  "original": "this place is heaven to me. i love italian food and italian grocery stores! for those like, this is the place for you. first off this is more than just a store and restaurant - its a market which includes multiple restaurants, coffee shop, gelato shop, and a meat and cheese bar. my story begins as such. my wife had gone there with her girlfriends a month or so before and when we were in the city celebrating new years eve she suggested that we stop for a meal at eatly. i was amazed at how awesome this place was. we put our names down for a reservation at their pasta restaurant. we were told 45 minutes which we were happy to do so we head over to the meat and cheese bar and order a plate of their finest salami and assorted cheese and a couple of classes of pinot noir. as it turns out our table was ready so much quicker so after quickly canceling our order we headed to our table. once seated and after reviewing the menu we ordered the mozzarella dish, lobster linguini and two glasses of their house pinot. the mozzarella was amazingly fresh - almost straight from the cow it was unbelievably delicious. the lobster linguini - good god man - was out of this world. i said above that i love italian food so i might be going a bit overboard on the review but eff it the food was that effing good! to add the wine was divine and helped wash down all that pasta and cheese! in conclusion, i will be going again. i'm almost considering making a day trip to nyc just to eat there again and i live in northern va. boom!",

( which i've had happen with other waiters ) a few of the standouts were the tuna tartare, and a scallop and braised rib appetizer. the sea bass and a bone in ny strip with black truffles were the main course favorites. the chocolate and peanut butter dessert was divine. we will be back. this is our newest philly favorite. make sure you ask for chris if you want great service.",
