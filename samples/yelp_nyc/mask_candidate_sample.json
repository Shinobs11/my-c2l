  "original": "we had our 2012 office christmas party at this chelsea location. we were a party of 18, not a big party, but certainly not insignificant. beyond that, the boss is friends with the owners of luzzo's for years, so the incident should never have happened. let me correct that, it should not have happened to anyone, especially with a guest who knows the owners, with a party of 18, visiting for a holiday celebration. unforgivable!!! we had 5 : 30pm reservations and seated in a timely manner. by the time we settled in and were prepared to order appetizers, it was probably around 6 : 00pm. it was close to 6 : 15 to 6 : 30 when we started getting food on the table. we had a round of pizzas and various appetizers. ovest is renowned for the pizza, and they were good as expected. but i was very disappointed by the meatballs. they were nothing in particular in flavor and texture. i suspect they were sitting in the kitchen for a while because they arrived at room temperature. the artichoke hearts were again, nothing in particular. i can't even remember the rest because they were all who - cares. we finished appetizers and they took our entree orders around 7 : 00 and were served by 7 : 30. my entree was ravioli with mushrooms. again, arrived lukewarm and was nothing in particular. fine, we had our entrees and had pleasant conversation. at around 8 : 00pm, a waiter just brings over a tiny metal bucket with a piece of paper in it. we were distracted by conversation and didn't pay attention to it. a few minutes later, someone noticed the bucket and was curious to see what it was. it was the bill for the dinner - totally unexpected given they just cleared the entree dishes. take note, we just finished our entrees. we were not offered dessert or coffee. they wanted us out for the next party that booked the entire restaurant for the rest of the night. rightfully so, the boss gets pissed and talks to the manager. come to find out, they booked the next party for 9 : 00pm and needed to clear the entire dining floor. we confirmed the reservations twice with the expected count. it is absolutely unforgivable that a restaurant would rush out a party of 18 without offering dessert or coffee. if the schedule is tight, then do not take our reservations. they knew it was an office holiday party",
