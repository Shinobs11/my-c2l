# For Tomorrow:
Refactor generateTriplets code to handle batch_size of greater than 1
Train and evaluate contrastive learning model on IMDB dataset
Get example triplets for Dr. Fang
Test out datasets given by Dr. Fang
See if pytorch 2.0 will finally work ( be sure to add checks in code to make sure code is compatible with non-2.0)
