32330,"Great spot to grab food before a show at the Riviera theater. The food was really good and flavorful (note: we picked the spicy options). Service was slow, but understandable since it was so busy for a Monday night (and since the waitress was lovely and super nice). Wine and beer were reasonably priced, but not the best we've had (however, maybe we made bad selections). If you have two people, get the messob for ONE - plenty of food!!!",1/31/2009,1AYUW750zvMxIV-FfPsrHA,fminnIzTMiZAlWpkp_vpYA,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw,N,4,1
59302,"Working nearby this restaurant, we order frequently from here. The lunch special is such a good deal and includes a lot of food. Delivery is very prompt, and we usually put in a large order and it is correct. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I always get the Pad Thai and it is always satisfying and delicious. I enjoy giving them business.",4/3/2011,KLHfx-T4oPmRiMeeA29XRw,vZN2-njEB4ijZTyOcvv3KQ,qkfBgSCbekH3DHTanVL1_w,Y,5,0
32445,"The place is pretty cool, maybe just a little too trendy for me, but worth visiting on a special occasion. The food is fine and the staff are very friendly and nice, but I want to mention the do-it-yourself fruit sodas. What happens is you get a big glass beaker of seltzer water and a small beaker of flavoring/syrup of the fruit of your choice. Then you mix the two in your glass, making the drink as sweet as you'd like. It makes you feel like a kid playing with a chemistry set. Clever, fun and delicious.",4/5/2009,7U0Vu,lLAnVhCX4ngyHK3EzUIRPA,JDNZxz0ud7zhuPo5pqznMA,N,3,1

45440,"Definitely not your average Irish pub. This is what I would call an upscale version of an Irish pub, but it's still unpretentious and approachable. It's a great place for after work/class on a weekday or for going out on the weekend. I met up with some friends here on a Saturday night, and we stayed in a cozy little booth the entire night. Drinks were reasonably priced, and the music was great. We were definitely feeling the DJ. Definitely would like to find a spot by the fireplace/library section next time.",7/31/2008,vbWBKtM2Udg5zsUbYhQFDg,BUAykc1rmmlcUgYs86ab6w,h-CNRJ-bqSZvz75J4A9cFg,N,3,1

57567,"Quite possibly the most disappointing dinner experience ever. Understanding that this may have been because I went in with such high expectations I'm still giving it 2 stars. This is supposed to be the most romantic spot in Chicago. What's romantic about sitting less than three inches from the table next to you? Yes, its dimly lit and has nice decor...but my fiance and I seriously sat there and listened to the conversations of the people next to us because we couldn't talk to each other!Where are the choices? There is one cheese, one salad, one cooking style and one chocolate. WHAT? The cheese tasted like alfredo sauce gone wrong, the salad was drenched in dressing, the oil had no flavor (it was literally just oil in a pot and my piece of chicken came out looking like a chicken nugget) and the chocolate was runny. There is no presentation. Just a pot on a sterno.Service...was good. Not great, but good. He was very nice and didn't get anything wrong (although the only thing we actually ordered was wine and type of meat). The hostess was also very polite.My fiance and I have had fondue a number of times before this and it was by far our worst fondue experience. If you're in the mood for fondue, hit up The Melting Pot or pick up a fondue cook book and do it yourself. Both are better options.",3/31/2006,THO8I-yGYEsvHnKQSWd5PA,65HoRBKSUMblSC5Fj7VJ8w,_UJ3KqtHIHjExbAg-iIGUA,Y,1,0
57544,"The food was Americanized. WE got Family Style---What a joke. Childsize portions and way overpriced. Rude waiter, and above all it was for my birthday. They ran out of lamb and white meat chicken after one helping. I would go to any other restaurant out of the 1,000s in Greektown above this place anyday. Choose another restaurant!!!",4/19/2009,LGruwdWFqLUvRCDf0tF2eQ,DlhkWd0BCjOUznoycxe1Lw,hylBw5ND7XyPldM6BN28vw,Y,1,0
33265,"I have been to Yolk many times and have enjoyed coming to this restaurant repeatedly for the past year or so. if you plan on trying it out on a Saturday or Sunday arm yourself with patience, as the wait is long, sometimes up t 40+ minutes. That said, I think it is worth it. Portions are large, the variety of food offered would satisfy some of the pickiest eaters, and the waitstaff is nice. The only downside to it...looks a bit like a cafeteria, impersonal, and they don't serve mimosas (a must for many Lakeviewers). Don't mind the distance, or the wait, but have a mimosa ready for me when I get there!",3/1/2009,PDU6bRH378Xe3a3,om5ZiponkpRqUNa3pVPiRg,O6uWHgJzylSjWjPSJKGhnQ,N,5,1
28616,"I was really excited to eat at Graham Elliot. Reading the menu, and listening to our waiter explain the dishes, my wife and I wanted to try everything. We decided to order ala carte and share, instead of the the tasting menu, probably a mistake. Our selections included: Beef Carpaccio, Potato Bisque, Bouillabaisse Risotto, Wild Sturgeon, Pork Carnitas. Everything was bland. The best thing I had was a beer. We decided to skip dessert. I have no problem paying for a nice dinner, but after this meal, I felt ripped off. I did like our waiter until I heard him discuss the menu to the table next to us. He offered them the option of ordering from both the tasting menu and the ala carte menu. He told us we had to from one or the other. Even more disappointing, I only heard about the foie gras pops when he told the other table. The restaurant presents it's self as an elite high end establishment, promoting a name chef. Everywhere you look, are his initials. They even sell GE belt buckles. However, when the food is that much of a let down, it's pretentious and cocky. I would much rather go to Sepia or Fontera Grill.",8/17/2009,3EhM5g6lLv8W014UPhDe9Q,GLSSGswAO3cWyfCZ0QIcNw,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A,N,2,1
54061,Sophisticated & saucy drinks in a semi-secret speakeasy scene. Wear violet on Monday and your 2nd drink is on the house. Small bite food is the perfect pairing to the hand crafted drinks and makes sure that you don't end up drinking on an empty stomach if you decide to stay for one last round.,7/26/2010,hQZm76NboOceu_MEdlVKbw,03zL3ijtaUWZn9HdKDsvfg,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,Y,3,0
7201,"The pasta here is fantastic. Its all handmade, and you can tell. I've had the Chicken Tortellini and the Lobster Ravoli - both were cooked perfectly. The menu is always changing, but the ingredients stay constant. Service is great (all four times I have visited)  I would have given it five stars except for the weak wine menu by the glass (bottle menu is extensive). Also, its a bit of tight squeeze in there. All in all, this place is a great italian restaurant and I would highly recommend it...enjoy.",11/30/2008,sFNW6oOFrzY-lv6O371amg,nwgPl6IfEwi_6YmUndHMdw,LYppbvgJlBG0SqjSKFiFGg,N,4,1
26683,"I came here on a Tuesday night for the cooking class. It was my favorite type of cooking class because it didnt require me to get up and do anything! It was basically more like a demonstration. The demonstration lasted from 6pm to 7:30pm. After the demonstration, we dug into a buffet dinner. The PHO was OUTSTANDING. We were only given one bowl of it though. I really wish that were unlimited. The buffet dinner consisted of a chicken and veggie dish, a veggie dish, and a salmon dish. The salmon dish was REALLY REALLY good. The other dishes were only okay. But the rating comes from the customer service they provide here. It was sooo exceptional. The servers were constantly refilling our drinks. They even gave us smoothies! I tried the watermelon and the mango smoothie. Definitely go for the watermelon one. Afterwards when we left, one of the owners asked us for our names and thanked us so much for coming. He was such a happy funny man! If I lived in this area I would definitely come here all the time. Food is authentic and made with passion, especially that PHO broth soup!",2/8/2009,WbPMnekRvnPwbnZSsdNTow,PbP2qdfYo2swY86yeKHyjw,DXwSYgiXqIVNdO9dazel6w,N,2,1

22089,"Husby and I kicked at old school at the Dawg a couple weekends ago. It was already packed around the time they opened on a Sunday, and we were just able to cruise on into one of the last available spots.  Are the dogs overpriced? You betcha. The service kinda slow? Uh huh. Still, I heart the retro vibe of ordering from a drive up and having someone bring a tray of goodies that attaches to the side of my car. I kinda wish she was on rollerskates, but I got over it.  Oh, and crinkle cut fries! BOOYA!",3/19/2012,7X2t-EdVWLzAejGYEtUpVA,VGJyLo9Z1tZj-T6W0yrJpg,F7IQngaDDBgYvhA3U31q-g,N,5,1

I love how the menu changes week to week. My favorites on the menu are the asparagus salad, all the pastas you get there are fantastic and the fish is never disappointing. They now have a back room by the patio that is so quaint and cute it would be perfect for a small intimate party.

21515,"Total experience: 2 stars Churros: 10 stars The line was long at 10:30am, and the whole process of ordering and getting seated was much less efficient and more confusing than necessary, but presumably they will work that out. Manager and cashier were friendly, which helped. Gunthoro chicken sandwich had a nice flavor, but way too many onions and the squishy ingredients slid right out of the hard crunchy bread every time I took a bite, making a big mess. But then came the churros. In case you don't love churros quite as much as me, let me give you a scale: 2 = churros at the fair or a street stand. Sad, frozen pastries that have been reheated and are overpriced, but that you occasionally buy anyway in a fit of delusional optimism or out of a desperate need for carbs in which anything made of dough and dusted in sugar will do. 4= costco churro. Fresher. But just a pleasant pastry, as opposed to the delectable delight that a churro could be. 8 = fresh churros in Mexico. You watch them get fished out of a vast pot of boiling oil. Sprinkled with sugar, and put into a brown paper bag that quickly turns translucent with grease. Your delight in the deliciousness is slightly tempered by the knowledge that this is really, really bad for you. 10 = xocos. These had all the freshness of Mexican churros, without the grease. And, bonus, in addition to granular sugar and cinnamon, they are crusted with little pieces of Mexican chocolate for extra flavor. Truly, truly amazing. Rick, open a churro window. Seriously, that huge line waiting for food and a place to sit, how many of them would happily fork over their cash for a quick churro? You could serve churros as fast as you could scoop them into a paper bag, and have so so many more happy customers every day. Churro window. Seriously.",9/14/2008,Z7CM8OOaRU3ghF8vdf8EvQ,3lb5jEWBN0aNQ1cBMvs5Hg,xXSMc3pDWTRQHLgjBTtTUg,N,5,1
26064,"Don't you hate when you order something called Mango Beef and there is hardly any mango or beef in it? Me too! Finding myself at Simply It for a group gathering, we had a broad selection of items brought to our table for tasting. The portions and variety were abundant. Everything tasted fresh and yummy too. I particularly liked the dumplings, pot stickers, Chicken Lemongrass, and the dessert, Fried Banana with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. But what really got me were two things: 1. The service was actually JOLLY! The staff were more than happy to pour our BYO wine, not cover their ears to shield from all of the ""lady chatter"", and did it all with a smile on their face. 2. One of the girls told me the story of the owner. Apparently he was abandoned by his two partners in the restaurant venture. Instead of giving up, he has pressed on to singularly insist that this business succeed. Now that is a vision I want to support! Thank you Simply It for the hospitality and phenomenal deals.

14961,"If you are a vegetarian, do NOT go to this place. I asked the waiter if there was cheese in the marianara sauce (there was) so I decided just to have a baked potato. The waiter then proceeded to get into an argument with me, telling me he and his family had eaten meat their entire lives, and that vegetarians ""were what is wrong with the world today"". It took about 5 minutes of berating before he finally accepted that I wasn't going to order anything else. I've never experienced such bad service, ever. The place is also extremely overcrowded, with waiters bumping into one another and patrons of the restaurant, even while carrying food that's on fire. One even dropped a lit sparkler on the carpet.

42718,"As often as I go to this place and as much as I love it, I've been too lazy to review it. I dine in and carry out on a fairly regular basis. The staff is super friendly, they always ask how I'm doing/have been and they really make me feel like a valued customer. On top of that, the food is fantastic. When I dine in I take advantage of their roasted 1/4 chunk of a chicken and 2 sides and drink for like 6 dollars. It's amazing. It's probably the best chicken I've had in Chicago. When we carry out it's always pizza, they do buy one get one half off, and my favorite is the Allexia. We order online from work and pick it up on the way home, it's always ready when we get there, and it goes great with Fat Tire or 1554. If you're going to have a pizza and beer night, do it with Fogo. Just a forewarning. This place is SMALL. They have maybe 3 or 4 tables for sitting so it's not a good place to dine in with a group.",1/14/2011,uSZSBNxE112Gq,jQUjYO2z2JPxKGlECbKbUQ,juop6_3dLfPDo-un-ZuXrg,N,5,1
22353,"Greek Islands has the best Greek food in Greektown. I've been there 4 times since last summer and I would have gone more if I wasn't a poor graduate student. Whenever I go, I always order the Arni Fournou (Colorado baked lamb served with oven-browned potatoes). It is by far the most juiciest, the most flavorful piece of lamb I've ever had! And the potatoes are amazing!! I've also had Arni Fournou with rice and a tomato sauce - also really great. The Mousaka is good, but not as good as the Arni Fournou. Both times I've had it the Mousaka, it wasn't heated properly. Their service is hit or miss.

The waitress sits us right by one of the huge windows saying its not even sunny out. Lady, if your room is lit by the sun and you can read, the sun is out.

36289,"Framing: Went there with 5 friends for a brunch on Saturday at 11 am. We had to wait until around 11:30 for our table. We each ended up paying around $20 including tip. Food: AWESOME!!! Everything we had was delicious and the menu was ridiculous. EVERYTHING is on there so expect intense debate and indecision. Tons of pancakes, waffles, eggs, french toast, fruits, etc. And everything was well prepared. I had the bacon lover's omelet and survived without being rushed to the hospital for coronary problems. Others with me had strawberries on greek yogurt, strawberry stuffed french toast, one of the skillets, and pancakes. Everyone cleaned their plates. Service: Good but not great, and in typical American style, they rush you when you are done eating. Same restaurant in Amsterdam would be awesome. Eat, talk, relax and enjoy time with friends without feeling you must run when done with the last bite. hostess and other servers are just not that friendly. Not nasty, per se, but certainly not exactly pleasant AT ALL. Decor: Who cares overall if decor is not that great, but in this case the restaurant is kind of cute but not kitsch. It is, however, WAY too crowded and we were crammed over near the window, barely able to move and definitely not able to get up. Not a pleasant experience unless you are REALLY comfortable with your table. I felt like I was sexually harassing my friend sitting next to me because I kept accidentally rubbing against his inner thigh. AWKWARD!! DRAWBACKS: 1) Wait was minimized for the group but only because I arrived 10 minutes earlier. Total wait was about 45 minutes. I could see this being a major pain for many people when there are options nearby with less of a wait. But I have waited for Original House of Pancakes on Bellvue and that was much longer. 2) Staff not friendly. 3) MOST NEGATIVE: There are no mimosas or bloody mary's. Who has brunch without those????????? And when I asked, the server gave me SERIOUS attitude. ""We are a breakfast place and have not even tried to get a license for alcohol"" I am not an alchie, but find brunch without mimosas just ... well, breakfast!",1/31/2009,GkeW6BHWMTEurf5rEu-CRw,lnbm7qs_D5mcsQ0jLpTXSw,tCkwBTuEFvhuaBoEUWqbuQ,N,4,1

59676,"My wife and I travel to Chicago several times per year. About two months ago, we were walking through downtown. Around 10:00, we wanted a late dinner. We saw Ruth Chris and decided to give it a try. Even at this late hour, the place was packed. We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who seated us at the bar promptly. It is hard not to be impressed by the interior design and architecture of this place. It is truly stunning.Our Bartender was an extremely pleasant young man in his upper 30's with curly hair. We ordered a couple of drinks, a seafood appetizer and our entrees. I ate the seafood; and was excellent. The bartender and I talked about how it was prepared - similar to his family recipe... (Joe is his name) Joe kept us on our toes with funny stories and nice compliments- I almost forgot to try the seafood special I had ordered! It did not disappoint; nor did my wife's meal, but Joe was the highlight of our dining experience. Needless to say, this was an excellent experience. In a crowded, somewhat loud, steakhouse in the the heart of Chicago; I felt like I was having dinner at friend's home. My only regret is that I don't remember Joe's (I think his name was Joe) last name so I could publicly acknowledge his incredible service. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to speak to the manager before we left, and rave about this rare experience. My wife and I live in Cincinnati and we are both pretty high on the food chain where we work. If half of my or my Wife's employees/co-workers were as friendly, experience, or knowledgeable as Joe is our company would be better off!

I ate my way through Chicago and this hot dog was the highlight!! I got in just before closing and Doug was there to wait on me with a smile and friendly service just like his day had just started. What do I recommend? Go early, order several dogs and sample away. And if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they are serving duck fat fries, get two orders. They are yummy!

38711,"Having just landed in Chicago a few hours before, I was anxious to try some of the world-famous 'deep dish' pizza, particularly being born in New York and privy to their specialty pizza for a number of years. A coworker of mine had visited this restaurant before on good word and promised me I would be impressed. We sat down and ordered and received some unsolicited advice from a fellow patron at the next table. He said that although each pizza would take approximately 40 mins to make, it would be well worth it. A few mins later, this patron (having finished one slice of his pizza and half a beer) got up and left. The wait staff looked panicked for a few minutes and after asking about it, we discovered he had just boned out. Interesting that he would take the time to compliment the restaurant before ditching without paying the bill. Regardless, we were more than happy with our dinner, the pie was thick, had plenty of cheese and ingredients, and covered with a sauce that reminded me of my Italian grandmother's marinara. I was very impressed and will make it a point to revisit this restaurant the next time I'm in the windy city.",1/27/2010,I3Xkl45-xUHMTWiDAYa88A,bQaKuQAnC1jwANNAaV1nqg,sR4EOfPuI-at41uIxIZPhw,N,3,1

My advice start with 2-3 meats you want (plus the pineapples, my favorite), then flip the thing to black so you can enjoy eating in piece then flip it over again to get more. It's quite hard and almost disturbing to eat with a constant flow of dudes waving knives and skewers of meat in front of you!

We were provided a loaf of crusty bread to mop up the buttery broth. The real celebrity of Publican is the meat selection.

The space is really nice - feels relaxed and cool. They played music that could have been from my own playlists... this is always a plus.  The idea of the popcorn at the beginning was cutesy, but it was very tasty. The desconstructed Italian beef was tasty, but I didn't care for the bun. Luckily, this would be the only think the whole meal that I didn't like. My second app, a creamy (squash? sweet potato?) soup was awesome... ginger infused marshmallow that melted for the cream? Awesome! Spicy jam to mix in? Awesome! My only small complaint, which I realize at about this point of the meal, is that they are going to elaborate on every dish in a really monotone, bored manner. Either don't elaborate on every ingredient, or don't act like it pains you to do so. Easy enough!

Sure, the menu states to create your own salad it is $10.00, but an additional $4.00 to add a meat. Really, for a few small pieces of chicken-- $4.00?! It's plain ridiculous. What we loved about coming to Icosium was that it was inexpensive for fresh, delicious food. This place isn't a high-end establishment by any means, so what's with the high-end prices for a salad? Oh, by the way, they only take cash now. No more credit cards. We won't be paying Icosium a visit any time again soon, which is quite sad.",5/5/2011,FdRb61rg4rHktNxIMJfhsQ,5UYdspRturRfCzJ2sa1EJQ,yBRaSkuYwFhYEoucDyD0lA,N,5,1

42953,"After a drunken night, I woke up very hungover and NEEDING some pizza. I called Domino's around 1pm. At 2pm they called me back to inform me they lost power and would make my pizza as soon as it came back. At 3pm they called to say the power wouldn't be on until 4 and I wouldn't see my pizza until after 5. So despite my craving for the delicious cheesy bready and doughy pizza crust of my trusty Domino's (not my favorite pizza normally, but I love it when I am hung over) I decided to take a chance and order from the Art of Pizza. By the time we found the menu, figured out what we wanted, and placed the order it was about 3:30. By the time the pizza came - it was 4:50. Perhaps had I not waited almost 4 hours from the start of my pizza quest to get it, I might have liked this more. But I just compared it to my Domino's and it fell short. The cheesey bread had no flavor - no herbs like D's, no marinara dipping sauce like D's. The pizza had the pepperoni under the cheese - sad becasue I like to pick mine off and eat it first. The crust was also too thick and hard at the top. I did like the fact that they had things other than pizza, so I could order a sandwich and fries for the fiance. But the fries were soggy and his sandwich only so-so. For $30 with delivery and tip, I would have rather had Domino's. I will say though, the pizza was actually better the day after which earns it a few points.",10/1/2009,KBVb1Cuw84ApbEZQO3F7fQ,i7E48NFYrYduLu3x0baHVw,tW2jfL-qMccAYZSghPBbHA,N,2,1

28048,"Graham Elliot is a cool restaurant. I took my foodie parents here and everyone enjoyed their meal. However, there was one minor disappointment We were given a truffle/parmesan popcorn appetizer that sounds great, but in reality the popcorn was stale or too wet. Other than that minor deviation we enjoyed the ""experience"". GE is one of those places where the meals are pretty challenging. We had a cuttlefish linguini that challenged our pallets and I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. The consensus amongst us was that it should taste good, therefore it does... This is the problem with a place like Graham Elliot, the food can be challenging and delicious. So, I wouldn't come here if I was just looking for a great meal.

La Choza was the best and so was the owner Sylvestor, and if anyone has fond memories they would like to share, let me know!  That being said, I think Nuevo Leon is the closest thing that I have found. The mole was rich, thick, and delicious. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed which is always a good sign. I loved the decor, I loved the families that were seated around us, and I loved the food.

33695,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here more times than I can count, and I have had maybe one or two ""OK"" meals. Everything else has been good to excellent. The servings are generous, but not overly huge. The quality of the food is very high, and everything is usually very tasty. The menu is hand-written and then photocopied. I am not sure if it changes daily or what, but the selection is always fresh. Despite not being very big, there are always multiple things on the menu that sound good to me and it's tough to make a decision! They do a standard brushcetta and a special one that is always changing. They always have several pizzas, pastas and entrees. They are accommodating of special requests; if there is a chicken dish that is not boneless, they'll gladly make it with boneless chicken breast if you ask. The prices are in line with what you get. The service is generally pretty good. The staff is friendly but professional, and they're not attitude-y or stuck up. Now, the downsides: There can be a long wait for a table sometimes, especially on the weekends. In fact, last time I tried to go they said 2.5 hours! Needless to say, I went somewhere else. But that was uncharacteristically long for them, so I don't penalize them for it. The upside of the waiting is that they have three bars (main dining room, coach house and upstairs). The other downside is that the main dining room is VERY loud and VERY crowded. I don't really like to eat down there. Insider tip: Ask to get seated upstairs. Same food and service, but more spacious and less noisy.",7/9/2007,GpKha7z,oIylWWfGfSjHaBkquL7MjA,6PQTqW9j-sriDBQyQCJbjw,N,5,1
52069,"As Portillo's is for the Hot Dog, I would argue that Gino's is the quintessential deep dish pizza experience. Sure, it has a lot of competition (Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Giordano's, etc.) and these competitors are almost equally as good and shouldn't be discounted. You can't go wrong with any of these places. But, I'd argue (and call it personal preference) something about the Gino's East experience pushes it over the top. I think I just like the facets of the Gino's pie slightly better... from the way the crust is made to the tomatoes on top. From the writing all over the walls to the quality of the food, Gino's is sure to provide an extremely memorable dining experience.

33452,"I freakin' love this place, so much so that I will break my own rule, and rate a place that has over 100 reviews already.  First, the menu is extensive. I bring everyone I know here. Someone visits from out of town - we HAVE to have brunch at Yolk, not only because I am a brunch whore, but because there is something for everyone (except the discerning organic nazi or the vegan). Every visitor I have taken has sung the praises of this place. For the meat eaters in the crowd, the country skillet is fabulous - my dad was sold with this concoction with multiple kinds of meat thrown together with the potatoes and eggs any way your picky egg eater wants. Oh, and they truly deal with their namesake well - no undercooked or overcooked eggs here. For the ovo-lacto vegetarian types, there are a bazillion options, including the delish pancakes and french toast, or the veggie skillet in which the asparagus is actually cooked well! The eggs florentine, the spin on the benedict without the pig, will also serve those veggies well. My roommate salivates for the Sante Fe Frittata bi-monthly, loving the way they throw in both jalepenos and avocados in this piece de resistance. Personally, I try something new everytime. The eggs benedict is fabulous. The hollandaise is homemade. The eggs are poached to perfection. The scramlers are really well done, especially the cajun one - delicious! I love their omelettes! And I am a girl who really doesn't like pancakes, but I actually split a side order with my Sante Fe Frittata loving roommate because these are deliciousely cake-y. The food selection and its preparation is what makes me come back time and again to Yolk. Yes, if you go during peak brunch hours on the weekend, there will be a wait, it is just that good - and popular. Duh. It happens. If it sucked there would be no one there. Because of this, service is quick moving, but not usually bad. Oh yolk, how I love thee. That is why I make the pilgrimage at least once a month to sample your delectable delights. I fully endorse others to do the same!

We find a table, sit down, go find some silverware (there is no waitstaff here at all), and start to eat.We discover that all the pizza we are eating is undercooked - the dough is raw, and the meats are still pink inside - totally disgusting! We take them up to the counter, and the manager refuses to even look at the pizza slices we're complaining about. ""That's the way we serve our pizza, and if you don't like it, that's too bad.""

Yes, we ordered soup and, instead of broth, a bowl of liquid with the consistency of pork and beans arrived at our table. GROSS. We also got the fried chicken that comes with szechuan peppers. I didn't really care for the dish as it wasn't discernibly spicy, the chicken meat was almost non-existent, and it was oilier than a little ceasar's pizza.

They both started waiving their hands on our faces saying ""hey, you can't bring those in here."" They immediately escorted us out of the entrance way to the street. I was appalled and taken aback!!! So this may sound like its not a big deal, right? WRONG! How hard is it to say, "" Im sorry, those are not allowed in here."" Wouldn't that have been more civilized to say?

They do cram a lot into a small space, making the dining area something of a maze. Room dividers are shelves of empty wine bottles, which is pretty cool. Our service was excellent, no complaints there! My girlfriend and I ordered the cheese & chocolate 3-course meal and split it. Having already eaten a pretty heavy lunch, this was more than enough food. The salad was good and the cheese fondue was excellent; the bread and veggies were too big to dip and eat so we had to cut them ourselves - food here is labor-intensive! I'd say, at least for this course, the work was worth it. We were expecting the chocolate fondue to be like melted Hersheys chocolate chips. What we got instead was more like Herseys chocolate syrup - good...but not as good as it could have been. If i wanted to dip stuff into chocolate syrup, I could do it at home for $5.

I'm actually even surprised it was as bad as some people say, because our waiter was a driving force behind my 3 stars. Being a Top Chef Masters fan, this was an obvious pick during my trip to Chicago. I went in with reasonably high expectations and GE hit close to the mark, but not quite. The cheddar risotto sounded SO GOOD, but was so average! The cheese-its were out of place and the bacon ""pancetta"" was all fat and no meat (for flavor, not eating I guess). As mentioned, the caesar salad was strange but tasty (the anchovies were good but the monster crouton wasn't worth the calories). For entrees, we all ordered seafood: Arctic char: Good, the brussel sprouts were great. Scallops: I still don't like scallops and even GE couldn't convince me that they're good. I didn't get to try the cod because my BF scarfed it down before I got the chance. So no review there. Which also leads me to my next point that the PORTIONS ARE TINY.

It came out to be around $60 per person with two cocktails each.My boyfriend and I have been to many high end restaurants in Chicago and here in Boston, but this one takes the cake.

And if you time it right (I'm talking a super early/late lunch or a bad weather day), you can enjoy Xoco without the typical long wait. After a few visits, I have realized that I am disappointed with ordering anything other than the Ahogada. That's not to say that the other tortas aren't spectacular, it's just in my mind- the Ahogada reigns supreme. The spicy tomato broth is amazing and the picked onions add a zesty touch. It's awesome in every way. My husband's favorite is the Pepito, also a flavorful masterpiece. Don't even hesitate when they ask you about a dessert. The churros are a must-get. So, if for some reason you haven't tried Xoco yet, wait for the next blizzard or tornado warning, tell your boss you are taking an earlier lunch - and go enjoy Rick Bayless's culinary genius.",4/21/2011,J9K6vYTbTDqqMqVVKmSYrQ,AWwTN3sKFmMX9Hj1Sx8NWA,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,N,5,1

49272,"I've now been here twice so feel qualified to review... once for a glass of wine and some cheese, and once for the burger since it was featured in Chicago magazine and one of our bosses decided this merited a team lunch - who am I to argue! First off we went for wine on a Thursday. It was meant to be a gap filler - i was en route to O'Hare and needed a drink to make it through the labyrinthian hellhole - ahem, sorry - but I ended up wishing i had a whole evening there. This might be because at the time, they were doing a ridiculous deal where some wines were $10 a bottle... so ridiculous, we felt bad, and ordered some cheese. The selection of cheese is phenomenal, the server was very good and informative while patiently ignoring my irrational cheese foibles (turns out 'i don't like anything stinky' is both untrue and not terribly helpful). We had some unbelievably good feta, and... i can't remember the others. I do remember not being a fan of the dried bread cracker stuff that came with - proper bread and crackers for me, please, not an attempt at both at the same time. But, that's a minor detail, and I did like the grissini being on the table anyway. Second trip for the burger at lunch: 9 of us show up, they seat us immedtaiely, they take 9 seperate burger orders, all with different cheese, cooking instructions and relishes. They are delivered speedily and without fuss to the right people. I'd say mine was a bit more than medium rare, verging on medium so a little dry to my taste, but dammit it was still goooood (3 extra O's good, remember that). Fries also very very good, crispy and salty. I am most excited to go back and try their 'best grilled cheese in Chicago' given the standard of this meal. Negative - not feeling a lot of ambience in the restaurant for lunch, and STOP FILLING UP MY WATER. Hovering near my head while I take a sip only to then splosh the stuff all over the table? Stop it stop it stop it.",4/19/2009,5kpQH7K3j,qB56Z5UAI-OkORhmhuFCOA,xjZ9eqYrzMrl2v6_1Kv6hA,N,3,1
61296,"Talk about bringing a slice of home with you, this place definitely brings me back! I was reading through the other reviews and hereis my input on them. First of all, I can honestly say being a Cuban from Miami that lived there all my life, THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTIC. Those puddles of oil and garlic in the bottom of your trays, the crowded restaurants, guess what? That is what a Cuban restaurant is all about. Why are people complaining about there being too many people in the first place? Isn't that the sign of a good restaurant? When I went there, the place was as packed as could be, but guess what? It took no longer than 7 minutes to receive my dinner. I went there expecting this place to be just as small as the other one, but was I surprised! Great memorabilia on the walls to look at, beautiful artwork on the outside while you enjoy your cafe cubano and tabaco in the patio, and most importantly, the best authentic Cuban food this side of Chicago has ever seen! I was a little skeptical at first about having a Cuban Sandwich on french bread, but I gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised. By the way, go to any Cuban restaurant in Miami and you will get the Picnic Shoestring Potatoes on all your sandwiches! So for the person that wrote that they were dissapointed about that, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO MIAMI! When I went, I took up their offer on the Masas de Puerco with Congri and Platanitos, as well as a side of Yuca. It was wonderfully prepared!!! The large fried chunks of pork were cooked just right with a great crunch on the outside, and soft juicy meat in the center. Top them off with some fresh lime juice, and you're in for a 10 minute vacation! The Congri was perfectly cooked with those hidden bacon bits and fat that makes the dish come alive. The platanitos were just as sweet as they can ever be, not overcooked and had just the right texture to add an amazing complement to the dish. The yuca was steamed just right, with the hint of garlic sauce on top that was amazing. I would have liked to see a little more garlic sauce on mine with some onions, but that's a personal preference. All of this, in a packed restaurant, and it took less than ten minutes. I couldn't finish the whole meal, so I took part of it home with me. I wanted to save room for a coffee, pastelito, and a smoke. Perfect way to end a great Cuban meal in the Chi. My recommendation: Go to this place, ask the owner what he recommends, and TRY IT! Trust me when I say that this place is the real deal. I thought I was going to miss my food when I left Miami, but this place helped me not miss it as much.",2/15/2011,5AvmoDPWU8Nxflox3JcBNA,mHTBByVSvpKflgt4ebZAEw,1iehp7Z2kejBq3RSeb4Dxg,Y,5,0
54751,"Best Breakfast Ever!!!So, you will have to wait to get a table and the service will most likely feel a little rushed to those accustomed to sitting around and chatting after their meal. But for me and E it's total worth it. We go here as a regular treat on Sundays when we aren't trying out new places for breakfast. Me and E have become eggs benedict connoisseurs and their varieties are always a crowd pleaser with some interesting variations that include crab cakes, salmon, and avocado. Don't miss out on their smoothie and juice bar. They have smoothies that put Jamba juice and orange Julius to shame. Everything is super fresh and homemade even their cornbeef hash which is something you don't often see. I am a savory kind of guy myself but their banana and nutella crepe is remarkable. You want skillets? They have em and they're fan-frickin-tastic. The only bummer about this place is that they don't serve booze/ Blood Mary's.All and all the very best...

14358,"My affinity for ""diner food"" has placed me on either end of the diner spectrum, from greasy spoon to silver spoon--Glenn's Diner is definitely a silver spoon. Their take on a staple (scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast) includes melted parmesan and chives in the eggs and the tastiest potato pancake I've ever had. Breakfast is served all day, in true diner fashion, and often incorporates fresh fish specials, which is not my taste, but I've literally seen people drool over the crab cakes benedict. Speaking of fish, their full-wall menu board is covered in specials (the pretzled walleye caught my eye--might try it myself one day). For lunch, I've often had their salad w/ grilled chicken (and no iceburg-yay!) and it usually yields enough for two. The decor is fun and the staff is fantastic.

9924,"My father refuses to eat any Italian food outside the home, but he will gladly make the exception for Piccolo Sogno - the descriminating taste of a native Sicilian is the best testament ever. I took my colleagues when in town for a tradeshow and they raved about this amazing restaurant for weeks after returning home to CA. Several comments suggesting Northern Italian food but Chef Tony most certainly offers fine, authentic Sicilian dishes - just like my Zia Damiana makes back in my family's beloved homeland...brings a tear to my eye...enough said...

46537,"The boyfriend and I were given a couple hundred dollars worth of Lettuce Entertain You Gift cards and didn't feel like going anywhere fancy, so we decided to try this place seeing as it was a couple blocks from our apartment. We went on a Sunday night (bad idea) and the place was jam-packed with entitled suburban yuppy types. A woman in a fur coat wanted to get through and because we were packed like sardines in the (tiny) waiting area started yelling at me to move. I told her that I was trying to- and she gave me a sarcastic 'oh, really?' Ugh. I wish I'd had a glass of red wine in hand to pour on her ratty dead-animal coat. The hostess told us it'd be an hour wait, which was fine, since the football game was on television at the bar. We waited maybe twenty-five minutes and were seated in a (small) booth near the back. Our waitress was nice enough (and pretty cute) but the service was slow (they were busy, so I understand). Boyfriend ordered nachos as an appetizer for himself (I can't eat dairy) and a barbecue bacon cheddar burger. I got a veggie burger (no cheese) with the salad bar. The nachos, according to the boyfriend, were good, and he enjoyed his burger (he's pretty picky about his burgers, so this is a good sign). My veggie burger had good flavor, but was crumbly and dry. I also wasn't fond of the potato chips that came with it- they were cold and somewhat soggy. The (2-tablespoon) side of coleslaw was more like a sample, but flavorless, anyway. The salad bar was nice enough, but being used to Whole Foods salad bar, definitely left something to be desired. A lot of the stuff on it was very basic and there were no crunchy things (like croutons, sunflower seeds, nuts, et cetera) so I felt like I was missing a key element in my salad. The French dressing also tasted watered down. I would not pay $11 for this salad bar- I felt lousy paying $6 for the salad bar as my 'side'. My drinks were refilled pretty promptly and the server was nice enough, but it wasn't the greatest dining experience. The tab came to around $50 with drinks, which isn't so bad, I suppose. I wouldn't return, it just wasn't exceptional enough to brave the obnoxious clientele, cramped space, and wait time.",9/5/2010,m3xDHw7,kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,ptRZlXxngjFj5gghwPNNHA,N,3,1

My only small complaint was the chips tasted a bit stale but as a free extra and considering that everything else was so good and so cheap not even a big concern. Fantastic food overall although thinking back on it, a little scary that all the food could be so cheap and still be approved for eating.

17319,"Violet Hour is your sheik, find me if you can, swanky, everything from scratch, wait your a** off in an, at times, imaginary line bar. Perhaps I should have thrown in a few more adjectives up there. People were certainly in all levels of attire but pants and a shirt feels more appropriate than jeans and a Smurf T-shirt. In my view Violet Hour will have you waiting on a list for at least an hour regardless of they have tables or not. I'm not mad at it because it's a good psychological approach to building demand and desire. What is important is that they'll let anyone in waiting so you don't have to feel cool enough or rejected. The staff once inside is also quite friendly and not at all stuffy like you might expect. Once inside it's really a cool dcor and set up. The high backed chairs give you the feel that each tiny table is its own private booth. These guys make every syrup, garnish, and otherwise that goes into a drink aside from the base alcohol. This kind of preparation has to be respected because it's time consuming. It is also art work. The drinks are tasty and certainly something to experience. I only had their hummus appetizer but it was very good. The hummus had a very nice texture with just a hint of garlic which gained strength has I took bite after bite. The bathrooms are really nice in that they are completely separate; meaning that there is one door per private bathroom. I suppose if you want a little boom boom time you could get away with it in private. You'll probably be to buzzed to care if your caught anyway but the place does have an energy that will have you thinking what I'm saying. All-in-all if you're out for something very different and really cool this is a great place. Good for dates or to show off Chicago to an out of town friend you can go wrong. Just don't come if you're looking for a quick drink; you will be waiting in line for some time no matter when you go....it's what they do!

42486,"This pizza is a cheese lovers dream!! My friends and I ordered delivery which took about an hour but was well worth the wait. My guy friends, being the canavores they are, went with the meaty delight pan pizza and a thin crust canadien bacon. For me, the meaty was a little overboard when they add sliced beef in the mix w/ sausage, bacon, pepperoni, and God knows what else. But, like I said, the cheese was overabundant as well, which was well needed to compliment the meat. The thin crust was just okay. Over all, the meat, cheese, and sauce was excellent. The crust fell a bit short for me, as I thought it was a bit doughy. Perhaps it was just b/c of delivery that might have softened it up a bit, but I will definitely be eating here again sometime in the near future.",6/15/2011,zJ1nQFPGWjO9gMKDFVI4tQ,khc41pC4ZNmeyEcSQgpf_Q,ALwH81_sqskLmwfWS-_eeQ,N,3,1
56383,"I came here with my wife last Sunday to celebrate my birthday. Needless to say, the restaurant itself was good enough to make my birthday one to remember (but don't tell my wife I said that!).Everything was extraordinary. The food was perfect; much better than anything I've tried in Argyle. Argyle has always been my go-to place to get quick pho or just about any Vietnamese dish since it's a bit closer to my place, but my wife decided to treat ourselves to something different, especially since it had such great reviews. I just never knew what we were missing out on!We started our meal with the Bon Vivant Platter, which has an assortment of their 'rolls' for a variety. We both thoroughly got through that quickly due to our appetites. I love their spring rolls! Then, for appetizers, I decided on the catfish in a claypot. The sauce it came in was not too sweet, but adequate enough to leave a good taste in my mouth. My wife opted with the beef and asparagus. She's really picky with her meat, but apparently, the meat was cooked just right for her. Amazing.We had a nice waitress who checked up on us on a few times, but did leave enough time in between so we can spend our dinner quietly and peacefully. We weren't surprised when it wasn't busy, but apparently, this isn't a good sign for restaurant owners...The owner of this restaurant is especially endearing. He's super nice and sent over a complimentary fried banana dessert because he heard it was my birthday. Help out this man and come to his restaurant! You won't be disappointed.

When I placed the order, the person said it would be a half hour, and it took about an hour and 20 minutes. Also, I ordered and paid for spring rolls, that they forgot to bring. The food they did bring sucked in my opinion. I had shrimp fried rice, which was super greasy, with only a few mooshy shrimp. I had an order of the mongolian beef, which was skimpy with greesy sauce, making the vegetable super soggy. The few non-scrappy beef pieces were pretty good though. We had the garlic chicken which was also skimpy, greesy, and soggy. I won't have food delivered from here again. If dining in the restaurant is better, or if they were just having an off-day, I guess I can see giving them another chance.

Our hostess was super attentive and we managed to get a seat near the kitchen in a record 75 minutes!The guacamole was delicious, but the ribs some folks who were eating at the bar recommended were bland and we left most of them on the plate.

Having grown up in Pilsen, my family, friends and I have known of this place since the early 80's and we all agree that it is the most overrated (and politically connected) business in Pilsen. Everything from the tacky facade paint job, to the mediocre tasting food, to the indifferent almost rude servers, this place does not aim to please it's customers at all. Yet once a year for the last 12 years or so and mainly out of support for my old community, I give this place a visit hoping it's finally worth recommending. The decor still lacks warmth, the refried beans are still greasy and overcooked and the miserable waitresses are still indifferent to the customers needs. The last time we visited we ordered the carne asada dish and it took the waitress almost 10 minutes to finally inform us that they were out of carne asada. (On a wednesday afternoon?)

I've tried several of the Sushi options here and have liked most of them. The lobster and waygu roll is amazing. The Chilean Sea Bass is some of the best fish I've had...moist and delicate, in an interesting preparation. The Crabcake Ahi Tuna is unique and also excellent.

I love this feature because in Vietnam, we usually have Pho on the street, enjoying the scene of the city in a big crowd of other people who are also eating, and this restaurant does bring that nostalgic feeling to me. Pros: - Authenticity scores 8/10 - Food are fresh and delicious, - Quick service once you're seated, - Nice view of streets, helpful waiters, - Impressive name to recommend for friends. Cons: - If you go to peak dinner time, you might have to wait standing around for 30' - 1 hour to be seated, and there is no waiting area/chairs - The place looks big but actually quite small so you might have to share table with some strangers occasionally at a big long table. However we do this a lot in Vietnam so let's think about it as an authentic feature of Vietnamese cuisine. - Waiters are not the best, they're cool but might be rude sometimes during restaurant's mega-busy time.

You start off getting a pretty decent portion of crab legs with parmesean corn and coleslaw, after that they bring you out one crag leg at a time and you can order more corn and slaw if you'd like. He also ordered a 40 of Miller Lite, yes I said a 40 oz.. The crab legs started off great (especially for what you would pay at Joe's or Shaw's) but as the night went on and they busier they got, the legs came out very salty and mushy from the overcrowded boiling water.

22052,"Loved the quick and efficient free valet parking though I guess others also offer it in this neighborhood so that shouldn't seperate them. This is a huge place but getting their right before the Bulls tip off made it a little crazy. But it's a classic. Haven't been here since highschool and will not wait that long again.  The Tirokaf cheese appetizer of whipped feta with peppers was amazing on the fresh bread. Just the right amount of heat. ($6.50) The roast of loin of lamb with a rice and veggie side was also delish. Absolutely loved it. ($19) The baklava was also incredible. If I hadn't gotten so full I would have eaten the whole thing myself and it's big. ($4) The yogart is a little too tart for my liking and really more a breakfast item than desert but my girlfriends wanted it so we got it. It is served with honey. ($5) And, for those of you who know me, I had to have an old fashioned. Very nicely done. ($7) All and all, a grea meal and great experiece.

It's too bad I don't live in Chicago or I'd go back until I had tried everything on the menu.Hot doug's is awesome. It's one of the single greatest places I've ever eating. It pulls no stops in making your food delicious yet cheap. There's always a long line, which tells you something, but getting your food doesn't take long once you're in there. Doug himself is a really nice guy (I recognized him from watching the No Reservations episode). The food is awesome: I had the duck hot dog with foie gras, the Sonoran, and the Buffalo one (it was filled with blue cheese and deliciousness). OK, i shared these with my fiance, but they were all amazing.My only recommendations if you go to Hot Doug's are:1) bring a book/phone while you wait in line2) order 2 hot dogs for yourself3) order the duck fat fries4) Consume5) Achieve nirvana",12/18/2010,Z7oH42ttzgP5JKcmAVsrIg,x7wIQTZJ13kyvTMGXCZIFg,HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A,Y,5,0

12988,"I was so excited to go to this place because I love both Cuban and Mexican food and I had heard such great things about it. Then along came a Groupon - how perfect! Although I thought the service was great and it would be a great place to go hang out and have a drink - I did not like the food. I thought the best thing was the bread and butter (sort of sweet and spicy). We had the taste of Cuba appetizer - I wasn't a big fan of but it was ok. For dinner, I had the honey jalepeno pork chops which is one of their specialties. I really did not like the pork chops - they were overwhelmingly sweet to me (though I know people that love them). I was hoping for some spice from the jalepeno to help with the sweetness but there was none. I tried some of my boyfriend's food (steak with black beans and rice) - it was just okay too but it was drenched in lime (which is crazy for me to say because I put lime all over everything).  I really wanted to like this place and appreciate the great service, but especially given the price, I would recommend going elsewhere.",5/20/2010,BDEIL11LyWuvciZ4jR9bHA,fYNd52EuhYoV0l-BFn1Oew,WaIbupMGDBi5B3SChsUH8A,N,2,1
25866,"We are currently in Chicago where we are thinking about as a permanent move. Since we love Spanish food, we felt the hotel we are in would be perfect as Mercat is part of the place. Super stay, super food. I think not. We first went for lunch and were really hungry. The menu was good and had nice choices. He went with the ham and fig salad and I had another salad with cheese and veggies. Nice. Good sangria, too. Then it took forever to get the next dishes, like about 45 minutes. And we were hungry so it seemed longer and the other tables were being served and they were leaving. Finally, the manager came with the food, to apologize. Nice touch, good hanger steak and spinach for me. We thought we'd give it another try for dinner. That was the worst idea yet. The service was horrendous and we didn't even get served! We went to the bar at 6 and were told we couldn't get an actual table for dinner until 8:15. So we sit at the bar. They told us we could eat at a bar table then. We know what those are like, tiny with little doll-chairs that are so uncomfortable. We passed. We'd wait. We returned at 8:15, promptly. ""it''ll be a few minutes,"" we were told. At 8:30, we are offered the same bar table from 2 hours before. The exact same table!!! I told the woman this so she said we could have another tiny table but with a banquette for seating. Okay, a little better. Then she said she was sorry and would bring us a glass of wine to make it up. Next thing we have a hostess staring down at us telling us that we are lying about waiting two hours and it was ten minutes and we were relaxing in our rooms. I asked, ""are you lecturing me?' and she actually said, ""yes, sort of."" Wow! Then a male manager comes and gets in our faces and says that we are so lucky that they fit us in and we should have taken the first table at the bar because they take reservations for those tables too. I guess the bar stools are reserved here. I will never come here again, even if I move to Chicago and will tell everyone what horrid service this place has.

58763,"Now I suppose this review could be biased. It's been several months since I actually ate here. And when I was there, I was on a date with a guy who gives me massive rose colored glasses. But still. I get so annoyed at people who go to a place like Graham Elliot and then complain about the food to cost ratio. We had the 10 course tasting with pairings...yes, the courses are small. But the tastes are amazing and you don't leave hungry. If you want big portions, there are some lovely steakhouses in Chicago. The pairings were very unusual - at least to me. There was one snafu with the dessert pairing, but the waiter and mixologist were so sweet and apologetic and quick to bring us an additional dessert and cocktail that it was almost a *positive* part of the experience. I don't think Graham Elliot takes itself too seriously at all. All our waitstaff was friendly and casual, but on the ball. My favorite part of the evening was when the busboy noticed that my date was coming across the table to sit next to me on the banquet between courses. He wordlessly, and with a cute twinkle in his eye flipped the table sideways so we could enjoy the rest of our meal without the back and forth.Also, I recommend asking them to take the crack laced popcorn off the table after a few handfuls or you won't have room for the delectableness to come.",7/12/2008,nlqXSnL_hWaPosGJEdgWOQ,fXK3mGD8S_WYwKjFBGxS1A,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A,Y,1,0

I had the Gunthorp Farm Chicken Enchilada Skillet, and it was sooooooo gooooooooood! And the iced tea with special herbal additions was also very tasty, and perfect for a brunchy drink. I love the decor, and having this place near my house is a plus. I really appreciate that they grow so much of their own food. That's really cool! The only thing is that the price, for my wallet at least, is a bit high. We didn't pay for breakfast (father-in-law in town) but had we, I would have been sweating a little bit.

50423,"Now if you are in Chicago visiting or just moved there this is a good landing spot financially and socially because its a sports bar at its finest and celebrities pass through alot especially sports Celebs. The atmosphere is more lay back energetic than Technotronic/punk. Every time i have been there the bar seaters always strike good mature conversation and the staff is super responsive awesome and on it. It has a couple of levels so you can also book a level for a private party or something of the sort and it comes with a massive package list of options, which i think is pretty neat. It has the main bar on the ground level. A lounge in the basement and a seated dinning area on the second level over looking the ground floor. Its a good bar to spend a staturday night at if you want conversational clubbing + there is no dress code.Prices are reasonable $ - $$$ because they have bottle service for 350ml bottles and 750mls as well did i mention that they sell 40z Oh Yes!!!!! Their food is amazing and personaly i would give it 5stars for food found in bars because its Delish.

57091,"As part of my birthday celebration, my wife and I went to Carnivale this past Friday night. It was our first time eating here and we walked away with a high opinion and plans to revisit in the future. For starters, the staff and waiters were very nice and helpful. We were seated within minutes upon check-in (we had 7:30PM reservations for 2) and were given a table on the second floor overlooking the main dining area. The space is beautiful. Formerly a warehouse, the place has been renovated with outdoor seating, a bar area and an adjoining main dining room with vaulted ceilings, brightly colored lamps, a huge glass mosaic and cool decorations.The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Music was playing in the background during our meal but we didn't have any trouble hearing one another. In fact, it was just loud enough to drown out your neighbors and provide a little bit of conversational privacy.We had heard positiive reviews about their mixed drinks so my wife ordered the Coconut Mojito and I ordered the Mojito Millonario. Both were good; however, I was partial to my libation. It was a few dollars more than the regular Mojito but the 12 year estate rum they used was absolutely delicious and worth the extra expense. In addition to the rum upgrade, in the Millinario they add cava (spanish sparkling wine) and forego simple syrup, which is used in the regular mojito. This made for better flavor and kick in my opinion. The food we ordered really hit the spot as well and was prepared perfectly. To start, we had the Arepas and the Ropa Vieja. Both had great flavor. The pork belly and corn cheese cakes in the former were a nice pairing. If I had to choose between the two though I would go with the Ropa Vieja. The braised beef and spicy mayo together with the other ingredients made for an incredibly tasty combination. Plus, in the RV they give you 4 little portions per plate compared to 3 on the Arepas dish. Regardless, you won't go wrong with either.For entrees we chose the Churrasco and the Bistek Palomilla. There was no clear cut winner in my mind because both dishes had unique and satisfying flavor profiles. The meat for both was cooked just right; tender but not bloody and easy to cut. My wife made the comment that the Churrasco tasted more latin american'esque while the Bistek Palomilla was more amorphous, although still excellent. She may have had a point. Regardless, the roasted mushrooms, radish salad and brisket mofongo disappeared quickly from my plate. The sweet potato puree and corn on her dish did compliment each other and the beef tenderloin very well.Since it was my birthday they brought us a free dessert, flan with bits of caramel popcorn on the plate. I didn't even see that option on the menu but it hit the spot. Definitely not the best I've ever had but since it was free I wasn't complaining. Had they not surprised us with this I would have ordered the Banana Cream Pie, which sounded awesome. Next time!",2/4/2010,1MtWJVAZMpL_fZBqJTLUrQ,S8QWXZw2BNcK2CU5Lz9TWg,OKOfoisduqP24uK3WYvx7Q,Y,5,0

They are HUGE though, keep in mind if you are ordering pasta too. -Farfalle pollo is most popular- its a heart attack on a plate. -Rigatone Bolognese is yummy. -Cooks will change/add anything. Everything is fresh so there is little that they can't do.  -Vegetarians- keep in mind that their marinara and most of their soups are beef based. Ask for the BV marinara.

2891,"My wife and I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago. A big part of the trip was going to taste the various culinary treats that range from Al's Beef to Gino's East, Blackbird and Tru. My first impression was that there seemed to be a very up-tight vibe to the dining room that night. My wife semi-agreed, but not as much. I understand fine dining and the associated feel, but this still seemed stuffy to me. We chose the standard five-course tasting menu, which goes for $110. There was no pre-set wine pairings, which would have been a nice option, but oh well. The wine list was EXTENSIVE and very high-end. Almost so that I don't believe there was an option under $100. To me, that's just not providing options for your diners. I've been to the Napa region many times and there are quality wines to be had under $100. Whatever, it's wine and again, it's fine dining. Understandable. As for the food... overall it was great. Very refined and showed a great amount of skill in it's preperation. However, I felt that the meal lacked a true inspiration or soul. I did not feel like the chef was truly inspired by the menu or wowed me with much. Yes, it was one of the best gnocchi I have ever tasted and well executed. However, it was a gnocchi in broth. Ok... ? I mean, it was good, but thank you for the potato dumplings in broth with a parmesan twille? Have we not seen a twille for about 10 years now? Anyway, the meal had it's highlights. Specifically, the caviar with avocado puree was delightful. The main courses (Ribeye and Venison) were perfectly cooked and delicious. The pastry chef needs to be recognized nationally for his/her skill. Also, the service was absolutely impeccable and the front of the house was on-point. So, to wrap it up.

59611,"The service was the worst I have seen in a long time. We barely sat down and the waitress wanted to take our entire order--not just drinks. We said we weren't ready but I don't think she understood since she pointed out what dishes she recommended. She finally left but literally came back a minute later. She did this several more times until we felt pressured to order right then.My two friends ordered the BBQ. I ordered a rice dish. My friends were half way through their meal and I still did not get my entree. I finally flagged down a waitress (don't expect to see them again until time for the check and don't count on being asked if you want anything else). She said it would be right out. Then 10 minutes later our soup arrived (at the end of my friends' meals) but still no entree for me. Then the waitress brought the check and I said they didn't bring my entree so she needed to remove the charge. She looked confused then said it was ready and walked away. She then came back w/o it but said it would be up soon. I told her I didn't want it anymore. She was not happy about that. To top it off, they tried to charge me for the soup that normally comes with the entree (which I did not eat since I don't like miso soup). She angrily came back with the check after we told her to remove the charge and said nothing to us--never any attempt at an apology.I'm shocked there are so many good reviews although I did see a pattern of poor service and problems communicating with the servers.

49752,"I guess this is what happens when you have high expectations. After reading some of the reviews on here, I thought my group and I would be in for a treat. 2.5 hours of poor service later, a treat was nowhere to be found. Oh, and did I mention everyone's dish came out cold? I booked this place for my brother's birthday and was excited because they seemed more than willing to accommodate our group of 11. Reservations were for 8pm and when we all arrived i went to tell the hosts that we were all here. After a lot of ""Let me just check on the table for you"", one of the hosts proceeds to tell me that ""they didn't know I was coming today"". That's funny...I received a phone call from Las Tablas that afternoon confirming my reservation for 8pm and when I saw my name very clearly written on the reservation sheet when I walked in. How did you not know we were coming? He then went on to explain they'd ""try really hard"" to get us a table....that I reserved...5 days prior. Anyway... FInally, about 30 minutes after our reserved time, we are seated. Everyone's excited to eat and partake in sangria. We all order and end up waiting until after 9:30pm to get our food. Now I know there was a lot ordered and lots of different meats to cook, but an hour after we sat down? I don't know think I have ever waited that long at any restaurant or with any size party. Thankfully the sangria was good, since we ended up ordering 3 extra pitchers to bide our time till the food arrived. So, we're all starving (and a little tipsy from all the sangria on empty stomachs) as the food is finally brought over to the table. My plate was missing the pork belly. Another plate was missing the plantain. And the best part, every single plate had cold food. What the heck? One person had his plate taken back to get reheated (which also turned his steak from medium rare to medium well). A couple of us also mentioned to the waiter that all the food was cold. He just shrugged his shoulders and stared at us. I think at that point, we were all too hungry to argue about it any further. The food didn't necessarily taste bad, but meat really isn't meant to be eaten cold. Regardless, we just ate because we were all so hungry at this point.  Not only was the service awful but the food (which I figured would its saving grace) was cold and nothing was done about it. The waitstaff missed out on getting a great tip from a table of 11 and instead got a mediocre tip from a very disappointed group. Maybe this place is better in smaller groups. but I am wary of going back now with the experience that I had.",9/25/2010,ujMZHEOO89ywXW8ZyBZDrg,buRwKVu-oNiu0FpdQY-lsA,2WoMT3wSpp9vxZeTv6u-cw,N,5,1

59405,"My wife and I are big Chicago deep-dish fans. Our current favorite is Gino'a East, but we typically try a new deep-dish place each time we're in Chicago. This time it was Giordano's. Overall, we were not impressed. Like Gino's East, Giordano's does not take any reservations. So the wait to get to your table is anywhere from 1 - 2 hours on a weekend night. We waited for 90 minutes. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza, which was a nice feature that allowed the pizza to be served within minutes of our seating. Waiting aside, what we really care about is this pizza. The crust of this pizza has less of a corn flavor than Gino's, which some people prefer. However, the sauce and overall flavor of Giordano's was disappointing. The sauce tasted like something out of a can. We ordered a pepporoni and sausage pizza, and we had 2 slices that had almost no sausage on them. The service was lax at best, with our waiter checking in about once every 20 minutes or so. The provide a bottle of water on the table, but this seems to be a reason for them to not check back in for any other beverages. Summary, if we're going to put in this kind of wait-time for food, it better be a special experience.

The pork belly ban bao was smoothered with hoison sauce and pickled slaw. Unfortunately, it masked the taste of the pork belly. This is a common theme with some of the dishes we tried here. Same thing with the rolls, they add so many extra things to the rolls that you couldn't really decipher what you were eating (if that makes sense - see pics).

Two giant steak burritos and about a gallon of black salsa later, yeah, good stuff. It's that good people - and not just after the taps are turned off for the night, but even in the light of day.  I'm partial to the black salsa (caliente!) but he green is delicious too (caliente!). I usually get the chicken super (burrito) but the steak is incredible too. Pork tends toward the fatty. The burritos are big. If you get the steak, go purist and just get onions and cilantro. Steak tacos have good proportions too. And often I just go there for the salsa, get a few large tubs to bring home just for me!

54361,"My girlfriend I ventured to this Lincoln Park establishment last night based on reviews from fellow yelpers. Upon arriving, I immediately knew I would enjoy sitting in this place and having a cold beer because of the lively atmosphere. However, I didn't know if I would enjoy eating their pie. I am always skeptical of pizza places that claim to be better than Gino's East or Lou's.We started off with the Combo appetizer which includes cheese sticks, fried mushroom caps, fried zucchini, and poppers. All of this for 9 bucks definitely worth the money. Then had the house salad which included carrots, olives, tomatoes, and chopped romaine. Also, a pretty good deal at 4 bucks a salad. Now for the main course, we ordered the large pizza in hopes we would enjoy it enough to last through the weekend. My half of the pizza was sausage, onions, and green pepper (this is what I normally order at Lou's or Gino's). The pizza arrived at our table with the patented black crust and the eating began. I believe the true test of Chicago deep dish pizza is actually the final bite of pizza where you get the crust and the toppings all in one. I immediately turned my pizza around and took this bite. It was great the crust was crunchy and airy at the same time. The toppings were plentiful and the sausage had good seasoning. When I saw the black crust I wondered how can that not taste burnt, but it didn't. It tasted like, well... caramelized cheese,brilliant! For 4 beers, appetizer, salad, pizza, and tip this experience cost us $74.00 and we still have three quarters of a pizza left to enjoy.

60492,"HIGHLY recommend!!I've been going here a lot lately and love it, for many reasons.First, the menu is extensive and has something for everyone. I am a vegan and appreciate that there are options for me. Veggie burger, black bean burger, edamame salad, vegan soup, etc.  And my carnivore friends like the burgers, chicken, salmon, etc. So many options!!! And good wine selection! Wonderful menu!!Second, the service and the staff are top notch, starting with the managers. A group of us went to Wilde on the show day recently. While the city was nearly completely shut down, Wilde was open and so enjoyable!! It was packed and they were way under staffed. But Chad, who is the manager, stepped in to be our server that day. He was so friendly, so fun, and offered fantastic service, despite the chaos and his ""dual jobs"" that day. There were a couple minor mistakes with our order due to all the chaos, and Chad was fantastic in how he dealt with it -- with humor and respect.All the staff is consistently wonderful. So friendly, hard working, etc.Third, the music selection. On a typical day/night, the variety of music is amazing! I will say the music on the Saturday before St Pattys day was ridiculously loud and probably should have been turned down a notch, but we certainly enjoyed the selection and dancing regardless. :)My friends and I now go to Wilde often b/c f the food, atmosphere, the staff and location and always feel welcome as if it were a tiny, friendly, quaint, neighborhood bar....even if its completely packed and nuts in there as it was on Sat before St Pattys day.

I'd just made a good amount of money from a recent project and wanted something different and on the expensive side. The food itself was rather good. It was presented in a very good manner and the taste was exquisite. The servers were very well trained and knowledgeable when they brought us out our food. They would tell us what the dish was and what was the best way to eat it get the full flavor profile. Make sure you pay attention because the way you eat it actually has a lot of impact on how it tastes. Certain things are meant to be eaten together in the same bite to give it its maximum use of whichever ingredient.

Thinking it was a fluke that our first visit was a bust, we gave it another whirl. MISTAKE!",3/5/2012,zmDcVrv25PD86kBEHK1c0g,8GFn6jQK7k3HFxsA-oZwAQ,NGfbRjWoqUh2fGw8DU_pmA,Y,4,0

55505,"NOT WORTH THE PATIO! After returning for a second time to experience the ever talked about patio I was extremely disappointed. Not only was I seated one hour after my reservation time, multiple parties who arrived well after I did were seated before my table. This is clearly a place where if you don't know someone expect to be ignored. Our waiter was extremely rude, acting annoyed when he made the frustrating mistake of bringing a glass of wine instead of the bottle I clearly ordered. The cold, unfriendly service made me feel very unwelcome and contributed to the overall negative experience we had. The food is absolutely forgettable- the peaches in my antipasti were rock hard and tasteless (when there is so much great produce in the summer it shouldn't be so hard to create a good dish!). The pork was terrible as the prosciutto was so overcooked it was more like burnt jerky than anything else. Again, dessert was disappointing and not work staying for. And for all those that rave about the patio, yes it is nice to have an outdoor space with some trees, but the experience is ruined when you are crammed in so tight that you can't even move. I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this meal all summer. You are far better off going to 'A Tavola' nearby. Great patio and the food is infinitely better!",10/6/2010,Uuk1Yr_AxM_2XYI9PelgSA,lzS42JpUQOy2F3XTqLvSzw,JMa9cTNQA5mm4GbR2W8Oiw,Y,4,0

30776,"One word, WOW! Our dinner was fantastic before we even got in the door and I didn't know it. I hate eating in Chicago, not because of the food, but it's just such a pain parking even with a valet. The valet here asked us how long we plan to stay. I'd never been asked that before. I had no clue why that was important. He guessed about two hours and my wife agreed. It was only after that I found why that was important. Two hours and ten fantastic minutes later, we came out expecting to wait 20 minutes before we finally got our car. The valet came back from parking another car and gave us our keys. He already had the car parked around the corner. Now that is top notch service. Painless parking aside, the food was awesome. Oysters Rockefeller were some of the best I've had. My wife and I agreed, the French Onion soup, bar none was the best we've had in Chicago. If french onion soup is on the menu, we order it. So we have had a lot of them. I order one of the bone in steaks. Came exactly as I expected which is a nice surprise. Most cooks in US America seem to think medium rare is means blue or pink inside, this one was right in between as it should be,  point. My wife had her Chilean Sea Bass which was cook perfectly. She also instead on creamed Spinach as a side. Note: all portions are really meant for two or more. I really, really don't like cooked spinach, but I ate it and actually didn't hate it. I think that is a high compliment. My only knock against the place, it's dark. I mean really dark. When I walked in people were welcoming me on my way to the table. I couldn't make out anyone's face. It was a little better at the table. I could read my menu well enough, but the wait staff shouldn't have to carry flash lights. On my way out, if the waiter had said farewell, I would never have know I was passing right by him. My final thought on it, we will definitely go back. p.s. I can't believe I forgot about my dessert. I had the Cheese Cake. The Cheese Cake Factory needs change their name. Their $7 cheese cake isn't even close to this $10 of awesomeness. It was like biting into creamiest sweetest slice of perfection. I now have to stop there every time I pass by just for the cheese cake. I may have to take the 60 mile long way home tomorrow.",11/17/2011,ruV5vaqweVdV0L9Ny,2GBiV4GKAYroG_falP6SMA,Pcg4FtfbvSMMwrYuE1yVjQ,N,4,1

We celebrated the New Year in '99 with friends, and I still remember it.At about $75 for two people (not including alcohol), it's a pretty decent price for a good night out. My husband usually orders the filet sampler, which I still to the filet, cooked rare. We usually have the mashed potatoes as a side, and try to save room for dessert.

15979,"Came here with a party of 3 on a Wednesday night. As we walked in, tons of different colors surrounded us and live music filled our ears. The hostess greeted us promptly and asked if we were interested in either the dining area or or the bar/lounge area. We decided to go to the dining area since the bar/lounge area was loud and we couldn't hear each other talk. We did not make reservations so we had to wait about 15-20 mins (not bad since it was already packed). We started off with the shrimp ceviche. All I can say is Y-U-M-M-Y!!! You can taste the different flavors of the lemon, chiles, avocado, and corn all coming together. The shrimp is fresh and succulent. It was also accompanied with some type of chips. People were not lying when they told me this is a must try. The entrees came shortly after. My friends ordered the chuleta (pork chops with squash and brussel sprouts) and the arrachera (skirt steak with rice). I can not comment on the taste of their dishes, but according to them it was good. On the other hand, I ordered the pollo (Peruvian style chicken with potatoes). It came with two good size chicken thighs on top of a bed of red potatoes garnished with red and yellow bell peppers and green beans. The chicken was soo tender and juicy on the very first bite to the very last. We finished off with the carnivale ice cream cake. And can I say YUMMY again. It was a three layer cake with passionfruit, pistachio with chocolate chips, and guava with cheesecake ice cream. It sat on top of basil, strawberry, and pineapple sauces. Oh and the best part, they drenched the cake with chocolate fudge. Overall, our waitress was very knowledgable and sold us on everything she named and described. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. Also down in the bathroom area, they offer a photo booth and a shoe (flats) dispenser for the tired working ladies. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone.",3/6/2012,0Hc01y4ejblggWEXgTCgng,DZC-4TrlkvlyhG0VQY8Yfg,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg,N,4,1

7093,"This is most certainly my crew's favorite place for a nice Italian dinner. Chef Tony is one of the coolest chefs/owners we've come across. He always comes around and makes sure we enjoyed ourselves. The best part is, he's flexible. There have been times when he's made the most amazing adjustment to dishes when someone has special food needs. The restaurant itself is uber cozy, with it's exposed brick and patron art all over the walls. In the warmer months, sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood. As for the food, que Bella! My personal recommendation, the gnocchi, I think it's the best in the city, with its pesto base, sun dried tomatoes, chicken and toasted pine nuts. This is definitely a place to grab dessert, the rice pudding is to die for! It's warm and gooey and just perfect. The wine list is incredible and you'll definitely have leftovers for the next day (not of the wine, of course). P.S. When you go, sign up for the mailers, only if you are interested in receiving coupons, though. Sometimes the coupons are really good. They also serve a Family style dinner on Mondays for $19.95. My girlfriends and I ate there last night and one of my girlfriends did it by herself (no judgment there... she had plenty of food to take home). The portions they bring out directly reflect the number of people who go in on it--from one person to the whole table. The choices are from the more popular dishes on the menu, which is awesome. It's a great way to sample the restaurant's menu..",3/17/2008,224Y,KHzoUj4ZJ3_L0Go-i7TVug,LYppbvgJlBG0SqjSKFiFGg,N,5,1

7465,"I wanted to like Chicago Q, mostly because this part of town needs some good BBQ. Based on a late lunch this afternoon, however, I doubt this spot will make it. The upsides - a pretty dining room and friendly staff (at least on this visit); great house-made pickles and chips served when you sit down; a very tasty array of sauces (two of them are actually BBQ sauce, one is ketchup, and the fourth I couldn't really identify); and a hot towel for cleanup after a meal that's mostly eaten with fingers. The downsides - for starters, lunch time prices. Even in the Gold Coast, you ought to be able to get a lunch entree for under $10, but there are no BBQ entrees at that price point. I tried the classic burger (9.75), which was served with the aforementioned sauces and some fries. The fries were piping hot, and looked freshly cut, but alas not very crisp on the outside. As for the burger: cooked precisely medium as requested, tender, but lacking in flavor. If there was any seasoning here, it escaped my attention. Adding BBQ sauce helped. Service was friendly but I still don't understand why (in a deserted restaurant) it took more than 5 minutes to get the requested mayo. I'd suggest a couple of strategies for this spot:  1) Address the shortcomings on the food mentioned by others. 2) At lunch offer a different sandwich each day on special at 9.95 including a nonalcoholic beverage; and a full entree (not a sandwich) for 11.95. 3) Try some signage out front so people know what they will find inside.",11/29/2010,2RmuL0-vNcqLamGUL5pODg,CNsPhqN0t6drW4b-2Z5zcw,euO3-H92LCivH2B0CQPlnw,N,2,1

We sat for a good 15-20 minutes until someone came to take our order and on top of that, I had to ask for water. Don't sit down resturants generally give you water right away before taking order??  When the lady brought the water, she had her head face toward the floor where you can litterally see the top of her head as she's approaching our table with the tray of water. My friend said maybe it's a culture thing and I didnt think so because I've ate at a lot of Korean places and the first thing you hear when you walk through any korean joint is... ""Anyeasayo!"" Didn't get that here! The pickled side dishes tasted OLD like they've been sitting out for days. The kimchi radishes are crunchy, these were chewy. Also, the place isn't the most cleanest place either. So that right there tells you what their expectations are. Usually I don't criticize whole in the wall places because BELIEVE ME, i've had some of the best FOOD in whole in the wall places. But definitely look elsewhere for Korean if you're looking for good korean w/ good service.",8/12/2012,F4b9FwPxyMRQO86eFiyYEA,IpVFQuWk4gEgQQ_XmzjeQQ,_n3OmwreEGPQmiHKklsD8w,Y,1,0

46539,"R.J. Grunts was the first salad bar concept in Chicago and even today it can't be beat. Located right in Lincoln Park this is a great place to visit after walking around the Lincoln Park Zoo or even if your just in the area. Each time you walk through the doors you are greeted by the friendly waitstaff. If you go for lunch you can normally get a table right away but sometimes it gets rather busy for dinner so keep that in mind when planning your night. I love their salad bar and soup combo. If you are a fan of French Onion soup with a thick layer of bubbling cheese on top this is the place to go! Even when it is hot out, I will always love the soup/salad combination. I love being able to choose my own veggies to go on salads and all the fruit is always fresh and delicious (and of course healthy!) They also have great burgers and fries. Every time I have gone there the food has always amazed me and the atmosphere is always lively. I remember going there as a little kid with my parents and always having such a good time at R.J.

I went in with high hopes, a hungry stomach, and my girlfriend. We were greeted by the staff and walked to a table near the ""kitchen"" (they cook everything in the bar area). We took a while to order because everything sounded delish. We wound up ordering the garlic cheese bread (meh, not too impressed), cappellini pomodoro (classically done), and the day's special: a chicken and ricotta tortellini dish served on a bed of pesto and topped with sun-dried tomatoes. Holy smokes! This was amazing. I mean it looked small, there were three tortellini, but it wound up being quite filling. (Tip: this tortellini dish was a special, but you can customize your own stuffed pasta dish on the menu!) The service was phenomenal. We waited like four minutes for our meal. It was super quick. Our server was very friendly and easy to talk to throughout our meal. He offered a sneak peak at desserts at the end of our meal. Normally we pass, but we said ""When in Rome..."" and ordered a cannoli. It was chocolate covered, and chilled. Very sweet and a perfect ending to a delightful meal.

As a former resident of Greece and a flaming enthusiast of Greek food, I stand by Greek Islands until the end over any other restaurant in Greektown. I always end up spending obscene amounts of money here because I order everything. I've learned over time that the best idea might be to share an entree with someone. Wait, scratch that. Just get two, you'll have left-overs and be overjoyed by them. As far as appetizers go, I recommend: octopus, saganaki, tzatziki, fried zucchini and horiatiki salad. If I were you, I would check and make sure you go on lamb Rosa Marina night because it is the most delicious thing you will ever eat in your life.

50936,"Okay, I would've said ""Yay! I'm a fan"" (4 stars) only when I went to dip into my yummy leftovers - still yummy ice cold, btw - they had only packaged the meat and not the sides! I was more excited for the cheesy grits and greens this morning than the catfish (which was still plump and moist out of the fridge), but alas, the busboy made the executive decision that I wouldn't want it. My group and I were so full after sampling so many apps (I will get to those) that I barely touched the entree, so it was a HUGE disappointment to not get the grits and greens that had come w/ my meal.  ]o: The apps we tried ... fried green tomatoes, crawfish fritters, frog legs, cheddar croquettes, & house boucherie ... Fried Green Tomatoes: LOVED them! My friend Keren thought they were too hard, but a green tomato is unripe and hard by nature. I don't think I'd want a flavorful, crispy outside followed by a hot, mushy inside. The tomato being of a hearty consistency worked for me and my hubby. PS: The remolaude was FAN-TAS-TIC! Crawfish Fritters: Not a fan of these. Keren's & my hubby liked them, but K thought they tasted too fishy, and I thought they were more falafel than fritter. Froglegs: Tastes just like chicken! (Only chewier.) Seriously, it was a good experience having never tried them before. The bread-coating may've been a little too much though, it took away from the meat, but the legs were served with another KILLER sauce - sort of a marsala take that we all sopped up with the bread. Cheddar Croquettes: I really dug this one - crispy, flavorful outside, gooey, cheesy inside, & accompanied by another yummy sauce, like a mix b/w a green godess dressing and jalapeos. (This joint really should jar and sell their sauces!) K had a different idea of what a croqutte should be - something more along the lines of a puff pastry - but the deep-fried preparation rang true to me. House Boucherie: My hubby had asked for a small sample of the head cheese first which the waitress happily obliged. I tried head cheese for the first time in my life, folks, and it was scrumptious! There was a slight consistency issue at first (half lunchmeat, half jello-y), but when the taste expanded, I really enjoyed it! It was zesty like a good deli Genoa salami and the gents loved it equally. All the meats and pickled veggies on the platter are made in-house and you could really taste the quality.  Entrees we tried ... gumbo, pecan catfish, peach tea pork chop, shrimp & grits, benne chicken ... Gumbo: So I'm used to Zatarain's (what I use @ home) and I was initially put off by the deep brown color and hit-you-over-the-head bold flavor @ Big Jones, but after I got over the side-by-side comparison, I really enjoyed Big Jones' gumbo and there was definitely an authenticity about it. Pecan Catfish: My entree. The one that was sent home sans grits & greens. The catfish was plump and juicy and well seasoned and not at all fishy tasting. I thought there would be more pecan flavor infused into the pan-fried breaded sear, but there were plenty of crunchy, sauteed pecans embellishing the plate. The grits were a little stiffer than I had anticipated, but I attributed that to all the cheese. They were tasty on their own w/out me salt-and-peppering (which weren't even on the tables). The greens were sweet and sassy and simply delicious. Peach Tea Pork Chop: This chop could stand next to ANY steak and hold it's own. Served medium-rare-to-medium, it was a tender, savory, healthy portion adorned with cubed sweet potatoes in a thick, sweet gravy/sauce that spoke very southern to me. Shrimp & Grits: K's hubby ordered this one. He felt like it was a titch cold, but he acknowledged that it was probably prepared first and waiting on the others. He stirred it around and the creaminess was quickly restored and he said it was very good. If this was served with the same shrimp that adorned the green tomatoes app (I had forgot to mention that), I gotta believe it was excellent.  Benne Chicken: K ordered this dish and wasn't madly in love w/ it. Granted, we were full from the apps, but her reaction to it was pretty reserved. She said the chicken was good, but she didn't like the sauce. I went home with her leftover chicken, and honestly, it was just average. Decor ... fancier than I expected. I'd rather a grittier appearance, but it was nice. Service ... the waitress was great and accomodating. She forgot one cocktail round, but she laughed at her own ""oops"" in a way that was forgiving and endearing. The busser on the other hand was attentive to the point of being near annoying. The restaurant swaps out silverware/plates after every course and for me, it was too much. I love exemplary customer service, but in this case, the above and beyond was intrusive. We'd be in the middle of an antimated conversation, and he'd be up in us clearing the table ruining the moment, not to mention, leaving a crucial part of my entree out of the to-go package.",6/3/2011,5qxx7oVPtfl0AI8jTzwZSA,_VClXtUMeb8HDxhG7uSGfQ,ElCbMJRjgu9LDj4MxOKXew,N,4,1

47722,"Interesting dining experience. We sat in the dining room on a high-top table abutting the fireplace (so it got a little warm). Very cheery and helful service, but the place was over 1/2 empty on this Wednesday before Thanksgiving. The many options on the expansive Salad/Pasta/Veggy Bar were for the most part good. A few did not agree with the five of us at the table, but that is to be expected. Not everyone can agree on all foods. The highlight of the Brazilian Style of service (where they bring the meats and fish to your table on a big skewer) was the Butter Beef. Tasted like Heaven. The Mahi Mahi also great. A lot of oohing and aahing at the table, but not everything was oh-my-gosh. You have to try each to see what you like, with some more memorable than others. I liked my Grape Martini. My wife thought her Lemon Drop Martini was a bit odd tasting. We shared the Butterscotch Bread Pudding which met the expectations of the waitress who described it. It was a birthday dinner, so one of the Puddings was served with candle on a plate with happy birthday spelled out in chocolate (nice touch). Given the focus on all-you-can-eat here, we may come here for a large group event (from time to time) but not on a regular basis if it's just the two of us. At least not for the full menu option (about $55, I think). The bar menu offers a scaled down, plated version of the meats for under $20 and I might opt for that next time.

39282,"This is a pretty good Korean BBQ joint. The way this place really distinguishes itself is by giving you an oddly large number of side dishes--we counted 25 bowls. It's a little intimidating, but really, what other restaurant, of any kind, brings you 25 (yes, twenty-five!) of anything with your meal--at no extra charge?! And to boot, you can get any of them refilled, as many times as you want, at no extra charge. The BBQ is good, too. We got marinated beef and pork, and yes, it's fun to cook your own meat at your table. Good tasting, too--that beef marinate is phenomenal. Drawbacks? Well, we didn't know what we were eating with all 25 sides; in fact, less than half were easily identifiable. The waitstaff is super nice, but they only speak Korean, so when we asked what something was (it was one of the ones we didn't like), we got an extra serving instead. And really, if you're not into wasting food, you might not like this place: You're not going to like all 25 sides, so you're going to end up leaving a bunch of food on the table to be thrown out. Lastly, the place could use some remodeling, maybe a paint job, maybe something to brighten it up, as it's all dark brown wood inside. But a good place for Korean BBQ. I recommend you go if you like different things, want an eating experience, and want some good food.",2/22/2007,D7SynllL0jvHtjQR9jvvZA,9d5-xvLEv-AqNGmgBetNkQ,_n3OmwreEGPQmiHKklsD8w,N,4,1
59346,"Fox & Obel is a difficult place to give a single rating to because it is made up of many different pieces. I'll review each separately, from the good to the bad to well, you know the rest.Grocery (5/5):We live across the street from Fox & Obel and love the convenience and selection. They have a great variety of different specialty options that you won't find elsewhere. They have a great cheese selection, a huge craft beer selection, more chocolate than you can imagine, coffees from around the world, meats, etc. If you're looking for something unique or high-end, this is the place for you. The prices aren't outrageous, but you're certainly going to pay more than you would at larger chain grocery stores.Desserts (5/5):Our usual stop is the dessert counter when we go to Fox & Obel. Their dolce de leche cheesecake, chocolate mousse, cookies fresh out of the oven, and pretty much anything else is amazing. If you ever need to bring a dessert to an outing, you can't go wrong here.Prepared Food (4/5):The kitchen does a great job with prepared foods. They must use the same ingredients that they sell in the store, and the portions are very large. The only reason I give if 4 stars is that the presentation isn't the best (a Luigi Bormioli water glass, breakfast served on a white porcelain plate, with a paper placemat and fruit in a paper cup? not terribly consistent...). The take out food is just as good as if you sit down, so a grab and go meal is great.Outdoor Patio (0/5):This is a recent addition to Fox & Obel. We saw them setting up a nice set of tables and lights on the sidewalk and decided to try it out for breakfast one morning. They weren't busy at all (1 table was taken) so we went in search of the hostess. She was inside at the top of the ramp and busy doing something. We asked if we could be seated, and she seemed surprised that we would want to. She then tried (convincingly) to turn us away. She said, ""You can only get bagels here"". Ok, can we get anything else? ""No, just cold sandwiches and some bagels"". Ok, can we grab take out from the Cafe and have coffee out on the patio? ""No, they don't allow that"". No wonder they're never busy.Cafe (2/5):Inside the store, you'll find another place to get food. This one is at the back of the store next to the milk. It's actually 2 places in one, and you need to be aware of the difference or you'll be turned away. There is a grab and go line that has a counter where some food can be ordered (but not all), a cash register, and some pastries in a case. Upon walking in, there are many tables for you to sit at and the way that the place is set up, you would think that you order your food, pay, and then sit down cafeteria style. But be careful, if you order your food at the counter and then try to sit in one the tables to the left you'll be turned away. In that section, you can only order your food at the table. You are only allowed to sit to the right if you order at the counter. They will not accomodate you if you make the mistake, as I saw a poor older couple in front of me learning the hard way.Market Bistro (1/5):When we got turned away from sitting on the patio we decided to try out the Market Bistro instead. It is full of potential and supposedly the nicer of the 3 places to eat within Fox & Obel. We walked in to find that there was no hostess, but only several stressed out waitstaff that were simultaneously training, seating, and taking orders. The long and short of the Market Bistro (for breakfast) is that the waitstaff is undertrained, confused, and the place is in chaos. It's as if the management grabbed a few employees from the grocery store floor and said ""you waited tables in college, great! Go work in the bistro!"" The food was good, the view was great, but the service was terrible.TL;DR:Fox & Obel is great as a grocery store and their kitchen is great. Their food service, though, is on par with a college diner on a Sunday morning. I would recommend coming here for groceries or to get take out (if you have time to wait in a confused line), but don't sit down to eat. It will ruin the experience.",5/16/2009,Le1tN9hSb5Yp9X3P3y_ECw,4WMg5sHZ-rDza67ZKnLXow,qkfBgSCbekH3DHTanVL1_w,Y,5,0

However, when someone told me they pride themselves on BYOB Thai joints and that this is their favorite...it definitely peeked my interest. We went on a Saturday night and had zero problems getting a table. I was surprised by the decor and ambiance of the place. I was expecting somewhat of a dive, but it was really cute and kind of hip (as in I wanted to ask them what paint color was on the walls because I wanted to use it for my apartment).  The food was delicious, which is really what's going to keep me coming back. We started with the spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce (i.e. thinner/sweeter peanut butter) that was devoured in two minutes. We split two entrees: panang curry beef (it was great and not too spicy) and the chicken pad thai (yummy and not too greasy or sweet).

Also... the CB&J (cashew butter & fig jam, with raclette cheese on grilled sourdough) has to be tasted to be believed.

37149,"This star rating has nothing to do with the food or the awesome selection of beers this fine establishment has. It has everything to do with Rob the bartender. Hey Rob, you are a BARTENDER at a BEER BAR, one with TONS OF GREAT BEERS. Maybe you should take some time and learn what you have on tap, or maybe which ones taste better than others, or even just the pretty pictures on the labels. Patron: What are some good IPAs you have on tap? Can you recommend a good lager? I'm looking for something local. Rob: What? Uh, here's a good one (points to nearest tap) Patron: Is it an IPA? Did you hear what I asked? It's kind of loud in here... Rob (annoyed): Theres a lot of beers, here's a list. Maybe Hopleaf should change thier name to 'High Fidelity', then they could hire Jack Black, then Rob the bartender would feel right at home. I'm not saying your a mean guy, just take some interest in your product, like every other great bartender there. I have given up asking you for recommendations, but can you try to remember what I am drinking when I come back up for another? I know, I know - its sort of hard in a crowded bar, but even the creepy guy at my bus stop remembers the hat I wore the day before. My heart sinks a little when I accidentally get your attention at the bar instead of that other cool guy with the beard that is pleasant and knows his shit. Lastly, all of this ignorance and forgetfulness wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so clearly bummed out that you have to get my drink in the first place.

Average meal price with a half bottle of wine and 2 drinks comes out to about $120 for two people. Their fixed price steak option is always a good bet - you get a salad, 6oz filet, and dessert for under $40 pp. My steak always comes out done like I ask (medium) and I've never had any issues with service.

58065,"By far one of the best restaurants in Chinatown.You will see a great variety of people dining here. It serves authentic Sze Chuan cuisine. It disgusts me when people go into this restaurant and order stuff like egg rolls and fried rice. Skip it. If you want that, go to Panda Express. If you don't know what to order, ask for recommendations. Every single time we have dined here, we have had great service and amazing food. Highly recommend the Three Chili Chicken (Chef Specialty), which is somewhat powdery(?), spicy chicken with just the right amount of oil. Pure heaven. Lao Sze Chuan also serves the REAL orange chicken and orange beef which is simply amazing. Nothing like the frozen crap served at places like Panda Express. They use real orange peels and it has just a hint of crispiness.Now if you can handle spiciness, you will enjoy this restaurant. Otherwise you will be missing out on the true gems of this place.

19389,"I can appreciate Xoco because after beginning culinary training in my youth, and hosting a 26-part PBS series called 'Cooking Mexican' in the seventies, I dedicated over six years to culinary research in Mexico, culminating with the publication of my 'Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico'.** Wait... I didn't do those things. Rick Bayless did. And thank goodness for that, because it allowed the confluence of events that yielded Xoco's opening last year. And that allowed me to experience the Ahogada sandwich. ""Ahogada"" literally means ""drowned."" Yes, my wood-grilled pulled pork sandwich was fantastically seasoned and fired to crunchy delicious perfection but it was also cut in half, with the middle ends ""drowned"" in a shallow bowl of a thick tomato-based spicy salsa. The sandwich halves pointed up like twin obelisks, and when the item was served to me, everybody nearby in the restaurant looked on with awe at how fantastic the sandwich looked and the presentation was. I have only had this sandwich once (so far) but it is rapidly contending to join the list of my top 10 favorite sandwiches ever. In addition, the guacamole at Xoco is fantastic, as well as liberally peppered with chiles. The cubano sandwich is solid, if not awe-inspiring. It is also worth noting that they've got about six different kinds of ""hot chocolate,"" including one I found to be an amazing novelty that was mixed with ancho chiles. Hot chocolate with a bite! Yes, it works. Xoco has quite clearly considered every aspect of its service and cuisine. The dining experience is full of individual flair and makes you feel intrigued at every step forward. I have rarely experienced this much of a ""wow factor"" at a place that was under $15 per person for a full meal. **synopsized from wikipedia",12/13/2011,0ZgcDqytJv,NnrCwpS1i5mZtkGGzmIk0g,mlhHPnHmjO2_ypcP5Vc9Zw,N,5,1

A great thing about Hopleaf is they have a great mix of local, seasonal, and little known brews to rock your palate. As a proponent of beer nerdery, a solid 2 thumbs and a big toe up. The food is also incredible. As detailed below, a great mix of pub food, American comfort food, and sometimes charcuterie. I recommend the mussels as well as anything they have on special - I've never been disappointed. I take visitors from out of town here frequently - everyone loves it and wants to go when they're back in Chicago. I can't really talk about specific entrees since I've had most of them, but the food is truly delicious, simple and unpretentious. The service is great, but the bar gets PACKED. The kitchen opens 5:30 pm most days, so if you show up around then with your party you'll probably be seated quickly. After 5:30, godspeed. Definitely the best mix of delicious food and awesome beer in Chicago with the personality and atmosphere to match. However, I don't recommend it, as I don't want the place more packed than it already is.",7/9/2009,H-jXQ-D3fBwmfxf3PXdjqA,ngQK_l9ubujkh8_0nfI_4w,sR4EOfPuI-at41uIxIZPhw,N,4,1
19424,"The Gage holds a decent St. Patrick's Day party. We had some delicious Gage mini-sliders, mini fish and chips, and some other random hors d'oeurves that weren't too memorable. The bartenders were attentive and mellow, and overall, I had a great time despite the fact the space is in the basement of the building (i.e. no view). Since then I've made enough trips to warrant a real review. One of the classier joints to frequent south of Madison Avenue, the Gage keeps a good price range on their menu. You can pick a few small dishes to nibble or do a progression. Having the subtle delineation of first/second/third/fourth to indicate whether a plate is ""snack-sized"" or entre-sized is very helpful when going in a group, especially if the sight of some $40 entres is a bit intimidating. The Gage's wine list begins at a higher price point of around $40. And they have, on occasion, run out of the first wine my group's requested. They have mastered the $12 martini though, especially for a Michigan Ave/Millenium Park spot. There are some perks to being an upscale Elephant and Castle. For starters, they have classic fallbacks that are consistently great. The Gage Burger and Fish and Chips are always satisfying (and on the cheaper end of the entres!) The Elk Saddle with ricotta and rhubarb to contrast well as mild salt/sweet, is a superb dinner if you feel like shelling that much out. Unfortunately, saddle's not the only reflection of their elk preparation. Poutine: gravy, cheese curds and fries, with an elk ragout enticing me as a catalyst, disappointed as an oversalted ""snack"". Screwing up salt is always a no-no. As for sides, the brie potato is as rich as it sounds, and nice and crisp. On seconds: I was quickly disillusioned with their Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab. The breading was half salt, while the afterthought of lemon crme fraiche and caviar weren't the best. The mussels with vindaloo are savory and succulent though, and a better seafood pick. Rabbit was seasoned really well, as was the caramelized lobster. Both of these dishes rock this part of the menu. When it came to dessert, the peanut butter beignets immediately drew my eye. I love beignets, and the play on PB&J was charming and effective. French toast? Not so much. With the emergence of so many other gastropubs recently, the Gage has too much volatility in its menu for me to rate it well. It's not even about the unwarrantedly high price point. Their hits and misses are equally strong, and they really need to work on their salt issue; it's an elementary skill to master.",12/9/2010,Qsmid2Lz7YIek24ZUkKLDw,pPSWHxy-RqlRqmyborXHLQ,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,N,5,1

This place was bustling, with the outdoor patio open (it was chilly, but they have multiple outdoor heaters). We sat outside and had drinks and shared some small plates. My favorite thing, hands down, was the spring peas with red onions and feta. Also very tasty, and meaty, was the pork neck bone with ricotta. Don't be turned off by the whole pork neck bone thing....it is sorta served in this croque with fresh sliced bread to spread. If you are into olives, order the fried ones here. Reminiscent of fried pickles, the fatty/rich/bitter taste is delicious. We also tried the milk braised pork shoulder. It was good, not my favorite, but was very tender and served with mashed potatoes. The only thing I didn't like here was the hostess. When we came into the restaurant to be seated, she acted like it was quite a chore to help us.

35499,"After a hiatus, I was looking though my reviews and noticed that I never have reviewed Sun Wah. What an egregious omission. Sun Wah is only my favorite Chinese restaurant in town, but my favorite restaurant on Argyle and my standby ""I am stressed and need to have my way"" restaurant. If I go on my own, I am moderately stressed. If I ask my wife to go with then I am really stressed. I have a lot of stories about Sun Wah and most have less to do with the duck, Hong Kong pork, or garlic fried ribs than I care to admit. Sun Wah is great family run restaurant that offers one of the top special dinners in town in the Beijing Duck special. For $28, you share a 4 course meal with as many of your friends as you choose. You get first tableside cut duck in buns, then comes the duck soup, next is the remainder of the duck in duck fried rice, and finally comes house made sorbet. If you are lucky, you get a fifth course of radishes to start. We love the owner's daughters who have so much energy, knowledge, and willingness to chat. The Duck special is great, but if you want to go off menu, try the Hong Kong Pork or Garlic Fried Ribs.

However, I've had the opportunity to try the extensive salad bar a couple times while dining with meat-eating co-workers and friends. It is not your average salad bar. It is overflowing with fresh vegetables and ""fancy"" things like asparagus, artichoke hearts and hearts of palm. There are numerous types of olives and seeds to go on top. Fresh bread and olive oil help fill you up. However, I just can't justify paying about $30 for salad. Even if I absolutely stuff myself, I'm hungry an hour later. I can understand the meat option being as expensive as it is; however, they should really reconsider how much they charge for the ""salad bar only"" option.",11/2/2008,tpLLtJhTgtNQaC5m3RHTAw,ouTduTFdna34Ddb_qlAJFw,43rd1LKcZRIunySzbMsyLQ,N,3,1

NO I thought the food was actually quite overpriced for tapas-style dining. We ordered the spicy pork rinds (not spicy at all, more like sprinkled with cheese, not impressed). We also had charcuterie plate, steak tartare, and pork belly which were all excellent (4-star range). There were two of us gals sharing, and after this amount of food, we felt content and not overstuffed.

Even with this high expectation, the restaurant delivered. It's hard to believe that it was three chefs and a waiter running the restaurant. I thought that was odd, in a good way.  Two things that were note-worthy: Chef Shin was working the room. He had his quality control hat on and is very charming and nice. You can tell that the restaurant is his baby. Second, they sneaked in a 6 course that was awesome. It was a rabbit stew in a large spoon. Very unexpected and tasty.  Two notes: they should leave your wine on the table.

So, I'd say know what you're getting into. A tasty $9-$10 sandwich with unique flavors. The churros are also great, but again there will be some saying it's a churro.

15779,"Calo's has very solid Italian dishes. The food is not trendy or pretentious, just good, filling, classic Italian fare. As expected, they have really great pizza (and feature giardinera as a topping which is a HUGE plus in my opinion). That said, I must admit that I miss the OLD Calo's -- the one with the 60's neighborhood pseudo-supper-clubby atmosphere. It had great character! On the weekends there was always a band and cute neighborhood couples would trip the light fantastic on the dance floor. Now Calo's has been remodeled (actually it was a couple of years ago) and the remodel is nice. The problem is that it's just a little too generic-yuppie. Last time I was there, there was a ""light jazz"" combo (which is OK), but no one was dancing. The ""old school"" atmosphere is definitely missed (at least by this nostalgic ol' queen!). In short, for home-style classic Italian dishes, Calo's know exactly what they're doing (and have been doing it for a long time).",5/8/2007,4w33t0xfRGeepo5PfC4n8w,nzgqccQQN2Yv-w1GFeFRPA,oLM9piDKbj2PDgy-m3XEcQ,N,4,1

14571,"My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants, especially when there's an atypical drink list involved.  We got to Rev. Brew around 7:30 on a Tuesday and the place was hopping! Not overly hopping where we waited an hour to get a table, but we did wait about 15-20 minutes. However, what I thought was very cool was they had a server in the lounge area-- we were able to get a drink (the Anti-Hero I.P.A) while we were waiting. We commented how we liked the vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant. Any restaurant that has eclectic groups of cliental is usually a sign that it's good. When we got to our table we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We ordered our food (my boyfriend got the Hombre Burger and I ordered the Tofu Chili Dog) and it wasn't long before it came out. Justin said his burger was a B+ (""about an 8.7, 8.8 out of 10) and I found my tofu chili dog to be pretty flavorful! Aside from the food, we were impressed with the beer menu. No Coor's Light, Miller Light, or Bud! They (for obvious reasons) highlighted their microbrews, but if you weren't interested in those, they also offered a plethora of other microbrewed beers. Like I said before, we tried their I.P.A (as I'm a huge fan of India Pale Ales) and it was pretty good. It wasn't as hoppy as an I.P.A usually is, but tasty none-the-less.

17520,"I was really excited to try this place after reading all the reviews on Yelp and Metromix. We went on a Friday night around 8:30 pm. There was no problem finding parking and the line was only about 5 people tall. It was drizzling outside, and luckily, we all got to wait inside the hallway. Once the man with the gentle voice let us through the blue velvet curtain, we were seated in the third room (out of three rooms). There were two bars and the chairs had really high backs. It was very dim and perfect for a romantic night. My boyfriend said, ""It feels like Halloween!"" Ha, yes there were some freaks there. Unfortunately, we didn't get a table per say, but more like a bench with a cushion for our table. We ordered two Spanish Margaritas because the 43 Liquer brings back memories and I had to have it. When the waitress arrived with the tiny Margarita glasses I was concerned, especially since they are $11/each! But then I saw it came with a separate glass container to refill. After finishing the first drink in its entirety, we realized that the $11 drink was well worth the money! The drink was strong, but while you are drinking it you have no idea how strong it is! We also ordered the waffle fries with blue cheese/onion dip, which were very good. Later, I tried the Juliet and Romeo (backwards, I know), which had cucumber, mint, gin, etc....really good! The atmosphere was really relaxing and great for conversation and people-watching. The waitress was kind of a jerk, but we didn't go to see her, so no harm done. Overall, I will go back to try the other drinks on the menu and, hopefully, sit at a real table with a high-back chair.",4/27/2008,xzp3BQNalm9mQ7b4d0,k_ye0NWiq4BgvuUpYgTaqQ,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,4,1

The appetizers are standard, nothing especially outstanding, but my girlfriend seems to be a fan of the jalepeno poppers (I have no problem 'helping' her eat them).  Service is always pleasant and very helpful. I don't think I've ever had to ask anyone to refill any beverage, water, soda or beer or for anything else. That's the kind of service that makes me really want to go back. And we do (we also order a lot of delivery...go figure).

19376,"The ruse is on! Walked out feeling bamboozled, hoodwinked, scammed, screwed, fleeced, deceived and taken for a ride. I limped back to my car from the action I took in the rear. It is in all honesty that writing this review disappoints me greatly. I have read the numerous critical rantings about XOCO and chalked them up to people who either didn't get it, or of jealous wannabes who don't like seeing one Chef get all the attention. Dear Rick,  Why I ask are my lips burning from salt? Not just my dish, my girls dish as well. Why when I leaned up against a wall did I receive nearly a second degree burn? Is there a reason your glorified bus boy manager can't work the room and ask how your meal is? If someone takes an enormous dump, is there any guarantee I won't have to smell it while eating my salty broth?  I can answer one. In your greedy quest to squeeze two more people into your restaurant tube, you placed a piece of sheet metal around your wood fired oven. This results in a very hot wall with a chair next to it. Idiotic at best. I was lucky enough to find street parking right across the street, that was the end of my good fortunes. The line didn't seem very long and the menu was beautifully written, it yielded great promises of culinary excitement. As we clutched our menu, made our choices we watched a chef make one after another perfect empanadas. We stared at the wood burning oven relinquish its pleasures onto plates. Unfortunately this went on for quite some time, we waited for twenty minutes without the line moving. We were four people back in the line with no order being taken, no explanation.  Finally, we order, we get directed to our ominous table against the oven. My buddy Jack P. in his stirring review spoke of the Feng shui being of a ""bus station, I can't argue with that. While waiting for the bathroom I was useful in holding the walk in cooler door open for a chef, stepping back and forth out of peoples way and most of all just clogging up the isle. First our Polverones and hot chocolate arrive, fantastic. The best short bread cookie ever, even though I suspect it was a touch raw inside. The hot chocolate was rich, complex and exactly what I expect from Bayless. The Short Rib soup comes and my anticipation has got me giddy. A tremendous disappointment. The broth was so salty it stripped me of my abilities to taste anything. Chunks of zucchini and potato were added to the bowl rather than simmered in this briny bath. I think of a soup as an iconic representation of simplicity. This was more like four ingredients introduced to each other, and never having the time to get to know one another.  Even had the saltiness not ruined it for me, this would have been a major failure. At one desperate point I poured some of my water into my soup just to make it palatable, even this desperate venture was inadequate in diluting the oceanic vibe of my broth. The smoked pork torta was served plunged halfway into a broth of arbol chilies, we ordered spicy and it was, problem was it was so salty, again with the salt. I don't get it. I looked around at the table next to us, a six top that was struggling with the same issues. No one comes around to ask ""hows your soup."" Narry a manager to be seen except to explain to people how to stand in line for a half hour. The ingredients were all excellent, but the parts were greater than the whole. When this concept was announced I imagined a great place to get a cafe con leche, a real churro, maybe a tamal and a champurado. I guess Ricks bean counters thought that would not generate enough income. Soup, sandwich, cookie, and a hot chocolate=$36 if this food could have lived up to my previous Bayless experiences then that would have been a fine price to pay. I am sorry, but I will stick to my small taquerias para caldo y tortas. Gracias.",12/5/2011,3pUdEbIESlWXQKI38lH3HA,XGi1KAfq4YVNe_-PibSIEg,vvhfPV-Llkd4fE2SHuLVvA,N,3,1

39484,"Okay, so this was my 1st experience with Korean BBQ. Let me start out by saying the BBQ part was REALLY good. As for the rest, I'm not sure what to think. I understand that no one there speaks any English and cannot communicate the menu, and that's fine. However, I would really appreciate there was an explanation of BBQ on the menu. If that's too tacky or non traditional, some written material should be available on request, or at the very least, when a confused ignorant customer comes in like myself.  The woman that seated us had a very angry look in her eye that made me think I had just crashed a party. She took me to our table and our waitress. I asked the waitress what she recommended. Without hesitation, she fingered another waitress and all she could say was ""rib"" and ""chicken"" and ""good."" That sounded fine I thought.  They proceeded to throw 20 plates of food, the BBQ, BBQ setup, the appetizers, water, and drinks all at once and then left, never to return until they cleared the table.  I tried to ask the latino bus boy in Spanish what was going on, but he was just as clueless as I was. Maybe it was his 1st day.  I've had Korean cuisine but never the BBQ. I would have Korean BBQ again, but i did not think I had to research Korean BBQ before I went in. Silly me.

47871,"My experience at ZED was extremely mixed. I arrived at around 9:30 PM with a friend on Friday, July 3rd. We were meeting a group of other friends, who had arrived just 15 minutes earlier. We choose ZED because of the rooftop. Anyway, when we arrived, we were told the rooftop was full so we would have to put our names down and wait. It was weird because our friends, who were only 15 minutes ahead of us, were able to go right up. Because it became ""full"" so recently, I assumed we were on top of the wait-list and that we would be up shortly. Several groups of people left from upstairs during the time that we were waiting, but we were not allowed up. In fact, no one else that was waiting was either, so we got kind of suspicious. I almost felt as though it was trying to act ""exclusive"" and ""popular"" when it really wasn't. Anyway, after waiting for about 30-40 minutes, we were finally called to go upstairs. Once upstairs, our experience changed dramatically. We met some people who invited us to their table. We ordered bottles of champagne. The service was impeccable - the waiters were bringing us shots of Patron and various appetizers on the house. The food was great - I really liked the egg rolls and cheese fondue. The bread was amazing! The rooftop was also really nice, with a decent view of the surrounding buildings (it was not high enough for a great view of the city, but it was not bad). I recommend ZED, but have to say it was a bit pretentious. And be ready to spend $$.",10/11/2008,Fr2ZsCrlGG6GABnDXB7HZQ,O0aXKx-Xlc0kxiqWgyBngA,d6UbRb9W5eA1yL-DuVZ8ug,N,5,1

Thanks guys ------- I was really excited to try Irazu, because I've heard so many great things. The food was good - really good actually, but not excellent - the service wrecked the experience, and unfortunately the meal. All but one of our meals were cold, as evidently they had been made at different times and brought them out together. That was approximately 45 minutes after we put in a simple order for 4 people. 2 people got the wrong order but were too exhausted and hungry to argue - not that we could get anyone's attention for service. We had to ask for water, ask for our both of our bottles of wine to be opened. Add to that, dirty cups and silverware. SO disappointing. I love casual dining, and the spirit of this place.

47700,"This is only a review of their brunch.  First off, it's a bit pricey at $25 plus drink, plus tax and tip it'll easily hit around $35 per person, but this is one of the few places that is worth spending that much on brunch. Everything, and I mean everything was delicious. That is no small feat considering the number of dishes they bring to you and the vast array of choices available at the buffet area. Everything was obviously high quality, and they definitely take pride in their preparation.  The atmosphere for brunch is pretty laid back, and I really enjoyed it. It looks like a pretty hip place during the evenings, but I haven't been there for anything other than brunch. In fact, I'm not sure if I'd be hip enough to have dinner there.

I think my favorites here would have to be the horseradish baked clams, their famous crusted filet medallions, their halibut, barbecue and rib combo, and last but certainly not least, their key lime pies. Those things are to die for. no, honestly, TO DIE FOR. I've been here a couple of times just to pick up a pie to go. Their salads are pretty good too. I love the Wildfire Cobb salad, not healthy but definitely satisfying. Also, their mashed potatoes are extremely tasty.

6060,"4.5 stars Asking why you must come to Davanti Enoteca is like asking why you have to play that next level of Angry Birds....you just have to. Anyway the star of the night really was the marscapone polenta which had the best creamy texture and depth in flavor with the ragu of the night. (happened to be a mix of veal, beef, and sausage--slightly salty but forgiveable). The pizza with mushrooms/leeks/truffle oil was stellar and had real depth of flavor in the multiple cheeses! Yes of course I swoon at any mention of truffle oil.. but the combination of the braised leeks and mushrooms really was creative and well executed. The toast with egg/truffle oil/asparagus was a wonderful combination of texture crunchy toast, melty cheese, and runny egg.. but I'm not sure if I would order it again just b/c there are so many other things on the menu. Also the eggs come slightly undercooked/runny for those who are wary of such things. Also tried the cannoli sundae which was basically like a full sundae cup of the cannoli ricotta filling and chocolate chips with pieces of crushed fried cannoli shells. To be fair, I'm more of a marscapone cannoli type of girl. That said, I wasn't really very impressed with this dish at all and wouldn't order it again. Overall, the service was great.. Waiter was helpful and friendly. Although I hate when the service clears food before you are done and you are wistfully watching it gone gone gone away before you can stop them.  I find their wine list on that humongous wine bottle rather obnoxious...and heavy! Very reasonable priced paid about ~$25 per person without drinks.

40416,"OK I'm 95% sure I got the right La Pasadita for this review, which seems to be a constant source of confusion in these reviews. According to my detailed analysis, 37% of La Pasadita reviews are posted on the wrong location. Don't take that statistic too seriously though; also according to my analysis, Tina Fey and I are BFFs. Anyway, this is the biggest of the three Las Pasaditas (LPs from here on out) on the west side of the street, slightly to the south of the other one. You can get table service here if you decide to eat in. I got carry-out. The menu here is the most expansive of the three LPs. You can get tacos, tostadas, tortas, burritos, fajitas and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. This may also be the best location for us gringos. I haven't been to the one just north of here, but the one across the street can be a bit intimidating at times for someone as lily-white as me (even though I do speak a little Spanish). The service was OK. Not super friendly, but not mean...just a bit cool. It took awhile to get my food after I ordered, but not quite long enough to be too long. My order was completely accurate. I really enjoyed my chicken torta. It was messy and tough to eat, but there was a generous amount of flavorful chicken on it and they didn't skimp on the other toppings. My steak taco (with only onions and cilantro, the default taco toppings at all LPs) was also good. Finally, my horchata was delicious. I think the prices here are quite fair for what you get. The torta was 3-something, and it was very big. I got a torta, a taco and a regular horchata for under $8 and it was plenty to fill me up. If you're dining in, the place is nothing special. The seating is typical of what you'd see at a carryout-oriented taco joint. I'm not sure if you get free chips & salsa, as I haven't tried it.

13676,"I don't know if I'd call it a revolutionary realization, but people like good food paired with their pints. Craft beer brewed in house? Even better. And who doesn't love the quintessential neighborhood bar? Well, Revolution Brewing has all of the above elements. And even early evening on a Monday, people are flocking... not an empty table in the brewery, and only the sporadic, lone bar seat. The good news for us is that we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. I was prepared for bad acoustics as a few friends mentioned it was excessively loud. I say-- not so much at all! Our party of four was able to hold easy conversation without straining to talk or hear. We started with a few appetizers-- the bacon fat popcorn (tasty with TONS of thick bacon) and the steamed mussels. They offer two versions of the mussels: the classic style prepared with white ale, celery, shallot, and bay leaf; and the other prepared with hard cider, blue cheese, leeks and Fuji apple. Usually I'd go with v.1 as I order something similar at Hopleaf and admittedly, I get a bit skeeved out about cheese and seafood together. However, I really enjoyed their fresh take on this dish and if I was sitting closer, would've probably ate more than just a few. Boom! For my main, I ordered one of the evening's specials which was a pork belly sandwich. It was served on some type of soft multi-grain bread which I felt was an incorrect pairing. The pork belly is so rich and fatty and could have used more substantial armor. Though good, the threat of falling apart was always a possibility. Even better than the sandwich was the side I choose-- the cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes. So outrageously delicious that I could probably eat an entire wheelbarrow full of 'em. And after this meal, I could have been wheeled out in one, too! For dessert... they have a chocolate bread pudding that tempted but my beer had already filled the last of my stomach real estate. I ordered the Bottom Up Belgian Wit which was better than average but not mind-blowing. What I did covet was the Coup D'Etat (a dry and slightly spicy French-style saison). Next time, I'm all over this one. Cool, sparkling new space. Welcome to the 'hood, RBC!",3/30/2010,m-Sxx1KzRwQ3lySamVLlgg,MGPQVLsODMm9ZtYQW-g_OA,OKOfoisduqP24uK3WYvx7Q,N,4,1

Order a Bloody Mary with a huge piece of thick cut bacon, olives and celery in it, served in a glass rimmed in spices. Or, enjoy Mimosas, brought as a carafe of OJ and a bottle of bubbly in a wine bucket to your table. Follow that up with their thick-cut, maple soaked bacon. And it is maple-soaked. So if you don't like your bacon served slathered in a pool of maple syrup, then it may not be for you. Sugar is my hangover cure, though, so I love the stuff. The fried Wisconsin cheese curds are awesome. As are the nachos, served with guacamole, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, sour cream and an cheese bechamel. I like to add the skirt steak. Best nachos on Division. Hubby likes mac and cheese as his hangover cure, and they do it right here. You have your choice of what they will add to it. Hubby always gets his with chicken and bacon.

The servers are friendly. However, the bussers were so annoying! They were constantly at our table just to fill up our glass of water even if I only had taken one sip out of my water glass. If there was one crumb on the table someone would come and clear it away. It's nice to have an attentive waitstaff but this was seriously obnoxious. If I was not actively chewing on something a busser would come over and ask if he could take my plate even if I had only gotten my food ten minutes earlier. At one point in time 3 different people came to the table within two minutes to try to take away my plate! Two asked me if they could clear my plate and the third person just took it when I was not done! It was hard to have a conversation with the people I came to the restaurant with because we were constantly interrupted. We were not taking a long time to eat. We were only there for an hour and we went in the middle of the evening; not right before it closed.

Shaw's has been on my to do list for a while, and my business partner and I finalyl made it there this week. I could not have been more underwhelmed. A restaurant can not hang its hat simply on having a particular product. King crab legs are good, but they are good if I go get them at a high end grocery store and cook them myself. The price-point on the crab-legs was simply insane...and I have had a lot of $200-$300 per person dinners in my life. At the end of the day though, it's their place and they can price how they want.The crab cake that they served me (and charged $30 for) was one of the worst crab cakes I've had. It's a $5-10 crab cake at best. Lump crabmeat? Not a single piece. I'm from DC, and grew up on good crab cakes, and this thing was a mess of shredded meat and too much filling.

15650,"SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A STIFF DRINK THE HIDDEN DOOR Only steps away from a 7-11, a bank, and an Asian massage parlor stands a sign-less facade with a door handle and a yellow light bulb overhead. At first glance it's a bit gimmicky - manufactured exclusiveness. On second thought, it's pure genius. For this entrance is more than a door. It's a rabbit hole, the symbolic beginning of the Violet Hour experience, a portal meant to transport you away from the trains overhead and the text walkers below, a proscenium that separates two worlds...one where everything from cocktails to conversations are devoured quickly in Big Gulps and tweets...the other where time slows down, where the music is soft enough for people to talk and more importantly to LISTEN. Which is the stage and which is the audience? Which world is real and which is the farce? The calm within or the chaos outside? All things best pondered over... COCKTAILS A no cosmopolitan rule; I'm already in love. I had a fight with a bottle of Tanqueray nine years ago, and I figured if I was going to give gin another chance this was the place to do it. I go with the Indian Summer, a mix of Plymouth Gin, lime, lavender syrup, and house-made tonic. First sip... Hello hello... light bulbs flash, my eyes open wide...I pause. This is delicious. My first reflex is to drain my glass dry, but I stop. I pause. I savor. I reflect. I smile. And I notice my friends are doing the same. I end the night having had a wonderful conversation with old friends, expertly prepared cocktails, respectful and unhurried service, my world expanded to the wonders of gin, and perhaps a mandate to slow down and enjoy life more. I will indeed be back and I suggest you do the same. 5 perfect, gin-soaked stars.",10/20/2009,LV1obX5g-f7MxaQxCxl02g,xKD6xH0ga9KsMXDIwz2MCw,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,5,1

10779,"I always heard good things about this place, but when I walked by I always saw a sea of blue blazers and North Face fleece and was turned off right away. Now, I could complain about the death of the artistic side in Wicker Park, but people do that all the time. Someone has to shop, buy stuff, and work in Banking and what have you to purchase art, music, etc., so, this is all I am going to say. So why go in? Well, a friend of mine suggested it and promised me that I would love the pizza, and love the beer, and have a good time, so I went on a packed pre-Thanksgiving Monday night and realized that the crowd was a true mix of what Wicker Park is now rather than what it was in say 1993 (I lived here then and remember it). So, it truly is a neighborhood spot - serving the whole neighborhood. The corporate Big 10 graduate set as well as the (also probably Big 10 graduate) hipster, artist, writer, and what have you set. The beer: great stuff. We sampled the ""camel toe"" which packed a 9% punch and was a great beer (not just for the kick it packed). The other beers were well prepared. They do beer well here - very well. The pizza: We went for a white pizza with spinach and goat cheese. It was freaking amazing. We asked for it ""well done"" which they did, and in fact the kitchen guy brought out the pizza to ask us if it was the way we wanted it. How freaking cool is that? The verdict: Super place! While I am also a graduate of, gasp, two Big 10 schools, I must say that I have been guilty of judging a book by its cover. Sure, there is a frat boy and sorority girl sweetheart clientele here, but it is a nice crowd and the servers are professional, nice, have lots of body ink, and serve some amazing pizza and beer. They have a Sunday night special too - large pizza and a growler full of beer for, I think, $20 --- take out only.

The food was not to disappoint either To be honest it was the best Greek food I've ever had! I am in Chicago on business so I am dining alone, which makes me super attentive to nothing but the food, as there is no company to enjoy! In fact as I am writing this I am secretly trying to convince myself that I should come here one more time before I leave town :). I ordered cold lima beans, Greek salad which came with a fresh block of feta on top and a delicious virgin olive oil dressing and moussaka for the main course. The moussaka melts in your mouth and it had a nice thick yet buttery layer of potatoe on the bottom. It was also served with a piece of a piece of perfectly seasoned garlic potato baked in the oven.

42437,"Oh Tank, how you've changed after being on Check Please. I'm happy that you've become successful. However, I'm very disappointed that you've raised your prices, decreased your portions and no longer serve flavorful, AUTHENTIC Vietnamese dishes. Upon our last visit, we were surprised by the new, hip square plates and the newly revised menus. You've lost a lot of your Vietnamese regulars, but as long as you can get Vietnamese food newbies through your doors who wouldn't be able to tell the difference between pho broth that had been simmering for hours and broth made with boullion cubes, then more power to you. It doesn't bother us that you've compromised on your dishes to accomodate the Western palate, as we have so many other choices up and down Argyle and along Broadway. It's OK, we'll forgive you. In the meantime, you keep serving up your sub-par Vietnamese food so that as we walk past your window after a great meal at Le's Pho, we'll just entertain ourselves with the sight of all those poor souls you've managed to sucker into trying your lackluster food.",11/3/2009,b55HWgeHxmja4Ntt1SvJZw,nkwCULdFWcVKbSgVhQxG5g,ALwH81_sqskLmwfWS-_eeQ,N,4,1
57594,"A Chicago-must. It takes a few minutes for your eyes to adjust down here as the romantic candles and fondue burners are the only thing lighting the basement-like restaurant. With the Melting Pot as it's only major fondue competition in the city, Geja's offers a considerably more unique experience for special occasions.For those unsavvy about fondue dining- Geja's starts each meal with a small salad, and then has three different types of fondue- cheese (with apples and bread to dip) to start, oil for the main course, and chocolate for dessert. Though Melting Pot offers a few more variables (particularly with the dessert options) you still cant go wrong with Geja's, it's less expensive without a drop in quality, and an infinitely better dining experience.Factor in more time (3 or more hours) for a meal that involves the patron in the cooking process. (Apparently, some people don't like the idea of having to cook your own food.) I think it's fun- part of the experience.Geja's has top-notch service, an extensive wine list, and usually a live guitarist playing (non-obtrusively) in the background. Look for nightly specials and local coupons that help bring down the cost, which for what you're getting, is still fairly reasonable.Make it a point to try Geja's if you haven't already. It's on a very short list of my favorite restaurants in the city.",12/18/2009,dtZnWl5T0ClET6bl005Rlw,NOsJ2jYJyLjkkc9IiGvXsQ,_UJ3KqtHIHjExbAg-iIGUA,Y,5,0
58753,"I was here Friday with a friend because of GE's reputation as a quality place at a reasonable price. I'd have to say it didn't exceed or underperform my expectations, but met them. The music was louder than I expected. I know GE billed itself as fine dining but without the haughtiness, but I thought the music was a bit too loud as I felt I needed to speak loudly so my table partner could hear me. However, I did enjoy the atmosphere and the lack of tablecloth was nice for such a place. The waiter tried to sell me way too hard on buying their specialty drinks, as I must have turned him down 3 or 4 times. Sometimes a man just wants a Coke, mmkay? Popcorn was brought out before the entree and I found it to be quite good. The popcorn flavor rotates and we were given the ranch style. Can't speak to the other styles of course. For the entree, I ordered the salmon which was presented very impressively on the plate. I would highly recommend the dish. I normally hate beets, but I even enjoyed these as they had just the right amount of flavor and taste to compliment the other food on the plate. Everything was paired intelligently.I had the Molten Chocolate cake for desert which was even better than the entree. Caramel was added to the side as well as a small ""glass"" filled with a milk shake. Better experienced firsthand than described. Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Graham Elliott but did not come away wowed or disappointed. If you're looking to find a quality establishment at a reasonable price, than GE is definitely for you. If price is not an issue, then the more expensive staples (such as Alinea or Moto) are a better option.",7/29/2009,nqlbIdSPbpIdVmA7z9j8gQ,Mnfs6Y88rkrkqi1ESedNzQ,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A,Y,4,0

The food is also great; can't beat a bucket full of mussels and a duck reuben. I was a little too timid to try the pb&j with cheese on it, but maybe next time. I see some complaints about the atmosphere and busyness as I scroll down, and having only been there once, I won't try to refute it all, but when I went it was sunday night after lollapalooza and the wait wasn't bad at all, especially considering there was another bar/burger joint that we couldn't get into at all.

6899,"Yummy, yummy in my tummy! This place was so good! Not to mention they have the most delicious, crisp Sauvignon Blanc I have tasted to date. I love my white wine! I felt like I was in cape cod while sitting in the dining room, it doesnt really resemble a BBQ joint, but no complaints here I liked the decor. For the food, we started off with the hush puppies, obviously, and they were so stinkin good. I usually dont like hush puppies, but then again, I've never had them with Jalapenos and Cheddar and that delicious dipping sauce. I ate 2.5 of those puppies! Seriously good. For my main, I had the Smoked Salmon and beet salad. The salad was soo fresh tasting. They diced it up for you, so that was nice, and the beets were sliced very thinly. They had the nerve to ask if the maple dressing would be ok, are you kidding, of course it will be! I also tried, the pulled brisket and that was seriously out of this world...especially with that spicy BBQ dipping sauce. The pulled pork just might have pulled ahead of the brisket as it was just cooked so perfectly! It pretty much melted in my mouth. And, we obvi, couldnt pass up the Mac 'n Cheese, I just polished it off as my lunch and it was just as cheesy, crunchy and delicious as it was last night! How could I forget about the pickles until the end of my review!? Those pickles! I had them box them up for me, I dont care how cheap it looked, I couldnt stop eating them and I knew I would want more today! Good thinking on my part! If you havent been, definitely go! I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ, but this place definitely impressed. The service was top notch as well.

60411,"This used to be my favorite Pizza stop in Chicago. Working in the city, I recommend this Giordano's to everyone. Until now.The pizza is still fantastic, our server was nice. Not much personality, but nice. Management is horrible and an embarrassment to any organization. A friend from England had offered to buy lunch and after dinner he presented a traveller's check to the server. All seemed fine. She returned asking for identification. He gave it to her and she returned later saying that they were unable to take the check. We asked for the manager and we asked him why he would not take it. He smeared the reverse of the check which showed it to be valid and his answer was ""We can not take it because you are not from Illinois."" That was the only reason he would not take it. We tried to verify with him that Giordano's is not tourist friendly. He walked away. If I had not offered another form of payment, I wonder what he would have done.This is the shoddiest customer service I have come across is Chicago.

48832,"I have only ever had the pleasure of enjoying Sunday brunch here and it is so delightful that my friends and I have made it an almost weekly ritual to haul ass here after church and cross our fingers that they aren't out of anything! First thing we order: Publican mimosa is amazing - I never would have thought beer and orange juice would be so much better than a champagne mimosa! I even tried a ""beer-mosa"" at Cafe Centraal in Milwaukee for comparison and it came nowhere close to the Publican mimosa. The German beer that they pair with the orange juice is perfect. Second thing we ALWAYS order - fries w/fried eggs on top and the maple syrup braised Publican bacon. Those dishes alone make for a perfect meal but when there are at least four people fighting over every last morsel, you really should order an entree! I have tried the red-wine poached eggs, la quercia prosciutto (that is sliced fresh in house), sourdough & bearnaise - best kind of ""benedict""! The fried french toast I had once but a bit over-fried and kinda hard, but the warm apple compote and housemade maple sausage that accompanied it made the dish really stand out. My sister once ordered the ham & eggs and when the plate came we felt like the Flintstones! The hunk of ""ham steak' seriously reminded me of the ""brontosaurus burgers"" made popular in the opening credits of the show (that caused the car to tip over in the drive-thru). Last but not least - if you are lucky enough to get there before they run out, the cashew sticky buns are TO DIE FOR!

31861,"This is a super overdue review. That sentence is both assonant and truthful. I had been hoping to go back to Demera to confirm my initial impression from several months ago before reviewing but haven't gotten back. Life gets in the way of delicious foodstuffs sometimes.  Anyhoo, it was the Groupon for Demera that got me back on the Ethiopian wagon after an initial trial probably fifteen years ago. I was vegetarian at the time and my family went on what my dad would call ""an urban adventure"" down to Addis Abeba in Wrigleyville. For whatever reason, Ethiopian did not make a hugely positive impression on me. Fast forward to cashing in this Groupon. I found the glossary on the menu to be extremely helpful. Not only in terms of the dishes, but also the description of the injera. I think it might be the only man-made superfood: gluten-free iron and protein in a spongey pancake. Sign me up. Also, our waitress was helpful and put us all at ease in this brave new world of deliciousness.  Since the Groupon was for the whole shebang, we had an appetizer, vegetarian messob, dessert and a bottle of wine. They were out of the honey wine but the red we had was an excellent complement to the food. Our appetizer was the sambussa sampler, and wowsers, they were good. They definitely rock the boat if you're aiming for lower-fat eating (fried dumplings will do that) but sharing a couple is worth it. Three of us shared the messob for two (choosing everything but #27, 28, 31) and had plenty. Especially me. I ate a lot.  The prices without a Groupon are manageable and it's definitely possible to fill up without the appetizer/entree/dessert combination. It's also a shade more elegant than you might expect on the corner of Lawrence and Broadway (no offense to Green Mill or the ghost of Al Capone). I hope to visit and eat a lot again soon.",9/7/2011,SwNaRR5FgwQu622bv2-,0_FEaXlTnF8mVqa2SFTnig,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw,N,5,1

I also tried their signature eggs benedict and that was good, nice creamy holandaise, poached egg was a little rough around the edges but the yolk was perfectly runny. The canadian bacon was cut weird thicker on one side making for uneven salty to creamy to bread ratio in some areas. The english muffin was fresh and moist, that was a real plus. I was also disappointed when there was no mimosa or other breakfast cocktails, can't call yourself a proper brunch place.

14595,"I only left off the last star because the place could use a few more vegetarian-friendly options. However, what they do have is pretty terrific. I've been there twice already, and I knew then that I would come back many times, even if it is just to have the same thing over and over. I can safely say I've never had a tastier pretzel than the one I tried that first night at Revolution. You know it's not something that was ready-made to pop into the microwave, and the mustard was just as tangy and piquant as I like a good dipping mustard to be. Warm, soft, filling...yuuuuummmm!!! I also had the sweet potato cakes. The sauce that covers them tastes as authentic as any Indian masala sauce found in a Devon St. Indian restaurant, which was a totally on-point red curry cream sauce. The veggie chili wasn't spectacular, but it was still good and got its point across. The second visit is what really sold me on the place. This time, I chose the tempeh reuben, something that I've been wanting to try ever since I saw this one chick chomping on one the last time I was at Earwax Cafe. Holy moly! I'm going to start with the salad. You wouldn't expect a brewery to come out and give you a kick-ass salad, but they did. It was a large one, there was no iceberg lettuce in it, it was chock full of a variety of veggies, and it was just good. Good, good, goody-good, good! Now onto the sandwich. The sauerkraut was crisp and tangy with just the right amount of vinegary goodness that you want in a sauerkraut without the sogginess of the cabbage that you can usually expect. The pumpernickel bread was lightly toasted and the perfect companion to the rich flavors of the tempeh. The sandwich was so filling that I had to force myself to finish the whole thing, actually, that's not totally accurate. It was so tasty that I didn't want to stop eating it in spite of being more stuffed than a Christmas goose. I'm not even that big of a drinker these days, but I was also a fan of the drink called the ""Stray Bulliet,"" a drink made with Bulliet Bourbon, which I happen to be a fan of. It was a mixed drink that didn't sacrifice the taste of either the liquor or sweet stuff it was mixed with, which I think was a ginger and lemon simple syrup. Needless to say, this is definitely a new go-to spot for me. My stomach was immensely pleased. Staff is friendly and service is pretty good, especially considering the popularity of the establishment. Oh, and for those who'd say it's not revolutionary, take the time to read about who's behind the place, what their philosophy is, and how local so much of what we consume there is. They are the first restaurant that I've seen that supports one of our local distilleries, Koval, in addition to the local microbreweries in the area (Goose Island is a no-brainer) in addition to their own beer. Good food by good people who care about what we eat. They're getting more of my money, guilt-free.",11/3/2010,yNQhMFQnABQTUgdCf-UH2Q,joLEqnju2_MdR_zJAHaaLA,OKOfoisduqP24uK3WYvx7Q,N,4,1

So i cant get my bit of ""healthy"" on without paying extra for veggies or a potato?Huh?! Where do they do this?! At Grand Lux!

My husband had BBQ chicken which was good but it really tasted no diff than what he does on the grill at home. On another note: I was celebrating my bday in Chicago this weekend so my husband snuck and told them. Heads up: if you let the staff know it's someone's bday in your group they will bring a VERY thin toffee tasting thingy (which was good) that flakes and cracks up in your hand. It's a mess! Then there's two small decorative icing swirly things on the plate with a candle in one. I was so confused on what to do with it that we had to ask the waiter ""what do you do with this?""

311,"On a whim, I made a food field trip to Chicago, and I knew that I had to see what the buzz was all about regarding this restaurant. With my reservation set for a month in advance, I eagerly anticipated the discoveries of a lifetime on my dinner plate. Now that I've been through the tour at Alinea, I can truly say that food is more than just nourishment. It's a way of life that evokes feeling and emotion; to be more specific, true happiness! The experience began as I walked thru the large unmarked wood doors. A long hallway awaited me and mysteriously directed me to the sliding doors of the restaurant. The decor was sleek and very clean. I was greeted by the host and brought up the stairs to a nice corner table where the food experience of a lifetime was to occur. 26 courses and 4 hours later, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Some favorites of mine included a cauliflower puree dish, pumpkin and gruyere cheese custard served a bed of smoke, trout roe with tropical flavors, and a wagyu beef and mushroom dish with a maple infused sherry vinegar. I could go on and on with the food, but to conclude, dinner at Alinea is the experience of a lifetime!",10/28/2008,YMGG0oJwegNjEoXQqQ4nMg,lvydy9YebJr_qz3_helliw,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,N,5,1
52266,"We were trying to find the best deep dish pizza in chicago to compare to Giordano's which we had been to before - Everyone said Gino's East. We went early because we heard about the lines - but walked right in (No reservations taken) - staff was friendly as they seated us upstairs - quite entertaining to read the writing on the walls - which they encourage. we ordered beer as the rest of their beverage menu is obviously not attractive and of course had an appetizer while waiting for our pizza - which didn't seem that long of a wait- Since there was two of us - the waiter was very helpful to us for portion sizes. We had the famous cheese and sausage (patties instead of crumbles) and a small. The pizza had a good sauce but the crust came away from the ingredients - as you put it on your plate - which didn't send the message that it was fresh.....the crust was okay - and not chewy (if you like that kind of crust) - the sausage was good and there was mozarella underneath it all.....We each ate only one piece - didn't want to waste the calories on a second. My friend and I definitely thought we had better. Guess next time we will have to try Uno's....but right now, for deep dish, Giordano is at the top of the list. PS the calamari was good and crunchy - served with two sauces - marinara and cocktail - when we left at 7:30 - still no lines......hmmmm - sounds like people are going somewhere else?",9/2/2009,YMs2cOEGl,gOPm2yoe38_OM6x4NIwLEw,ibreTMGGaQSanZttUchjKg,N,5,1

Then we walked in and have been back about 6 times since. With all the other choices in Andersonville, that is sayng something. We've taken others there, they all agree it's pretty good stuff. Our favorite soup is the complimentary vegetable puree, which one can heat up depending on how much additional mystery paste is added. Then there are the entrees. We usually eat mid afternoon, so we usually order the savory crepes. My all time favorite is the house Icosium crepe, but the Chicago crepe is a solid runner up. Their apricot iced tea is really good, but sometimes a little weaker than others. The cucumber water is a refreshing touch and their hot drinks are usually served in these great oversized glass mugs which I just love. Decor is interesting and we usually can find a seat, all except for one Saturday around 2 pm. Prices are really reasonable, too, but the food is what we come back for.

Unfortunately the wine was not chilled so we were presented with glasses of champagne whilst the bottle was readied. Our bartender was fantastic, lively and set a great mood for the rest of the night by playing certain songs just for us.Once we were seated, Jeff did everything in his power to make our meal memorable.

42251,"Gilt Bar has all the major elements that make up an epic Girl's Night Out. Beautiful space. It's dark, very urban with wide wood tables, soft leather seating, vintage decor and gorgeous and elaborate chandeliers. On a date? The dim lighting will be sure to show off only your best assets. While we were upstairs in the dining room, we did take a peek into the lower level lounge. Dark, sultry and very sexy, this is the place to break out the Loubies and mingle with pretty people. Leave your puffy coats at home. Delicious cocktails. There is never a bad time for St. Germain cocktails! Sweet and bubbly, they go down a little too fast, which just adds to the fun! They also have an expansive wine list if you're in the mood for something a little more serious. Decadent, rich and sinful food. I'm somewhat relieved it took me this long to get to Gilt Bar. The menu features rustic bistro fare, all of which is very heavily loaded with butter. With six girls at our table, I was able to try a nice sampling of the menu. High points include: + Steak Tartare. This dish comes with super buttery toast, a garlic/mayonnaise butter spread, and tart gerkins. The portion size is quite large and is topped with a runny egg. + Garlic Toast. Warning. If you are on a date or planning on getting lucky, I would advise against this dish! A loaf of rustic bread sits in a pool of roasted garlic cloves in balsamic vinegar, olive oil and I'm sure... butter. Be careful, Vampires!! + Pear Salad. To be honest, I should have gotten the pear salad and stopped there!! The huge six once-ish portion of blue cheese was intense!! With delicate greens and sweet pears, it would have been just enough. Or maybe not... + Cod. Drowning in butter. Girls on a diet... you just can't win here. Just don't try!! + Bouchot mussels with white wine, shallots, herbs. While the mussels were very good, they weren't the best I've ever had. + Chocolate Pie. I'm not really in to super chocolatey desserts, but this dessert was like sex. It actually might be better.

59990,"My wife and I received the worst service we have ever experienced at any restaurant last night at Las Tablas. I seriously thought we were on candid camera and they were just trying to see how much we would take before we walked out or threw a glass at our waiter.We went to Las Tablas because we bought the groupon. We have been 3 or 4 times before and used to love this place at the old location and enjoyed the new location previously and had no issues and always loved the food.Last night started by a short wait, which was no surprise and just fine for a friday night. We sat at the bar. We sat there for 10-15 minutes and not once did the bartender ask if my wife or I would like a drink. I stared at the guy while he walked back and forth in front of us, washing glasses, serving a few other people, and never once making eye contact with me. There was not a large crowd at the bar, and at one point we were the ONLY TWO PEOPLE at the bar and still not a word or eye contact. My wife remarked how strange it was while we were still seated at the bar.We were then seated by the hostess in less than 15 minutes, which was great. but then we waited no less than 15 minutes before our waiter showed up at our table. At that point we had had plenty of time to choose drinks, appetizers, entrees, etc. We ordered everything including a glass of cab for myself. We again wait no less than 15 minutes before our waiter shows back up with my wife's drink but informs me that they have no cab, only merlot. At that point, I should have been 2 or 3 drinks into the evening so i said that would be fine.And I want to reiterate that though this was a friday night and we were using a groupom, the restaurant was not overly crowded and by the time we got our food the restaurant started clearing out and there were several empty tables, so this service was not a result of busy, just bad.Our appetizer and food comes out with no problem. The food was good as always. Then we wait....again. I had finished my first glass of wine between the appetizer and the entree and put my empty glass on the edge of the table so someone would get a hint. My glass sat there for the next HOUR until we left the restaurant. We did not see our waiter from the time he brought my drink to 30 minutes after we had finished our meal. After finishing our meal, with no sign of our waiter, we finally asked a bus boy for a take home bag. My wife got that back in a few minutes and it sat on the table in front of her for almost 30 minutes. I though that would be evidence enough, along with our cleared plates, empty water glasses, and still empty wine glass, that we were done and more than ready to get our check and get out of there. But no, we waited and waited until I finally spotted our waiter and flagged him down. With very little spoken if anything he brought the check to us. I put in the groupon along with my credit card into the bill fold. We again waited no less than 15 minutes before the check sitting half on, half off the edge of our table, with the credit card sticking out, was finally picked back up to be charged (I had to flag this guy down again). He takes the check and comes back 10-15 minutes later with a check for the entire meal, no discount for the groupon. Of course I have to flag this $@#% down again and tell him that he did not discount for the groupon. He says ""oh, you have a groupon?"" This just about blows my mind as the groupon printout is a letter sized page that sticks out a restaurant billfold. This is when I just started laughing because halfway through the experience it was already bad, and it just continued to get worse and worse. Anyway, the guy goes back to his register brings me back a receipt showing he refunded my card, but needs my card again to charge for the meak minus the groupon. done and done. We walked in at 8pm, and didn't walk out until after 10pm. We were ready to leave at 9pm. worst experience ever. ruined my friday night. It would have ruined my weekend, but I figured writing this lengthy review/story would give me closure. obviously, I'm done with Las Tablas.",8/17/2010,ow7X01LHSiNQf7H8AdheDg,kGAKRyVzrlXhmbUomKLbCA,2WoMT3wSpp9vxZeTv6u-cw,Y,5,0

I was so excited when I discovered Crisp since Koreans are known in Asia for their fried chicken but it's not common knowledge in this country yet. I have my brother to thank for introducing me. I started going to Crisp when it first opened and the owner was still working the counter. He truly listens to his customers because I asked him why he wasn't carrying Milkies (which happens to be one of my favourite Korean beverages). Soon after, it appeared in their beverage coolers. The others who have since joined the Crisp team are stellar and I've enjoyed getting to know them as well.I have taken a tour around their menu and I cannot get past the Seoul Sassy wings and the Buddha bowl aka bi bim bop. Every time I introduce a new friend to Crisp, they are delighted. One of my best friends from NYC came to visit me soon after I had moved here from the City and I brought him to Crisp. He said that he had tried a sauce similar when he was in Miami and has been searching for that same type of taste ever since. It was here in Chicago when he was able to do so again. This friend happens to be someone I have had hundreds of meals with and never a bad one; his high praise echoed my sentiments. I cannot say enough how much I love Crisp. Try this place.

The key differences between this location and the Morton Grove original are that the inside has been renovated in the last 20 years, the location is in a pretty happening part of town, and it is not located on block from Burt, who is the non Malnati godfather of Chicago Pizza. A combination of these three factors makes this location much more crowded than the original, and the burnt crust great pizza might have something to do with it as well.  It was Friday night and we had a party of 6, so it took about 40 mins to get a table, which is fine, since it gets super crowded. I think they do reservations but require a credit card or something, which makes sense. Dinner is always interesting eating with some people you don't know too well, especially when a couple of them want to order for the whole table. I was fine with it since my dietary needs were taken care of, but when one of them tried to order thin crust, we had to quietly explain what city we were in and things got back to normal. An added plus was one of the people does not eat crust, meaning I got double the burnt goodness!",11/30/2011,R-6DYKAYhstfQJS0gsfARQ,UT4P_cuEzJhk-AGj8NOwMQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,4,1
54134,"Had an amazing dinner here last night. Have always been a fan of Rick Bayless and glad I was finally able to eat at one of his restaurants. I had the suckling pig torta, guacamole and a churro topped off with a nice Goose Island Matilda. The pork in the torta was amazing. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. I can easily say that it was not only the best torta I've ever had, but it may have been some of the best tasting pork I have ever eaten. The habenero salsa that came with it was fiery and delicous.The guacamole had great flavor and was seasoned perfectly. A lot of times I find guac to be bland, but not here. Very flavorful and delicous. The service was great and the people working there were very knowledgeable about the food and friendly. We waited about 25 min for a table on a wed night at about 8PM. It was well worth the wait and we will definitely be back.",1/6/2012,HKsf7GtjGIKBet4JmJDuDQ,v9Gr3ds5J5vnUrGcLNypVg,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,Y,5,0
37874,"I was so excited on my recent trip to Chicago to try a famous stuffed pizza. Giordano's didn't disappoint! The pizza is very different than what you may be used to. It is more like a pie than a pizza. We were told the wait would be 45 minutes......but, we could pre-order our pizza so it would be ready when we were seated.  We had cocktails and an appetizer of fried calamari (really good!) while we waited for a seat.   The pizza is very different than what you may be used to. It is more like a pie than a pizza. We got one with peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni. The cheese was really good and really plentiful. Be careful not to order too much,as the pies are really filling.   I would have given 4 stars, if it weren't for the service. Our server wasn't rude, but he was hardly friendly. The cashier where we pre-ordered wasn't any better. A place that is surely brimming with tourists need to be friendlier and more inviting. There are a hundred different pizza places in Chicago.

28453,"I'm not in the restaurant industry. I've never worked in a kitchen, never waited tables. I have no idea what it takes to work a lunch or dinner service. However, I do love to eat out, lots of different types of places, and I understand that fine dining can get pricey, and plates tend to be on the smaller end. As Americans we're so accustomed to seeing big heaping servings of slop on our plate, when we're presented with something creative, beautiful and artisic, we can't appreciate it for what it is.  Until I spent a day in Chef's Bowles kitchen, I didn't understand how much goes into each and every plate on his menu. It's not just white fish, or pork, or spongecake. These plates have five, maybe six components that are all prepared separately and have all the chefs and line cooks working from 10 am in the morning til closing. These men and women come in everyday and prepare several sauces, foams, reductions, sabayons... the list goes on and on. And, even with such a busy place, each dish that comes out of the kitchen is beautiful, delicious and consistent. It's not just remarkable, it's frankly, misunderstood by people like me, until I saw it for myself. And then I see why these menu items are priced the way they are. Anyone who feels like they didn't get their money's worth should spend an hour or 2 in the kitchen with these incredibly talented chefs. You'll end up wanting to pay a bit more for your food, just in sincere apprecaition for what these people do day in, day out.",5/24/2010,-wQ8bBh154aJ,3BeWRRSZ8B8nwdL2eJ-uWQ,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A,N,4,1

I got the Icocium Crepe because it had a ton of things in it that I like: roasted peppers, fresh basil, goat cheese, caramelized onion, fresh roma tomatoes, pine nuts, roasted garlic and baby spinach.

56843,"I must say I was highly disappointed by this restaurant. After looking at the menu, I expectd a lot from my first experience there. The atmosphere, however, was not conducive for a pleasant dining atmosphere. It was extremely dark, so dark in fact that I could barely see the steps on the stairs and had to use my cell phone to read the menu. Furthermore, the place was noisy as heck like the New York Stock Exchange with less intelligent people. The woman was laughing hysterically and stomping on the floor at some lame joke. I attribute that perhaps to her drunkeness? Let's hope.The food was also disappointing. It was more vietnamese than French and I've eaten better food at a noodle shop in Chinatown. Everything was mediocre. My entre, the salmon with vermicelli was filled with too much lettuce and fillers without much actual noodles. The deserts were also mediocre. I've tasted better things at the local bakery. All in all, I wouldn't go back here. It was too overpriced and I believe only people who haven't experienced good vietnamese food would like this place.",8/1/2008,DDsq-vH5LrXXSpB1z9Clxw,GpxifYOMBwU9tBW0OtVzVA,5OtAmmypXvuTbkFBCziF_Q,Y,5,0

5469,"I was walking north on Michigan Ave. and feeling pretty peckish after a meeting last Sunday so I decided to settle for dinner at Bennigan's. Nothing against Bennigan's but it's generally not the first (or second or 30th) place that comes to mind when I think of fun and interesting places to eat. In other words, I was hungry and I was willing to settle for ""just okay"" food. I knew there was a Bennigan's nearby but I couldn't remember exactly where so out came the Google map app. on my phone. I searched ""Bennigan's"" and saw that I'd actually have to backtrack four blocks to get there. Forget THAT.  I passed Subway. Not in the mood. I passed some Chinese place. Meh. I passed Starbuck's. Bleah. And then I saw The Purple Pig. Here's the internal dialogue that took place in my mind: Me: Hm. Purple Pig? Me2: Meh. I *could* go there but it's probably ridiculously pretentious. Keep moving. Me: I'm really hungry. Oh! And other yelpers say it's a great place. I really should try it. Me2: *shrug* I guess. meh. So I walked in, saw that it was very busy and got a sinking feeling. I did NOT want to sit and wait an hour before I was served. I was immediately greeted by a host who informed me that they could find me a seat right away if I was comfortable trying out one of the ""communal"" tables. Now, I realise this won't be everyone's cup of tea but, after getting over the initial awkwardness of sitting next to people who aren't there to spend time with you, communal tables can actually be kind of cool. So I said ""sure!"" and was seated immediately. When I looked at the menu, my first reaction was, ""What was I thinking? Why did I come here? I'm in no mood for wine right now and I don't even like pork. This was a REALLY stupid idea."" I waffled for a while and seriously considered leaving. Everything on the menu has pork and/or (mostly ""and"") some sort of cheese. Their tag line is ""Cheese, Swine and Wine,"" so shame on me for not taking it literally. Here's the thing, though. I DIDN'T leave and, once my server, Katie The Rock Star showed up, everything got all better. Her name isn't Katie The Rock Star. At least, I don't think it is. But she was amazing so I've dubbed her accordingly. Anyway, after Katie The Rock Star explained the menu basics to me, I settled on the fried chorizo stuffed olives and the whipped feta with cucumbers.  I expected to wait a while for my food - the place was PACKED - but within moments, I had my stuffed olives.  At the risk of sounding like a walking foodie cliche, I have two words to describe my first dish: Flavour Explosion. Every bite was a ""wow"" moment. No kidding. It's not a huge dish but there's so much flavour, you don't *need* it to be huge. Just as I was finishing my olives, the whipped feta and cucumbers arrived with a plate of toasted bread. Holy shit, that feta was good. I'm kind of glad I was dining alone because, frankly, talking would have ruined the moment. I just wanted to close my eyes and enjoy the flavours. So I did. Amazing. After I'd finished savouring my foodgasm (yes, I said it. foodgasm), I started the people watching. It's a little tricky to do this without looking like some sort of freak when you're actually sharing a table with the strangers you're observing. However, the opportunity for a little conversation presented itself in a way that can really only happen when dining at a communal table. The party of three to my right were discussing European chocolate versus American chocolate. The female in the group gave me a subtle look when one of the men mentioned how much he loved a specific east coast chocolatier. It was subtle but it was enough of an invitation so, giving a sidelong glance of my own, I murmured just loudly enough, ""I really only enjoy European chocolate. Especially Belgian,"" and suddenly, I was a part of the conversation. Then, the couple to my left shyly asked me if I would please be willing to take their picture on their monstrously large freak-of-digital-nature camera. I happily obliged, though it took me three tries to get it right. See what I mean? Really, only communal dining can give you experiences like that. I get it. It's not for everyone. But I happen to love those little moments so it was a perfect dining experience for me. After the conversations wound down, Katie TRS returned to see how I felt about dessert. Oftentimes I'll take a pass on the dolci but I was in the mood so I chose a strawberry soft-serve ice cream in a brioche drizzled with balsamic. mmmmm.... delicious. And not so heavy that I thought I'd go into a food coma. It was the perfect ending to a lovely meal.

Tiramisu: perfectly rounded dusted with cocoa powder. Only downfall was that it wasn't very moist and I could not taste the rum-ness. But it was good nonetheless. The service was good.

48557,"I went here for Sunday brunch. Our friends really built it up as an amazing brunch experience, so I had lofty expectations going in. I had no idea what the restaurant was about and I wanted to keep it that way. Once I walked in and saw the giant pig-themed decor, I knew I was in for something special. The menu was small but intriguing. There were few interesting drink options. I went with the Publican ""Mimosa"", which uses a beer rather than champagne. It was a really nice change of pace and a great way to start off brunch. I ordered the sausage dish with a side of the honey-glazed bacon. I expected a giant portion, but was pleased to see that it was much more reasonable than expected. My biggest gripe about the experience would center around the service. Sitting at the cafeteria style communal table, we felt we were largely ignored by our waitress that focused more on the ""pen"" booths. We had to constantly flag her down to get some service and we also had issues when it was time for the bill. However, the coffee replenishing was top notch. Overall, the food was tasty and different enough from the standard brunch fare to warrant a visit. It's not TOO overpriced and the ambiance provides a unique experience.

I did not have any expectations because this a gathering to celebrate a special occasion and I was just along for the ride, but we had a party of 9 with a reservation. The place is extremely dark (what are they hiding?) and tight. They pack you in there and I seriously can't imagine they have not had any lawsuits with all the flames and oil flying around. The prices were outrageous. I find it amazing they charge $40 + for them to put the raw food in front of you so you can cook it yourself. They seem to pride themselves on the premium seafood and meat. It's too bad that it gets ruined by having to cook it in oil. And it's so damn dark that you can not see if your food is actually cooked or not! Nice effect. Beside the horrible seating (chairs look to have been taken from a bad banquet hall) and dingy setting, why overpriced food, we found the staff to be arrogant and nasty. We waited over 30 min. for half our party to be seated and they seemed to be fine with pushing us into the way too crowded bar where waitstaff seemed miffed to have to go around us. The bar - wine staff we dealt with was a real jerk to top it off. My brother dropped over $600 at this place and in the end we could have gone to so many other amazing places in Chicago at that price without having to cook our own food and come out smelling like we went to Bennihana!

39375,"So to start, how can you not like a restaurant that is open until 5am? Moving on.. if your not really sure what Korean BBQ is because you have never been before, it is exactly what the name says. It is Korean food, barbecued. Not just barbecued though, barbecued YOUR way. How is it your way? Well, when you sit down at your table, there is going to be a big empty spot in the middle of the table, and a ventilation duct over your head. As soon as you tell the waitress you want BBQ, a cart comes out with a flaming grill with charcoal bricks burning - or, if you are some place else, it could be a gas stove they have at your table. Once your food comes, you cook it yourself! You like your steak well done, then cook well done - yourself! You like it practically raw you can still give it a name - cook it (or warm it) yourself! On to the review: I have been to my fair share of Korean BBQ restaurants, and have had good experiences. However, this one is my standard go to. After a long night out, or a hard days work, a great way to treat yourself is by heading into San Soo. As with your traditional Korean restaurants, they bring you all the side dishes you could imagine. I mean, you have barely decided what you want to eat and already there are more little bowls on your table then you know what to do with. The only thing I have ever eaten here were the different varieties of BBQ meats from pork, chicken and steak. All very excellent and flavorful. The service here can vary. Sometimes they treat you like you are their best customer, other times they treat you like the red-headed step child. Either way, the food can usually make up for it. If have never tried Korean BBQ before, this would definitely be a great place to start. It would give you a pretty decent standard amongst other places. As well, if you plan on BBQing your own food, make sure you have someone with you, because you need to order at least 2 entrees to be able to BBQ at your table.",5/5/2011,RlT69q-7w01CHfD8XDe0JQ,dGND9DDQe5L6Lli2TolF1A,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,N,5,1

10148,"Our friend Lori LOVES Italian food - probably because she herself is part Italian and because she once lived in Italy, so I trust her instincts when it comes to taking us to Italian restaurants. I am happy to report that this one lives up to her - and our - expectations.  Pre-entree extravaganza: the bread basket was great and plentiful - and it is here that I will exclaim that this is hands down THE BEST focaccia that I have ever eaten. EVER. No tomatoes in or on it - just rosemary and perhaps some olive oil and garlic. It had a hint of sweetness to it which I had never experienced before. I am in love! Another thing I need to rave about right now is a side dish we ordered called caponata. OMG! I had no idea what this was and Lori explained that it is a Sicilian eggplant dish, a cooked vegetable salad made from chopped fried eggplant and celery seasoned with sweetened vinegar, and capers in a sweet sour sauce. This dish also had raisins in it and, while usually served cold, this version was served warm. TO DIE FOR! My friend ordered the insalata caprese which she loved. My partner devoured her insalata barbabietole comprised of local beets, shaved fennel, Imported buffalo ricotta, greens & citrus oil. I ordered the fried calamari served in a paper artichoke - perfectly prepared. Entrees: quattro formaggi ravioli (""Ravioli di ""Piccolo Sogno""); 2 orders of spaghetti nero ""frutti di mare"" (string cut black spaghetti, mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari with San Marzano tomatoes, green chilies); I ordered my favorite autumnal pasta - the exquisite cappellacci di zucca (spiced local pumpkin stuffed ravioli, brown butter, sage, walnuts), the leftovers of which I am looking forward to polishing off today for lunch. Oh joy! Desserts: I am a huge dessert fan but Italian desserts don't do a thing for me and nothing peaked my interest on their menu so I simply ordered the gelato which was very good (3 small scoops of choc chip, white choc, pistachio). My friends ordered the saffron panna cotta with caramel sauce and berries and pronounced it wonderful. Perfect cappuccinos. Ambiance: hip and happening environment with a beautiful antipasto table that screamed ""EAT ME."" The place was packed and thus really, really loud. Thank god we were in a side room in a corner with only a few other tables around us so we could attempt to hear each other. Service: good, although our nice waiter was swamped and didn't come to check on us with enough frequency. At least he had a number of busguy/table assts who checked on us. I do agree with a previous Yelp reviewer who mentioned a language barrier with the bus staff. This is true - when I passed a bus guy a plate to ask for some grated cheese for my partner, he immediately disappeared with the plate before I could ask him for the cheese. We laughed our butts off about it and simply got another plate when he returned a few moments later. Can't wait to go back! The caponata is calling my name....... Also - only $6 for valet parking.

8960,"I think the difference between 'Mediterreanean' and 'Persian' is the price. There are some differences in the cuisine but for the most part I think it's the same but Persian restaurants have higher quality ingredients. Think filet kabob instead of beef and you get the picture. Obviously, since I am a fan of it it's not too bad. Noon O Kabab has some pretty good selections, and I give it an A for effort since it does try to set itself apart from the other Mediterranean/Persian restuarants in the city and on this strip. I went with a friend of mine and split the hummus which was pretty good. A smooth consistency and a pretty tasty standout. I had the Fesenjan which is a pomegranate stew with chicken. I ordered it because it was something different....well like I said, A for effort. My friend went with a more traditional approach and got the steak and chicken kabob combination. I was much more pleased with that flavor. If it was a little on the pricey side, again you pay for the higher quality and it does show.

19189,"this is a great neighborhood place. the burgers are great, the beer selection is fantastic and constantly changing. it does get pretty busy on friday and saturday nights, but stop by during the week and you will find a great, relaxing place to hang out and enjoy good food and good beer. also, the staff is really friendly and great to hang out with. btw, they serve what is literally the best hamburger i have ever had in my entire life. i'm not exaggerating here. it's not their regular burger (although their regular burger is one of the best in chicago. get the slow burn. you won't be disappointed). rather it's a $26 dry aged prime rib something or another. it's only served on wednesdays and thursdays if they have any left over. i'm not usually one to go for fancy expensive burgers, but this one is worth every penny. i definitely won't hesitate to order it again. there really is no way to explain it other than to say it is burger perfection. other than the burgers, the salads, appetizers and sandwiches are good too. the poutine is fantastic. the only thing i wish they did have was desert. but i guess beer counts for that. if you're not a beer drinker, they keep a selction of great wine and great spirits as well. bad apple is one of my favorite places in chicago. check it out!",5/22/2010,ZQraWr1iocMEr-Mik5mE2A,sFc9-wdTlhPJZyjqq5ekVg,GEpXn9rtTMtIj5NsGFiNQw,N,5,1
4458,I miss a good week night excursion to the Green Mill where I could randomly stop in to see whomever might be on the stage. Most acts were decent and many-many more were outstanding. Now 10 years of living in the stodgey DC area and I've yet to find anything like the Green Mill. Musicians of Green Mill quality play the Kennedy Center or a pricey Georgetown snoot joint with a 2 drink minimum and a wildly over-the-top cover charge (read Blues Alley). Chicagoans... the Green Mill and every little divey music venue across your chilly city are your treasures to discover and enjoy.

47672,"ROOF DECK IS INCREDIBLE! Yes, I do believe that statement deserved capital letters.... In my humble opinion, I think it is worth skipping the prix fixe dinner (because really, who needs to eat) and making your meal out of the delicious drinks. There are many fruity drinks on the menu. By ""fruity"" I mean that there is a juicer at the bar and they fresh squeeze orange juice into the drinks! The drinks are refreshing and expensive (seems to be a likely combination in this town). The roof deck is amazing...wood benches, green grass, a beautiful bar, ample seating, great views, the list goes on.

57142,"I would give an A+ to the atmosphere and overall experience. The food was very good, but not good enough for the prices. I think presentation sometimes trumps flavor here. The quinotto tart with goat cheese and peanut sauce was interesting but lacked something. The ingredients were unexceptional, it seemed like something I could make at home. The potato pancake with quail egg appetizer was equally disappointing--it just tasted like mashed potatoes. And I've definitely had better churros. The highlight of the meal was actually a side of mac and cheese I ordered! It was creamy, more like fettucini alfredo, and coated with crispy breadcrumbs. Excellent sangria, too--not too sweet and with a hint of citrus. Probably the best sangria I've tasted. All in all, this place is worth a try, for certain menu items and the bright, cheery atmosphere--especially in the midst of a dreary Chicago winter. But I don't think I'd go back again, unless someone else was paying!",12/22/2008,YW-9xAGiAbsCP_4yES1_EA,p2b_XhigQHHosDYStWPphg,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg,Y,4,0
35109,"BF thinks I give out too many 5-star ratings, and I think he's right, because now I wish there was a 6-star rating to give to Shaw's. I've been jonesing for a crab cake from Shaw's so we headed up on a Sunday afternoon at half-time and parked ourselves at the Oyster Bar. I just absolutely love this place, and actually prefer it to the more formal dining area (which is lovely, but a totally different experience...also 5-star). The bartender was so attentive (not to mention gorgeous), and I proceeded to slam a microbrew (I forget which one it was, but it was something I've never had before). I ordered my crabcake and BF got oysters. If a restaurant can be judged by the bread they serve (as some say) I am sticking with my ""6-star"" rating, as the bread and butter were so flipping good. My crab cake arrived and it was exactly as I remembered, and BF's oysters were apparently fresh and delicious or whatever a good oyster is (I do not partake). Then he ordered clam chowder, which I proceeded to dip bread into. OMG was it ever good! I don't particularly love clam chowder normally, but I would totally order this next time. The service was so great that it's as if the kitchen had a camera on us in preparation to bring out the next item...perfectly timed and piping hot. BF got fish tacos, also excellent. I got the blueberry and peach cobbler...which I really didn't share with the BF as I think he was afraid he would lose a hand if he tried sampling it. It was the perfect Sunday afternoon.

Sure you could spice it up with rice, beans, veggies, and other good items. But, if you really just want a steak burrito, these guys have it down. I live across the street and the grill smoke wafts into my window and smells delicious constantly. It's kinda funny that there are three locations. all right next to each other.

The Marty Allen (formerly the Don Rickles) beef, pork and garlic sausage ($3.25) - nothing special. pass on for next time. Duck Fries ($3.50) - The fries were all right.

Geja's was by far the best fondue I have ever had. I have only ever been to the melting pot, and I liked Geja's way better. The main difference is the oil. Geja's has hot oil instead of broth. Broth is for soup as fas as I am concerned and doesn't do much for the food. Also, Geja's has some great dipping sauces that take thier food to next level.

61225,"I just realized that I've been coming here almost every week for 16 years. I don't know whether the chef is still the same, but their steak burrito is still affordable ($6), huge and very tasty as it's always been. My wife usually gets shrimp a la Veracruzana (about $12), which is great if you like them spicy.  This place has been renovated last year and has new, much better bathrooms. It's clean and has friendly staff, very fast service, and the waiters will never give you ""this is not my table"" crap, so if you ask any of them for anything you need, it will be there soon. Our favorite waitress is Astrid, very dedicated and polite, always smiling. You can often see cops eat there, which is a definite sign of tasty and affordable food.  The two hidden jewels: 1. Best flan in Chicago! It's not very cheap ($3.50 per piece), but it's real and it tastes just like my mother's used to, no instant junk, and no cheese cake. It gets that non-industrial consistency, being darker with some bubbles trapped close to the edges and on the bottom. This is real stuff, made of real eggs.2. Their frozen margarita is unsurpassed by any other I've ever tasted in Chicago, if you like them like me, which is strong and freezing cold.  My little secret is to go there during the off hours just before dinner when there's barely anybody there, because by then the margarita machine has cooled everything close to the freezing point. Only this way you can get a margarita that can cause frequent brain freezes if you're not careful, the one the sticks so you can almost eat it like an ice-cream with the straw. I don't see a reason to order any but their regular frozen margaritas with them being this good. Their house tequila (used in these) is supposedly made by the owner's brother in Mexico, so be careful, because these things are made strong and since they're so tasty, even one of them can fool you into a blissful dizziness if you consume it too quickly while your stomach is still empty. I usually drive there, so I limit myself to no more than one per visit and I sip it quite slowly.The free chips is good, but the quality varies, best being right after they fry a new batch. The home-made red salsa served with it is medium to quite spicy and very good.  Their horchata is too sweet for my and my wife's taste.Last, but not least, it's very affordable, so tip them well, because they work much harder for their money than the waiters at fancy places with less tables but much higher prices.",12/15/2010,u3liEB_ctY0PEkgKvu2d7Q,kTCrdj1ITMgh3-UM4SGytA,ibreTMGGaQSanZttUchjKg,Y,4,0

39524,"So, I live out in the 'burbs, but a couple times a month I try to head into the city to go out to eat with a foodie buddy of mine. This time though, we didn't even meet up til almost 10, so we knew our food choices would be limited to bars. After a short perusal of this site, we settled on Longman & Eagle - but we did not ""settle"" on quality of food. It was without a doubt the best food I've had in a hipster bar/pub ever. I think the experience would have been even better for me if my drink tastes didn't run (in the words of my friend) ""from the girly to the super girly"" since this place had a bourbon selection that made my friend swoon (85ish). The Great: What we ordered: 3 drinks, the welsh rarebit (that crispy soft pretzel was AMAZING) - bar snack, ricotta gnudi - small plate, tete du cuchon - small plate, pork shoulder - entree, and flank steak - entree. This perfectly rare specimen of steak was mine, and I cleaned my plate. Even with a morel jus (I'm not a mushroom fan) and creamed ramps (the closest I get to dark greens is spinach dip). The Good: All of the above for $125 (including tax and tip). The Less than Good: The one, singular complaint I have about the food is that my steak was a little over-salted - not to the point where it wasn't yummy, but the salt made it taste less steaky and probably not as delicious as it could have been.",1/25/2011,hC6OywSq9iZBYBwxs6xc7w,vr1zoqw_2TyFh94dyZ-Ecg,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,N,4,1

It's a for-sure deal whenever anyone comes into town because I know they won't be disappointed. As a Vegan, watch out for not-mentioned-on-menu fish eggs hiding in things that sound legit (like the seaweed salad), but they're always more than willing to take it off, just need to be told :)",4/2/2011,pL9pcyAYQywOKq7Jnx86JA,_YUgnPWb7F1qGxTRW4zoEQ,tCkwBTuEFvhuaBoEUWqbuQ,N,5,1
56146,"I tried this place twice over the last three weeks. The first time, I really liked it. Our waitress was really sweet and crepes were flavorful. So, on our second visit there, we took a friend with us--wasn't impressed at all. The place was crowded and the seats were badly arranged-while the booths that sit 4 were all occupied by couples, they made us squeeze on a two top, which wasn't enjoyable. After a long wait, we got our food--though the ingredients were definitely flavorful, my crepe was cold, and the soup bowl that came with it was 1/3 empty! I also didn't like the fact that they charged $1.00 extra for the bread, and $1.50 for the olive oil to dip. Keeping the prices of the menu items reasonably affordable and then charging for those small things that should be complimentary is just not right. Our waitress was very sweet but wasn't really so helpful when it came to making up for the kitchen's mistakes, and I don't like being served by wait staff who wear sweaters with soup stains and salad dressing on them.",7/7/2011,BzeYw--xVKc459K7woU2dA,8gQKJDkOo4aQqIXkNnYk3g,Rlg07N7Sl1qTzjc7zc6Whg,Y,1,0

56678,"Italian cuisine, although delicious, normally strikes me as somewhat routine in comparison to the other great offerings in Chicago (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Lebanese, Swedish, etc.) BUT Sapori is marvelous. Not only is the food excellent, but the staff is attentive, helpful, and courteous. Anthony, the owner is lovely and warm, the epitome of the gracious host. Last night was my first (though definitely not my last) visit to Sapori and we opted for the family style servings. You can select 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 3 pastas/entrees, and 1 dessert from this menu. I loved everything I tried. The Risotto al Funghi was buttery and flavorful with delicious mushrooms. We also tried a Squash/Pumpkin dish that was seasoned perfectly. The Caprese salad - always a winner, and Brushetta for starters. Tiramisu for dessert - these three are pretty standard Italian fare and not really my cup of tea in a place other than Sapori. Bottom line: awesome dinner! Plus we have leftovers that will be enjoyed today for lunch and dinner.",2/19/2010,a1B_u7WIp0CT_BF0Pq1CGg,pWkU6ZSwMQFrmUxHWTyK_g,LYppbvgJlBG0SqjSKFiFGg,Y,5,0
59855,"I am an avid foodie and can say I have eaten at most of the cities steak houses and have yet to find a place that has it all, like Kinzie. From the minute you walk in the door until the minute you leave, you feel like you have hit all the reasons one goes out to eat. Service is exceptional, there is not a moment that you feel over attended nor unattended. The food is prepared exactly the way you like, whether it is the temperature of the steaks or asking for little to no oil in cooking your fish. The risotto is as good as you get in Italy. As for the desserts, they are to die for, especially the buttered rum cheesecake and the flour less chocolate cake.

40280,"The thing I love about gastropubs, is the fact that you can dress as yourself and still get a chance to have a great selection of alcoholic beverages, delicious food, and great service. I've been hearing a lot about this place, so I was super hyped to go. The outside of the building doesn't have much for advertising, just a plain black and gray facade (which isn't very inviting). The interior was a little drab, until I started to realize the concept of what they were going for when my server, Cortland (what an adorable name and very fitting for a young Kurt Cobain look alike) approached the table in a blue, plaid, shirt and black jeans. As I looked around the room, I noticed that each server had on similar attire in their own unique way, kinda back of the woods, outdoorsy. Cortland was one of the best servers I have encountered in awhile. He was warm and incredibly knowledgeable in both food and drink. He knew every detailed description to each menu item and was able to pair it well with a suggested beverage. I ordered the Smoked Sweetbreads with piquillo peppers, olives, and fava beans and the Tete de Cochon with fried quail egg and Asian mustard-five spice sauce. My friend had the Pear Salad and the Roasted Cauliflower and Lentils. This chef knows his shit. He has a superb palate and knows how to pair his ingredients well in order to hit the perfect salt, sweet, sour, bitter, crunchy, soft, combination. It was the perfect balance and the preparation, seasonings, and execution were spot-on. Plate presentations were concise. I was very impressed. Unfortunately, the only downfall was dessert. We shared the Poached Apple with bacon ice cream, and langues de chat. The bacon ice cream was horrific. It tasted like they added liquid smoke to the anglaise and the smokiness took over, not a great way to end a memorable meal.  Lucky for them, the food prior was so good that they still get five stars in my book and I will definitely return!",1/23/2012,p1wdbDX0jRd1AK6tAn5QKg,ah-HoVU-QKku_K_FJ_Ly3w,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,N,5,1
33034,"Just returned from our second visit to Yoke at 355 E Ohio Street (corner of Grand & McClurg) and I must say that we're very happy with this find! Each of us had the Dublin Pot Roast sandwich which was rich, flavorful and grilled light and crispy. While enjoying the sandwich, I was thinking that a ramekin of the mushroom cabernet sauce for dipping might be nice, and then who should appear but our friendly server! It was almost spooky! Okay not really... Now, I was expecting the sauce to be gravy-esque tinged with red and bits of mushroom, but it turned out to be more like a French-dip au jus - still nice to have, though. Choice of fries, onion chips, fruit or slaw and for me when fried onion is available, nothing else has a chance! It's a good thing nobody is checking my cholesterol anytime soon! The dining area is airy and open but, acoustically ""live"", so it was a little loud. Overall the service was efficient and friendly and the menu is extensive. On our last visit, I had the Black and Blue Steak Caesar Salad which I remember as just great. So we'll have to return real soon!

Didn't they know that better exists? Oh but they do and its called Pequods. And it is AMAZING! It is light and crunchy and the caramelized crust is heaven. I ordered a small thin crust for myself because I was so afraid of the deep dish. But alas all I did was eat deep dish because it was like a drug. Eat here, love it.

The waiter and bartender took really good care of us, and as the gift certificate stipulated, we got a three course chef's brunch. The goat cheese and balck pepper biscuit was very tasty, the eggs benedict with popovers was great, and the dessert was amazing. The chef sent out one of each of four desserts, and we coulnd't decide which was our favorite, the bread pudding or the red velvet cake.My girlfriends kept thanking me for inviting them to this wonderful experience, esp each time the waiter brought us another drink.

15492,"This is a pretty big step up for me. I'm pretty much satisfied with a draft pint of Fat Tire and watching a televised sporting event involving two teams I don't care about from a shaky bar stool. I'm not a sucker for ambiance at all, but when a place makes a modest effort to give itself a swanky 1960s look, I'll bite. It's the closet thing I can get to proper time travel since Home Depot doesn't carry the flux capacitor I need for the time machine I built out of spare telephone parts and my old Castle Grayskull. You're not just going to see a couple of Andy Warhol posters and listen to The Beatles here. Aside from the subtle hints of looking like a set on Mad Men, it's a very relaxing atmosphere. It's very dimly lit so nobody can notice your blemishes or any remnants of that facial tattoo you got after that ""anything but clothes"" party your freshman year. The chairs are probably the most comfortable things to sit on without having to pay a membership fee or overstay your welcome at The Sharper Image. Between the lighting, the seats and the potent cocktails, you might have to make a pretty good effort to not fall asleep. Drinks are $12 each unless otherwise noted. It sounds overpriced, but a lot of time and effort is put into them, and they follow their recipes to the last milliliter. Once you taste their Old Fashioned, you'll know where those extra few dollars went. The term ""half assed"" is not tossed around freely at Violet Hour. This is a great place to bring a date or a friend, but also not a bad place to drop in by yourself and sit at the bar. The bar men are very friendly and more than willing to talk to you while they mix your drink. One thing they won't take kindly to is phone talking. They have a pretty strict policy against them. Just turn your phone off and relax for an hour or two.",2/17/2011,mx1oSS36IJhQszJ8,U1u3Ym_wClJix2nmSMPoDg,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,4,1
5879,"Thank you Steve M. for such a fantastic recommendation!!! We almost didn't go here. Considering we only had one night in Chicago and had already eaten a whole pizza and had our very first White Castle experience, we really didn't need to be eating dinner. But you only live once my fellow gluttons, so to Wildfire we went. I like it here. A lot. Our waiter Marcos was SUPERB. Super super nice. Didn't flinch when we decided to share a meal. Had a thick accent I couldn't understand. Most of his teeth were capped in shiny gold. Love that. My man started with wine flight #1 ($7.50!!! four glasses!!! I am so moving here.) and I went with the martini flight at an equally well priced $14.00. Ooooooooh, the martinis. This is how to do it, people. You get a standard Cosmo (crisp and perfect), a sour apple (yes, it's played out, but some things are cliche for a reason. like when they are deeee-licious), the ""wild raspberry"" (similar to a Cosmo, but sweeter, dangerous), and my favorite, ""The Stormy Night"". Right then and there, I decided this drink was going to be one of the signature cocktails at my wedding. Black Cherry vodka and watermelon Pucker are combined with a few other ingredients I can't remember, (I had just drank three martinis people, so sue me) which made for a lovely cloudy violet cocktail. Some might liken it to a Jolly Rancher, I'll just call it ""mommy juice"" even though I have no children he he. The drinks went great with a shrimp cocktail (shrimps a little overcooked but fine and a very good spicy cocktail sauce) and the filet sampler with parmesan, bleu cheese and horseradish crusts. I have to be honest, I'm not really feeling the ""crusts"". The only one you could really tell the flavor on was the horseradish and the whole thing just seemed unnecessary. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty but I think next time just a regular filet or sirloin for me. Got my man to eat creamed spinach, which is decadently evil. After his first bite he says, ""hmmm... it tastes like cheese"". Well duh honey! Any good steakhouse vegetable in no way shape or form resembles anything you'd find in your local produce section. Too good. The dessert trio put this meal over the top and completed the third trimester of my food baby gestation period. Love the ice cream sandwich, filled with Snickers-like cold creamy happiness. Chocolate peanut butter pie... no description necessary, this is an ""eye-closing"" dessert. As in, you have to close your eyes once you take a bite 'cause it's so amazing. The palate cleanser of the three was the key lime pie, oh your thick graham cracker crust I will long for you until we meet again my sweet. Hmmm, must fit in a wedding dress in six weeks. I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.",9/3/2009,ouiLBCSw6uBpzRCD8A-sGQ,iavmUodM9k0Ep5kW6Z02WA,CQ75CQSyrsmb-S3UAwCHpw,N,5,1

14907,"As a native New Jersey-an, I can honestly say that one of the things I miss most about the motherland is the Italian food.  Oh sure, you can get good Italian in Chicago. But there's just something about going to your neighborhood Italian joint.  The maitre'd is an old Italian guy in a tuxedo who will pinch your cheeks and give you a warm hug. Most of the recipes come from his wife, who has been cooking Italian food for her huge family for most of her life and can always be found in the kitchen. The servers and bartenders are their kids and grandkids. There's a guy playing Sinatra on the piano. It's loud and boisterous and fun.  I think Sabatino's is the closest thing I've found to this in Chicago. I took my folks there this past weekend for a belated father's day dinner. Now, my dad is a tough critic. He lived in Jersey for the first 37 years of his life, and we had to drag him to Chicago kicking and screaming. Every single place I've taken him that I think will remind him of home has been met with a big ol' meh from him. But not Sabatino's. It's about as authentic as you can get.  Onto the food. I was pretty surprised at how good everything was! You get lots of loaves of crusty bread on the table, and you also get a free order of delicious pizza bread. All of the entrees come with soup AND salad. The salad was nothing special, but the spinach egg drop soup I had was absolutely delicious. Between the 7 of us, we ran the gamut of entrees from pasta to fish to veal. And it was all really, really good.  (Side note: There's like 15 veal dishes on the menu. PETA would not like this place.)  Service was a bit slow, but all in all, we had a great time here. As we were walking out, there was even a guy on the piano playing some Sinatra. My dad actually had a little tear in his eye when we left - I think being in an environment like that reminded him of growing up with his dad in Jersey. I'm glad I could find something in Chicago that replicated that experience, and I'm sure we'll be back.",6/23/2008,tuxFdNk4jRYsVcUU5MQVCw,JKW0Rnul21GcIUTBdW-MaA,0-rkPnrTODt_veJ_nMVT_w,N,4,1

58251,"I recently had a chance to eat at The Pig, a new restaurant on the Mag Mile. Tucked off the street, the entrance found inside what looks like an office building, the sign boasts: Cheese, Swine, and Wine. The interior is small but well appointed, sporting large community tables and a marble bar overlooking the bustling open kitchen. I took a seat at the bar and proceeded to peruse the rather impressive menu. The menus sports categories for Antipasti, Fried Items, Entrees, Salads, Cheeses, Charcueterie, and an item they call Shmears. The wine list came in a small booklet, almost like a 3-ring binder, with pages that look like they could easily be replaced or updated, always a good sign in a place that professes to take wine seriously. I was quite hungry and ordered accordingly.Pork Liver Pate: served in a small dish with a nice serving of grilled bread. The flavor of the pate was amazing, rich and noticeably liver-y but without the often found over-irony quality of a lot of liver dishes. The texture was perfect, creamy, smooth, and actually melting a bit on the hot bread. Overall the best liver dish I have ever eaten.Pig's Tail: As soon as I saw this on the menu I had to try it, it isn't often I find a food at a restaurant that I have never tried in my life. The tails came in a cast-iron bowl and had shaved hard-boiled egg on top. They looked and smelled great and I was definitely curious to see how they tasted. I wasn't disappointed. Moist, falling off the bone, and wonderfully flavorful, they had a shard flavor of vinegar (probably from a marinade or braising) that cut the unctuous texture and flavor of the meat. A wonderfully surprising dish that I immediately wanted to tell friends about.Pig's Ear: I figured why not continue with parts of the pig I don't often get to sample! I had actually already heard about this dish from a friend who had eaten it, and was looking forward to it. It came out served in a medium bowl, the pigs ear was sliced thin and fried with peppers and fried sage was added as well. The whole thing was topped with a perfect fried egg. On the chef's recommendation I mixed the egg into the rest of the dish, spreading the yolk throughout. The first bite was pure delight, the textures were wonderful with the crispy bite of the ear and fried sage offset by the creamy yolk. The peppers in the dish added just the right amount of spice to the proceedings and it was seasoned so well that I quickly went to work devouring the whole dish. It was probably the single best dish I have eaten since moving to Chicago recently. For dessert I sampled some cheese and had a glass of sweet wine recommended by the bartender. The bill was shockingly small for the amount and quality of the food.I was wholly satisfied and actually started reading the menu again, planning what I might eat the next time I made it in to the restaurant. The dining room was abuzz with excited looking people and the overall vibe was very fun and friendly.

8183,"I once ate here every week. It wasn't by design or pre-meditated or anything. It was a natural inclination that wasn't meant to be suppressed, so for a month last summer, I hung out on the al fresco porch every Friday evening waiting for a patio seating. Each time I brought different friends for some real-life Yelping it forward. Because I love to chew, the Napolitan dough fit my masticulative habits perfectly. Thin yet with enough substance for slow oral savouring, the topping of fresh ingredients was a complement to the crust, rather than an American-style barrage of slathered meats and sloppy cheese. Any of the appetisers is a great way to start the meal and go ahead, get a pizza per person. It's completely possible to polish it off on your own, and if the Italians stay skinny doing just this, so will you. The tiramisu and tartufo are the two desserts we always get, as well as the Moretti La Rossa bierra. Because the pizzas take just 90 seconds to be baked in the oven shipped in from the shores of Naples, carryout is an extremely speedy process (just make sure you're steady enough to clear a glass of prosecco that proprietor Jonathan Goldsmith serves while you wait). But you better get home fast -- the intricacy of the pizza demands that it be eaten while freshly hot, or it will wilt, literally.",4/17/2007,28R0IP0zEd3UmtVssTKybA,3Hby0XniStF519qjv3IVIg,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,N,5,1

Great selection of beers too. The decor is warm, all dark wood, subway tiles, sleek but in a cosy way, and it was really comfy up at the bar. They're also very courteous to everyone regardless of whether they're in tourist-wear or business suit. I was so impressed I vowed to return soon. Fast forward one week and 3 other bars later, all serving a similar ""cucumber"" drink. NOT the same, cucumber juice is just not the same as mashed cucumber. Best at the Gage! So, dying for another Capone, I raced back today with my girlfriend in tow after another day at the museum. Picked outdoor seating, very pleasant, very friendly service. Very good food. We both started with the soup, a chilled bosc pear soup - heavenly. Just heavenly. I got the special - a corned beef sandwich on pumpernickel, which was excellent. My girlfriend got the brisket, which was a big open-faced sandwich piled with arugula. I didn't love it, but I think it was personal preference - I'm not hot on braised brisket to begin with. Girlfriend loved it, so there ya go. The clouds were starting to roll in, and a few drops were falling, so we skipped dessert, which I will absolutely remedy the next time I go. Very soon.

54069,"PAY WITH CASH ONLY. OR ELSE YOU RISK BEING STOLEN FROM!!!I just opened my Bank of America home page. I was just doing routine budgeting. But I discovered, to my dismay, that VIOLET HOUR STOLE $17 from my bank account!!! You may not think this is a lot, and it's not, but when does it feel good to be robbed???? Here's what happened. My total bill came to $43 dollars. I gave a tip of $7. I paid with my debit card. When I looked in my account, I had a $43 dollar charge followed by a $24 dollar charge. This happened to me once before several years ago and I vowed never to use a card to pay a restaurant. But at some point that wasn't worth the hassle. Then came Violet Hour!Yes the lines are long. Yes the food is only okay. The atmosphere is not necessarily worth the wait. All of that is okay because my girlfriend really wanted to go to a speakeasy and the drinks are amazing. BUT THEY STOLE MONEY FROM ME!! IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO YOU, USE CASH ONLY. I am writing this even before calling Bank of America. As you can tell, I'm very upset. But I don't think that I'm being over the top. Hopefully my warning will save you 17 bucks.

7030,"q was great!  came here for a 30th birthday party, and my friends rented a private room for saturday night. dinner was family-style, which was perfect because there were 15 of us and we didn't have to take all night to order. there were sweet pickles and cajun chips to start, already waiting out on the table. i'm a dill pickle fan, but the sweet pickles were pretty damn good anyway.  for starters, we had the hush puppies and the fried green tomatoes - both were really good, although i really like lillie's q's puppies better. our main meat came, and we had the chicken and the ribs. the ribs were FALL OFF THE BONE! the only ribs i've ever had that were fall of the bone were homemade by my brother-in-law, so i was really happy to see these were, too. the chicken was juicy and flavorful. the meats came with 4 different sauces on the side. our sides included mac & cheese, baked beans (with kobe beef), and cornbread. everything was really good. it was hard not not finish the plate. dessert was phenom, too. while everyone had the peanut butter brittle (im allergic), i had some sort of chocolate mousse pie with caramel and pretzels. it was amazing. the decor is super cute - old country, yet modern, homey, clean. i ordered the sauv blanc all night, but others had the mint julep (in sno-cone form) or pimm's. i am definitely going back!",1/9/2012,yyYRRNWo-xASq1NjuLL5oQ,2I7-sk24HJbZZQ2WoX4moA,euO3-H92LCivH2B0CQPlnw,N,4,1

Encased meat rules here where Mr. (Hot) Doug defied the city's foolish foie gras ban to make sure carnivores got what they deserved. This hot dog sit down joint with the oddest location imaginable - across from a electricity hub (think overhead wires) is the best place to taste what should be the future of the pup on the bun. I love the specials that give me the chance for tastes hard to otherwise imagine always with timely, relevant names. Fascinating posters and pictures on the walls that detail the history of the hot dog. Wish they took credit cards, but with Doug ""It's straight cash, homey.""

I didn't try any of the juices, but a brunchmate did, and it came out room temperature. I guess this is standard, but it seemed strange to me. This is a good breakfast place.

The diverse crowd is always fun and having been there over 10 times in the past year, I can say that the crowd is pretty consistently fun. A plus is the fact that even though it is in Logan Square, the hipster vibe has not taken over this place so it will survive all ironic movement currently sweeping other gastropubs. The service is really good for a bar/pub/restaurant and very friendly. I can't remember the name of our server during our most recent visit but he had a great vibe and knew his beers as well. Actually, he made the entire meal very fun and my out of town guest commented on how he wished more servers were like our server. Nice job!The food was really good for a pub and actually some of the items were really good for a restaurant! Yes, get the popcorn and you won't be disappointed except that the portion is a bit small so order 2 servings (trust me on this). You won't be disappointed as the menu has something for everyone. Love the burgers but I have had a lot of the menu and have loved it all. That is actually my favorite part of Revolution: every time I have gone there, I have tried a new beer or food item and have always been really pleased.

20183,"This was my first time to dinner in Buck Town and I loved it. What a great area to explore. We went to Coast to celebrate some friends' birthday and everything ran very smoothly. We had reservations at 7 and were seated immediately. The restaurant is divided between two long rooms and the decor is an Asian urban and is very tastefully done. The crowd is hip and more on the younger side. We were celebrating 30 something birthdays and were definitely on the older end. The ambiance is great in this place however at some points it was hard to distinguish between the wasabi and ginger because the lights were so low. The seating was great, comfortable and enough room for 6 of us at a corner booth in the front. The tables are close together but it wasn't a problem.  Our waitress was awesome, very attentive and made some very good suggestions in terms of someone in our party having a food allergy.  It was hard to hear her at times, like everyone was saying it can get pretty loud, so be prepared to be talking at a yelling level.  We order the sesame crusted scallops as an appetizer. To die for, I would highly recommend them. So good it took 3-4 bites to finish. We decided to order Sushimi and maki rolls. My favorites were the wasabi, dragon, and fatty white tuna. Everything was nicely presented however the maki was on the smaller side. Great for woman but they could of gone a little bigger for the price.  We brought champagne and wine. Our waitress immediately greeted us with glasses and offered to uncork the champagne. I am really diggin the BYOB. It cuts down on the cost and you can bring what you want. I think the pinot grigio we brought went well with the meal. The staff was very nice however I would tell them they need to relax on clearing the table. It felt like there was an arm in front clearing something every other minute. It was a little distracting and somewhat disruptive to the conversation. They did light a candle and place it on the dessert we ordered while we sang happy birthday.  Overall, I thought it was a great place. You're definitely paying for the scene but the food was delisch. We were well taken care of by the staff and our waitress even made recommendations for someone that had a food allergy. Sweet!  Pros: SCALLOPS, SCALLOPS, SCALLOPS  educated and helpful waitress, hip environment, reservations taken, BYOB no corkage fee is spent more than 15 a person (not hard to do), great presentation and ambiance Cons: The noise level, the one bathroom (??? so always a line)(that really surprised me they definitely skimped), the constant clearing of the table, no parking, no valet, must cab it or walk.",9/26/2011,3NLHW4TqOuTpmv0H7xc2jA,cyzGtY0BEElF5Yjcl-ogQg,vvhfPV-Llkd4fE2SHuLVvA,N,4,1

60955,"I was really excited to eat here this past Saturday night. My good friend is a teacher at Lasalle 2 Elementary school just down Division so we strolled down there later in the evening. At some point during the day my friend was given a coupon from Fifty50 saying ""We support our Teachers!"" and it said come in for 40% off your entire bill. There was no fine print, no explanations as to what the specifics were. So we showed up ready to enjoy. Looking over the menu, I was shocked by all the accolades this place had gotten and was ready to try some of the food. When we presented the coupon however, the waitress said it only applied to the person with the coupon, even though everyone at the table was a teacher, but didn't have their CPS id's. This wasn't printed on the coupon and we were thoroughly bummed. The wait staff was rude and indignant about us hoping for the deal, so we eventually just got up and left. We really didn't have a problem spending the money, but the way it was handled was awful and made us feel like beggers for even asking.

For dinner, I've heard that their fish is not fantastic, so I had their special butternut squash risotto which I tried my very best not to finish but apparently had to eat every last bite, and also sampled some other pastas which were all really good.  For dessert we tried the chocolate hazelnut cake (can't say there was any left of that) and the pannacotta, which isn't a favorite of mine.

It seemed to be difficult to keep everyone at the table between the bathroom stall crying sessions and phone calls to home outside the restaurant. This social/company side of this sacred meal was nothing like I had envisioned it when I originally chose q for our dinner stop, but the food was exquisitely predictable. My kobe beef sandwich was piled high with juicy, lean chunks of meat and left me wishing I wasn't from out of town so I could party the night away with a to-go box in hand. So, maybe we weren't able to salvage the remainder of the evening, but we were able to fill the tummies of a bbq-loving bunch with juicy meats and bloody Marys.

15030,"Love, love, love Violet Hour! The cocktails are phenomenal. I don't think I've ever had anything there that I haven't liked. Whenever I go, I always sit at the bar. This allows you talk to the bartender and learn more about how the drinks are made. These cocktails are like works of art, so it's incredibly interesting to watch how they're made. I never order off the menu. Instead, I talk to the bartender and let him know what types of spirits I enjoy, and he'll make something special that's out of this world.

58405,"I wasn't sure if I should believe all of the hype about Piccolo Sogno, but my experience on Friday night made me a believer. After a year of reading about the acclaimed patio, I couldn't imagine that I'd truly be stepping into paradise, but this urban oasis really made me feel like I was in an Italian garden. Our server, Jeff, was knowledgable, honest, and entertaining. He dubbed himself our tour guide for the evening and took us on a wonderful adventure of Italian cuisine. Each dish we tried was more delicious than the last. I loved that each pasta dish could be ordered in appetizer-sized portions, which allowed our group to sample more of the menu. Don't skip the Ravioli Piccolo Sogno. The appetizer-sized portion is four pieces of Ravioli, so you can definitely enjoy it and still have room for an entree. Everything about this experience was decadent, from the atmosphere to the food itself.

We asked for a bigger table but they said they're full, however five minutes later there are two girls came for drinks and they gave them 4-person table, HELLO? We are all customers here! Geez. Couple weeks later, I came back but this time I reserved table through open table and we had an enjoyable and delish dinner. Our server was really nice and attentive, which is why i added one star to this review. Food is great and seafood selections are fresh. I recommend their blue crab stuffed lobster and oyster rockefeller.

I thought that the prices were pretty high (comparable to other steak houses in the area I suppose) and I thought that the servings were a tad skimpy (again, comparing steak house to steak house). I did appreciate the fact that they had more on their menu than just steak, though I ended up getting the filet. The appetizers that we ordered were ok - again, nothing to write home about. If I am going to spend money on a good steak restaurant in Chicago, this won't be the one I choose next time. Oh well, you win some you lose some :).

13080,"2nd time at Texas de Brazil, but first time to this location in downtown (1st in Schaumburg).  It was a late Thursday dinner where we didn't arrive at restaurant until 9:00 PM and the restaurant closes at 10 PM.  I was worried that we would be missing out on the full selection coming in this late but we confirmed with the host, who told us everything would still be available.  We would have sat down at 8:45 but the valet attendant took FOREVER!  But I'll save that for parking company's review. First, I highly recommend joining their E-Club. They send you BOGO coupons or specials such as two for $69 for the salad bar, meats, and dessert, which is a bargain considering dessert is not usually included.  Tonight, we took advantage of the $69 for two.  I usually stay away from salad bar and go right for the meats. But, this time I tried a little of the lobster bisque, caprese salad, ahi tuna, and portobello mushrooms.  Lobster bisque is my favorite soup ever but was not impressed. Too much sherry? and no chunks of lobster and way too rich.  Loved the caprese salad. Ahi tuna needed more flavor and portobello mushrooms were a bit on the soggy side.  Now for the meats!  My favorite meats of the evening were the garlic parmesan pork, top sirloin, and flank steak.  Pork was cooked perfectly and not dry. Top sirloin and flank steak were so flavorful and a perfect medium rare.  I usually love the bacon wrapped filet mignon but the bacon was way too salty that I didn't enjoy the filet.  I don't usually eat mashed potatoes but loved how creamy the garlic mashed potatoes were.   Even though, we were there late, the service was still great. Our server Leah was always on top of things and always asked if we there any particular meat that we wanted to come back.  The manager even stopped by to check on us, which is always a big plus for me at any restaurant.   We had the creme brulee for dessert, which was amazing as always.  My suggestion for these churrascarias is to make the dessert portions smaller! All in all, a fantastic meal at Texas de Brazil with great service in a wonderful ambiance.",7/7/2010,HI4tz9XcUzsBu,-H1gpNCwggKzdHs8YgeHKQ,3Mx2PM7v8qjqhgF3cDXxbQ,N,4,1

Design wise, this might be the slickest place in Chicago. The ambiance alone is worth the trip.

58546,"This was my fourth and final visit to Spacca Napoli. Two visits ago, I was dining with a friend at a two-top. After our plates were cleared, Jonathan Goldsmith (the owner) came up to us and asked if we would mind moving to another table as he was trying to set up for a party of eight. He offered us each a grappa and apologized for the inconvenience. We obliged without question. Last night I was dining with 3 friends at a four-top. We had reservations and were seated promptly. After completing our meals (including dessert), our waiter offered us the check. At that time, we had been at our table for a little over an hour. In the middle of our conversation, Jonathan Goldsmith came to our table and asked if he could settle our bill, to which I replied, No, we haven't looked at it yet. Shortly there after, we put our credit cards in the jacket. Jonathan Goldsmith collected it and then returned it to us. Within 2 minutes of signing our credit card receipts, he returned to our table and asked if we would mind moving to the bar (where he would offer us grappa or a drink of our choice) because there were a lot people who were waiting to be seated. In protest, I told him that this was the second time in a month I had been asked to vacate my table at his restaurant and that I found it in poor taste to be asked to leave the dining room to make room for another party. Taking issue with my protest, he told me that he was sorry, but that he was trying to be nice and didn't want to make his other customers wait 1.5 hours to be seated. Frustrated, we left the restaurant.Sadly, Jonathan Goldsmith's behavior exemplifies what is experienced in American eateries across the country: namely, it isn't about making the customer feel welcome or encouraged to digest one's meal at the table on which it was served. It's about turning the tables and making sure that every last available dollar is taken in by the end of the night. Fortunately, I live in a city where there are a number of fantastic pizzerias and Italian restaurants where the owners and managers encourage you to enjoy your meal (Calos and Pizza D.O.C. being 2 perfect examples) in a relaxed, unhurried setting.",11/18/2008,ikFn3GhcJFVdN9wayjcAZw,ItumIPRUphRhJM40NU6-qw,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,Y,5,0
17437,"Absolutely one of the finest establishments in Chicago. Love the cocktails - lovingly handcrafted, tasty, and refined. I dream of being able to mix like the mixologists here. It is an oasis of excellence in a sea of mediocrity. One my first visit to VH I spent twenty minutes discussing the merits of several different types of bitters for a Manhattan (the drink by which I judge all others). How terrific is that? I've been to VH many times and always enjoy the experience. It is a place which requires attention to the cocktail and the conversation which will ensure with your companions. Perhaps I love it for the fact that you need to converse/discuss/interact with the people you are there with. The art of conversation is alive and well at the VH. But lets face it - they make an absolutely fantastic cocktail. And the cocktail remains the greatest civilizing force in the world. The room is wonderful, with most of the space being devoted to small, intimate tables with high backed chairs, making sure that your focus remains on your drinking partners, and not the scene around you. It's a place to converse, not to cruise. The seats at the bar are also terrific, as you can discuss/debate to merits of various drinks and ingredients with the knowledgeable staff. I remain in awe of the Zarzamora - combining both Bourbon and Fernet Branca - absolute genius! As one of the few Fernet Branca drinkers in Chicago (as far as I can tell) it was a revelation. In short - this is a wonderful place. It brings people together for conversation and sophisticated drinking. It is clearly a throwback and not for everyone. When I introduce friends to this place they are generally in awe, never having realized that this oasis of civility still exists in the modern day. Go, you will not be sorry (unless Hooters is your idea of a great drinking establishment).",12/14/2009,6Y1N0,J8mFTJfBBBaShBX1WV30hA,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,5,1

Unfortunately the weather wasn't nice enough to sit outside, which is first come first serve with or without reservations. Our reservations for 9 were at 7:30, again 3 months in advance and we called several times the week of to make sure it was still going to be okay. We didn't get seated until after 8 p.m. That behavior would never fly anywhere else in the city, and if it were to happen, most restaurants would at least comp dessert, an appetizer or one of our 3 cars that we had sitting out in valet. I would never wait that long to eat there again unless it was to enjoy a glass of wine on their patio; honestly the only reason we were going here. The food was good, as expected. It wasn't tapas but definitely smaller portions for an Italian restaurant. The wine menu was large but they didn't carry a Pinot Grigio, which I found odd for an Italian restaurant. I would go back, but not anytime soon. This place has been open for a while and it wasn't a weekend, they should have their act together by now.

After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I finally made it into the store and ordered two special dogs (the catalonian and the foie) and of course duck fat fries (they only have these on the weekends). Before I get to the good things, I've got to say that the duck fat fries were *very* disappointing. I'm not sure if it was a long day and we were just unfortunate enough to get stuck with fries from old fryer oil or what... But the fries were disappointing even if they were not fried in duck fat. Lacking flavor and a little bit on the soggy side, I probably wouldn't order these again. The Foie dog with the duck sausage was interesting. Hot Doug's definitely did not skimp on the amount of foie on the dog. I'd suggest eating this last as the foie can overwhelm your palate and have a tendency to stay in your mouth a little longer than you'd think. My favorite, by far, was the catalonian... Pork sausage with a saffron rouille... That combo was heavenly... Not only can you actually see threads of saffron in the rouille, it tasted sooooo good... I can probably eat the rouille by itself...

21261,"FAMOUS FOR: Superdawg (hot dog) (10/10) Hahahahah! I just surfed over to my Yelp profile page and it says ""Your next review awaits..."" and points to Superdawg, and I'm like...Wat? Of all the times I've been here, I never reviewed it? In disbelief, I went to my reviews and did a search for Superdawg and found that every hot dog joint I've ever reviewed...Superdawg was mentioned, and yet, I never actually reviewed the place! Whoa! THE BEST CHICAGO HOT DOG So, what's there left to say that hasn't been said yet? Your hot dog is served in a box, which reminds me of Animal Crackers for some reason. The hot dog is tucked away and the box is stuffed with crispy crinkle fries. The dog isn't a Vienna nor is it a Chicago Red Hot. It's its own thing. It's about the size of a Portillo's jumbo hot dog, but without Portillo's ""chlorine"" flavor (that everyone says I'm insane for saying). By the way, that ""chlorine"" flavor that only I seem to be able to taste is in Portillo's Jumbo hot dog only, not their regular sized one. In any case, it's your good ol' Chicago Hot Dog, with the dog, mustard, radioactive colored relish, celery salt, onions (blech! - I order without), pickle, and tomato...all on a flimsy bun. But the tomato isn't chopped red tomatoes, it's a small green pickled tomato. The reason I mention ""flimsy bun"" and also the reason why it doesn't lose points for it, is because I like the flimsy bun. Bread to me is simply the container that the hot dog rests in. It's necessary not only for that, but to help even out the intense salt in all that Superdawg, The problem is, a lot of places get it wrong, and the bun is too big or too intrusive. You get a nice hot dog flavor for awhile, and then the bun sorta takes over and cleans house. I don't like that. That's why I like Superdawg so much, because the bun does it's job (even out the intense salt) while not leaving much of a trace. The dog also is just incredible. I'm always amazed at the flavor of a Chicago Red Hot, given its size, but man, the Superdawg dog is just fabulous. The flavor is as intense as a Red Hot (even more so), and there's so much more of it! The only qualm is that sometimes, and it may actually be more of a mood thing than an actual Superdawg problem, the Superdawg can be a little too intense. Sometimes, the mustard, pickle, and pickled tomato sort of join forces, Power Rangers style, and it gets a little salty. Nothing that an ice cold Diet Coke or a few helping of fries can't fix, but if you have to do that, then what's the point? ALL IN ALL Even though it's probably the least Chicagoey of the famous Chicago Hot Dogs, this is my favorite Chicago Hot Dog! OH YEAH - CASH ONLY! - There is eat in, but just a tiny little area with counters and chairs. It's meant for you to eat in your car a-la Sonic.",7/6/2011,j8b9T3bDv8O2g,JjTusdmnjHxKe-Kqwr0YGA,FCcgXODBs6O7MGH3VZNyLQ,N,2,1

I shared crab fritters for an app and they were excellent, as were the sauces served alongside. For dinner I had the black bean cakes with both the mango salsa and the red pepper sauce, Yankee coleslaw (vinegary which I favor), cheese grits and green beans. I absolutely loved everything. The food was really flavorful, fresh and interesting. I also got the very reasonable flight of red wine for $7.95 which was unpretentious and good. I realize this place is totally batso crazy in the mornings and I think I'll just return for dinner. The whole place was dimly (with a big Christmas tree), fun but not loud and just delightful.

This was a new idea to me and ended up loving it. The fries and sandwich are served all together bunched up and yummy in my tummy.

15298,"I absolutely loved this place. Stylish but not pretentious, everyone is welcome as long as you follow their house rules.  We sat at the bar and marveled at all of the drinks being prepared. It was very difficult to decide what to try! I wound up having a 23 Skidoo and a Blackberry Caipirissima. (We were there before they switched to the Fall menu.). They were both in the rum section of the menu but couldn't have been more different. The Caiprissima, with Flor de Cana 4 year, blackberries, demerara syrup and Briottet Creme de Muir, is the kind of drink that's right up my alley. It was light and refreshing, a drink you'd be happy to sip on poolside. The 23 Skidoo had Zacapa 23, Ramazzotti Amaro, El Dorado 5 year, demarara syrup and Peychaud's bitters and was totally out of my comfort zone. It was strong and masculine, something I wouldn't ordinarily order. That's the nice thing about their menu: all of the cocktails are $12 so you can just pick whichever cocktail sounds good and have fun. Of course, if you don't want to take your chances, the staff is more than willing to discuss your likes and dislikes and make recommendations. I love the decor and the seating. It's a great place for a date or a small gathering of friends. It is quite dark inside with no windows which really adds to the atmosphere. It's like being in the casinos in Vegas...you can lose all sense of time! Sadly, our time at the Velvet Hour came to an end all too early due to dinner reservations. Rest assured next time we're in town we'll be back.",9/25/2011,s2mbKiKufkoAUiGpThQCew,9aF5Ns6-8QYwEl1rRJIacw,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,5,1
44105,"I popped my proverbial sushi cherry here thanks to the lovely Jackie P. I posed around town as a sushi connoisseur as I ate only California rolls. I was informed that it wasn't really sushi I was eating so I had to go and get the full experience. So I did at Wakamono and loved the Rainbow roll and some of the other items I got to try. I'm not posing any longer but I do have more to try! The place seems nice as I did like the layout. I also like that it is BYOB, even with the $5 cork fee ... If I were a lush then perhaps I would have a problem with that. It is a work in progress on being a lush - I'm sure a few more Yelp gatherings and I'll be there! So I was part of a small party so I didn't pay attention too much on the prices but they seem fair enough with the amount of sushi pieces that came out. It was a good group to be with and everyone seem pleased with their food.

33161,"One of my friends told me that she swore she once saw a bus on Elston Avenue some time back in the '70s, so I followed Sacramento Avenue up to its suicidal collision with the Nystrom building at Elston. I didn't see any bus signs, but wondered if maybe there was a secret off-the-schedule bus, or if CTA drivers still took occasional bribes for doorstep service like they sometimes did in the pre- GPS surveillance era. After waiting for hours with no sign of a bus, I became restless and hungry, so I followed Elston vaguely towards O'Hare. For those of you who don't know Elston, it is one of the few streets in Chicago that travel through both time AND space. That's why I wasn't completely surprised to have arrived, just past Addison, at a stained-glass caf in Bucharest circa 1930. Inside, a curly-haired Django Reinhardt was playing his guitar alongside a female Stephane Grapelli and some other rascal on guitar, gliding through standards like After You've Gone, Corcovado, and Misty before landing on an unrecognizable tune. Django scraped the strings lengthwise, Stephane moused her fiddle, Django plucked the strings between the saddle and the bridge, Stephane launched a small jet along the concourse of the strings. They smiled at each other, knowing the moment of spontaneous genius they had created. Branko, the owner, weaves his way through the dining area, checking on his customers.  Flames leap dramatically from plates of saganaki seemingly every fifteen minutes. $7 may sound like a lot for a plate of cheese, but with the fire and Branko's effervescence included in the deal, it's a steal. If the beer selection is noteworthy- Old No. 38, Barley Island Wheat Ale, South Hampton White, Peak Organic Amber- the wine selection may be more so. One specialty I didn't try was the Dracula's blood wine. There's good food here, too- I tried the whitefish but that's just the start of it. This could well be the best little world music venue in town right now. Other regular acts include a French accordion duo, Bossa Tres, a tango group, and a rumba group. I came here with a couple of guys... but now that I know the way the stained glass and orange light cast a warm glow on all around, I'm coming back with a woman. And maybe take credit for what Branko so tastefully created.",11/11/2010,etN0yyywrPucjDlTfWCxEg,GWc9xqw7afyp6AqcKesKhQ,Au1f1UMmKcgOXLsg4v56xw,N,3,1

We were all on the same page... you and I both knew that we didn't have a reservation. If you did think we actually had a reservation, you never would have approached us with such an attitude.

58781,"After hearing such raving and wonderful reviews about this place, I decided to finally go try it out last night. I had such high hopes when I walked into the place but left feeling a bit let down. First off, although the staff was cordial, I got the feeling I was literally being ""rushed"" out of the place. This could be attributed to the fact that I arrived about half an hour before closing; however, if they took me in as a customer and were going to take my money, they should treat me like any other customer. I ordered the recommended Tiger Cry beef for appetitizer and was disappointed. Although the menu said the beef was char-grilled, what I got was mostly burned, inedible pieces of beef that were bitter to the taste, spare a few pieces towards the middle of the pile. Next, came the potstickers. Two out of the five pieces were so hard that I couldn't even bite into it. I had to use my chopsticks to literally pry it open just so I can get to the pork inside and toss the dumpling skin aside. The only thing I was totally impressed was was their yum woon sen (noodle and chicken salad). It's one of the best I've had and is probably their saving grace. The only complaint I have about this dish is the fact that they used mainly ground chicken instead of actual chicken strips, which most other Thai restaurants use in their yum woon sen. Their Kee Mao noodles was just alright. I've had better but there really wasn't anything too special about it. The plate was a bit small and was filled more with veggies than chicken or noodles. Also the fact that I got ALL 4 dishes at once practically made me feel as if they wanted me to leave asap, because by the time I got to my main dish (the Kee Mao noodles), it was starting to get cold already (it was the 2nd dish to arrive out of all the plates).Overall, I was unimpressed by the restaurant. I don't know if I'll be dining there anytime again soon. Hopefully I'll just chart this down to being there as their last customer.

56177,"I am a frequent patron of Icosium Kafe. It goes without saying that the food is fantastic - read any of the other reviews to confirm that (my favorite is the Chicago crepe- and the vegetable soup is the best I've ever tasted). But what really keeps me coming back to this restaurant time and time again is the service. The staff is small, so over time the faces become familiar, and I am immediately greeted when I come into the restaurant. I feel like I'm eating with family.So imagine my surprise on Saturday morning when my meal was interrupted with shouting and swearing. I looked up to see what I assume was a manager, feet away from my table and in plain view of the entire restaurant, yelling in my server and swearing at her. He was accusing her of neglecting her tables. I can't speak for all her tables, and I obviously don't have all the information, but I can attest that she provided my table with impeccable, friendly service. Even if she had been neglecting tables, it was completely inappropriate for him to yell at her and use such strong language (I am not exaggerating when I say that he used the f-word over a dozen times), especially in front of her guests. It was infuriating. Thankfully I know that such behavior is not typical of Icosium, but I would be shocked if any first-timers in the restaurant that day ever returned. Who wants to eat at a restaurant where the servers are verbally abused?I don't mean to take up so much space detailing this event.

59941,"We live in Wicker Park and are long time patrons of the Alliance Bakery, but we recently had a bad experience with those amazing looking cakes in the window. Since I was completing graduate school, we decided to order something special for family that would be in town for the celebration. There was an awesome cake in the window that looked like a giant cheeseburger. Inspired, we decided to get one that looked like a deep-dish pizza. When I ordered the cake, it was much more expensive than originally quoted...over $160 for a cake that fed eight. When I picked the cake up, it was the size and dimensions of a regular cake, NOT of a deep-dish pizza, the frosting was pink instead of red like a marinara, with just a few fondant pepperonis and (gray) mushrooms. My expectations had been set by their impressive display window, and even the Alliance baker who heard my complaint agreed that he would also have been disappointed. The only offer made at that point was to add a few more pepperonis and mushrooms. Not only was my entire party very disappointed in the cake's appearance, the amount of money we spent was far beyond our budget, which made the disappointing product smart all the more. The cake itself was delicious, but the experience was a bad one that left us sad. We wanted to be happy, satisfied customers. We wanted a realistic looking cake like the ones their window display advertises. The Alliance neither delivered nor offered any recompense. We expected much more from them.",9/19/2008,TIpEO9zBPC4maWcsRAkdhQ,BE2UhQ-dW5jHxxjANM1ZxQ,xjZ9eqYrzMrl2v6_1Kv6hA,Y,5,0
5610,"Stopped by The Purple Pig for dinner while in town for a concert. Since my stomach eats on Eastern time zone, I arrived before the big dinner rush and was able to get seated quickly. We ordered 5 items from the menu per the server's friendly suggestion. My first complaint was that the menu descriptions do not adequately prepare you for what they are serving. I was frequently surprised by what I received versus the description and even more surprised to see what the other people at the communal table were receiving based on the menu descriptions. If you are going to have an exotic menu, I think you need to give patrons adequate tools to make their choices. My main concern, however, is that while the menu promises exotic eats, the dishes that are served are generally mediocre. The $20-something beef tenderloin was just okay, nothing special. The prosciutto balls (where's the prosciutto, by the way?) were bland. The panini was just a fancy ham and cheese. The saving grace for TPP is the pricing. I thought the pricing was excellent and a good value for the location. Overall, we had a fine meal and felt like we got our money's worth.

Like clock work we were called in 15 minutes and led to our booth where someone else was sitting and the waters were being placed on the table. WTF! Anyway, the seater leads us in a big circle and we end up back at the front desk where a mass of confusion seemed to set in.

25947,"The name says it all - this place is Simply It! I was the first to arrive for my first GNO. I walk in and find a huge table along the back wall all set up for the lovely ladies of yelp, so I shimmy my way to the middle along the wall. I figured I'd be in the middle of the gals, the booze and the food. I was right. So as I'm sitting down and grabbing the wine from my bag, the owner walks up and introduced himself. He's a small guy with a giant smile. He took my wine to open and chill it while I waited for the other yelpettes. Slowly the ladies began trickling in and while we got situated, the servers were grabbing everyones bottles and chilling, opening, etc. Very prompt and gracious. On to the food. I had never had Vietnamese before, but the menu sounded awesome so I was excited. They started us with an appetizer sampler. The servers came around and told us which sauces went with which app. I immediately forgot the protocol, but appreciated to quick lesson. I was sitting next to the fab Helena B. and when the server was telling us how to use the sauces, she noticed Helena already chose one and told her she'd ruined it. She wasn't snotty about it though, and we all found it pretty funny. Helena liked it anyway - rogue sauce and all. The egg rolls were super crunchy and I fell in love with the chicken dumplings. As the waitress was taking the plate away, I stuck my arm up to grab the last one off the plate - I mean, it's just the girls - I don't need my manners, right? Right. I didn't get to try the chicken pastry deal, and I wasn't really a fan of the spring rolls, but that's only because I'm not really a cilantro fan - so I didn't hold that against them. The salad was a cold shrimp salad with papaya and cilantro. As long as I didn't get a bunch of cilantro in the bite, it was super light and refreshing. The entrees were a lemongrass chicken dish, stir fried with sweet bell peppers, jalapenos, lemongrass (duh) and herbs. Very tasty. The chicken was moist and the veggies had a slight crunch to them. Then the mango beef. Served in a coconut with mango, garlic, onion, coconut and snow peas. So good. Then the calamari dish. This was the one I was most skeptical about, but ended up enjoying the most. I couldn't keep my chopsticks out of the pineapple it was served in. The calamari was cooked perfectly with cashews and, of course, pineapple and veggies. All served along side sticky rice. Dessert was fried bananas with a strawberry and chocolate drizzle. Scrumptious. Also a plate of fresh fruits. Everything about the meal was amazing. All the ingredients were super fresh and cooked perfectly. The decor was bright and clean. The service - the service was impeccable. They were there when you needed them, but not overbearing. The perfect balance of attentiveness that can be hard to achieve. On my way out, the owner was saying goodbye to us all, and he said goodbye to me by name! I was super impressed. LOVED HIM! All this fabulousness for $25?

The food itself is fine enough, but the menu doesn't inspire much of an appetite. The server didn't seem to know much about beer, despite working at a brew-pub. Also, he billed for the mediocre cupcake he brought out when we told them it was my friend's birthday.

Fried chorizo stuffed olives started me off and next course was beets with goat cheese whip and pistachios-- delicious! But what totally took the cake was the WAGYU SIRLOIN TIP with fingerling potatoes, caramelized red onions and olive and bone marrow vinaigrette. This dish was highly recommended by the bartender. I very seldom eat red meat but I decided to take the plunge because of her enthusiasm. It was thankfully a lighter portion than it sounded and was, in a word, stupendous. Every bite had a delicious combination of acidity, marshmellowy and charred beef, briney-ness buttery-ness and sweetness.

We got there at about 4 PM, it didn't smell like old fish, were seated right away, and had the best service all night. We were tempted to order the other fish specials, since they only have 3 different fish (tilapia, trout and catfish) for the special, all served the same way (pan fried with baby reds and mixed veggies).  Started with clam chowder - DELISH! A bit too creamy but was deliciously fresh with lots of bits of clam. Salad was a bowl of mixed greens - nothing fancy but agreeably a great traditional salad. The trout. EXCELLENT quality! Fresh, tender, moist, a FULL FISH. yummmmmmmmm. What surprised me were the sweetened pecans on top - I normally don't like my fish like this but it was a pleasant surprise. I was just glad it wasn't all over the fish. For $14, I really could not ask for more. We can't wait to come back for brunch, especially since they take reservations.

If you talk in there, or answer your cell phone, not only do you get a lot of hostile looks, but there is always someone twerpy and backward enough to explain condescendingly that you should NOT talk on your cell phone in there: again: get a life people: its 2009, people talk on their cell phones EVERYwhere now, and if you develop your mind a little bit (say get past the preoccupation with cupcakes and goody-goody attitudes) it is easy enough to learn to concentrate no matter what is going on.

2734,"I would give Tru 10 stars if I could :) That's how outstanding our experience at Tru was. I chose this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and was a little apprehensive as my husband is a vegetarian. But they assured me when I made reservations that they could make 9 courses all vegetarian. From the minute we gave our car to the valet till the end when we got our coats back - it was an amazing and the most luxurious evening. It's not just about the food or the ambience - it is truly an experience. I was warned that our whole dinner would take around 2.5 hours at least. As soon as we gave our car to the valet (who also wished us a Happy Anniversary) - we were walked to our table, and on our way we were wished at least by 5 different people a Happy Anniversary. The place has a dress code - it deserves a dress code :) We were a little intimidated at first, but after a few minutes we were put at ease. We were waited on by 5 people during dinner. We chose the 8 course vegetarian grand menu. I will not go into the details of all the courses, but let me say that the food was outstanding. It looked like art, and there were a couple of courses where my husband and me did not want to put our forks on the plate - because it was soo pretty! You always have 2 people working in sync : to bring out a course or to pour water or clear the table ware - it is like a synchronized and orchestrated show but without being too pompous and pretentious. The service was impeccable and the attention to detail was truly commendable. The servers were very knowledgeable about the food being put out in front of us and answered all our questions patiently. As for the food, let's say we ate the fluffiest of gnocchi, tastiest of potatoes and the earthiest of mushrooms. We tasted flavor profiles that we didn't know could be put together so well. It was an excellent menu and put together beautifully. Chef Martin is a genius. It was an amazing dinner, and was made special because of the impeccable service. It was a great choice for our anniversary date. I have never been to a Michelin-star restaurant, but Tru totally deserves it.

This server who was moved to Miami's location used to serve me all the times. And i always tipped him $50. After that, i still kept tipping $50 to every server of mine. But not long ago i went there and it was only 2 of us. At the end, when the check came the guy had charged me a 15% service fee. That angered me. For a resturant going to high places such as this, they should train their eimployees well enough to understand respect. Yeah, service charger, for tabels above 6 people is understandable. But for 2, sad. I still left the guy extra $50. Maybe he'll learn something that way.",1/6/2010,LY9N88uXVZr6TuaZuHDapw,5B2HNepli3qU9pKBqINfoA,3Mx2PM7v8qjqhgF3cDXxbQ,Y,5,0

55901,"My Oldest daughter woke up yesterday morning asking me if we were going to meet the beautiful Indian Lady at the restaurant. I realized my daughter was asking me about the India House restaurant we went to last weekend, and the girl who greeted us and seated us at our table. Both my daughters were amazed by her Indian Costume and she was supernice talking to our daughters and answering their questions, so they now think we would go there every Saturday as they heard me telling the girl as she was seeing us off that we will be going back there for sure. This was our First experience to Indian Food as a family, even though my Husband had tried it several times before, and it was his strong recommendation that finally made us decide to introduce Indian Cuisine at India House to our kids. I agree he made a great choice. The Food was delicious, and our daughters loved the Nan bread and the Chicken dishes. The Service was excellent. We informed the girl who seated us about our kids and my first experience to Indian food, and she ensured us the Chef could make the food mild for us, still retaining the flavor. The waiters were very attentive and helped us out with great recommendations for first timers. My Husband went for the spicier dishes, and he was enjoying it. I tried some of his dishes and they were really good. I think I am now ready to try spicier Indian dishes, so we would love to go back soon. The kids enjoyed the Mango drink called lassi, and they also have a great choice of Wines for adults. The Indian Ice cream Kulfi was delicious too. Even the Valet Parking team was good, as they were ready with our Car when we came out of the restaurant, so we did not have to wait in the Cold Chicago Weather. The only thing I hope they had different is their lighting style. The ambience is great in dim light, but it makes it hard to read the Menus, especially for beginners who would like to read the description of the dishes. I wish they turn up the lights by a notch so we didn't have to squint looking at the menu. But I have seen this at a lot of other upscale restaurants too. I hope they all realize the guest perspective on this issue and would do the needful to make a change. Overall - Great place for a Great evening.

56317,"Yay for my first Yelp review ever~! I had to just write a review for Simply It because it's simply amazing. I've been here at least ten times already ever since I discovered it last summer, and the food, service, and atmosphere has consistently been very good. Being away from home (VA), it makes me really miss Vietnamese food. Now, I know that Argyle is much closer to me, yet I still venture out to this place all the time despite the 7..8 minute walk from the El. Why? Not only is the food really good, but I was greeted with such warmness that it made me feel so homey. Cau Tuan, the owner is such a nice man. He treated me like I was part of his family and that's what I appreciate most. And his staff is very hospitable as well. The service is wonderful; very attentive and quick. I always get the Banh Xeo, Avocado Wontons as appetizers. I usually don't really like getting Banh Xeo at other restaurants, but their version is actually really good, and the portion is big too. Other good ones include the Seafood Eggrolls and Calamari Salad. I've tried a variety of their entrees. I like the Pineapple Calamari a lot along with the King Crab Pasta, and Seafood Noodles. Though they don't have a dessert menu, we are always given a small treat at the end of our meal whether it is rice cakes, fruit, or even fried banana! Also try the bubble tea! It's amazingly good!!The place is so good, that we keep coming back with friends.

If you are looking for a better option, Ukrainian Village is full of them. I personally would settle for a small Lou Malnati's deep dish over this place any day, however, as I've stated in some of my other reviews, I really do recommend Picante, Smoke Daddy or even Janiks over on Damen/Division.  There's also a nice couple of Italian restaurants in the area as well. Overall, this place is worth checking out as we may have just gone on a bad day and ordered the wrong thing, but we just waited so long that if I had a choice between picking up a burrito and eating right away while watching football or sitting down and waiting for an hour and having to raise our voices over the ruckus from the kitchen, just to be heard, I would take the burrito.",5/7/2010,KqCj1SVMNPifot4KsAnqFA,NoV17PGTyDg_A4DzZ3kxRg,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,Y,2,0

The ambiance was nice and I loved the big chairs and tables and the eccentric pictures of pigs on the walls. Our server was extremely friendly and upfront about what was available for the night. He gave us great recommendations about beer and other drinks (I tried the hard cider). We ordered: - a round of oysters - they were so good! I had never tried raw oysters before in my life. These tasted really fresh and the flavors ranged from sweet to somewhat salty. - a cold plate - came with an assortment of prosciutto, sausages, and other sliced meats - a hot plate (my favorite) - rabbit sausage, beef tongue, pork confit and a few other things all tossed in a couscous You can find the exact descriptions on their website :) We also tried the dessert: - Rhubarb pie - excellent taste. Not too sweet, not too tart. - Waffle with blueberries Bottomline: if I'm ever in Chicago again, I will definitely go here.

It was really strange to me, but some vietnamese guy i met at the apple store on Michigan avenue said it was better food than Viet town. So i went, and it exceeded my expectation. The PHo i have to admit was Home cooked quality, i actually left saying, Man that Pho was actually really good. Also the Fried Banana and icecream is to die for... Plus, The owner is extremely friendly and talks to all the customer. He clearly knows how to run a restaurant. I know this might sound to good to be true, but what do you have to lose.

In Chicago sometimes the food is a bit too ""messed with"" for my palate, but generally creative, and served in very ""design-y"" spaces with excellent table service. Fluke tartare - flavorful fresh fish, transparent, well married flavors. Excellent. ""Game birds"" - squab breast w quail egg - don't remember the preparation very well, but I remember thinking ""how clever"" and ""how delicious"" in quick succession Deconstructed ceasar - tight bundles of romaine hearts in three neat stacks, one atop a ""brioche twinkie"" and all of them topped w a tiny little anchovy fillet. More clever than delicious, but still good, and will definitely elicit a chuckle Chicken noodle - was almost over a cold, so figured this would be perfect. It was. Chicken stock reduced till thick poured over small packets of flavor, such as a carrot ""marshmallow."" Delicious and clever. Sweetbread empanada - love me some empanadas, and these were no exception. Possibly the best dish of the night -- certainly the most beautiful. Plate once again peppered with little flavor packets that kept you guessing but never unhappy. Delightful. Hog cheek - the only dish that may have been a bit overdone. Flavors seemed too concentrated, too salty, and not in balance. The wine list showed immense creativity and broad knowledge. One of the most interesting lists I've read in a very long time. The beer selection is also deep and fascinating. Some dishes were paired with beer rather than wine (appropriately), which showed ingenuity and expertise. The one cocktail I had wasn't great, though the liquor list seemed well chosen. Service was unobtrusive and prompt. I could find no fault.

Though, he did bring another glass of water after we paid our bill, tipped him and were on our way out.Then, once I have sat on a seat with some sticky brown liquid on it. Double Yuck!

We ordered the stuffed crust mushroom and sausage pizza - I guess it wasn't actually legit deep dish pizza because the crust was fairly thin, but the way they piled on the mounds of toppings and cheese made it as deep as an actual deep dish pizza. The thin crust was stacked with a generous layer of the very flavorful sausage and fresh mushrooms, followed by the ooziest/yummiest/thickest layer of SOOOOO MUCH CHEESE, followed by another generous layer of toppings, and finally covered in a layer of marinara sauce. Honestly, I don't think I could eat a more delicious pizza in my life - and am (somewhat) seriously contemplating paying $60 to have some authentic Giordano's shipped to me... :)",5/20/2009,uTez6ZqwZW-ndhd7cIpkxA,rWaI0XFBwa_JRyMrHR_h3A,z_qEuUuRWIq4O-YufXHf1w,N,3,1
52285,"We ate upstairs and our server was terrible! Plates were delivered that had not been washed - large pieces of someone else's green pepper and onion on it...our server mumbled oops with no apology and 10 minutes later brought new dishes. Our deep dish took 1:30 minutes and came out mushy. It was not a busy night as we were seated immediately. I think he forgot to put our order in. After an hour of waiting, I asked about our pizza and 15 minutes later it came out mushy. I will not go back.

Granted, this place is good-but, not THAT good to stand out in the snow and ice for 90 minutes. Yesterday, I just happened to be driving on California, and noticed for the first time, that there was no line outside. Oh wait, did I see a parking spot right outside the front door? Oh, yes indeed! Now, I should say upfront that I am no fan of Chicago dogs. Actually, I think they suck. But, I do like brats, and opted for the ""Dave Kingman."" Now, this was a really good brat-but, once again, it wasn't orgasm in my pants amazing. Very friendly, and quick service. Tasty brat, fries, and reasonable prices. I would return-but, I sure as hell won't wait more than 10 minutes. *Budakis on Damen is just as good, sans long lines.",1/28/2011,N4VRjp7M3qMzLXRh2ay6OA,PbP2qdfYo2swY86yeKHyjw,HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A,N,4,1

I ordered a Chimichanga and the last time I checked Chimichangas were more than a deep-fried burrito packed with 2 pounds of meat. What's the point in going to a sit-down restaurant and paying for the service if the service is terrible? I might go back and try something else, but I'll get it to go because their service sucked.",6/3/2011,ZNo-1q49xjXcRdOv7bo8uA,XtK6SsSltSrCdvvkJKsEHg,08X_5WTOVNvk4SgPRKBjjQ,N,4,1
54952,This place has the best Bourbon cocktails in Chicago. I have never had a more lovely Whiskey Sour on a chilly night. My girlfriend and I have been here three or four times and it just gets better and better. The food was extroadinary the meatballs we had for an appetizer were so delicious. I then ordered the pork belly and holy shit! It had to be the most savory thing I have ever had. It was crispy on the outside with a taste that tingled your taste buds and an even better texture on the inside. The chocolate creme brulee we had for dessert just completed the evening.,12/1/2006,PS9S5x4Mt5OxFPegKHACgg,HMaDY4SlvTuJkG11UTopJg,q-_jW5lauONk_58S-wVIrg,Y,5,0
48174,"I've been to Publican for their Brunch but this time I came for dinner with 4 of my gal friends .I'd say a party of 4 is the way to go at this place, so you can try a lot dishes but still recieve a fair portion per person. Everything is small plates and by small I do mean small, like tapas size or smaller. But expect a total Foodielicious experience! Here's what we ordered: The meats: -SPICY STEAK TARTARE was a delightful delicacy for rare meat lovers that we all raved about. Served with fresh veggie garnishes and a great flavor, I think this was one of my favorite standouts. -COUNTRY STYLE RIBS - we did the full order and this was a good comfort food dish, a better portion for a group of our size plus juicy and tender. -BOUDIN BLANC - at first glance, i was like, 'What! you get one tiny sausage to share between 5 people."" but once you experience this dish, your taste buds will go haywire!. I think this was one of my favorites - the meat was so tender and had a wonderful flavor! It makes my mouth water just thinking about it now! The fish: - BEAU SOLIEL, SPANISH MACKEREL, AND STRIPED BASS ok, I'm not afish lover and rarely eat fish, but i definitely ate this fish. It was so fresh, no fishiness and all the flavors of each dish generated ""ooo's and ahhhs"" from our group. -The Spanish Mackerel, though simple in presentatation, was very tasty - expect it to be on the salty salty side. -the Striped Bass was so memorable -served with cucumbers and almonds, this dish was my favorite fish dish. -The OYSTERS: A group of our size required the full order of 12, and it's worth it! Very fresh, I swear they must fly their oysters out to the midwest often!  The vegetables: - POREINI & KING MUSHROOMS: Definitely one of my favorite dishes. Our first reaction was ""what! this is all you get for $20!"" But again, once you taste the dish, you will know why you paid what you paid. The mint,balsamic and burrata just bursts with flavor in your mouth. We were all like ""wow"" and lip smacking =) . -ASPARAGUS - skip this dish, while it's good, it's nothing special and unique. -SUMMER SQUASH SALAD: While very fresh, it's not a good dish to split between 5 people - we each had like a piece of lettuce and a small veggie, so i can't comment on whehter it was special or not since i barely got a taste! DESSERT: -the waffle dish and an apple pie w/icecream dish - this really topped off the meal. Everything was really good. The Damage? With one drink per person, we each spent $75. Expect to spend a lot of dough in order to experience what this place has to offer, which is a heaven for your taste buds.",9/17/2011,n-W2n,Eu9t9pDcGADgtNNs7h8UMw,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg,N,5,1

People with reservations seemed to be waiting more than 20 minutes past their reservation time. Server splashed hot oil all over my fiancee when he quickly set down one of the pork dishes. Server was inattentive, as we used the same plate the entire meal and only received attention when it was time for the check. The meat was overly salted, and not generally as flavorful as usual. The restrooms both had dirty water stains on the floor, full waste baskets, and few remaining towels. Normally this place does well, but for some reason it was extremely disappointing this night.

41117,"Girlfriends and I dined for a super early Sunday dinner. Our reservations were at 4:45pm because someone from our party had to catch a flight. This place is really small but in a very cute way. Clearly since our reservations were so early, we were the first to arrive for dinner. We were greeted promptly by our friendly waiter. This place has a prixe fix set five course meal. We stumbled in the day they were serving quail (too bad it wasn't foie gras). Our five course meal consisted of: Starter: Amuse First course: Salad of baby red oak with sablefish sashimi Second course: Charlmoula Lamb Third Course: Curried lobster bisque with tempura lobster Fourth Course: Stuffed quail Fifth Course: A tribute to bananas (medley) I substituted the lamb for a fish since I don't eat lamb. The presentation for each course was excellent! Everything had excellent flavor - just right. I can't remember what fish the chef used to substitute the lamb course but I wish I could because it was simply amazing! One of the best fish I've ever eaten in my life. It was my favorite of the five. I also enjoyed the lobster bisque very much. There was a bite after each sip but it was so good. My friends thought it to be a little too spicy for their taste. The quail actually looked a little scary but it was tasty. I'm not a big dessert fan but the girls loved it! Unfortunately I couldn't finish my dessert platter. What I loved most about this place was the service. The chef (both the pastry chef and food chef) came out after each course to check on us. The waiter never let our beverage glasses stay empty. The moment he took our utensils away, he would replace them immediately.  Both chefs greeted our tables numerous times and personally brought out the meal. It felt very ""homey"". I thought the prices were reasonable. The menu is set at $65.00 per person so depending on what you drink, you're looking about $85 a person after tax and gratuity. I highly recommend coming here on a date. It is very romantic.  It also feels a little fun and mysterious that they're an ""underground"" restaurant.

The martinis were expensive, but really well done.  Then came the appetizers. Chicken samosas - dry. Veg pakora - dry and bland. The chutneys made me worry for our health. They were clearly used at another table and not cleaned up or replenished before being placed at our table. The tamarind and mango chutneys were less than half full, and the spoon handle for the tamarind was caked with the sauce.  The lamb curry had a delicious sauce but the meat itself was dry and undercooked. Cubed lamb in a curry dish should be moist and fork tender. It was borderline tough. The service was inconsistent.

25738,"4.5, really. I ate here a few weeks back, and I can still remember the big, bold flavors of my meal. I had the 2 course lunch here, and I chose the Arroz a la Cazuela (a type of Chilean soup), the Butifarra con Judias (house made sausages with truffled white beans) with the fries as a side, and my friend and I split the chocolate croquettes as a desert. The Arroz a la Cazuela was a solid dish. The saffron added a great aroma to the broth, and the flavor was subtle, but not hidden. I didn't care too much for the artichoke confit--the shrimp, chicken, and chorizo, when eaten with the aioli, blew that away. My second dish was essentially house made sausage with with truffled white beans. The white beans knocked my socks off. They were the best beans I had ever had. The accompanying fries were well cooked, the but the aioli wasn't too memorable. For desert, a friend and I split the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow. My friend loved the croquettes--she devoured hers so fast, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the marshmallows with caramel. Silky smooth with rich banana flavor . . . highly recommended. Don't let the olive oil turn you off of this desert--it adds a nice contrasting flavor to this dish. I will definitely visit Mercat when I'm in Chicago again . . . I can't seem about to forget those delicious truffled white beans . . . Oh, and I also had the seasonal sangria. If I'm not mistaken, it was ~$7 and well worth the price.

When I go w/ my uncle and his family, we get many free refills on the banchan. When I go there with my friends, the free refills disappear and out comes a $1 charge per dish.

56740,"This is such a great place. They have delicious homemade pasta. I have been here twice and both times I got the veal meatballs. They were large and super tender. My family went crazy over their pumpkin ravioli, it is the best pumpkin ravioli I have ever tried. Their desserts were delicious as well, with a hazelnut (I think) panna cotta, as well as the tiramisu. But to top it off, and the reason they absolutely get 5 stars in my book, is that I just received a card in the mail from them. I had filled out my information on a card at the restaraunt last time I visited, and I just received a handwritten thank you note from the chef, along with a gift certificate to come back and use! I have never had a restaraunt do that unless it was my birthday, so I think this really shows how much they value their customers. I will absolutely be coming back!",7/21/2011,m8dmULs8vuCOq64P-Ph2lA,NsXxQZ2xEboocqdrVGT5Rg,LYppbvgJlBG0SqjSKFiFGg,Y,4,0

They also serve deep fried mantou - YUM!A note about how to line up at this restaurant. You need to go into the restaurant, get the attention of one of the servers to let him/her know how many are in your party, and get a ticket.

I really think I'll go in next time and just start with the chocolate fondue because it is definitely my fave!  The first time I went to Geja's, I wasn't too happy with the service. While the hostess was going to seat us, a waitress went up to her and said don't seat them in my section. I don't want another table. Ive been a waitress so I get having bad nights, but really? Right in front of me? Someone must have called her out after because she came to apologize but the damage was done. Good thing we didn't get sat with her. Our server, who was awesome, got a really good tip! Only reason Geja's is missing one star is for that rude server.Today was no problem. Typically, you need reservations to come in but we walked in and crossed our fingers. The hostess was very nice and said to give her 10 minutes so we went to the bar for a quick drink and we were promptly sat.Again, from start the finish the food is awesome.

9959,"I've been here a few times and I really enjoyed it. They have tons of options to customize your pizza, ranging from your choice of sauces and toppings; they've got your standard sausage and pepperoni, but also a few different things like mashed potatoes, clams, artichoke hearts, meatballs, and bacon. I've had the plain sausage as well as sausage with fresh tomatoes (I'll be more adventurous one day, I swear). Both hit the spot just as I needed and they were VERY generous with the tomatoes - each slice would have a few sections of really thinly sliced tomatoes fanned over it. It was pretty tomato-y. In a good way, of course.  A bit of a warning though, you may want to let the pizza cool for a minute before you grab your first slice because it comes out ridiculously HOT. If you try to scarf it up the second after it lands on your table you may end up with permanent, sandpapery cat-tongue!  They also have karaoke on Thursdays and live band karaoke on Saturdays.

14771,"Went to Sabatino's last night with my husband and a friend that we haven't seen in years, who had never been. Of course it was fantastic. We love this old school Italian place. This and Buona Terra in Logan Square are probably my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. We started with strong cocktails. Yum. Minestrone soup came next, then salad. The soup was perfectly seasoned, filled to the brim with chunky vegetables, and was exactly the right temperature. The salad was simple, with a garlic dressing, and was perfectly chilled. A big warm loaf of Italian bread was accompanied by their signature cheesy bread. There's Parmesan cheese, butter and olive oil on the table, so you can select your favorite bread accoutrements. For entrees, I had the chicken meuniere -- sauteed chicken in a garlic, butter and wine sauce, with oil and garlic mostaccioli on the side. Our friend had the special fish -- skatewing sauteed in garlic and oil, with red sauce pasta, and my husband happily remained in his chicken parm rut with a side of spaghetti. The service was gracious, and the portions are huge and very reasonably priced. The tab, including drinks and tip, for the three of us was $75. Every table in the room was filled -- on a Tuesday night, natch. We skipped the baked alaska (personal favorite) prepared tableside and the rest of the dessert menu, but we did indulge our ears: there was a violinist and a guitarist working the room, singing Italian songs, so to speak. If you don't try this place once, you are making a HUGE mistake! P.S. It's exactly 24 hours later, and we are having our leftovers for dinner.

I gave them one more chance with the Bottoms Up Wit, it might have been ok with a wedge of orange, the aftertaste was similar to licking a quarter. Beer gets a negative 2 stars. If I ever go back I'll just stick with Fat Tire Revolution's redeeming quality is found in the kitchen, the smoked pulled pork burger was fantastic. Their pork was just the right mix of tang and sweet, on top of a medium rare slab of beef... it completely redeemed the place for my beer. If you get a burger ORDER THE POTATO SALAD!!!!

30268,"I hate hate HATE doing this. I really do. A restaurant that magically turns every hot-dog, hamburger, and chicken into a vegan friendly meal couldn't possibly be bad. In fact, as a vegetarian of 10+ years, I was kind of expected to love it, wasn't I? I wish I could say that I'd found my safe haven from all meat-eaters, but instead I'd found a restaurant that specializes in fake meat. First I blamed this on the fact that I'd been so conditioned to skip over such items as a cheeseburger that I kind of skipped over the whole menu. Going back to revise it, I did settle on one of their soy, fake, imitation meats. I love tofu. Soy has always been a true friend to me, but I just could not get into it here. Even if I didn't have the best experience, I'm really happy this restaurant is popular and hope it continues doing well. I love it when people are surprised how good something tastes without meat.

Yes, Bronco is a little over-attentive, but we were up for it and generally enjoyed his attention and recommendations. The food was DELICIOUS - each of the four of us was stealing bites off each others' plates. We're looking forward to going back, especially during a busier night when they (appear to) have live music. Didn't give 5 stars only because, like many others said, if we didn't have a coupon it would have been far too expensive to return.

The space is warm, inviting, and comfortable. The service is unlike many other restaurants in the city. They are very attentive-from managers, to servers, to bussers-all stopping by to make sure all was taken care of. Our server, Jonathon, was fantastic and made our experience both satisfying and fun. He was very knowledgeable and helped guide us to the perfect wine and meal-all with a bit of wit and charm!The hush puppies were amazing!! I'm still thinking about them.

35898,"OK...for years, I've been walking past Sun Wah and been saying ""I've hit every restaurant on Argyle, but never sun Wah...never the one with the ducks hanging in the window."" Well, it was about time I ventured into the infamous hanging duck place. So you ask why I thought those ducks were so intriguing, well, its simple; I love duck!  There I was, walking down Argyle with a friend,deciding whether to go to Pho 777, 888, 999, Tank, Haye Yen, etc etc. and the decision was made...Sun Wah. It was definateley not what I thought. I actually expected it to be a lot nicer in there than it was. When you first walk in, you are in a little vestebule area where the cashier counter is with some odd snacks and a menu on the wall. At first I thought that was the place, but then the friendly server showed us the rest of the restaurant. Not much to look at, sort of seemd like they threw a few tables around a room and forgot to put away the shipping crates, but I was there to try the BBQ.  I scanned the menu for a good couple of minutes trying to decide what sounded best. Since the doc shared the news that I am a border line diabetic, I've cut out the carbs so I look for dishes that are mostly proteins and veggies. Not a problem at Sun Wah. I ordered the three meat plate that is basically enough for two and only cost about 5 bucks. It had bit of chicken, duck and BBQ pork. I couldn't get enought of that pork...all sweet and BBQy...it was amazing. The chicken and duck were flavorfull and moist and everything laid upon a bed of this sweet soy sauce. The only issue I had with the chicken and duck was that it was cut is small pieces through the bone, so you had to really pick a lot and ended up with this gross pile of unedible chicken parts. :( After spooning on a bit of the soy/fish (whatever) sauce with the jalepenos in it that was on the table, my meal was boosted up another notch.  All said and done, I think my friend and I tabbed out at about 14 bucks total for the 2 of us to order 2 large dishes, a beer and some some tea. You can't beat that with a bat! The staff was helpful and friendly, the food was great and the prices were rock bottom low. Love it!!!

16020,"Had dinner here on Friday night to celebrate the aging of JN. The place was obscenely busy. Like, the waiting area was swarming with groups of people and I had to run away to catch my breath while waiting for our table. So, make reservations and definitely go elsewhere if you want a quiet dinner. This place is enormous, colorful and seemed filled with large birthday groups. Anyway, our server was great and the food was pretty good (and they make one tasty mojito). To start, we split the arepa, ropa vieja, and the salad special. The arepa was a big hit with J but I felt the pork was a little fatty. The rope vieja was all sorts of awesome though. Braised beef and plaintains? Yes yes yes! My favorite of the evening was the special salad - local greens (it was this thick purple spinach that I've never seen before and have been obsessing over ever since), marcona almonds, local cheddar, onions, Michigan apple and a chili serrano vinaigrette. Swoon! We should have stopped there but also had the pernil and arrachera (Maria's fault!). The pork shoulder was very sweet. The arrachera was beefy goodness and honestly, you can put chimichurri over anything and I will swallow it whole. Dessert was a little disappointing. We ordered the churros and they were really crunchy, like, a good baguette almost gum-cutting crunchy. Luckily, our server brought J out a little birthday treat - a sticky toffee cake topped with pineapple sticks. Quite tasty. So why only 3 stars? This type of restaurant just really isn't my scene. When I want ethnic food of any kind (Mexican, Vietnamese, Japanese, Cuban, etc etc) I am much happier when I eat in a small, no frills, family run place - they are my happy place. Swanky lighting and bright wallpaper always seems to detract from my experience. Of course, if J wanted to come back for a special occasion, I would too and eat a bunch of beef and pray that they have those purple spinach leaves again.",10/31/2010,d4KgCmDCil4vJQNZSUf8aA,2YuYRqSTsqHHZaiWXpo3Aw,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg,N,3,1

The empinadas are awesome, the bisteak, guarito and lechon sandwiches are all killer. the steak dinner is great as well, the mariquitas are covered in a pungent garlic sauce that is very addictive. their house hot sauce is very good and they offer habenero sauce for those of us with true chili pepper addictions.

The food is always consistently amazing. The meat is fresh and perfectly marinated. I have a huge appetite and when it's Korean BBQ, I somehow have a bottomless stomach. I can eat and eat and eat some more. The service is good and that is surprising in itself. Most of the time, the Korean ladies are rude and short, but it's part of their charm.

60002,"I was born and raised in the South so entres such as: ""Shrimp and grits"" or ""Biscuits and gravy "" sets my heart a flutter. Needless to say, I am a poor unemployed graduate student and the prices have kept me from venturing over. Having a dinner date last night with some girlfriends gave me the perfect excuse to spend some money that I don't have. First and foremost, the ambiance is A+. Posh indeed. When you first arrive you are blocked off from the diners by a heavy velvet curtain. Only until the hostess has confirmed your reservation are you allowed past the veil. Secondly, the service....A+. Very hospitable and knowledgeable. Answered all of our questions about drinks, entres and deserts. The food....here is where I seem to differ from the loyal following of Yelpers who have reviewed Big Jones. I admit that as someone with no money who is hesitant to part with it, my opinion on what makes a good eatery is a bit skewed (Cheap, big portions and consistent quality) from other populations. The prices were just a little bit too overpriced I felt for the quality and size of portions. I ordered the Pork Shoulder (one of the cheaper items on the menu at under $20.00) and while the pork was DELICIOUS, there was not enough ( I would have priced this entree for no more than $10.00, anything more than that would be pushing it). Same with the desserts. Yummy but small. My girlfriends all had ONE alcoholic beverage ($10-12 a pop) and their bills were around $60.00. So, yes the ambiance, the service and the food is good...I still don't find that the small portions makes it worth the price.

That was the only factor which made the long wait tolerable. We checked in at 10:50 and were seated at 11:35. At the time that we were about to be seated, I heard them quoting newcomers 60 to 90 minutes. The hype machine rolls on, I guess. I don't understand why people make this a destination. There are so many other options nearby, not to mention other neighborhoods. My breakfast was bad. Not ""just okay"" but bad. For some reason my dish came out about five minutes after the rest of the table's, so I'm not sure what was going on back there. I ordered the rock shrimp benedict and asked for the remoulade hollandaise on the side after seeing benedicts going to other tables drenched in sauce. The sauce turned out to be fine and in fact I also used it on my breakfast potatoes. But the benedict was awful. The english muffins were limp and chewy and the shrimp were tough and rubbery. Also, the dish was nearly tasteless. A sparing application of the hollandaise added some flavor, but when your main ingredients cannot stand on their own without a dousing of sauce, you have a problem. I do have to say that the single lemon ricotta & sour cherry pancake that I ordered for ""dessert"" was damn good. Way too sweet, but damn good. The service was adequate but lacked personality. Some of us enjoy a little happiness with their weekend brunch, you know? In the attic of my mind, this place seems like a relic of the early aughts. I associate it with a time in my life before I knew anything about decent restaurants, in the pre-pre-Yelp era, and in the years before a plethora of spots sprung up to accommodate this town's brunch obsession. Now, there are so many better options, all with shorter waits. When I dated a girl who was a brunch nut but only knew a few places, and later when I had friends who lived nearby for a couple of years, I would shrug and find myself tagging along to the Bongo Room. But now that I know better and usually control my own brunch destiny, there is no reason to come here and suffer long waits for mediocre food. Except to catch up with some good friends. For that I would be willing to go anywhere.",5/27/2012,kkUDFLS2zr4WO54Mh4MJHg,6EHbIv5w2I4XbXs3dG_D1Q,_b69OdBNLhysN1jFlYNQiA,N,2,1
11980,"I'm pretty picky about my pizza and since everyone had said this was one of the better spots my expectations were maybe a little too high. I actually enjoyed the homemade beer better than the pizza (I had the english style ale). I ordered my own small pepperoni, but ordered it extra crispy. The crust was somewhat crispy at the edges, but pretty flimsy everywhere else. Considering there weren't' any other toppings to weigh it down, I wasn't too impressed.

35657,"This is truly a mixed review. I was so stoked to come here for lunch because of all the hype and because I love duck so much. Christopher was sweet enough to take me even though he does not eat duck. When I saw the extensive menu I thought it would be a piece of cake to find some good food for Chris. He opted for hot and sour soup and the sweet and sour pork. Both were dreadful. The soup was neither hot nor sour and so full of egg it was more like egg drop soup disguised as hot and sour. We tried to doctor it up with the abundant condiments on the table, but it really didn't help. The sweet and sour pork had a standard sauce, but the pork was extremely tough. I, on the other hand, opted for variations on duck. I had the combo over rice. It was good, and portions here are certainly ample. I also had the duck and shrimp dumpling noodle soup. I enjoyed that as well and we took home enough food to feed a small army. I am still going to try and doctor up the hot and sour soup, just cuz I am perverse like that. I want to come back and try the Peking Duck, but will have to find a dinner companion because Christoper will not be making a return appearance.",6/10/2011,vqzMoxxiASrM1s55gtSkLg,jWDhfDetz_qy4mcjGV090Q,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA,N,5,1

The waitress came to our table a total of 2 times throughout the meal, once to give us our bill (on which we were charged 75 cents for the lemons we had requested for our water). After going through some difficulty in locating someone to make payment to due to our waitresses' neglect, I was talked back to by our waitress who continuously rolled her eyes at me as well. In addition, she charged our credit cards the wrong amounts and the manager told me he ""had 6 things going on and no time to hear what I had to say"". I have never been treated so poorly at ANY dining establishment. I have emailed the establishment with no response or explanation for their poor service.

Honestly nothing we had was good and I actually felt ripped off.My friends and I had been trying to plan for weeks to go here just to try what they claimed is Montreal Poutine. There version was the biggest fail at poutine I have ever witnessed. My drunk friends at 6am have made better poutine with McDonalds fries. The gravy killed it, it was sweet and disgusting.The spinach salad was bland with barely any dressing.The veggie burger was terribly boring. Boring bread, boring patty and boring sauce. I tried it simply because it was advertised as being made in collaboration with Sage Francis.The biggest insult on the veggie burger was the fact that my caramelized onions were ice cold!! I took a bite and could understand why something was that cold in the burger. Turns out it was the caramelized onions, i was disgusted. Do they just make a whole batch, refrigerate it and add it to burgers? If you're not going to make it to order at least have the decency to heat them up.I tried the truffle oil fries, they were ok, I don't know what truffle oil is supposed to taste like but I don't even know if I tasted anything other than regular fries.My iced tea, I had to send it back, it was barely yellow and the only flavor was the lemon i squeezed in it.Service was ok to say the least, after sending back the iced tea i settled for water which was only filled once after our waitress brought the check.I would not recommend Bad Apple, if you want good burgers go to Kuma's and if you want good Veggie burgers with actual caramelized onions go to Earwax.

55252,"This restaurant is amazing! If you truly love red meat and haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you've got to try one. Positive: The filet mignon is to die for! And then the filet mignon wrapped in bacon was even better! The service is outstanding. The guys (gauchos) serving the charred and seasoned meat have cuts ranging from medium rare to well done. If the cut of meat you want isn't available on that skewer, they'll get it for you. If you want your steak (on the stick) cooked longer, just ask! The chicken was surprisingly great too. They have 15 different cuts of meat. The ribs are OK. The pork and lamb are above average. The top and bottom sirloin is tasty. The pichanha (steak) is very good, but the filet is where it's at! The cheese rolls that come with dinner are very good.Negative: It's pricey. $48.50 for dinner. Granted, it's all you can eat and that's how much Brazilian steakhouses usually charge, but it's still pricey. The salad bar, while VERY fresh didn't have a very large array of choices. I understand that the meat is why you go there, so overall, it's fine. The parmesan covered pork has way too much cheese on it. There's no seafood. I hear some of Fogo De Chao's competitors serve shrimp. That would've been a nice touch. The fried bananas, polenta and mashed potatoes are good, but not really the point of going here.A couple of tips:1. This is all you can eat, very tasty meat so prepare for your visit. You may not want to eat too much earlier in the day if you are having dinner there. I saw people looking very sleepy and others, well, they looked like they didn't feel well. It's not Fogo De Chao's fault. You've got to have stomach room.2. While the salad bar is nice, do you want to pay $48.50 for fresh salad? Save your stomach room for the meat show! 3. Please pace yourself. Your stomach will thank you. They give you a coaster-looking object that is green (please bring me meat now) on one side and red (I'm taking a break) on the other. I recommend not having more than two or three meats maximum on your plate at one time. They'll get cold if you exceed that limit.4. Experiment a little. Don't order lamb much? Try it here. Usually like your meat medium well, try different cuts at medium and you may like them better. Since it's all you can eat and you can just get smaller cuts on your plate, you can afford to experiment and have fun!5. While I've heard they have a great mojito-type drink, beyond having that, you may want to limit your drinking. You'll already probably be sleepy from eating all of that meat plus now you want to add lots of alcohol? Hmmm. It's up to you.6. Allow plenty of time. At least two hours minimum. You don't want to rush through all of the delightful food and sights. We were there for almost three hours and had a ball.7. You may not want to bring anyone who doesn't really like meat. Besides vegetarians, even people who aren't big on red meat will probably be frustrated.8. Live a little! While this place is expensive, if you love meat, find a special occasion and get over there at least once. You'll have a great time.",8/12/2008,nKSC3p7Ob9aSLhy_L365ZA,9_ME--bvyZStdz6iwGzMCw,43rd1LKcZRIunySzbMsyLQ,Y,5,0

57847,"Came with a group of 4 on Saturday night, the last night of Restaurant Week. It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it did NOT disappoint.With a friend I shared an appetizer of spicy lentils, a meal of meat messob and a dessert of sambussa turnovers in raspberry sauce. The meal was INCREDIBLE. Combined with the great prices, this was a five star experience.The lentil dish was amazing; spicy with strips of pepper and perfectly delicious when scooped up with the spongy bread that is offered with every meal. The best part about being able to eat with one's hands is that it completely removes any taste of silverware that, though subtle, might interfere with such delicate and layered flavors. As an appetizer for two, it could have easily fed three or four. The lentils were incredibly filling and though delicious I had to hold off on finishing my half so I would have room for dinner!The meat messob was wonderful. We were thrilled to find each different dish a new experience. For those who haven't had Ethiopian before, if you like Indian food, especially heavily spiced curries, you will definitely go for this! The meats were incredibly tender, spiced to perfection, some hot and some mild (I like it hot!). The lamb dishes were my favorite, full of spice but not so overpowering that the meat's own flavor didn't come though. Some dishes have bones in them which may startle the less adventurous diner. Never fear! The meat is so succulent and tender it pulls right off the bone. One of our dishes was served with a smattering of some sweet cheese next to a marinated hard boiled egg, it was the perfect compliment to the meat offered, light and tasty on the tongue. When dessert came I expected the almond and walnut sambussa to be a bit like baklava but it was very unlike anything I'd ever had before; sweet and flaky and a little savory which is a plus for me in any dessert. Combined with the sweetness of whipped cream and the tartness of raspberry sauce this was the perfect capper to a spicy meal.However, my very favorite item on this menu was, believe it or not, the coffee!! Hot, strong Ethiopian coffee served in a clay pot. WOW! From someone who can never have their coffee strong or rich enough this is high praise! It's served up black with a saucer of sugar on the side. All of my friends spooned sugar into their cups and enjoyed the taste immensely but for me the pure flavor of this good strong coffee was absolute heaven. We had coffee with our appetizers but it would be just as lovely to accompany dessert.For anyone who's ever had a hankering for Ethiopian food, or in the mood to try something really exotic, Demera is a winner!Good food, good service (our water glasses were never empty and we were checked back on just frequently enough to make us feel well cared for), and great prices for such an extraordinary experience!!!",7/27/2012,vYOlD9w1O_T1dDzP0H-LXw,HV55mI9kztFPqid54UdA0w,JDNZxz0ud7zhuPo5pqznMA,Y,5,0

56760,"If you crave thin crust pizza from Rome, then this place will provide you with a quick fix. That's about it. We got there about 45 minutes before closing on a weekday night and were seated inside, in the room just west of the entrance. The place was spacious, but they sat us in the corner, next to two other couples. After the couples finished their dinner and left, the staff started breaking down the outside patio seating and bringing it inside. The door was kept ajar, so the cool restaurant air left the room. The place got warm and the ceiling fan didn't help. I felt like I was being rushed. How can you eat and drink when staff members are moving tables and stacking chairs right in front of you?  We ate our pizza and gulped down our wine. The dessert menu came. We decided to pass. In summary, if you want a place to relax and spread out, this is not the place. If there are open tables, the staff will not spread you out -- it will seat you next to other people.

The menu changes consistently and is posted on the wall (by the time you get to the menu everything looks good), the options keep you interested even if you've been to Hot Doug's before. The duck fat fries weren't bad, but for me, they underwhelmed. That being said, the hot dogs more than made up for the fries. As most everyone else has already pointed out, Doug works the counter and is friendly as can be. Doug's got a great sense of humor, quirky, down-to earth and will offer suggestions based on whatever info you give him (though you really can't go wrong). Best hot dogs, ever.The only downside is the wait and that it's crowded. We waited for around an hour and a half, which for some is ridiculous for any food, let alone hot dogs.

58624,"What a shame.1. Salad was absolutely drowned in dressing. The greens were floating in dressing. Also, the greens were nothing spectacular: generic salad mix.2. The cheese fondue is like Gruyere nacho cheese. By the time we were finished it was congealing on the sides of the pot. It is awfully thick, and seems as though it must have been prepared hours earlier and sat in a pot waiting. The cheese, if it truly is Gruyere, is obviously low quality. By the end I was eating plain pretzel bread (pretty good) to try to get the taste out of my mouth. 3. Chocolate was fine. The pound cake was pretty burnt.We skipped any sort of meat, noting that they advertised grain-fed USDA Choice beef, as if that were something to be proud of. In an age when many restaurants are offering grass-fed options beef (and even charging extra for it), bragging about grain-fed seems very dated. For over $40/person and not huge serving sizes of meat, I would think they wouldn't brag unless it were USDA Prime. I suppose it wouldn't really bother me if they had just said beef tenderloin without all of the extra features.Everything is just behind the times and seems careless. Each course comes out in only a couple minutes after ordering, indicating that most likely almost nothing is made to order. None of the ingredients seem high quality. $40-$50/person would be much better spent at countless fantastic Chicago restaurants.",1/28/2012,SwQBWjOYvY2HjkmoEAAKsA,0dxIxNHW2sbxxanoPkH80Q,hylBw5ND7XyPldM6BN28vw,Y,1,0

61265,"I usually do not write reviews because everyone has their own unique experience but my experience with Brazzaz the other night brought one on. It was on a friday and it wasnt too busy which was good. General decor and ambience was not all that impressive. We were seated and immidiately 3 people came up and began pooring water, taking drink orders and so forth. One of the men pouring our water, i thought was one of the bus boys, but he turned out to be our waiter. We asked for menus and they told us they dont have menus. So we asked what the options were and the cost. Our WAITER: ""ummm what is today, friday.......well the meat meal is 39.50 and if you only want the salad bar its between 25 and 30 bucks. So our waiter wasnt even sure??? Meal then went fine, food was average to above average but I must admit the salad bar is very good. Lots of options and unique dishes. And now the disaster. We got our check and we were charged for 3 ""meat"" dinners at 48.50 a plate. We only had 2 meat dinners and 1 salad bar for the 3 of us. So our waiter came and gave us a little trouble because he thought we all got the meat. So he went and changed 1 meal to the salad bar at 29.50 but left the other two dinners at 48.50 which HE TOLD US was 39.50, and would not change it because he said he made the mistake, whatever sense that makes. So we go to the front to speak to the manager and after explaining he had a smirk on his face and said ""im sorry, our waiter made a mistake and told you the wrong price of our meals.. Its 34.50 mon thru thur and 48.50 fri and sat. He explained there is nothing he can do and we must pay the 50 bucks a plate even though we were told 40 and the waiter made a mistake. He said the money would come out of his pocket if he changed it and was unwilling to do so. WOW, for a resteraunt that gets the attention this one gets i have never experience a more unsatisfactory experience. Needless to say that waiters tip instantly got included in the bill, NO SOUP FOR YOU. So my overall opinion would be this, with the options available in Chicago for brazilian steak houses and visiting almost all of them myself, i WILL NEVER go back to Brazzaz. Fogo de chao hands down has better food (meat). The service blew Brazzaz out of the water and the overall ambience and environment is much better. There is nothing worth anything close to $50 a plate at brazzaz. I will say the salad bar is good, if thats all you looking for. Fogo de Chao is def the best brazilian steakhouse in the city.

4027,"F*ck the pedantic pretentious pageantry of so called ""fine dining."" F*ck using the ""right fork"" and choosing the ""right wine"" and getting all dressed up like the Queen of England when you're just Bob from accounting the next morning. And f*ck you for making me put on a jacket. I get enough of that at work.  At Schwa, you're eating a mind-blowing meal cooked by hard working, bad motherf*ckers. It's upscale for the proletariat. It's food on par with Alinea in every way that actually matters. If you're reading this you likely already know that it has some quirks. These quirks don't exist to attack your lofty sense of self importance; they exist because Michael Carlson operates his business the way he needs to in order to deliver the best food he possibly can to your table. Made a reservation on the first call. Kiss my bitter Greek ass. The gorgeous, amazing girlfriend and I are both vegetarians, and chef didn't blink about it. We had no idea in advance what we were eating, as is always the case with prix fixe veg outside of seasonal vegetable menus from Trotter's, Avenues, etc... Accordingly, we brought a bottle of Martinelli Pinot, an Argentine Chardonnay, a bottle of Alsatian sparkles, and a second similar sparkler for the kitchen. We opened it all and paired as we went. Super duper rad. Apparently the best pairing for any meal is to have your favorite bottles open all night and to take whiskey shots with the kitchen. Hell yes. We poured a glass of the Martinelli for Chef and he called it ""barn-yard-y."" In a good way. Brilliant. Next time I'll bring wine for the adjacent tables as well.  The food was beyond rad and made us giggle like Dick Cheney eating a baby. There was foam and other molecular fun, but the focus was on flavor above everything else. Restaurant owners, remember. the godd@mn food actually needs to taste good. Innovation is meaningless without substance. Schwa pulls both off with aplomb.

14649,"I've been here twice and tried maybe 4 or 5 of their beers. A couple are great, and a couple are sadface. Overall I find them to be weak, some to the point of being downright watery (not in terms of alcohol content per se, but in terms of flavor).  The Bottom Up Wit is really disappointing. It's supposed to be a Belgian-style wheat, but it tastes like watered down lemonade and looks like piss. Way too much citrus, not enough BEER. Everybody's trying to be Blue Moon, and say what you will about popular mass-produced conglomerate beers, but at least Coors actually makes an enjoyable product in Blue Moon.  The Working Woman Brown Ale is utter crap. It tastes like weak funky water. As a working woman, I'm insulted. And shame on you, waitress, for recommending this abomination! HOWEVER, the Anti-Hero IPA and the Eugene Porter are both really good. The IPA doesn't actually taste like an IPA, more like a regular pale ale, but whatever's clever, it's good. The Porter is nice and smooth and has great chocolate/coffee tones.  It's a fun space, although they need to turn down the lighting earlier. I went for a first date at 9pm and it was still bright as shit in there. Hello, do a girl a solid and bathe me in flaw-minimizing glow, not raw honesty! They finally dimmed the lights at like 9:45. Just be aware, this place is lousy with hipsters and young families (!). Doesn't really bother me, but if you're looking for a gritty post-Soviet working man's bar, this isn't it (despite the theme of the bar and and the names of their beers). I haven't had much food here, but I did try a bit of the polenta fries, and they were pretty good (don't know why they're calling them fries, since they're like the shape of fish sticks, but still, good). The tomato aioli is great.

58187,"But he has nothing on!The Emperor has no clothes, folks. My crap review is going to do nothing to dilute the totals for Mr. Doug Sohn. He is clearly a true mensch, and deserves the Encased Meats Medal of Honor if there were one. He works his butt off and for that I respect him. But there are a few things worth noting:Love for HD is 50% tourists. He's listed in all the guides so tourists make the pilgrimage. This means dauntingly long lines. Hours plus. Just to get a freaking hot dog. Any other decent business owner would just hire more people. Increase capacity. We're not talking about product that cannot be made in higher numbers, or more quickly, by moving to a lager location or hiring additional staff. These sausages are NOT made by Doug or his staff. They are merely grilled or boiled by him. This is really not complicated restaurant work. The lines are the product of a SADISTIC and EGOMANIACAL restauranteur. Anyone else would just increase hours, have someone else man the front desk. Doug just needs to be the center of attention. He doesn't care if people stand in line for an hour ... it's all about HIM. There are at least 4 other places in Chicago making hot dogs and related encased meats that are just as good if not better than HD. If you want to stand in line for an hour for bragging rights or god knows what, that's fine with me. But don't pretend it's (a) for a unique experience or (b) for any reason other than to be a tourist in your own city. Making people stand in line for an hour for food that takes mere minutes to make is just wrong. And it really isn't all that good. Oh, but the tourists think so ... As Chicagoans we need to stick up for our city more. If I visited another city, waited in line an hour for a mediocre food experience, I'd look down at that city. This doesn't happen in NYC.

We brought a few bottles of wine, no corkage fees to be found on the menu, and dug in to our inexpensive meal. Chorizo tostados looked really good and not greasy at all. Taco plates are cheap as heck! I splurged and ordered shrimp fajitas, and got a positive response from the server which got me excited. Huge plate of steaming veggies and shrimp which provided plenty for leftovers the following day. As we were enjoying our wine and lingering for a few more minutes, the woman behind us stopped at our table to ask what I had ordered, as it smelled so delicious. The only downside was the guac, which on the menu for my order stated it came with avocado and rice, but it was just a squirt of somewhat industrial looking guac, but that didn't turn me off, as the veggies were so plentiful and tasty.",9/13/2011,v4YCSsb7DUKP94gjxo7Egw,_29D2rLmT_YENfHI7YxM1A,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,5,1

1285,"Not much I can add here, except a couple of observations. One from a friend from New York who now lives here. She cannot believe that people line up as they do here and that they act so civil towards one another. I had told her about barging through a line of about 50 people there one day to deliver something to Caliente Doug. She claims in New York I probably would have been attacked or otherwise maimed for that, and that people in line would not be so civil if they were New Yorkers. I hadn't thought of that angle. Even after living and working in New York. My observation about the lines is that I cannot believe that people wait OUTSIDE in 20-degree weather to get in here. I love it dearly, but can guarantee that I would never do that. Back in Oz, where I come from, no-one waits in any lines for anything or anyone. Not cubs, not Apple stores, not rock concerts, nada! Well, maybe if it's just out the door, I would...but not halfway down the block. I am thinking, too, that during our current ""economic downturn"", foreigners, out-of-towners, and other innocents who drive by Doug's must think it's a Depression bread line, a soup kitchen, or an unemployment office. My other observation is that I am both surprised and impressed by the fact that with all of the hoo-ha and fame surrounding the place, it is still humble Doug who sits there everyday, greets you, and takes your order.

Unfortunately, every other time we have gone here, the service is pretty bad. We live close and would frequent this place if it weren't for that. Also, ordering carry out from them is a nightmare. The order is often wrong, you wait around for it (they say a certain time, always add 10-15 mins before you go get it) the food is served in messy containers, and just isn't as good.

I always get the flank stank (carne asada?) and the tequila lime shrimp, and i'm always very pleased. For some reason my tab at this place runs up quick, but that is probably my own fault. I could give this place five stars but pulled one back due to two reasons: 1) i like the flank steak smothered in red sauce from El Jardin a bit more. 2) my tab is never under $70 (for two). I eat here about once every two months but would go more if my tab was closer to $50. Again, this is my fault, as ordering no margaritas would probably solve that.

Their sustenance menu could be better perfected--do NOT order the mini hot dogs or chicken wings, better elsewhere. The best : potato tater tots.

39885,"I'll have to say this place got even better. In fact I think it might be one of my favorite restaurants in the Logan Square and Bucktown area. I went back and had the frog legs in buffalo wing sauce and they were ridiculously delicious. Then the family farm pork belly steak was unbelievably tender. The most tender I have ever had. I seriously could not tell if there was fat in it or not. Now what really made it better was my confusion on my order of the sweetbreads. I actually had no idea what it was, just assuming it was type of bread. When I got it though, I found out it was actually a part of a cow. It didn't taste bad, it was just bland even with the sauce on it. Anyway, the waiter asked my thoughts towards it, and when I got into my description above, he took it off the bill. I even said no to that, and apologized, hoping I didn't offend the chef. The waiter said that their goal at the restaurant is to make sure the customers are enjoying their food, even if they're not quite sure what they're ordering.

54739,"Just a friendly warning to others...we experienced horrible service at the greektown location. We will not be back. We arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday and got a table right away. If you decide to try this place on a weekend, I would recommend going before 10am, because it did get busy at that time. We were rushed to order right when we sat down and the menu is quite extensive so we asked for a few minutes. Even though she came back twice in one minute, it wasn't that big of a deal and we ordered several things off the menu. The coffee smells a little burnt and tastes bitter--not my favorite--had to put a lot of cream in it. The juices we tried were smooth but not good flavor combinations. The donut pancakes were fine but doughy in the middle. The potatoes and eggs were fine. The service was frustrating. We weren't there but 20 minutes and they tried to clear my friend's coffee cup away from her. It was empty because no one cared to refill her cup. There were 4 young girls (hostesses?) standing behind us just staring at tables to get them to leave. Plus there was an older man breathing down my neck and instructing the bus boys to clear away everything immediately. We were still eating when they took one of our plates. We had to ask maybe 4 times in the meal to leave something on our table. I am very aware of people waiting for tables and will not stay at a busy place just sipping on coffee for hours, but I started to feel angry that we were rushed throughout the whole meal. It was rude and unnecessary. We were there for less than 40 minutes for a party of 4 spending $25-$30 each plus tip.

Yes, at times it is packed, but that is because it is a great place with great food and not only a HUGE selection of beer, but a ton of great beers. Every time I go I will order one or two of my usual and then I randomly pick 2 new ones from the beer menu. Now of course you aren't going to like every beer that you order if you do it that way because there are so many different types that you are bound to get a kind of beer that you aren't fond of. If you aren't feeling as adventurous just as one of the bartenders, who are extremely knowledgeable and are great at steering you in the right direction.The only part of me that wants to give this place anything less than 5 starts is the part that doesn't want anyone else to realize how great this place is and to have them show up and take the last seat, but the employees here have always been great so I have to give them what they deserve.",7/23/2011,kP-OqSlEUoEuePKSThQETA,4ppSyoSV1k4ve5tqwiMeYg,sR4EOfPuI-at41uIxIZPhw,Y,1,0

But Lao was the obvious choice after speaking with my Asian friends. The menu is roughly 53,281 pages long so picking an option took 35 minutes of browsing. Jokes aside, I closed my eyes and picked one. With my horrible luck I ended up getting one of the most boring and bland dishes they serve. But others ordered a spicy beef dish and fried pork which were nothing short of outstanding. I was grabbing seconds and thirds as I pushed my order to the side.

41315,"Hmm. I was unimpressed by place. I hope I don't sound like a complete snob, but when you're spending a certain amount of money you expect top notch everything. First off we ended up getting seated 35 minutes late for our 8pm reservation. After viewing other reviews, it seems like this place has an issue with this. We came for the steak. Like most people do when they go to a steak house. It was over cooked to begin with. But they also serve food on 500 degree plates. With nothing to cover the borders. You're warned of this, but aren't they aware that meat would continue to cook at that high of a temp? Half way thru my steak it became inedible. Disappointing for a 40 dollar fillet. Also food doesn't look presentable. They didnt wipe the plates so there is grease and whatnot splattered all around. Making your dish look unappetizing. We ordered side dishes. Mashed potatoes, asparagus, and spinach. All of which were pretty lack luster and the portions weren't as large as Gibsons and the price was about the same. Wine suggestion was pretty blah too. We bought by the glass, I believe it was called undercut or something similar. I probably wont be back. There are better places to go for steak in my opinion.",5/13/2010,ziRPoqEkeWX6q1912wpEeg,fktJEUOdL5VTYQTaDEa2Cg,n-mj6IJkWyCu4BuD2dvm0A,N,5,1

40379,"My favorite thing about La Pasadita is that they confuse the hell out of you by having a few locations right next to/across the street from one another. It always makes me laugh. I usually go to the location farthest North on the West side of Ashland. I love this place. They do things the way it was intended to be done. I ordered 2 steak tacos and they come with onions and cilantro. Simple and delicious. I'm a big tomato fan and had them throw some tomatoes on since I was feeling frisky this afternoon. The reason I recommend this place is that I never get those big fatty chunks of meat in my steak. There's nothing worse than digging a fat chunk out of your mouth mid-chew and leaving it on your plate for others to stare at while finishing your dinner. Besides that, the steak is incredibly tasty. Not sure what cut/marinade they use but I really love the flavor. They also have big squirt bottles of green salsa sitting out on the counter for you to grab as you sit down for a little extra kick. La Pasadita can't be beat. It's not just cheap food, it's authentic, great tasting Mexican food that you must try. Stop in anytime and give it a chance.

5258,"Cheese, Swine & Wine - what more do you need to know? I was in town for work staying at the Intercontinental and wanted to find a place nearby to get a light dinner and glass of wine. I walked in as a party of 1 and only had to wait a few minutes as the hostess tried to determine which communal table to place me at. The bar was completely full but since they had several communal tables I only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The tables are a bit tight on space - they are high with as many chairs that will fit as possible. I'll assume she realized that I was not from here and wouldn't be able to handle the cold and sat me inside away from the door. ;p The wine list was fairly long with Italian and Spanish varietals which will pair perfectly with the tapas style dishes. There was a lot to select from and it was so hard to pick just a couple of dishes as there were many I wanted to try, but this would be a great place to come with a few others to share many dishes. I started with the Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette and then got the Jamon Serrano with mushrooms and farm fresh egg. I was bummed they didn't have the butterscotch pudding but had their affogato which came with chocolate soft serve - different, almost like having a mocha. Overall my meal was very good, only complaint was that my grilled bread was a little over grilled so it was very hard to cut through the crust. Had great conversations with a few strangers at the communal table - funny that 2 were from California.",11/20/2010,CyqC9SCVtAUHaE5aqE-K,VeuwCtfmB4VyXWuUYbZp8w,boE4Ahsssqic7o5wQLI04w,N,4,1

52072,"Gino's East is a solid four stars. I had this pizza the night after I had Lou Malnati's, and the deep dish here was so much better. Ordered the deep dish sausage patty pizza with mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. Delicious - the sausage literally covers the entire surface area of the pie, which ensures that you get a bite of sausage with every bite of pizza. The cheese was also good - not too overwhelming. I also liked the fact that the tomato sauce was chunky, and more than enough to keep this pizza moist. My favorite part of this pie was probably the corn meal crust - it it not a doughy crust that others use, but dryer and more like corn bread... really unique. The wait can get tedious at times - don't come here with a huge group if you want to get in. 2-4 is probably the best option, but you are looking at 45 minutes to an hour just to get seated, and then another 45 minutes to get your pizza. They don't put your order in ahead of time like they do at Lou's, but this pizza is so much better and worth it.",12/13/2009,qMT-lU1PtBlFoyB55C1Uqw,fiDcrSANmmljv-6nl_gPtQ,ibreTMGGaQSanZttUchjKg,N,5,1

24402,"Like a few other reviewers, we also came here with the Gilt City certificate. At around 7:30 on a Thursday night, the restaurant was crawling with businessmen and their clients. While we waited to be seated, we ordered drinks at the bar. If you check in on foursquare there is a $1.99 sangria deal! When we were seated we received the pan con tomate, which really reminded me of when I lived in Spain. Just a simple piece of garlic toast with tomato. Delicious. We then received a beautiful bowl of Spanish olives, some Spanish salami and a cheese plate. The salami portion was huge and the flavor was insanely good. My favorite part was the cheese selection with apples and a burnt caramel sauce of sorts. The meal was off to a great start. We continued with our 2nd course, which was a selection of tapas. My favorites were the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. They were rich-almost could have been a dessert. The ravioli stuffed with butternut squash and lamb were also very tasty.The gambas al ajillo were done very well, as they were a dish I would often order while living in Spain. Moving to the 3rd course, I really liked the jumbo prawns with their heads still on. There were only 2 of them to share, but their flavor was incredible. The rib eye was a little tough for my liking and my boyfriend's pieces were full of gritty fat. The spinach with currants was also decent, but was missing something. Seeing as I was already pretty full, I was ok not loving our 3rd course as much as the 1st and 2nd. Dessert were small chocolate croquetas that were served with a rosemary caramel and banana marshmallow. I thought these were the perfect mini dessert. They weren't too sweet and the portion was great after such a large meal. I enjoyed my time at Mercat. The decor is great and the dishes come out at a reasonable pace.

The sides were great, as was the fresh pico de gallo, guacamole, and chipotle mayo sauce it came with. My girlfriend's veggie burrito was huge, fresh, and delicious (according to her)--and only $5.25. The salsa that came w/ the tortilla chips at the beginning was great, too. 2. Service. We went in on a Wednesday afternoon around 3:30--not a time when many waiters/waitresses are in the best and most attentive of moods--and our server was fantastic. He was happy, with a genuine smile, and very attentive. And our food came out really quickly. 3. Cost. Not an out and out steal of a deal, but really great Mexican food for a very reasonable price.

60269,"I decided to give this place another chance and go to the store and place an order. I ordered a Four Cheese pizza. I am not an ""all-cheese"" pizza fan (except for this one pizzeria on Manhattan's Upper West Side ) but figured that was the best menu item to start with. I was pleasantly surprised.I think that the smell of food is just as important as the food itself. It was a good sign that the pizza smelled great and you can actually pick up some of the ingredients. The pizza had a great balance of crust to topping. The crust was light- not at all heavy and or ""powdery"". The spices were subtle, but clearly apparent and were not overpowered by the sauce or cheese. The sauce was excellent, lightly flavored and not acidic or too sweet. All the ingredients came together to make an excellent pizza.I thought it was impressive that after my pizza was done, the baker took it to the manager (owner?), opened the box, and had him look at it. He shook his head with approval and I was handed it. I have rarely seen that kind of attention paid to food.The establishment was nice, clean, and large enough to hang out in.

Anyway, the service was prompt at the beginning but slowed down towards the end. During the meal, I was a bit cold. Many of the other patrons that were also seated in the back of the restaurant, appeared chilly too. They literally zipped up their sweaters, put on their hoods or switched chairs to avoid the drafts. However, despite the coldness, the food was delivered quickly and warm. For appetizers, we had yucca fritas and croquetas. From just one bite, you can tell that they can easily fill you up ( super starchy/heavy foods). So, some advice: eat sparingly to save room for your meal.  As for our meals, I had the pork chops and my brother had the lechon. My pork chops were thick and juicy! My brother's entree was a little dry but had a lot of flavor. We both really enjoyed the rice, beans, and sweet plantains. The sides really stood because they're simple but were seasoned and cooked well!

He always welcomes you into his establishment with a smile and you can't help but be in a good mood when you leave. I support this restaurant because it is in my neighborhood and they have been going through some rough financial times (there is a great tear-jerking article about this place in Time Out Chicago). I believe supporting businesses that continually go above and beyond - these are the nicest people and the food is good, so I try and go once a week.Now for the food...the curry is flavorful - I recommend the Clay Pot Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry.

48603,"My experience at the Publican exceeded my expectations! Beautiful, simple and relaxing decor -- a welcome departure from culinary venues that are painfully hip or pretentious. Excellent servers that knew the ingredients (including their source) inside and out, with great beer and wine pairings. Top notch ingredients and very generous portion sizes. The unctuous, pure flavor in the Pork Belly was paired with expertly prepared Brussels Sprouts. Someone else mentioned the mussels: fresh and steamed to perfection, they were simply sensational. The Publican convinced me that Chicago is the spiritual home of pork!",10/19/2011,6MvTcWDTmabfM2LfEgnUcw,6an3LKeQe5bGbM5uNVc_JQ,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg,N,5,1
4599,"Hm, more like a 3.5, but everything was just a little pinch away from being mindblowingly delicious. The bf and I needed a late dinner, yes we dine at 11:30, and apparently this was the place to be! Friends recommended the place, since we're from out of town, and I'm really glad we went. Amazing wine selection that's perfect for pairing with all of the yummy snacks. Had the fried pig ear, which was darn tasty, but a little too salty...can't say it was an OMG UMAMI PORK moment, but it worked well with the crispy kale. MM! Artichoke heart antipasti was way too salty for me, and I throw on the salt when it comes to home cooking. We had the balsamico, mortadella, pistachio spread and it was beautifully presented with a web of balsamic reduction laced on top. The only downside to the aesthetic was that the vinegar reduction drowned out the subtleties of the rest of the dish. Evening's best dish was the gargantuan cave man turkey leg. Tender, falling of the bone and greasalicious (I mean that in the best possible way...). Highly recommend that, as it is probably the largest dish on the menu and only $15!",8/14/2012,rkE3-9kgX4HIPsCenO3r0Q,E0OgqykcWdz-VWye_GXAVQ,boE4Ahsssqic7o5wQLI04w,N,4,1
35902,"This place is special. When I lived in Chicago, I used to go here about 3-4 times a month for Beijing duck and Yang Chow fried rice (and other delicious things). I recently moved to San Francisco hoping that there would be something similar. Nope.  I had reluctantly moved to Chicago and I can't imagine what my life would have been like without Sun Wah. You will have hard time finding anything like this restaurant anywhere in the US (Boston, NYC, SF included). The Beijing duck treatment for $37 can feed 4 normal people (comes with a full duck, buns, duck soup, and duck fried rice) and the taste is absolutely unbeatable. When there are bigger groups, I get the roast anything (duck, pork) and a Yang Chow fried rice. Other dishes are not bad, either. The quantity is very good, too.  Enjoy while you can! I certainly no longer can :(",1/12/2011,onjhDo8NyU8xfm,7jjAG0ELeN-SFpxPtBv2rw,KomhK0JD5cleEW55YTw7MQ,N,4,1

Shaw's won out because I have never tried it and was able to secure a reservation on a Friday night through opentable. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the overwhelming fishy smell. Most high end places I have frequented don't smell like that. We were seated in a comfy area in the old-fashioned restaurant. I loved the pictures on the wall of Charles Shaw and the first crab shacks way back when. it definitely has history and character.  We ordered the cold seafood platter and sampled cocktail shrimp, oysters, King crab bites and crab claws. All of it was very good. Next up was seafood linguini and 2 sushi rolls (Spicy tuna and I have already forgotten the other one). Decent. Didn't love it, but didn't hate it.

As that, the chairs are kind of uncomfortable, being faux wrought iron. Besides that, the food was very good. The corn muffins with honey butter were brought out hot and were delicious! I might go back just to have some of those and soup. Appetizers of crab cake and celery root soup were very tasty, though the celery soup was one-dimensional. Entrees of catfish and pork chop were good was well, catfish was more tasty and tender, but baked pean puree on the chop plate was interesting. For drinks they had a nice tea selection and nicely presented, while I had the 'homemade' ginger beer, which was very tasty and refreshing. Service was very nice and friendly from the lady server, if not a little overbearing, but that may have been b/c of the lack of other customers at the time.

58159,"Incredible!My fiancee and I brought some friends in from Boston last week and we were all blown away by our experience. From top to bottom, this was a great evening. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. Although a little difficult to find (it's inconspicuously located in the Blackstone Hotel) the decor and vibe is perfect. Great attention to detail.We were seated within five minutes of our reservation and our table was smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. Great views and plenty of space.Our server (Fred on the check) was over promptly to tell us about the menu and offer drink suggestions. Although the restaurant was packed, we all felt like we were shown plenty of attention. After a great description of the menu and cuisine, we decided to be adventurous and go with the chef's tasting menu. We were not disappointed! It was three courses and about 16 different items, all spectacular. Fred was there throughout the meal to make sure we knew all the ingredients and flavors as well as to explain the wine pairings we decided to get.Food highlights: Bacon wrapped dates; serrano fig salad; short rib pizza thing; lamb chops; patatas bravasWine highlights: Gine and Gine was our favorite on the chef's wine pairing. Fred wrote down all of the wines for us so we could buy them at home!For dessert, Fred had the chef make a dessert sampler for us as we couldn't decide between the four or five that were offered! Desserts were OK to good, but didn't quite hold up to the incredible meal we just had.Our friends were very impressed and even more impressed when we found out that the chef just won the Iron Chef competition! We'll definitely be back! Thanks, Mercat!!!",2/16/2010,TJgdn0GSOnvsCt_r70n5QQ,mqVVhP9VdaJcjA4OPgDqHQ,o4NcUfco7JxOcyfKFWyAhg,Y,4,0
26830,"The food is wonderful, but authentic. I say 'but' because some might not anticipate getting an entire chicken leg in their soup. You might. It's delicious, by the way. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because it's small, cramped, always crowded (expect a line - be pleasantly surprised if there isn't one), there are usually families with kids, if you don't get a booth you end up at a long communal table, and some booths are near the door (which is always open because of the line which might make for chilly eating).

It's like that friend who flirts with your chick, threw up on your carpet during your birthday party and always shows up fifteen minutes late to everything. Douchey but you still love em. There's enough praises about the pizza and the brews but one of the main things I love is that it's a great place to bring big groups (6+ people) when you wanna hang out in Wicker Park and sometimes do it at a moment's notice. It's a big space, the beer selection is great, there's games on the screens and the crowd is pretty diverse so that really does make the hour to two hour wait bearable. Their Golden Arm is a great light beer to drink in the summer heat and by the time you sit down for your pizza you won't be (too) shitfaced.

Also, in my opinion, the cadillac margaritas are worth it ... stronger and not as sweet!

All was well especially the service until at the close of dinner we realized shards of glass in the steaksauce. It is, I suppose customary and more classy to put the steak sauce in small white procelain containers We had maybe three given to our table so we shared the sauce. My brother kept crunching on something he remembers but thought it was the char on the outside of the steak (he takes his well done).When we complained to management, they handled it well until they informed us that they would only take care of my brother sisters portion of the bill. No matter how good the food was we were all placed in potential danger and definitely inconvenienced. For the trouble I think it would have been their pleasure, being the type of establishment it was to pay for everyone at the table. However, they took our information for their incident report and apologized numerously for the inconvenience. In the meantime our server was even embarrased that the check was not handled. Oh management did give a $75.00 gift certificate to my brother and sister together. We chose to use it because we will never eat there again.

I always liked going and fondly remember the miles-long salad bar. It has been forever since I've been to RJ's, and never to this locale. It was pretty much as I remember it: kitschy, strange and pretty decent food. As we left, the hubs said he now knows where the idea for Applebee's and the like came from.

I also met the owner who was a super Irish fella. All I know is, they have a good selection of beers and literally the best Fish & Chips I've ever had in my life. My cousin told me to put curry on the fish & chips and before I could respond (cuz apparently I gave him a crazy look) he said ""trust me"".

57347,"I wanted to try Coast so badly based on all the good reviews and recommendations from people. I made reservations for a Friday night. I was pretty disappointed with the table we were given, which was right in the middle of traffic, but they had nothing else available. The restaurant was very crowded and so loud that we could hardly talk to each other without shouting. We could, however, easily hear the lady one table over with a loud, aggravating voice. It is a really big place for a sushi restaurant, and it doesn't look like much has been done to reduce noise issues and keep an intimate atmosphere. So my much-awaited Coast excursion had a very rocky start. The sushi, however, was extremely good. If it weren't for the amazing sushi, I probably wouldn't bother going back. But I will probably try this place again - perhaps on a non-weekend night or with a different group who has better hearing :-)",11/15/2008,B_Xj6-l-pmMijgZPu4Ge0w,jlfy2GaGUfiDQzUDt1srIQ,mlhHPnHmjO2_ypcP5Vc9Zw,Y,4,0

59443,"I gave the place four stars, but it's really more like 4-1/2. We were all very impressed with Giordano's. After spending princely sums on restaurants in Chicago and getting, well, not what we felt was our money's worth, this fine pizzeria was a breath of fresh air. The service was excellent, even though the place was packed, the pizza and appetizers we got were hot and very good. I'm not a deep-dish pizza lover, but I had some of my daughter's and I wished I had ordered it. Even so, the ""thin"" crust pizza my son and I shared was superb and more than enough for the both of us, plus some for a doggy bag. The final tab, less tip, for six people was $72. That's one of the least expensive meals we had in Chicago, and easily the tastiest. I highly recommend Giordano's.",12/17/2011,iNBuUafDKMcvpWfKcUrFBg,7PYoGzjtDqElSPvF1ACEKQ,z_qEuUuRWIq4O-YufXHf1w,Y,1,0

I'm pretty sure it was only that day because the second time I came back it was pretty good then. Typical pricing for korean bbq, great food, service was typical.

29633,"Some friends wanted to come visit Chicago and their itinerary was the Christkindl Market, a matinee of Banana Shpeel, and dinner at Frontera Grill. She tried to make reservations like two weeks in advance but was told that although they were no longer taking reservations for that night that we'd be fine if we came in when they opened at five, which seemed fine. So we get there at five o'clock and there's already a line, which is fine. But then you get up to the host stand and it's five people in the party and it's 25 minutes to sit at a table in the bar and, she says with bitchiest laugh and something that seemed unpleasantly similar to an eyeroll, ""Like two hours *haughty grunt/sigh/bitchy laugh* for a table in the main dining room. And it's like, even this would be fine because restaurant hosts are genetically engineered to be maximumly haughty, irritating, and delusional. So we're told twenty five minutes and shooed away from the host stand to the corral around the bar. Meanwhile, they're not seating anyone despite that every table in the restaurant is empty. No explanation of, ""We start seating at such and such time,"" or anything like that. Just stand at the bar and watch them set up what is clearly your table and keep standing there for a HALF HOUR after the table has been set up. My friend walked over to the host stand and said there were like seven people standing around looking bored. I suggested to my boyfriend that perhaps they were staggering seating so the servers and the kitchen didn't get overloaded. He's in the restaurant industry and replied that they need more waiters then because any decent restaurant should be able to accommodate all of their tables being filled at once.  It's ridiculous and insulting to leave people standing like that without a word of explanation. After that experience I think I would never return there and I probably will try to steer my guests from that place as well. So we sit down and I'm not feeling particularly hungry at the moment. And, no thank you, I didn't want anything to drink either but our hostess ordered some vegetarian appetizers and once I had some grease in my system I mellowed out a bit.  The guacamole was pretty good. The deep fried quesadilla things were just all right and mostly just made me crave empanadas from Buenos Aires Forever. My favorite were the plantains with sour cream. She also got the mushroom fundido and that was good but I wasn't sure it really did it for me. I also liked the salsas that came with the chips. I ordered then an Autumn Margarita, which seened like it had too many ingredients, but I ordered it anyway and it was kind of busy but sort of all right. I was assured that there would be plenty of vegetarian options because Rick Bayless's daughter is reportedly a vegetarian. These options consisted of mushroom tacos (substitute out the beans) and some MIlanesa de Verdura thing which was basically like breaded and fried turnip slices and such with mashed beans and cabbage. It was fine but it seemed more like a plate of side dishes without an entree. It looks more substantial in the picture on the website but the problem isn't the amount of food on the plate, it's the fact that it's so underwhelming. It was just kind of boring. The desserts we tried were the pecan pie, the flan duo, and Bunuelos Navidenos, some mexican holiday pastry ice cream thing. None of them was particularly amazing but they were all right, in the order I listed them. The pecan pie was actually pretty good. I think I might have enjoyed everything a little better if I hadn't been so put out by the first forty minutes in the restaurant. I mean, I would think they'd want to get people seated right away so they could have them out the door by seven o'clock. Weird and rude is how I felt about that.",5/17/2010,DMTijXgngMdAswonRU-9wg,oJe0bYXVtx9vnzNWZCRrBQ,XgGUnYs2bjbbNvBefFtWxA,N,5,1

The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu, very polite and did a fabulous job. The food was incredible. We both ordered the Alaskan king crab. The sizes of these legs were so huge and delicious. We both felt we have eaten the best crab ever in our lives. I definitely got my moneys worth. Hands down the best in the city, if not the entire Midwest.

2798,"My wife (she was my girlfriend at the time) and I went here to celebrate our 10th anniversary of dating. We each did the chef's menu, and our summary of our experience is: there was not a single course that made us say, ""I would eat a whole entree of that."" The only course I remember is a salmon with barbecue sauce that I swear tasted 100% exactly like the flavored powder on Lay's K.C. Masterpiece potato chips. Now, I like Lay's K.C. Masterpiece potato chips, but this is not the way to stand out with flavor. What was good? The sommelier and the wine selection. The service, while a little too formal for my tastes, was also spot on. Also, while we weren't in love with the flavors, the presentations and textures of each dish were absolutely outstanding.

Started out with some cheese empanadas which were crispy and oozing with cheese. Ordered a limonada (like a lemonade but made to order with fresh squeezed limes highly recommended!). Then had the combination platter with the skirt steak and grill octopus. Now I usually expect octopus to be pretty bland so I order it more for the texture than the taste. But the grill octopus was so juicy and flavorful that my friends kept grabbing them off my plate! The steak was also equally if not better than the octopus. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfectly pink and oh so tender. It was SO GOOD I immediately think about it every time I hear ""steak."" lol Service was a bit slow but expected since we had such a huge group and the place was super packed and crowded.

The space was more kid-friendly that I expected - it's a sports bar atmosphere with music, but not unbearably loud, at least not during the late lunch hour when we visited. I tried the oatmeal stout beer and liked it very much. So far so good. We ordered a plain style pizza (which means it has parmesan but not mozzarella cheese). After a longish wait (20-30? minutes) our pizza arrived with the crust looking plainly overcooked. Our server managed not to notice or care. The crust was hard enough that cutting it with a knife and fork for my daughter was a real challenge. It's hard to factor out this rather essential failing in trying to assess what the pizza might be like if properly prepared. To its credit, it was missing the thick layer of greasy mozzarella that ruins 99% of thin crust pizza in Chicago. The sauce was a little on the light side both in quantity and taste with a strong lightly cooked garlic flavor. Overall, this was a major disappointment for such a highly touted pizza joint, and the fact that our server seemed totally oblivious to the clearly subpar product she served us only compounded the feeling.",11/28/2010,dAXRorifE64vKGfjlgfJkw,h6AqYcz0S1HfZM4UeVSing,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA,Y,5,0

60048,"OK, so we've been to Big Jones on three consecutive Saturdays for brunch. The food is unbelievably freaking good. The cuisine is ""coastal southern"" which works out to lots of hearty southern fare with a more than your usual mix of seafood, crabcakes, etc. This isn't diner food -- while brunch is clearly a great idea, it's up a notch from the Golden Nugget. The food is, without question, among my favorites in Chicago. It's also locally and sustainably sourced, which is rad. Things I like there: they do a biscuits and gravy that is so complicated you feel like that traditional white gravy was somehow cheating you. It's a redeye gravy over sweet potato biscuits, and comes with a big pile of southern greens and andoulle sausage. Mwah! The Eggs New Orleans is also ridiculously good. Poached eggs over crab cakes over hash brown potatoes. So money. There's other things to like about Big Jones -- wait staff is friendly and prompt, decor is interesting, drink list is complicated and good (a Bloody Mary is thick with actual spices and veggies, not pulped mixer). But mostly, it's the food. The glorious food. I never have a problem getting seated right away, and at $10-15 for most of the good stuff, it's a steal.

We arrived on time and were informed that it would be a few minutes until a table was ready due to several tables not turning over.After 45 minutes past our reservation, there was still no table available. All we were told was that our table was finished but wasn't leaving and they could not tell us when we would be seated, nor did they make any efforts to offer us a round of drinks or any other accomodation.There is simply no excuse to not honor a reservation after 45 minutes or to find some other way to accomodate us. The whole point of having a reservation is to enable the guests to coordinate and plan an evening.

1648,"I don't know what else to add to all the great things that have been said about Hot Dougs. So Instead I'll list some of my favorite encased meats that Doug offers.  -Pork and blue Cheese sausage. The cheese and sauce differ from time to time but I make sure that the sausage includes smoked almonds. The almonds are the key. If they aren't included, I look at the alternatives offered. -Atomic Ribeye sausage. This is my favorite of the bunch. I don't see it that often but when it's on the menu, I get in my car and go go gooooo!  Beefy and spicy! Well worth the $8 sticker price! -Boar sausages. The kind of sausage sometimes differs but the boar taste comes through. It's meaty but diiferent than the beef sausages. Excellent! If you are just looking for a chicago-style hot dog, go someplace else. Not that Hot Dougs doesn't do a great version, because it does but you can get chicago dog without having to wait over an hour anyplace else.  I haven't been back in a couple months because I just can't wait in line the reported 2 hours+ that people seems to be writing about. I'm glad that Doug is getting the praise because it is well deserved.

Had only eaten Ethiopian food once, long ago, but I was hungry enough to give it another try and I was not disappointed.We were seated within five minutes despite the flood of patrons coming from the concert. Service was prompt and super nice. Just as we were about to place our drink order, the owner came by with a tray of free samples of the homemade honey wine. It was so good, we ordered a bottle.At his suggestion, we started with some chicken sambussas - crispy, flaky turnovers with a sweet spicy sauce (move over empanadas).We let our server - who was also from Ethiopia - decide the rest. There was lamb and tilapia, lentils and collard greens, some spicy some not.It was all wonderful. Then at the end, another surprise. When they found out we had just come from a concert nearby, they took 5 dollars off of our bill. Some kind of ongoing promotion.We will definitely be back.

60788,"This place is definitely dedicated to its concept, a metal/prison theme complete with smoke machine and laser show in sync with the concert DVD playing on the wall of flat screen television, tin prison plates, and (perhaps oddest of all) black linen napkins. This place could be cheesy but luckily falls short of too over-the-top.The food was superb and the service was very good. I say this as a guy that has lived around the area for a few years and has been waiting for a place that not only has good burgers, but is as dedicated to the idea of the perfect burger as Kuma's Corner over in Avondale or the Rocking Horse in Logan Square. Yes this sounds like a bit of a hyperbole, but I was stricken with love at first sight with the Cruelty to Animals, a gigantic mound of ground beef topped with three different kinds of pork.My gf was pleased with the only vegetarian option, the Identity Theft (a fried eggplant sandwich) but was more impressed with the dessert, the Community Service (Banana Wontons).The beer list is also worth taking a long look at. There are some great choices in addition to the standard domestic drafts I avoid like the plague. The prices seem on par with other establishments I have been to of late. I think it is important to note that my gf and I are not metal fans. This is important because we still had no major issue with the music. Sure it was a little loud, but this is a metal bar and we only had to raise our voices a little bit to talk to each other or the server (as opposed to screaming).",2/4/2010,2cweo076b7cYEChiNdnwNQ,w9b84GIsoN-jjXCK634Ngg,oCTlReyKjJxKPFYfCurxxQ,Y,4,0

44566,"What Alliance lacks in food and rink, it makes up for in atmosphere. The best coffee shop to work or study at in the area, easily. I live near Alliance and head there regularly to do all of the usual coffee shop things. The staff is always attentive, friendly and professional and the coffee is consistently good.  There's better coffee out there, but I haven't had a bad cup at Alliance. I wouldn't recommend any of the espresso drinks, though. The americanos are good, but any of the milk espresso drinks can be passed on. Maybe I haven't found the right treat yet, but most of the cookies and pastries I've tried as Alliance have been underwhelming. You're paying for presentation. The real draw to Alliance Bakery is their lounge next door. It's usually fairly full, but you can almost always find a table for yourself. Being separate from the kitchen noise of the bakery helps to keep the lounge nice and quiet, and aside from the occasional conversation the clientele tends to preserve that quiet. It's perfect for working and studying. There isn't a better coffee shop in the area if you are looking to hang out for a while.

Oh and real quick: don't order a dirty martini, they will cane you with their mind. 10. The magic begins to happen, and I stare back at him in awe. He's pulling out bottles left and right, throwing things in the air which I could swear are coming back down in quantities more than what had begun. Adding, subtracting, carving ice cubes to fit the glass like a glove. 11. He comes to me and I say ""Thank you"" and reach for the glass, to where he says ""Uh uh, I'm not done yet"". As he is describing all of these things he has used, he squeezes the orange peel above my glass and lights it on fire to which there's a little flame POOF! ""It's very herb-forward, let me know if I didn't hit the nail on the head."" 12. Glass up, lips perked, and go! The cocktail hits my tongue and immediately all moisture is sucked out of my face.

Brought a bottle of wine and Omar brought us out some chips and salsa and took our order for guacamole immediately. After guac we decided to go for the new empanada sampler appetizer. Super crispy and extra doughy. While I would pass on the chicken in the future, the sweet plantain and spinach and cheese empanadas were excellent. I have to point out that the Pico De Gallo served with the empanadas was AMAZING. It had a ton of cilantro and fresh cut tomatoes. I will definitely ask for this in the future for chip dipping. Our excellent server, Omar was working the whole room and as he took our order made it a point to let us know, customers preference rules at Irazu. I felt no guilt as I constructed THE WORLD'S MOST PERFECT BURRITO EVER! It was a large warm tortilla overfilled with Black beans, YELLOW rice, Cheese, Avocados, Sour Cream, CHORIZO, Spinach and Mushrooms. And yes the rumors are true, I could barely finish half it was soo huge. My friend loved her veggie burrito but my other friend did not like her fried pork dish. It was completely over-fried (Is this possible? Apparently so.). We all loved the side of sweet plantains.  At the end I was disappointed that I was too full for a ""famous"" oatmeal shake but Omar told me I could pop in anytime to grab one on the go. A few minutes later, a bread pudding was magically ordered and it was a block of thick rich cinnamon deliciousness. Done and done.

They have a few made-to-order desserts that have to be ordered at the beginning so that they're ready by the time you're done with your main entree. Make sure to leave some room because they're delish!!",5/22/2009,QTkok1Nn6exQG6LkmwKC9Q,6yoMsVSh2Q-val6qMp95nQ,4wreIFjaPMppyEnzKHbozg,N,4,1
28409,"Can the gringo out mexican the mexicans? We enjoyed our brunch at Frontera, but it wasn't the second coming. I made reservations for nine people. It was decided by popular vote that I ordered the best entree: three little corn cakes, topped with egg, shredded chicken, or chorizo and plantains in a bowl of smoky black bean puree drizzled with crema. I've made black bean soup, from canned and dried beans many, many times but Frontera did something special to make this humble dish a standout (homemade broth? hours of boiling with a ham hock?) The agua del dia was delicious: cucumber, pineapple, and parsley. The misses: the red pozole was bland, the broth watery. And the special, a wet tamale, was way too salty, which drowned out the delicate spices Annoying: the waiter trying to upsell with the bottled water (after we'd already been served tap water, which tasted fine) and pushing the appetizer plate ($7.50 per person, for guacamole, ceviche, quesadilla, and taquitos. no offense, they're probably pretty good, but we could get a knockoff version at taco bell) Instead, we ordered the more interesting capitale quesadilla, which are deep fried, cheese filled empanadas, the guac and the ceviche (too sweet) Bright, festive decor.",7/11/2008,X9rSlbB7LZllJO9Lbs,ukyaLTQy1KuRQ2sQXWqTEg,DXwSYgiXqIVNdO9dazel6w,N,3,1

36146,"The general rule is to avoid the specials when you eat out at restaurants. That's just a clever way for a chef to unload ingredients that are about to go bad. The rules do not apply at Meli! No holds barred! Anything goes! Yes, their ""regular"" menu is excellent, but sometimes you'll find some legitimate gems on that little piece of paper found on the inside cover of the menu. Last time I was there: crab and black truffle omelet. And yes, it was as amazing tasting as it sounds. Yeah, it can be a long wait, but it's never that painful and actual service when you get seated is quite snappy. Oh, and one time we saw the new mayor of Chicago come in for coffee!

We waited in line since the place is very small and intimate. When we got inside, I was impressed, darkly lit, cute, laid back, that's what I like! The bartender was hilarious and friendly as we ordered drinks. Cocktails were $12 which is totally reasonable and they were delicious. I like my sweet girly drinks so I had the Pimms #5 that tasted just heaven. I could spend hours there just chatting and talking with people.

61122,"We stopped by to check out the remodel. The remodel is great...the food is best left for 4:00 am. I had a garlic shrimp dish. The main issue I had is that they should put the shrimp in a separate dish. It was bathed in butter. Now I like butter as much as the next guy, but I like the ability to shake the butter off, or dip it in. Instead, the butter ran across the surface of the dinner plate. So, the iceberg lettuce and my rice were sopped in butter. A little harder to shake butter off rice. The quesadillas were also strangely, seemingly dipped in butter before fried. The side of beans, had oil (or perhaps butter) pooling on the edges. The margarita tasted like it came out of a slurpee machine. The taco meat on the other hand was lacking flavor and was a bit dry...not buttery at all.On the plus side - the place looks good and is clean. The bathrooms were nice. The waitstaff was attentive.

The food was very good, although the wait staff was a little too attentive, often interrupting conversations to ask questions and offer more. The drinks were good as well.

As for rice, the dill rice is both traditional and clearly the best.Their hummus and babaganush were very good, though not extraordinary. Desserts look like the Middle Eastern classics, whichto my taste buds, come through as all the same.I've both eat in and taken out -- they don't stint on the take-out, and itsvery reasonable, even if you have company.

32665,"What to say...oh sooo much. This is for first time trials to an Ethiopian restaurant, like my experience. So let me dig into it (literally). First things first, the lunch buffet is no longer existing, BUT they do have the lunch specials. There is no sheet that mentions it, it's only word of mouth so listen closely and ask you waiter(ess). For $7.95 you choose 3 different clumps of thick pasty ""stews"" that include beef or vegetables, as mild or spicy. We had the beef Michetabish that had a nice flavor. It will come out on a round platter with Injera and a separate side of Injera (a large circular flatbread of a 20 inch diameter made of sourdough fermented with teff flour--see photos from demera for an example I included). Not only is it used to serve the food on but also comes to scoop up the food with (you won't find silverware anywhere around and use should use your right hand as custom says). I could go on and on poetically describing the Injera but the unique consistency is of a soft rubbery ""makeshift utensil"" like a children's play goo and looks like carpet padding with all the little holes. That's the best I can do. The taste has a sour hint to it too, hence the sourdough base. Lastly, the portions are very large, even the lunch specials! We tried the Chicken and Vegetable Sambussa appetizer which were delicious dough triangles stuffed with what it names. The Ethiopian tea was tasty with a cinnamon after taste (unfortunately, I noticed that it was brewed with teabags instead of loose leaf, but still good). The servers are from Ethiopia along with all the decorations and music. The waitresses are very nice and smiley, and they try their best to explain the items on the menu. At the same time, they leisurely assist you and you will often have to call them over if you need anything.

58678,"We went too this restaurant tonight and I had the most embarrasing time of my life. I have never reviewed a resturant. I have had some bad meals and some good meals. I cannot say that my problem was with the meal or for that matter with the particular young man that helped us. But with the establishment as a whole and the philosophy of the place. Our bill for two came out to $76+. Kind of hefty for a mid week chinese meal. But then again this is not a problem either. OK so here is the problem. We ordered some appetizers and then we ordered the main dish the Hot Pot. They brought the food to the table and we thought that at $16.95 per person the food they brought us belonged to us. But no only the food you eat is yours. Yes the fine print on the menu says that you cannot take away the hot pot left overs, didn't see that. But then again who would expect that if you bring food to the table you are going to take it back. So why, well there could only be one good reason, because they bring you the food and if you don't eat it they serve it to someone else. Highly illegal and quite unsanitary, I might add. Why else would they tell us that we could not take home the food that was on our plate. We ended up getting into an argument in the middle of the dining room. I have never had that happened before and I have dined all over the world.So tomorrow I plan to file a complaint with the health department. These people are reserving food. plain and simple, no other reason why they will not let people take food home that is already on the table.So worst restaurant experience of my life.Oh, I forgot to mention the waiter that came yelling at us and almost dropped his false teeth from his mouth.",8/9/2012,QjO8b2hC-kNiMugLrcrw0g,54SkvVv3RTbYJ3UkpGR-vA,yBRaSkuYwFhYEoucDyD0lA,Y,2,0

The lentils and the corncake had similiar textures, so it made the dish a little boring. The lime helped a bit... For my entree, I had the monkfish with braised taro. Nicely made. There was some mango salsa for the fish which was refreshing but nothing special. I'm not a big fan of bread pudding but fellow yelpers raved about it so I got it.

My only complaint is that our server, Daniel, had zero personality and it seemed as if we may have even been bothering him by just being there.The only way I knew his name was from looking at our check to see his name printed on it as he made sure not to introduce himself but merely said, what do you want to drink ?, what do you want to eat ? and Anything else or the check?'. There is a reason this place has a huge wait,(it's not Daniel), and its worth every minute to do so.

59234,I am so picky when I eat Chinese food and finding good Chinese seems to be so hard in this city....but this place has great BBQ chicken and duck. The scallion and ginger dipping sauce is fantastic and really send the slow roast meat over the top. You come here for the food only.....the decor is classically cheesy and laden with formica and fluorescent lighting...but its the food that counts in terms of what you would come here for. I had a group of chefs that I led on a tour of the city who wanted to experience BBQ in Chicago ad I took them here and they loved it....and they were from Texas which adds some credibility.,12/19/2008,eG7mcNRkyr-Md-7kiCCObA,4CdDDSw_IxJfglXc0-Uh4Q,KomhK0JD5cleEW55YTw7MQ,Y,5,0

61151,"I used to like Garcia's back when they weren't so big and popular. The food was great then and the service was not so bad. I went there sometime in december 2011 with my husband, and the food was bland, the service was even worse. It took the waitress way too long to get our check and didn't even pick it up after 10 minutes of the checkbook with our credit card hanging out sitting on the table. We tried to get her attention but she was just way too busy. Finally we got fed up and i just paid up front. I had better service in Paris, and there usually is only one waiter/waitress for an entire restaurant/bar there. The only reason for my one star is because they havent taken away the ridiculously large horchata cup, but even so, the quality of their horchata has gone down. Never ever ever will we go back to Garcia's. The only people who like it now are those out of towners who recently moved to chicago or tourists who don't know any better... I'd much rather eat at a hole in the wall mexican restaurant with excellent food than eat at a Mexican restaurant with bad service, bland food, and over priced to boot, (all of the above = garcia's).",2/16/2012,kaYhOPF3jd7xKXYI3i9k-Q,r2qvmMKRjVAGsJqUmbTCzA,08X_5WTOVNvk4SgPRKBjjQ,Y,1,0

14511,"Glenn's Diner is a small restaurant in my neighborhood that serves some of the best seafood I've ever had. You'd never guess that by the name. Most unknowing folks figure it's going to be patty melts and BLT's. But this place has great, high quality food, even if your not a seafood lover, they have many other menu choices as well. We love going to Glenn's and used to go at least once a week. Now, we only go about once or twice a month. In fact the only reason I didn't give Glenn's five stars is that they've gotten so busy (which is good, I'm glad people are supporting them) that I think their service is starting to suffer a little. 9 times out of 10 I'd say we get seated relatively quickly, and have a great server that offers good service. They are friendly and attentive. On rare occasions, we'll get a server that is friendly, but isn't very attentive because they are so busy that it becomes hard for them to handle and you can see and feel their frustration. However, the dinning room attendants are amazing! They seem to anticipate your every need. They've even brought us refills when our server was too busy. Recently we made reservations for one of their specialty nights. I was unable to go at the last minute, but heard from those that did go that even though they had reservations they ended up having to wait 45 minutes for a table. Now, this would be understandable if every table in the house was full, but they had empty tables and were seating walk-ins at those. I read another review that had a similar experience. I feel that if you have a reservation you should have priority seating and walk-ins should have to wait the 45 minutes. I think they need to rethink the way they handle their reservations. Overall though, this a great, no, awesome place and we'll definitely go back, again and again. By the way, the Manager is extremely friendly and accommodating. I saw that someone else had posted something negative about her and all I can say is perhaps she had a bad night that night because she's always been nothing but professional and friendly to us. In fact, most of the time she recognizes us when we come in. She may not know our names, but knows we've been there many times and always says, Its great to see you again"" or ""thanks for coming in again"". She was very accommodating to my friends that had to wait for their reserved table. In fact she did more than what was necessary to correct the situation but it was very much appreciated nonetheless! Go to Glenn's, but know before you go, it's not exactly what you would consider diner food and is not diner prices. It's not overly expensive either. I'd say mid-range. Despite my comment above, I highly recommend making reservations, especially on their specialty nights otherwise you could find yourself waiting for quite a long time to get a seat. In either case, it's worth the wait.",7/2/2010,tGKn1nzz26iZkTwz7IaRkw,SfFVDTpF9AbumPzY1IJQTw,50gFzdVglOz88eFJ6v-26A,N,4,1

The building looks a little run down, and exactly how green is it? Do they use organics?Local? Is it a good organization or just a front for a wealthy dude to make $$ off of us trusting vegans?

59241,"don't believe the hype. my wife and i went to sun wah wanting so much to find a new asian restaurant with good food. the reviews on this place sounded as if you could not go wrong, wrong. first the atmosphere in the place is as if you are in a huge cafeteria - really no aviance just come in and get your food. i do not have a problem with that as long as the food quality and taste makes you forget your surroundings so after you are seated we looked around and it was a good diverse crowd with what seemed like a large staff serving the people. however it was literally 10 minutes before someone showed up to our table and just appeared out of no where and asked are you ready to order - no hello how are you or would you like a drink, just are you ready order. i wanted to get a taste of what the peking duck tasted like without ordering the full meal and the waitress instructed me to try one of the ducks at the top of the menu ranging in size; small, medium and large. so i ordered the duck and my wife ordered her entree (mixed vegetalbes and tofu) an appetizer (fried scallops) and pea pod greens. the waitress put the order in and the duck showed up in less than two minutes all sliced and ready to be eaten - mind you nothing else not the appetizer or even our drinks. just a plate filled with a half of duck. my wife and i sat and looked at the duck for a few minutes, then i took a piece and tasted the duck. the duck was bland and gamey in smell and in taste - my wife did not even want to taste it after smelling the duck. so we sat at the table and joked for about the next 5 minutes about why would someone drop off a plate of meat and just leave. so i go to the front counter and ask one of the waitresses standing at the counter if they could take it back into the kitchen and put it under warming light or something - she did, and eventually brought out all the food together with appetizer. all the food was bland and tasteless except the pea pod greens. so i ate the greens and my wife picked at her platter and when the waitress asked if we wanted it all wrapped to go, we got the vegetables and greens to go and left the duck practically untouched.save your money go to panda or that place down the street, but do not go out of your way for crappy food",3/21/2010,9RDdTm0tR7FpP8KkeYpZIQ,0Vz1DoM-g1arxc6AU0sJkQ,KomhK0JD5cleEW55YTw7MQ,Y,1,0

3907,"CRISP STOPPED CARING Yes, that's right, Crisp has officially taken a dump. One, pricing is getting a bit out of hand; it used be somewhere around 6.99 for a Steak Bowl (all it is, is seasoned beef and rice) and is now costing around 10 bucks. Two, they give you less of everything; steak bowls used to be stuffed to the brim and had at least 2"" thick of beef. The wings USED TO BE, dare i say, pterodactyl sized. Now, everything has been sacrificed for greater profits. The wings look fairly generic in size (i used to love steroid sized wings). Three, their neo-hipster staff needs to drop the $hitty attitude. If i ask for extra atomic sauce for my steak bowl, just give it to me, don't hassle about 50 cents, that is completely petty and classless.

Upon being seated, we were given 3 menus to a party of six, and were told they'd try to find us some additional menus because they ""always run out of menus when the patio is full."" I'm not really uppity about these things, but I kind of wonder, if it's a persistent problem....why not print up more menus? Also, be warned that according to our server, it's against restaurant policy to split checks for groups of six or more--regardless of how many cards you are trying to pay on (meaning that if it's a party of 12 and you attempt to split it down the middle on two cards, they won't accommodate). I get it that it is obnoxious to ask a server to split the check on several different cards and there's definitely a point at which it becomes ridiculous, but there are plenty of other eateries in the city who won't mind splitting the check in half for you :)",11/11/2005,O-v1imql0whyTYk6UHidOQ,j6YqYVT5Fs8NH-jrQ2ulvA,4wreIFjaPMppyEnzKHbozg,Y,4,0

And much better than the sad, watery, bad-Cream-of-Wheat grits that causes most people to think they hate grits. I'd pick Wishbone's cheese grits over polenta any day. Yummers. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge brunch enthusiast. In fact, I say the phrase, ""Brunch food can only get so good,"" often enough that my friends probably are on the verge of never inviting me for brunch again. And for the most part, I believe it; I believe that there is a ceiling to how good an omelet or French toast or an egg-bacon-home fries combo plate can possibly get. But Wishbone blows me away - I'd sooner have brunch there than dinner at most other restaurants. If you go on a day when they've got the special Brisket Hash, get it. Or the day when they have the spinach, avocado, and Swiss cheese omelet, get it. Everything I've ever tasted at that place has been swoon worthy, and for me, swooning pretty much never happens at brunch.

29976,"In retrospect, perhaps I should have tried to come here for dinner instead of a 0730 early breakfast, because I just wasn't terribly impressed with my texas french toast for breakfast. Love xoxo's description of this place, cuz quite apt. Dont' come here to this quiet locale in Gold Coast for noise, trend, cool, glitz. Ain't gonna happen. Instead, walk a few steps down and walk into what is more like a dated conversation pit that was so in a few decades ago in living rooms....there's even an old-fashioned cash register that one has to press down really hard for it to make that clunkety-clunk sound that just adds to the overall feel. Apparently, at least 4 other parties were already well into their breakfasts. Though quite ample in portion, the toast was just chewy and 'limp'... don't know how else to describe it (I have had stellar french toast in my time....read Tower cafe or Bella Bru, Sacramento). Though dipped in egg and then pan-fried, the toast did not possess that great play in crisp and then soft on the inside...instead it was all completely soft somewhat tasteless. Would have been a nice touch had they just added a splash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the egg batter. Syrup is the other half that comprises a killer french toast experience: it was... meh. From the perusal of breakfast reviews, it's sort of hit/miss with this well-established place that is connected to the south of a condo building. The entree + grapefruit juice ran about $14 for breakfast. Just south of Goethe on Dearborn... had a wonderful, quaint, stroll through historic Gold Coast looking for the FLW Charnley House.",7/1/2010,L8SMiqzAhELFapy9fSU,tmFr6wmnWIvRdoKpRZ7gaA,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,4,1

I went for the bacon cheeseburger hot dog- yes the pork sausage was stuffed with cheese and bacon AND topped with more cheese and coca-cola BBQ sauce, I'm probably missing something but it was very decadent and very tastey. I ate every last bite. We of course opted for the duck fat fries which were delicious, but I'm not sure how they really differ in taste from the others? just more crispy? Either way they're fabulous fries. You can definitely split between 2 people. Oh and we ordered a side of cheese to dip them in. Repulsive I know but sooo good.

16106,"The pizza here is pretty good. It's not my favorite stuffed/deep dish/Chicago-style or whatever you want to call it in Chicago, but it's up there. The crust-cheese-sauce-toppings ratio is good, and I appreciate the texture and flavor the cornmeal adds to the crust. I also like the amount and flavor of the sauce. It was a little on the pricey side (over $40 after tax and tip for a large pizza with a bunch of toppings). The pizza did feed about 8 people, though . . . so I guess the price wasn't obnoxiously high. We decided to order from here because I have a cousin visiting from Poland who wanted to try some Chicago pizza. Because we needed it delivered, we couldn't get it from my favorite, Pequod's, so I looked for some reasonable alternatives. Calo was very highly rated, so we decided to go with them. And, like I said, the pizza was good. The service left something to be desired, though. I don't think my order was overly complicated. I wanted a pizza that had mushrooms, green pepper, and onion on the whole pie, and pepperoni on half of it. I went over this with the woman taking my order over the phone about five times to double check. It was really important because at least two of the people eating the pizza were vegetarians who didn't want pepperoni or any kind of meat touching their pizza. The woman taking my order was, somewhat understandably, getting a little annoyed that I was triple and quadruple checking this, but, like I said, it was important. Did I mention that this woman wasn't particularly nice to begin with? But, whatever, if the food was going to be good, it wouldn't matter. So, about 45 minutes or so later, we got the pizza. And it was really good. But it had sausage on it. All of it. To be fair, it also had all the other toppings, but the sausage made it inedible to the vegetarians.

43267,"I have dos palabras para ustedes: HUEVOS RANCHEROS. Seriously dude, the huevos rancheros are to die for!! My one complaint about this place is that you have to order at the counter and then just stand there until a table becomes available. I personally prefer to be waited on, and found it a little stressful that we all ordered and then had to just chill there, lurking over this poor table while they were trying to enjoy their own huevos rancheros! Also, we were meeting a friend so it didn't really work right because we ordered, they were late, then we ended up getting our food before they even ordered. I think typically the staff tries to time everything out, so the fact that we were served so far in advance was a mistake they apologized for, but it was still annoying. They had really good coffee as well. I ordered a vanilla latte and enjoyed every ounce of it. They don't have a TON of selection, nor did it seem they had your typical bacon, eggs and toast variety. If you did want that, you would have had to order a bunch of sides. That = pure lameness. Luckily, the huevos rancheros had my name on it and I would come back here for brunch so long as I got here before the crowds started up, just to avoid the wait. Also, a long time ago I bought some cinnamon donuts here, which were also pretty bomb. Highly recommend those little sweet nuggets. Other than that...oh they had a nice outdoor seating area as well.

15,"So, we were fortunate enough to score Sunday dinner reservations after the restaurant moved from its phone-based reservation system to the 'Next-like online ticketing system. I can honesty say that this was the pinnacle of dining experiences for me - that every fine dining establishment from this point forward will be judged against my experience. I'm not sure if this is fair, because Grant Achatz and team set an insanely high bar.  Prior to dining at Alinea, literally an hour before, I finished reading Grant and Nick's autobiography 'Life on the Line'. I appreciated having the insight into the creative passion and love for food that drives Alinea staff. I'm also slated for a trip to San Francisco in the Fall and am very much looking forward to scoring (hopefully) reservations at The French Laundry, which had a huge influence on Chef Achatz. Fingers crossed that my redial finger make it through to the reservationists.  Back to Alinea - We're not going course-by-course in this review, as I agree with many other Yelpers, that just simply ruins the experience. Although, I'm guessing that the Fall menu isn't too far from around the corner, which has me eager to go back for sure. From the time you check-in with the doorman to the moment you step through into the darkened, wedge-like hallway, your dinner begins and it doesn't stop for almost four hours. Every detail is meticulously considered and it shows - at the time I confirmed our reservations and any dietary restrictions or other notes of importance for the staff, I did not notify them that my other half was left handed. I didn't realize that was even a reason to make a special note, but at Alinea it is. Once they realized he was left handed, every course was situated and placed correctly in front of him.  I know for some the ticketing system has been a nightmare (and the person who rated the restaurant one star based on her inability to get a reservation really irks me), but perseverance and patience will pay off. If you get a reservation or have the opportunity to make one - don't think about it, just do it, turn yourself over to Alinea staff and be prepared to be blown away.",8/21/2012,MgarFT5mQE6Gq1eNAfw4Fw,0SvPdzpIEHQFJOvnPt9zxQ,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,N,5,1
51789,"I have been dying for this place to open! They were supposed to open in September, but just opened last week. It sucked, but whatever, it's so well worth the wait! When we got there on this past saturday night, it was incredibly busy, which I was happy about for support on local businesses, but we got seated pretty fast (there was just the two of us though, so that's why) The chips and salsa was very good. The salsa is fresh and they refill it for you. We ended up getting a pitcher of strawberry margaritas and I was determined to finish it. We both got a dinner combination, which was i think 9 or 8 dollars each but it more than filled us up and enough to take home. For the price and the amount of food they give you for it is really affordable. The pitcher of margaritas cost around $27, but it gave us enough for four drinks each, full to the top! It's a cute place and the remodeling opened it up alot. I love this place, we go to it all the time! I take my friends here and to Bowman's when they come to visit, and they all love it as well!",8/3/2008,6KHEUKkCMmarYAcCqN3HvA,DFBfwCQA7RjcaXIPywkpDw,08X_5WTOVNvk4SgPRKBjjQ,N,5,1
9020,"So glad to find such a restaurant that serves legit Asian food and is NOT in Chinatown. That means greater services and much better ambiance, which make your dining experience holistically better Bamboos, mirrors, and wooden frames dotted the dining area while bamboo chopsticks are neatly placed on the ceramic place waiting to serve. It's a great night dining in the illusion of space and time. We ordered: Fresh Spring Roll: all materials are tastably fresh, but not very flavorful without the sauce Roasted Duck: best roasted duck I've had outside of Asia. This entree was downed in no time. Sliced beef sirloin with lettuce wrap: WARNING! this shares the same idea with a lettuce wrap appetizer. Beware what you order SIDE DISH- Grilled Eggplant! This is heavenly. It's nothing like the soggy grilled eggplant you get in Italian restaurants. This is legit thinly sliced small cut eggplants marinated with Asian spices, garlic and a kick of lemon. I would come back just for this dish, to be honest. Overall though, entree could be better. if you are craving for real Asian food, go to Argyle/ Chinatown. yet if you are willing to budge on taste and get compensated in ambiance, come to Le Colonial",4/23/2012,1siRnemliiXNPrD3QCjt6w,Ax2W2agdZHKeHjfrlVa58A,5OtAmmypXvuTbkFBCziF_Q,N,4,1

54007,"Having just had a great time with friends here last night, I felt the need to share how wonderful this place is. Last night was a typically great night at The Violet Hour. The hostess for the night did our routine ID checks and when she saw mine, she wished me a happy b-lated bday. Then, I remembered how I should have reviewed the night of my 30th birthday on Saturday Dec. 18th at this wonderful establishment:I showed up early as I had been here before and knew I had to be here at open if I had a chance of sitting in the back area with a decent sized group. I showed up with 10 people and with 6 more on the way to meet me. The hostess for the night was completely amazing. She offered to split our group and knowing this was a special night she made sure all my friends knew where I was seated so I could greet them when they came in. I had 16 people in my party and I was able to mingle and catch up with everyone. The hostess came back to make sure my whole party was seated and asked before she removed one of the seating stools from one of the tables that wasn't being used. Then made sure there wasn't anything else I needed. She was completely friendly, accommodating and professional. The waitress for our table was amazing at describing drinks for the newbies and recommending drinks for the ones that had been here before. SUPERB SERVICE.Everyone left thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere, service and quality of drinks/food. I made sure to thank the hostess of the end of the night for the wonderful experience (I wish I remembered her name!). I was one happy birthday girl.

55929,"My first visit to this restaurant was OK. Our server was very nice and offered a few specials, but the food for person in our came out about five minutes later than the rest and one appetizer never came at all. Given this is a neighborhood place and BYO, I am willing to look past this point. The food is very average, I challenge someone to point out a dish at this restaurant that is done better than at any other Italian Restaurant in the city save Buca di Beppo. Went back...err...tried to go back for seconds last night and have never been treated so poorly in my life. Our entire party was not there and the host made it a point that we needed all people there to be seated (OK) and informed us that at 6:15 that our reservation would be lost. Mind you the restaurant is half-empty at this point. Upon the arrival of the rest of our party at 6:19, we were told that our reservation was lost and that we were not welcome. The owner/manager needs a serious attitude adjustment, and given the mediocre food, should be more accommodating to his guests. I am simply dumbfounded at what a prick the manager was (an older couple that had an incomplete party and was waiting agreed). Hey asshole - you still only have three other occupied tables in the restaurant and it's well before prime supper time on a Saturday.

Rush street location (Robert) refused to accommodate my 10 year old's disability and was horribly rude in the process including hanging up on my wife.

1679,"Foie gras duck sausage hot dog??? Yes please! We came on a Monday afternoon and there was a line peeking out the door. I guess it's true, there's always a line. While we were in line, the people in front of us started talking and we got involved in a conversation with them, and our 30 minute wait went by a lot quicker. The outside is kind of boring looking, very unassuming, but the inside is kitschy and bright and fun. Lots of primary colors. Lots of hot dog options, and I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of them. We ordered: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel: Woah. So tasty, so decadent, so fatty, so bad for my arteries, but SO GOOD. The sausage itself reminded me of the Taiwanese style pork sausages (for those familiar with longanisa, the Filipino sausage, it's kind of similar). Slightly sweet, very rich. A must try. Crayfish and pork sausage with shrimp remoulade and creme fraiche: Yummy but the creme fraiche had a very goat cheese-y taste to it.  We had another 2 hot dogs that were a Jack Daniels fennel pork sausage with something and then the other one had something with smoked gouda. I can't quite recall and the website and menu seems to change daily, but I remember them being very tasty as well. They were a little pricey but you are getting gourmet hot dogs. We had to take the train to the California stop and then hail a tax because it would've been a 1.5 mile walk to Hot Doug's, so just as an FYI, it's not super easy to get to without a car or taxi.",4/29/2010,72FpEkDHQQe-xeerHi1nNg,887-WxTKfe6Tcj3o4nNcfQ,HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A,N,5,1

When we pulled up, we noticed that there was valet. BUT in the same building, not more then 20 feet away was a parking garage. why pay their fees and tip when I can park my own car...however...I must warn anyone who decides to park their car in there, or let them park your car....be aware of crazy valet drivers. because one hit my husband as he whipped around the corner in someones brand new lincoln town-car. he made a sudden stop and didn't hit my husband hard, but they definitely made contact. i was frozen in shock. i couldn't believe what i just witnessed. Needless to say I complained to the restaurant, and they said it was a contract account that they hire for valet. I took off a star because I feel like they just shrugged it off like it wasn't their problem. which I understand to a point, but come on...you hire these crazy people to park your customers cars....I took it upon myself to call the valet service the next morning. so I took care of it.however, enough about that, and lets get on to the review..the atmosphere was very nice...it was dark, but not too dark, they had great colors, and great decor. They have a HUGE salad bar, with much more then salad.We had a lovely waitress named Vanessa. She was a doll. Very attentive and helpful. I love the fact that they have the endless servings of meat. they really have about 50 people walking around with all types of meats. I had a full plate and it was so delicious. one piece of advice, Go there HUNGRY. We had a very good bottle of champagne to celebrate his bday. It was very nice, because we had the bottle at the table, but they would pour it for you, and when glass is almost empty, they will come back around and fill your glass back up. refold your napkins, take your finished plates and give you new ones to start eating all over again. it was great and i recommend this place to anyone wanting a great meal..",7/15/2010,HYxOLQ_pRqDz58OapDCGTA,tlBoFfayUgHv0uNvDkXIMw,mCHto10PBQOKnefm7gholg,Y,4,0

I was a little shocked a restaurant would reserve the whole place and annoyed, but we sat at the bar to eat.We had a wonderful fish spread for an apptizer, but it was served with Ritz Crackers, yuck. We asked for the basket of crackers and ate it with those instead. For a main course, the fish pot pie was wonderful, warm, great crust but a little small in size for the price, but once I saw how many shirmp were inside, decided it was a good deal.

I jumped at the chance. We decided to go on a Wednesday after work. I assumed it would be a very slow night because who else in Chicago wants all you can eat meat on a Wednesday beside cuisine connoisseurs such as ourselves? I was wrong. While it wasn't super packed there was a constant flow of people, which lets you know this place is as great as everyone is making it out to be!The FOOD: Fantastic. I decided to opt out of the salad bar. (Hey I figure I am paying $50 per plate for meat so I am going to consume as much as possible.) Our meals turned out to be worth every penny. I had Parmesan Chicken, Parmesan Pork, BBQ Pork Ribs, Garlic Steak, Filet Mignon, Picanha Sausage, Sirloin, House Specialty Beef..... you get the picture. (I really wanted to try those beef ribs but those sucker were so big and my stomach was already so full..but don't worry mr. beef rib, I will be back for you :-)At one point in time there was so much meat on my plate I thought I would keel over! The SIDES: Our table came equipped with mash potatoes and plantains to cleanse the palate. Heather consumed a great amount of potatoes. Once again I opted to eat only a spoon full as I did not want to get full from sides and salads. Remember, this journey is all about the meat! At the very end of our meal, as I was about to call for the check, dessert was brought to the table of a lovely couple sitting in front of us, The dessert was fresh strawberries blended with vanilla ice cream. Now I know what your thinking, Just say they had strawberry ice cream! But no, it was more than that! I was full, super full. But I found away to make room in my stomach for one last hoorah and it was so worth it. This was the most refreshing dessert ever. The fresh strawberries whipped beautifully with the vanilla ice cream was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. As we ate our dessert we were privy to watch the entertainment in the winesellar. There a young lady performed acrobatic movements while selecting the wine of each patrons choice!The COST: 2 plates cost $99.99 total and the two desserts were:$15.50 total. With tax the price was $121.00 for a meal and dessert for two people. We opted not to drink so if you would like a glass or bottle, expect to pay more. As I mentioned I went on a groupon so it reduced by bill to $65! I felt like it was a total steal!!All in all I give it 5 stars. I also would like to recommend our waitress Nina! she was Fab. Valet was a bit annoying because it took 15 minutes to receive our car. But I wouldn't let the valet service stop me from going. We will be back!The question is would I spend my hard earned dollars there again and the answer is Yes!",7/2/2012,3Q5iXu72x3uLMEuYtQ3GTg,1_kUUtCIrNzg16WgKqhBOg,3Mx2PM7v8qjqhgF3cDXxbQ,Y,5,0

Drink: Sparkling Spanish Rose: yumminess, it had Champagne, Sangria and Fresh Strawberries...soon to be followed by a coffe though Mojitos: also good there, was nice to see they made it fresh Eat: Red Velvet Pancakes: Though I didn't eat this, my friend said it tasted like heaven. these are HUGE btw, it would definitely be more than enough for 2 people to share.

Thought it was going to be a gastropub but really dark and trendy inside. Highlights were the truffle popcorn and foie-lollypops. We liked some things on the five course tasting menu. Like the parmesan infused brioche in the deconstructed cesear salad and the skate was delicious. Chicken with carrot was ok. Dessert of chocolate with vinaigrette was so decadent. Although the food was very tasty it was small portions on a big plate. Understand this was a tasting and the portions were smaller than the normal entree portions...but I was still hungry a couple of hours later. Wished there was more food for $75.

The Chicago size portions were ample and reasonably priced. The service was spot on from the hostess to our servers, bartender and many wait staff.  I lived in the area when this was Tsunami.

24482,"this was my 1st time inside an authentic greek bakery, so i was very excited about seeing their selection of pastries. unfortunately, i was too full after dinner to eat anything else, but that didn't stop me from picking up a few things for breakfast the next morning. after much deliberation, i chose: 1. galaktoboureko ($3.50) - thin phyllo dough pastry with lemon custard filling. the phyllo dough wasn't as flaky as i'd have expected, and it was slightly soggy from the honey. the lemon custard was delicious, thick and creamy and not overly sweet. 2. walnut baklava ($2.95) - rich and dense chopped walnut filling inside phyllo dough. the chopped walnuts mixed with honey were delicious, maybe a touch too sweet, but delicious. the phyllo dough shell was flaky and laced with honey. note they also serve sandwiches and american desserts. delicious, authentic greek desserts that were a tasty breakfast treat for me. this is another place that i'd visit on my return trip to chicago.",4/10/2012,Gzhvv,KMJZ3W3Ftsxv3-3GijjnJg,o4NcUfco7JxOcyfKFWyAhg,N,5,1

2024,"My colleague and I scoped this place out months in advance of attending a conference in Chicago, and it was one of our big food excursions while we were in town. When we arrived, the line was down the block, and it ended up being about an hour wait. Totally worth it, though. I had perused the menu online earlier that day, and I decided I wanted both a more gourmet dog (the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage, with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris) and a more simple Elvis dog (smoked Polish sausage). And duck fat fries, of course. It was really hard to decide, though, because so many of the menu items sounded so tantalizing. What really made this 5 stars was the service, believe it or not. When we finally arrived at the counter, I was worried that I didn't have enough cash to cover everything I wanted. I asked the guy at the counter how much it would be without the fries, because I wasn't sure if I had enough. He looked at me and said, don't be silly! Don't deprive yourself of duck fat fries just because of cash! We can work this out. I was like, um, OK, I guess I'll get the duck fat fries then. He didn't even use a cash register, he just eyeballed my order and said, eh, that looks like about $15. I'm sure it would have been more than that if he actually added it up, but I'm definitely not complaining. Later I found out that it was Doug Sohn, the owner himself. He also talked me down from a medium drink to a small since there were free refills. What a nice guy! As we sat down to eat, the staff was very friendly, asking us if there was anything we needed, taking our trash, etc. They run this place very efficiently and seem to manage the crowds well. The foie gras dog was decadent and perhaps even a little too over the top, because it was hard to taste the duck sausage what with everything else going on. But that simple smoked Polish dog was sheer perfection. I'm glad I ordered both, because it gave me the chance to try both sides of the coin (not to mention I wolfed both down so fast, if I had only gotten one I would still have been hungry, and that would have meant getting back in the hour-long line). The duck fat fries, as one might expect, were fries like no other. Despite the wait, I would come here again and again to try all the different flavors, which change frequently. I loved the great service!",12/26/2009,wqWqolw1Nqlc9VcCiKDc7w,Dd-TkEszFMkSF-vRih51fQ,HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A,N,5,1

The waiter had an attitude from the moment we sat down and was disgruntled to see we had brought our own bottle of wine. Really? Why the attitude when you charge a $15 corkage fee? I suppose this was the reason why the waiter refused to return to our table ONCE to fill our glasses. Once the food arrived, the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes. Good thing they have much more attentive bussers who were able to assist us. Long and short, the food is not nearly great enough to overcome poor, unattentive service.

It's a huge restaurant and they did seem to be quite busy with a large group in the back. It took them quite awhile to get to us and to take our orders. We asked to have an additional duck added to our order. After about 20 minutes (some people had food already) they came out to inform us they had no extra ducks. This would have been fine if they had told us this initially, but at this point we were all quite hungry after watching some of our friends finish their food. When the ducks did finally come out they were delicious. It was my first time with duck and I really enjoyed it - particularly the fried rice. It's BYOB but with a corkage fee as they have a full bar there.

Our server was super friendly and attentive, but problems arose when the tapas arrived at the table. Each person ordered for themselves but the food runner said the name of the dish and put it on the table.

45129,"We dined at Anteprima for the second time last night and for the second time enjoyed the food, but were disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because we weren't ready the first time the waiter came to take our order, but after ordering and beginning to drink a bottle of wine, we waited what seemed like an eternity to order food. A similar painful would-be eternity came between the dropping off of the dessert menu and the return of the waiter.  Ok, so I sound whiney. But there's just something maddening about seeing your waiter flit across the room, cut bread at the bar, and chit chat with co-workers when you desperately want to order! On a more satisfying note, the food is delicious. We tried the octopus starter as many yelpers suggested--wonderful. The portions are sensible. So the food is great, service questionable. My final comment is on the phenomenon of small, trendy restaurants like this that pack in diners to create a very loud, claustrophobic atmosphere. Why do we flock to these places? Is the food really that great? or does the reservations-only buzz create a false sense of urgency? I mean, I'm not gonna lie--I felt somewhat special being a part of this seemingly elite room.

We got it, and it definitely boosted our experience, but we were not aware that almost half of the wines were desert wines. Not my favorite. In fact, I get massive headaches. If we had known this ahead of time, I'm sure we would have asked for an abbreviated pairing without the desert wines. I bet they would have done that for us. If not, you really can't go wrong ordering a bottle of champagne to sip throughout the meal. Small sidenote: If anyone went there this fall and took pictures of their food, would you mind sending me a message?

28854,"If I gave this place 2 stars, it would indicate that I'd try it again, and I wouldn't. This is easily the worst Thai food I've had in Chicago, and that's saying a lot because there are a lot of Thai places in Chicago and I've been to many of them. We went on a Monday in the middle of a rainstorm and were probably the only ones in the dining room, which looked nice but was uncomfortable since their wall length booth was broken and slanted. Overall I was really really dissapointed since I had heard ""best Thai food at Opart"" over and over again. The shu-mai appetizer could have come out of a Costco box, my spicy entree tasted spicy, and that's about it. Just chili, no other spices or flavors, and the beef, green beans and onions could have been presented better. His noodle dish tasted awful in a too sweet gravy that was so oily and unappetizing. The waitress/hostess didn't smile once and was sorting silverware at the counter just feet away from our table and apparently had no awareness or care to stop making such a ruckus. She was also oblivious to other details. For example, I asked for hot water and lemon: 1. She brought the hot water in a water glass, and not a mug. Too hot to hold. 2.

60692,"Grand Lux is AMAZINGI've never been there for an actual meal, because it is somewhat pricey, but their desserts are fabulous. big portions make up for the big prices, and most of the desserts can be easily shared between two people, they are very heavy and rich. The decor of this place is beautiful, very classy. You can watch the chefs at work if you like, and that in itself is pretty nice. All in all it is a beautiful classy roomy place, yet it is somewhat comfortable too. They don't have a dress code so you can go in dressed up, or in jeans and a t-shirt (as several of my friends were when we went) If you go, make sure to request the round room, it looks right out over Michigan Avenue, very pretty and romantic. As far a recomendations, I got the apple crisp, which was fantastic, served warm with ice cream. Also I tried my friend's molten chocolate cake. Also fantastic, especially if you are a chocolate loverAll in all the place is great, a tad pricey, but you get what you pay for. : - )",4/30/2006,TGUyzy0hjZYlco9FXbd6hA,CZw54D5qEQ4efsqNqEVNag,4wreIFjaPMppyEnzKHbozg,Y,5,0

3580,"After signing up for a 2yr membership to Bally's, I deserved an indulgent meal of fat, sugar and salt. I found it! For $6, I covered my hands and face with sticky Crisp BBQ sauce from 3 jumbo wings and fries. Thank god they cover the walls with mirrors so you can check your face and teeth for sauce blobs. Was the chicken delicious? Yes. Was it something to call home about? Yes. Did I actually call home? Yes. As much as my tongue loves fat, salt, and sweet, I would not make Crisp part of my diet. Crisp belongs in the McDonalds category of nutrition, only once a year for me. Also, the BBQ sauce reminded me of Sesame chicken which is too heavy for me.",9/2/2010,d9iilfuVWmC-vFRXIOnNhw,h9O1Q4kEklvYdwVsffTpMA,WBU0yq9J8qiYQfI_fh2P1Q,N,2,1

I'll try to make my assessment brief. I had a http://livingsocial.com deal which I'm sooo glad we did! I definitely would have felt this place was over priced without it. I guess my expectations were pretty high based on most of the glowing reviews. I was looking forward to a romantic dinner with good food. I don't think this place SCREAMS romance, unless your idea of romance is a dimly lit restaurant. The food was ok. My fave part of the meal was the cheese course and the dessert course. I had the chicken/shrimp combo and I thought the meat was pretty skimpy. I'm glad I went for the experience but I don't think I will go back.

My friend had corn pancakes with bananas slice on top that were equally impressive. My one complaint was that the breakfast items were all so similar. I think they could be a little more variety.

18680,"I want to like this place, like wanting to like a new hire with a good resume. On paper, great potential: in my hood, BYOB, a bit out of the way, homey interior, etc. But the food is just, well, not showing up for work. For starters, it's a bit on the pricey side for what is basically standard, old-school Italian. I can understand this to a point given that they need to compensate for being BYOB, but, again, to take the whole co-worker analogy and beat it like a dead horse, it's like realizing that you shouldn't have given them that lucrative package. When it comes to Italian, it all starts and ends with a red sauce. Even if I only get a taste by dipping my bread, this most simple of elements has to be right since it goes into pizzas, dipping for calamari, pastas, pizza, etc. So you know where I'm going...red sauce is bland and just off, to my tongue. In fact, everything seems to be missing that 'tastiness' factor to me that makes me crave the food. Sometimes good service can cover me sins, but even here, it's somehow not either the nice restaurant you don't even know they're there, or the friendly 'neighborhood' vibe thing. So, when the contract renewal comes up for this gig, I'm going to have to pass.",10/10/2006,s8HL3VCT8tZ,qfIxyeZVnmZy9mQL80UuPA,NGfbRjWoqUh2fGw8DU_pmA,N,2,1

ESPECIALLY the scallop. For sushi we ordered about 10 rolls and had a taste of everything. My favorites were the Philly roll, the White Dragon roll, and the Alaska roll.

We wandered in for lunch and even though it was pretty empty, they told us since we had no reservations we'd have to sit in the bar area, which was totally fine. Service was okay, nothing bad happened but kind of forgettable.  I had the brisket sandwich which is open faced and came with fries for $15. The fries were surprisingly great, being that I'm more of a fan of skinny fries than the big honking ones. But these were seasoned well and weren't totally potato-ey... you know what I mean? By the time we left, it seemed the bar was all tourists who didn't make reservations and the tables were all people schmoozing clients on business lunches.

Then I order something and it's usually lacking flavor! Maybe I'd be able to give this place 5 stars if I didn't know how to cook most of the stuff on their menu, BUT I make wayyyyyy tastier dishes than they do. Being a Vegetarian/Vegan does not mean that your dishes need to be flavorless!! Is it because the cooks in the kitchen aren't Vegetarians? Do they just not care that the food lacks flavor?? I know that Jo is an amazing Chef but I'm starting to think she has no part in the restaurant anymore. It seems as though there is no quality control.To sum it up: The Chicago Diner is really a hit or miss. I've had some pretty good dishes there, but I've also had some really bad (waste of money) experiences. Do I think that every Vegetarian should try this place at least once in their life?

I went around Texas' salad bar least 3 times just to make sure I had everything I wanted to try! :-) The Meat service was great! Again, because it was restaurant week I was fearful we would be overlooked and not have the opportunity to try everything we wanted.... I was wrong!

Every bite I took was supremely satisfying....Towards the end of the night I motioned for one server to stop by as he was going back to get more of the house speciality and he kept walking!

35225,"Let me just start by saying that I am not from Chicago. I live in a little suburb of Dallas and I have always loved my quiet little town. After about half an hour at Shaw's, my husband and I were devising a plan to move to downtown Chicago. This is truly 5 - star food, all the way through and through. We arrived around 12:45 for the Sunday Brunch (approx $45pp), and I feel like we could have spent half a day there. The nice thing is... there really is no rush. The last reservation they accept is at 1:30, and they basically keep bringing out food as long as people are eating. You don't have to worry about ""missing the good stuff"" because everything is refilled pretty quickly. We started out at the cold food table, enjoying some delicious seafood pasta, king crab, cocktail shrimp, oysters, ceviche, and sushi. Everything was amazing. I especially enjoyed the crab and the pasta, where my husband was fawning over the oysters, shrimp, and ceviche.  About this time we discovered the Bloody Mary / Mimosa station, which is an additional $5 to your meal. Another great selection of delicious beverages, definitely worth the extra bucks. Onto the next table, I had steamed snow crab legs, broc & cheese with lobster sauce, jumbo fried shrimp, and lobster penne pasta with creme sauce. Mmm... My husband also had the steak, and a few other sides... all of which he thoroughly enjoyed. Did I mention they have lobster bisque? Oh yes they do. Finally, I found some lobster bisque SO GOOD that it challenges the ""best bowl"" that was previously on my list. I think this is it, folks. It's amazing and it's on a brunch buffet. I cannot stress this enough : do not leave this building without putting bisque in your face. Finally, there is the sweet room. It is an entire room full of dessert options that you don't really have room for but must eat. So, we wandered in and painstakingly selected a variety of sweet treats to try. From the fudge to the chocolate, the mouse to the strawberries, everything was divine. It was especially fun to watch kids wander into this room unprepared, looking like little lost children in Willy Wonka's word. I watched a girl giggle madly while she plucked cotton candy down from the tree and then skipped off with a plate full of candy.  It is a beautiful world here at Shaws. It's probably a GOOD THING I do not live in Chicago, because I would gain 20lbs every Sunday.",2/23/2012,KOd,PkqGswbqNQZ810nmmung_w,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA,N,4,1

Rick Bayless was also there working hard behind the counter, which was great to see. He literally tasted everything before it went out and was working just as hard as anyone in the restaurant. To say this guy is passionate about his work is an understatement. The second time I had the choriqueso sandwich and instantly fell in love.

I always bring people here when they're visiting from out of town, I woo them with this brunch.   I've been here many times and the food has always been amazing. I've had some of the savory items like the breakfast burrito, croissant sandwich, and one of the best omelettes of my life (muenster, spinach, canadian bacon), but the REAL reason to come here is for their pancake options.  I've had so many different kinds and they have never disappointed. After the first bite of each new plate of pancakes, I do my hand-to-the-mouth-gesture and almost cry with joy. They change them up all the time which is both good (variety) and bad (the amazing dishes can never be ordered again). My favorites have been banana & crunch bar, pumpkin cheesecake, banana/peanut butter/chocolate, and smores. It's also a huge serving and I've never seen anyone finish an entire plate...you will earn my respect if you do.  A few things I don't love about this place: 1. The home fries/hashbrowns are covered with too many spices, I think it's overwhelming 2. There is always a long wait no matter what time you show up, expect at least 20-30 minutes 3. This is their biggest downfall and one of my BIGGEST pet peeves...they push you out before you are done with your meal.

Wildfire doesn't blow me away, but the food is good, atmosphere is pleasant, prices are reasonable, and service is great.

We started with wine and the bacon wrapped scallops (very good, but had a bit of grit). He had the bone-in ribeye (medium) for an entree, I had the petit filet (medium rare)... My steak was grossly overcooked - it was medium well+. His was well done. It was so sad, I hate to waste food, especially meat. Our waiter came by and asked how we were and I told him I though my steak was a bit overdone, and he was so apologetic, totally agreed that it was severely overdone, and said that he would get another one going right away. The same for my husband. I hate sending food back, I really do, so when the waiter treated us so well I felt better about it... The second time around was much better, cooked perfectly plus he brought our sides out again. As far as sides go - mashed potatos are wonderful - creamy, flavorful, with the skins still there. The creamed spinach was just okay - I like it more at Ruth's Chris. But, they have so many sides to choose from, there's something for everyone.

39308,"There are so many reviews L&E I was on the fence about submitting one. However, it is so amazing I have to voice my most recent experience! Appetizers and Small Plates: My friend and I ordered the Bone Marrow, Meatballs, and Olives to start with a bottle of Rose'. The Bone Marrow is different than other restaraunts because they provide you with salt and a jelly on the top which makes it a different and yummy experience. The meatballs have an bold but not overpowering herbacious taste with a delicous marinara sauce and sits on top of an amazing bed of polenta. I could honestly eat entire bowel of this and be happy. The olives are a nice compliment to the heavier appetizers and have several different sizes and flavors and are marinated perfectly. They are not overpowering with flavor and are done just right. Big Plates: We split this amazing porchetta dish that just melted in your mouth. The flavor of the meat was buttery and salty and the risotto underneath was perfectly cooked with just the right sized vegetables and creaminess. Mmmmmm We also split the clam in white wine dish (sorry don't have the exact name and the menu online is not up to date). The white wine broth was extremely flavorful. The wine and the herbs everything mixed nicely. What stood out to me the most with this dish though was how perfectly the clams were cooked. They were silky and moist and flavorful. The service: Waitress was perfect hipster friendly and knew exactly when to come, food timing was solid, bus boys knew exactly when to take our plates away, and the recommendations were right on. The price: For the quality of food you get, the flavor, the service, very affordable and worth every penny Overall: A place so good you yearn to go back over and over again.

19886,"Brought girlfriend here for her birthday. Note that I told the staff we were coming here for her birthday. Yet, despite the request, we were initially seated at a table by the bus station. If it's one pet peeve I possess, it's being seated next to a bus station, especially when I requested a nice, intimate table. However, after this small hiccup, the experience was wonderful and just as everyone had described from fellow Yelpers to Metromix and Chicago Magazine. Armed with 2 bottles of Otto's Dream Sauvignon Blanc (one of the finest wines I've ever tasted and a great option with sushi), we got a nice intimate table in the back after waiting an extra 15 minutes. Because of the prior inconvenience, we were given complimentary Miso. The rolls here are unlike those of generic sushi place. The ingenuity and originality that the chefs here put in is truly untouchable minus a few of the other sushi elites in the city. We tried a spider roll, which exceeded expectations, really packed a punch. Then we had the unique ""ceviche"" roll which was better than we expected.

We had to wait like an hour for our table. Fortunately, we're content with standing around and drinking. Unfortunately, I don't remember which brew we were drinking, but it was good. We had a group of six guys and we ordered two large pizzas, which was the perfect amount to satisfy all of us before a long night of partying. Our pizzas had a bunch of different toppings, and they were tasty.

I did the sparkling flight and the hubby did a Pinot flight It really gave us a chance to experience and contrast what we liked and disliked about each one. Unlike, wine tasting, there isn't somebody there telling you what to think. It's a classy clean modern bar and you can drink in whatever order you please!

You may be thinking ""they are just boiled soybeans, how great could they be?"" but they are served piping hot and super fresh every single time. I have literally had everything on the menu besides the california roll (what's the point?) and anything with salmon (not a fan, sorry) and it was fresh, tasty, and satisfying. There is a 711 across the street and a liquor store at the corner of Armitage and Damen to satisfy your BYOB needs (no corkage fee!)

It used to be a great source for meat and fish, and had an outstanding bakery.The past year or so (and more so recently) the quality had really declined. Prices remain high, but meat and fish are barely above Jewel and definitely not on the level of Fox and Obel. Selection of meat and fish has declined. The bakery still is good, but it is tough to justify a trip just for the bakery.

The byob made it even cheaper than it already was, and the portions are huge! We lugged in a few six-packs, and were delighted when they put down our names on the list, and then switched the store sign to 'Closed'. Last ones in! (and eventually out, as it turns out). The vibe is relaxed and the music festive. We started with some guac and ceviche, and once the entrees arrived, wondered if we should have. The flavors combinations are fantastic, and everyone was too busy chomping to speak for the next few minutes. I got the veggie burrito, with both mushrooms and spinach, and it was outrageously good.

I understand it's just beginning but it annoys me, especially with this place because of the gentrification that is happening with Logan Square. I hate to come off as one of the douche bags saying that kind of stuff, but it blows when you've got families from the suburbs, with their little kids, and ass wipes from Lincoln Park or Wrigleyville. The building is perfect for this place, a spot that you're not really going to find anyplace else in the city. As much as I didn't like it when Logan had nothing to do in it, I still just get annoyed that it's going to become the next Bucktown. But still, none the less, the place is great.

No problem, we'll just belly up to the bar for a drink! The handcrafted cocktail list was awesome, and their beer list was quite respectable. I first had some sort of hot toddy that I can no longer remember the name of. It was delicious! I followed that by a Half Acre Daisy Cutter. Yet another beer I can't find in KC and I loved it! We finally got a table (though well within the amount of time they quoted, so no complaints there) Dinner time! ***random observation*** They have super cute candle holders that I want for my home. We first ordered a small plate to share, and I immediately decided on the scallops w/ braised oxtail and gnocchi. All three are ingredients that I love individually, and having them together was astounding! Seriously, this was ""last meal on Earth"" good. I honestly cannot recall the last time I had a bite of something that made me as happy as that first bite of this dish. For dinner I had some sort of duck dish. It was good...very good actually, but after the previous course it just didn't stick in my mind. I looked on the online menu for a reminder, but it's not to be found. Maybe a nightly special?

54586,"I really love the food and that is what kept us ordering. However, after what happened today, we will NEVER order from them again. To begin with, they are always so rude when they answer the phone! We placed an order and after 1 hour 15 minutes it hadn't arrived and we called them. They said their delivery driver got his car stolen with all the deliveries. Understandable, but did they call us to let us know? NO! So, they said they would make it for us and have it there is a few minutes. 45 minutes later, we are still waiting and trying to call. NO ONE answered the phone for 20 minutes!! It just rang and rang. When the delivery driver got here after a total waiting time of 2 hours 15 minutes, I told him the situation and asked to see what he could do. He called and they offered us $6 off. We really didn't have an option because we were hungry. Then, we opened the food. It was stone cold! I called them and they happened to pick up the phone this time. The person on the phone was snooty and basically said that if we don't like it, give the food back and we'll get our money back. Ok, we USED to order from them at least twice a week and this is how we are treated?? The guy got so much attitude and did NOTHING to make us feel like they were sorry and treated us like it was our fault and that THEY were offended for us calling in. This is a horrible way to run a business and no amount of good tasting food is an excuse. They need to learn how to treat their customers.

Speaking of pigging out, I've heard great things about the stuffed french toast: 2 pieces of challah filled with mascarpone and dipped in vanilla bean custard.

THEY LIKE MY FOOD! He was going to every table asking if they like his food. So he reaches our table. For some reason, he didn't ask us if we like his food. He asked us if we had a coupon or something. So we said, yeah, we had a groupon. So he says, did you make a reservation? (clearly annoyed) My husband told him we did not, but informed them upon entering the restaurant that we had a groupon, and if we needed to call ahead. Being a Tuesday night, and not the least bit crowded, the hostess said no problem. We informed the owner of this, and he proceeded to SCOLD us for not making a reservation. WOW!! That was a first for us. Although we thought the veal paprikash was very good, the short ribs were just average - we would never ever ever return to this man's establishment.

It's pretty much the foundation of eating anywhere or ordering anything.He refused to give me his name or his manager's name after he got down right insulting and mocking.Do yourself a favor and head to Greek-town... the counter staff and management makes this place a joke.",11/5/2009,ts2cZGKNtT_yWTg7utapKw,dsbKiIvGrzv67OWTFtNgHg,O6uWHgJzylSjWjPSJKGhnQ,Y,5,0
23848,"This is one of my favorite places in the city to go for a casual breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The crepes are excellent. Seriously, I could eat there everyday. If we go for breakfast, we'll usually get a sweet crepe. My favorite sweet crepe is the Crepe Salem, with pineapple, walnuts, and honey. My fiance will usually gets the Crepe Perla, which has dulce de leche, bananas, and coconut. If we go for lunch or dinner, we'll usually chose a savory crepe. All of the savory crepes come with a vegetable puree soup, which is good. I particularly like the Palace Crepe or the Crepe de Roma. The Turkish coffee is good and strong and, if you are in the mood for something sweeter, the dulche de leche coffee is delicious. We've always found the service to be pretty good, if sometimes a tad bit slow.

10551,"Needless to say, after running 10 miles, almost anything would sound delicious. In all honesty, I was a little hesitant at first - I had serious cravings for some heavy carbs, but I acquiesced given the raving fan following Piece has. We ordered the queso de cabra - which again, I was skeptical... that's a Spanish dish... at a pizza joint? Boy, was I wrong! Delicious... so much so that we kept the marina sauce for future dipping pleasantries. Our pizza arrived shortly thereafter. I was truly disappointed... our order was wrong. The one ingredient that I dislike, was all over our pizza =( We informed our waitress and she removed the pizza. How devastating.  Now here's where Piece earns a place in my heart. Our waitress returned with the incorrect pizza and offered it to us to gnosh on while the correct pizza is made. She apologized and assured us that our right pizza was on its way. Well of course, we ate the vast majority of this onion-laced pizza - which was still delicious, by the way. Just needed to pick off those breath evil doers and I was good to go. Our waitress returned with the onion-less pizza and that was ALSO devoured... just a bit more slowly than the first. When the waitress presented our check, she told us that they took half off the cost of the ONE pizza and that she would gladly box up the remains of BOTH pizzas. So if I do my math correctly here... we consumed 2 pizzas for half the price of one... meaning we paid 25% of what we got. Talk about great customer service! I'm sorry I didn't get our waitresses name - I blame the fatigue of SF10, but kudos to her and whomever hired her!",6/21/2010,ZE898hbye,eNcJSOMF19kxnCrrEIdQUg,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA,N,5,1

56067,I have been going to Superdawg ever since I was a little girl. Every time I go to Superdawg I will always get a Whoopercheesie with basically everything. Superdawg is a great drive in restaurant to go eat at night because you can go with your car and just eat in there or you can go sit out at the tables and just eat with friends and enjoy the night. I was hanging out with my boyfriend one night and I was in the mood to eat a Whoopercheesie with fries at Superdawg. When we went there that night that was his first time there and ever since that night he loves that place and he always wants to go there for a hot dog or a Whoopercheesie instead of going to Burger King and McDonald's late at night. Their service is great their so polite and they don't take forever to make your food.

50890,"This place is good but not AS good as everyone had warned me about. I think it's because I measure how good a diner is by how good their pancakes are and I wasn't very impressed with Wishbone's cakes. The Denver Omelet I had was pretty good. Big chunks of sausage and the cheese distribution was perfect. Our waiter suggested next time to substitute the cheese with cream cheese.. it's supposed to be amazing that way. This place serves grits. Enough said there. This place does NOT serve corn beef hash. Enough said here. I really liked our server. I've actually been here twice and placed with the same server both times. He was pretty friendly, gave me free coffee.. 3 cups of free coffee.

Food was pretty tasty...we had the special, which was three pieces of steak with different toppings on each which you could pick. The mushroom topping was great. We also treated ourselves to the key lime pie, which was also pretty dang good. The only thing I would complain about was our bus boy...he kept cleaning our stuff away before we were even done.

The steak and eggs was huge! I had a whole meal to take home and I was pleasantly full. It comes on a bed of lobster sweet potato hash which was amazing! I had the hollandaise sauce on the side as I am not really a fan, I tried a little and it was good, but too rich for me. We tried some of their bacon as well and it was just okay in my opinion.

7387,"I have come to Sapori several times now. Usually, it is on Monday night, overstuffing myself at Sapori before going to a neighboring bar to watch Monday Night Football. They have a gluttonous food special on Mondays. For they bring you a sushi like check list where you get to check off 2 appetizers (something with cheese, please), 2 soups, 3 entres (something stuffed, something savory, and something creamy please) and a dessert. All of this tasty goodness for just over $20 bucks.  The cuisine here at Sapori is solid, Italian-American fare. Their food is good, simple and unpretentious. Their service is good and very welcoming. As an extra bonus, they have a very nice outdoor seating.  In all honesty, I am a little overly harsh in critiquing Italian restaurants. As I find Italian food very easy, albeit very time consuming, to cook. As a result, an Italian restaurant needs to either make better food than I can at home, or have great atmosphere/service. I think Sapori's is as good as I can make at home or better and the welcoming service makes this place worth coming to. I would say never do this for 99% for restaurants out there, but sign up for their mailing list. The discounts they mail you are actually worth receiving (like 25% off your entire meal or even free meals.)

My favorite KFC(Korean fried chicken) is the Seoul Sassy glazed whole bird. My wife and I always get a buddha bowl to accompany the yummy chicken. The mild flavors of the cold marinated vegatables mixes perfectly with the steamy hot rice. Make sure you mix in the buddha sauce before you dig in(makes it ohh soo scrumptious). Non-KFC eaters should try out the Seoul Sensation burrito which has the Bulgogi beef and Allison's Atomic sauce on the side.

And then I decide not to go back until enough time passes that I've heard enough people say ""oh Frontera grill? I love that place!"" and then I go back. Today was more of the same. Went there for lunch with 2 old friends. We had no problem getting a table which was great. Even though we were clearly chatting and catching up and kept telling the waitress ""we need a few minutes,"" she kept coming back and asking for our order. We asked for recommendations and she recommended the 3 specials which were all entree sized and nothing else. I thought that was a little weird, but whatever. After we were badgered to order, our food took a LONG time to arrive, during which time we were not checked on, even though the place was not very crowded. We ordered guac which was tasty, but received that before ordering our entress, so no other appetizers or anything to worry about during that long wait. I ordered one of the fish specials, which was good but not memorable. It was a moist and flavorful piece of fish in some sauce. The accompanying polenta cakes were very good. I also enjoyed my horchata. My main gripe would be the price - my friend pointed out that my fancy dish was about the same (or less) food than he had on his $10 appetizer dish. And it was also FREEZING in there. There must have been a door open. It's good but not mind blowing, and if I had to wait for this, I think I would go elsewhere.

25099,"I've heard the complaints - it's too dark, it's too cramped, you come out smelling like oil, etc... I think if you go into Geja's knowing what to expect you will have a blast. I've been dozens of times over the last ten years and have nothing but good things to say about the place. The service has always been impeccable, the food is consistently delicious and the music - oh, the music. A few things to think about if you're going. First, make a reservation. For real. The last time I called they didn't accept Friday/Saturday reservations after a certain time (7?) so just avoid it on weekends if you can. When was the last time you went on a Thursday night date? Second, request a booth. This will solve any overcrowding problems. Yes, the regular tables are close together but I have never had any problem ignoring (or making friends with!) my neighbors. Once I learned that you could request a booth I have never had a problem. They can't always honor it, of course, and you may have to wait a few extra minutes but the space and privacy are worth it. Third, you will smell like oil when you leave. There's simply no getting around it. To be honest, though, I've never understood this problem. Your date smells like oil too - what's the issue? Embrace it. It's not a foul smell, and it reminds me of Geja's the next day when I do laundry. Mmm. Finally, enjoy the music. The guitarists have always been happy to chat with us on their breaks, and they are phenomenally talented. They're interesting folks, and finding out about their backgrounds and training always makes listening to them more enjoyable. One last point: you will leave STUFFED. The prices may seem a bit high depending on your budget, but it's worth it. Every bite is heaven.",10/16/2007,xgb3TIUf5BIQMhbkXFFkDg,Scf6ebRM9kTHt02wYik0Ag,hylBw5ND7XyPldM6BN28vw,N,5,1

We ordered the steak frites, rapini, whole striped bass and red snapper (served sashimi-style, a nice surprise and REALLY yummy), as well as 2 desserts: ginger stout cake and the waffle with honey butter.

5203,"A little disappointed. Ambitious menu that didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The same vinegar base seemed to run through many of the dishes and while it was tasty it ultimately lacked imagination. We sampled about 11 dishes and none of them sucked but none had any 'wow' presence. The pork liver pate was texturally perfect but a bit heavy handed. The prosciutto bread balls were uneventful and the marinara with it was bland and sweet. The biggest disappointment was the bone marrow. The bread they served it with was delicious but the butter and garlic completely overpowered the marrow which, on it's own never seemed to have absorbed any of the herbs as promised on the menu. And so it went... It really felt like a Publican knock off without Kahan's talent to give it any soul. Service was minimal - brusque and inattentive. We waited a long time trying to order courses and our server offered us nothing in the way of either recommendations or personality. Music was okay but the low fi sound system just made it annoying at the volume they set.

35066,"This is a review for Shaw's Sunday brunch.  I think everything was ALMOST there but not quite hitting the mark or meeting my expectations (which I think were pretty lofty based on feedback and recommendations from friends). The cold seafood bar was where I spent most of my time. The lobster and melon salad, ceviche and lox were the champions of this station and I made sure they knew it. They also had three different sushi rolls which were nothing special. They were reminiscent of something you would get at a grocery store. I ate a ton of them anyway because they weren't terrible and it was all you can eat spicy tuna rolls. I mean, it was all you can eat ... what's a girl to do?  The most confusing thing about this area was the king crab chunks that a lot of reviewers rave about. They're one inch sections of king crab legs served cold. They were watery, flavorless and difficult to eat. It was a lot of work without much reward. Needless to say I did not go back for more. The waffle station was a pretty big hit for my 6 year old son. Everything you could put on the waffle was sugar based. He ate it up. You can also create your own omelet and have it made to order but every time I walked past the omelet chef wasn't there. When I want an omelet I expect someone to produce an omelet! It never happened. The hot food section was pretty massive. Standouts for me were the broccoli in brie sauce, lobster bisque and mini crab cakes. The first time I passed through to make my sons plate they had tiny little corned beef has patties with a perfect little sunny side up egg on top. They were so cute! I wanted to eat them all! Unfortunately they were out of it every other time I walked past so I didn't get to try them. This also made me sad. The eggs benedict would have been really good if the whites of the eggs weren't runny and undercooked. The carving station also looked really good but AGAIN there was never anyone there to carve the meat. The dessert room was super cute and obviously the kids were loving it. All of the desserts were minis so we were able to try quite a bit. I tried the tiramisu, creme brulee and key lime pie. All were good ... ish. Mostly just plain and boring. Our server was great and always on top of drink refills and questions. The mimosas were actually my favorite part of the experience. I had the blood orange and the white peach. Both were fantastic and only $5 each. The biggest issue I had was that they were constantly out of everything. We had brunch on a Sunday at noon. New Years Day no less! You would think it would be stocked. Several times I would wait in line forever to make a plate and right when I would get to the item I wanted a waiter would take it away to fill it. The killer was that they were removing trays that were half full. It was painful and it happened MANY times. I've rarely eaten at a buffet that blows me away but I had high hopes for Shaw's. The one thing that they do absolutely right is let kids eat free. However, if I'm going to spend $150 on brunch for two I think it should totally blow my mind. Sorry Shaw's but I will not be coming back.",8/18/2011,R154UsIIC4w9T8LGUGuCGg,E9iHe8ZPpfENKinG8inVmA,1g52-6WzlhjIOpNAsBjPJg,N,5,1

They have some more unique items like chopped liver (mmm) that you don't find on every buffet so its a bit more unique. Like all salad bars it can get messy especially since everything is very compact in this space and you have to sometimes reach across 3 other bins of food to get to your selection. If you're a hygiene-freak don't eat at this salad bar. I had the chili on my most recent visit because it was cold outside and I wanted something warm to go with my salad...pretty good. The portion was huge too.

FOOD Insalata di Mare - Seafood Salad: At $10, this was a pretty good deal. Nothing too special about the bread itself, but the seafood (poached calamari, cuttlefish, and shrimp) was pretty fresh and wasn't ruined by dumping a bunch of batter all over everything and frying the whole lot. I think they can afford to put in a couple more olives, though. Funghi e Salsiccia - Mushroom, Sausage, Basil, and Fresh Mozzarella Pizza: Our server recommended that we get both a red and a white pizza to give both a try. Done. We opted to go for the mushroom and sausage pizza, and the housemade sausage was AWESOME. The sausage wasn't overseasoned with a salt-mine's worth of sodium, and it wasn't greasy. We were told that the crust is the star at Spacca Napoli (more on that later), but I don't think that's a free pass for a blander-than-expected red sauce. Maybe it's subdued on purpose to let the fresh ingredients shine through more, maybe they don't think it's bland. But it could stand to be more aggressive. I love a flavorful sauce. I had two problems with the crust; one, it was too salty, both by itself (when eating the crust) and in combination with the toppings. Two, the high moisture content of the fresh mozzarella soaks through the paper thin crust at the center and makes the pizza pretty soggy. For some reason, it still works, albeit it is a little unsettling. This was supposed to have basil on it and I'm sure you can see the pathetic attempt at it...but it was disappointing that they only included what amounted to one basil leaf. More basil = more balance. Oh well. Bianca con Bufala e Rucola - Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Arugula: The second was a white pizza made with buffalo mozzarella and topped with fresh and crispy arugula. Olive oil played the red sauce's normal role here. Buffalo mozz is a lot creamier than regular mozzarella, but retains the same high moisture content, so the same issues with the crust that I mentioned about are the same here. The extra creaminess of the cheese is definitely noticeable for a obviously heavier pizza here. Still, great flavor, and I love all of that arugula on top. But again, where's the basil? The generous heap of other greens helped with the balance issue cited above, but still...more basil please! Spumoni Ice Cream: Pistachio, rum, strawberry and chocolate ice cream with some candied fruits. Very good! I was extremely happy with the spumoni, but I can't really say that it's any better than what you could get at the store or ice cream shops. Nutella Focaccia: THIS WAS INCREDIBLE. They use the same dough that they use for the pizza and bake it til it bubble up. They cut the bubble down the middle and slather on the Nutella goodness, and it was amazing. I loved this dessert, and the salty dough went so well with the sweet and creamy Nutella. This is genius. This is a must have. SERVICE/OVERALL: Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and stopped by frequently enough to get what we wanted, but not so much so that he was overbearing. We went later on a Sunday so there was no wait so I can't speak to how busy the restaurant is at peak times, but I think they're able to get out the pizzas and appetizers pretty quickly based on what we experienced. Overall, Spacca Napoli is a great restaurant that's worth the drive to Ravenswood! Just eat the pizza there or else the fresh mozzarella might eat completely through the crust.",4/4/2012,YpPLNo-nK6V9perBhvpkCQ,KA-Fnti4ySteap2R3xSpVA,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,N,4,1
49442,"Went here before going to see a show and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the wine to be great and the food to be OK, but it was actually the opposite. Wine: we did the bin 36 flight, I do not recommend this flight. None of the wines were bad, but there was nothing exciting about any of them. I would try a different flight or make my own next time Cheese: we did the American cheese flight and it was amazing. This is a must have in my eyes. What moved Bin 36 from 3 stars to 4 stars is the fact that they carried 2 cheeses from Zingermans, one of my favorite places in Ann Arbor. In the American cheese flight you get the Bridgewater from Zingermans which is superb. Soup & Salad: we had the market salad and shrimp bisque were both very good. I would say that the salad is a must have with great fresh pepper, brie, pears, and vinaigrette dressing. Meal: we had the marlin which which came on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with onion rings. The dish was fantastic, lots of pepper, well cooked, and a lot of flavors going on. Atmosphere: Nice open space with a very welcoming feel. The two person tables on the side are close together, but that is pretty common for the city, I feel.",5/4/2012,jmubBf0zucpsM4-,h1BUlTlxijqn2WLqsz1TDA,2WoMT3wSpp9vxZeTv6u-cw,N,5,1

59176,If you are truly a fan of sushi steer clear of this place! Virtually all the rolls contain something fried or are drenched in mayonnaise-y sauces. Even the ginger dressing is made from mayo - hello calories! Sushi is supposed to be light and fresh fish - not grease and fat. Ick. Even the miso soup is off - there is tofu and seaweed there but the broth tastes like straight up sodium.

The atmosphere is nice and the patio on a hot day is the place to be. I ordered the snapper. It was pretty good, not the best i've ever had but i wasn't disappointed either. The service could have been a bit better.

18472,"Caro Mio has a special place in our heart because we were engaged here. Years later, it is still amazing. We had Christmas dinner last night with my parents, and naturally will be enjoying the leftovers for days to come. Being the kind of people that make homemade pasta in our own kitchen, the only acceptable way for us to carb out away from home is...well, homemade pasta. They've done away with all the greenery in the front window, which is kind of a shame because it was so pretty, but the place is always packed. More seating just naturally won out. Entrees take a bit of time to come out, but I would not want it any other way. This is beautiful made-to-order pasta. My father had the monster of all dishes, the special chicken parmigiana with homemade rigatoni. (Incidentally, this was also the dish I chose on the magical engagement night. My husband must really love me considering he still proposed after watching me scarf down half a plate of a not-so-ladylike dish.) Hubby went with the linguine and clams Diablo - a classic, nice and spicy and garlicky. I had the angelotti with peas and prosciutto, one of my standby favorites. The perfect mix of sweet and salty. But my mom won for the night. The special pappardelle with sun dried tomatoes, chicken, spinach, and gratineed to perfection. Damn. Go early for a little romance, the later it gets, the more crowded (and noisy.) But walking home from Caro Mio, a little boozy, smelling of garlic, hand and hand with your sweetie, the other hand holding tomorrow's lunch, it doesn't really get better than that.",12/23/2010,Kmt4XE4TYBtatTsvR-n3,aVJRem3nM7St04KG7ANzEA,NGfbRjWoqUh2fGw8DU_pmA,N,5,1

What originally drew me to the restaurant is that they have one of my FAVE dishes from LA that you can't find here which is the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice Cake. I think because I know what the original tastes like I'm spoiled. The rice was there, but the tuna was extremely spicy. I was very disappointed. I have learned though that lunch is definitely the best time to go (try their chicken salad), but it's a condensed menu and some of my favorite rolls aren't listed.

39004,"Medium place: it is not rare, but it certainly isn't well done. (Ok, enough Statler & Waldorf quotes.) Went on 8/27/2012, and not in a terrible rush to return. I will return for whiskey purposes. As a scotch man, their menu is fair but excels mostly in the area of American whiskeys more so than the precious whisky from that enchanted island in Atlantic Ocean. You can get just about every small batch Bourbon or Tennessee Whiskey, and they even go to the trouble of getting some of the rarer distillations. The bartender was knowledgeable as to the palate of the spirit, and when I told him I hate the sugary taste of most Bourbon (i.e. from the corn-based sugars) and of Irish Whisky (b/c of the triple distillation), he understood his customer immediately and made suggestions. Any bartender that knows her/his inventory is worth seeing again, and that's why this place gets three stars right off the bat. As to ambiance and food, well, there's a reason we didn't move off from just three stars, isn't there?  I read a previous review, and yes, this is Hipster Heaven. Each of these philistines probably listens Radiohead, is a closet Hanson/Lady Gaga/LMFAO fan, but touts Wilco as having invented Rock'n'Roll. It's as though the standard Hipster Conformist Uniform is nearly a requirement: ironic t-shirt, ironic winter hat in the hottest summer in many years, and ironic tattoo...very un-Chicago. You should resist the urge to tell these people they suck, however, because (1) the will serve you food and (2) you know these are the wiener kids that grew up with Participation Awards for playing soccer and have faux high self esteem. You would shatter their little double-pits-to-chesty world if you let them know they are way, way uncool for wearing Kurt Kobain's wardrobe and/or 1980's attire in 2012. Let it go, it's too easy, and you're better than that. Besides, we need to discuss the horrid execution they gave for the food. Firstly, the generalities included a lack of some basic fundamentals. I rolled out with a veggie friend (pescetarian, to be precise) among our group. (Pescetarians can be junior foodies because at least they understand protein.) So, we directly asked ""Skeech"" the Waiter if the two dishes she and I split had any meat whatsoever. He replied, ""No."" Being that I have an unending love of bacon, I quickly identified that there was bacon-smoked infusion in a dish my friend had already been eating. Now, if you have veggie/vegan friends, then you know your job is help them I.D. a meat taste if they lack familiarity, and then be prepared to assist with holding back their hair after you do. You also may know that one of life's guarantees for a veggie/vegan person is that they will get very sick from that most delicious of all meats: bacon. Skeech failed. Next, nearly every dish was undercooked. You expect that one out of six would be undercooked, but four of six was too many. We had a variety of plates, but the Duck several ways, the steak, and the mixed dishes all were undercooked. Only my lobster and the fish (I believe the catch that day was a sole) were served at the correct temperature. Lastly, the wine suggestion was so far beneath par that I doubt Skeech could ever discern a merlot from a Cotes^ Du Rhone' because, well, I asked for the closest thing to a Cotes^ Du Rhone' and he brought me that dog shit known as merlot. (As an aside, I hated merlot way before it was 'Sideways' chic). There is a reason, though, that I did not deduct a star for the food, which is that the lobster tail was absolutely phenomenal, having been correctly prepared in terms of temperature and managing to have a uniquely rich presentation. It was served in broda with three out-of-this world marscapone-filed tortellini. The broth itself had a seafood-vegetable blend, and the stock was fresh, leaving me to believe it was made in-house. The fish, other than the bacon-infused beat that was mischaracterized as veggie (hey, I loved the damn thing!), was amazingly fresh for Chicago, having an almost crispy sear and accompanied with fresh veggies. Dessert was truly enticing and succulent, as the ""old time sunday"" combined the best fruits with the best chocolate and a simple vanilla ice cream that will return you to your childhood. Overall, I'm going to come back when I'm bored, stay at the inn portion of the establishment, try the hoity-toity ""bar"" menu, and enjoy the whiskey. I think that might be its role, and so that's why it gets a second chance, but I'm not pacing to get back there any time soon.",7/12/2012,1TgcHrtXapZTafSSUavRVQ,gSGJkDlLjLYip3iH2AvCIg,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,N,4,1

I'm a food-industry person, and I can honestly say Fogo is among the cleanest places I've ever seen. Only issue: when they're busy, the ""no-touch"" (read: sanitary) trash bins get really full - and I feel bad leaving my trash on the counter! I recommended you shove a 32 gal bin outside the door on busy nights!4. They have 60 kinds of pizza on the menu. Even so, I am one of those people who always asks for something special.

39590,"Second time I've been to a Korean BBQ, but this was the first time cooking over charcoal. It's definitely smoky and started to bother my eyes a bit by the end of the meal, buy my peepers are pretty sensitive, so I won't count it against them. I went with two other ladies and think this is definitely a group joint. Sharing the the main thing. We got to sit at one of the tables along the edge of the restaurant where you have to take off your shoes and essentially sit on the floor level. I really liked this since it made it seem different and fun. The we got short ribs and bulgogi and I liked them both. I gotta say I enjoyed the quality of the meat at Cho Sun Ok a little more, but I really liked the flavor of the charcoal over the hot stone pots they use at Cho Sun Ok. Service was fine, nothing spectacular, but we weren't ignored or anything. The food was good and we did get more little sides than I remember getting at Cho Sun Ok, so that was really fun, trying the different things. If I have a friend who wants to head for Korean BBQ with a group, I won't hesitate in recommending San Soo Gab San.

56356,"I don't give out 5 stars lightly - that fifth one usually has to get pried out my cold dead fingers - but I can't avoid it with this place. It is Simply It - a great place to get exotic food at reasonable prices. 6 of us went there on a Monday eve to celebrate my wife's birthday. If I mentioned which one there would be more cold dead fingers -- so I'll let it pass. Anyway - the family made the trek to Lincoln Ave for a reserved table for 6 at 7 - and it was ready and waiting for us - with a personal hello from the owner - and let's face it - who doesn't like a personal hello from the owner. Makes you feel important. They seated and watered us quickly, took our wine and had us wined up in a matter of moments as well -then the fun started. The menu is a treat just to read. Spring rolls, tempura, sticky rice cakes - we selected a few and they were all delicious. The calamari comes in a 1/2 pineapple - and the 15 yr old daughter who won't eat anything - actually ate it all. They get 5 stars just for that! Main courses consisted of clay pot catfish - excellent if you like catfish - not too bad if you just like Clay pots. We also had something wrapped in banana leaves - which gave it a taste that we couldn't identify - something like candy circus peanuts was suggested - it turned out it was banana flavor - duh! Meanwhile the wine kept flowing as the food kept coming - 6 of of us shared 4 appetizers and 5 entrees - and my poor son (literally - since he just moved in to the city) was able to take home a nice doggy bag for the dog he doesn't have. All of this at a price I usually pay for just my wife and I to celebrate at a fancy suburban restaurant with less food and overpriced wine. I have to mention the beautiful arrangement of pastries, fruit and raspberry sauce they provided to celebrate the birthday. It was a great end to a nice evening. The beauty is the menu is so vast we can back and do it again and try all new stuff.

58455,"Man, what a bummer. I saw all of these great reviews and I thought this is perfect for my sister's birthday dinner of 10! However, I'm no dummy that is just going to plan a whole group dinner based on strangers reviews, so I went there tonight Friday at 6pm. We were both starving-would have thought anything was great. (let me also preface this by saying we do have good taste in food and I cook very well myself.) The bruchette which the mgr recommended was extremely full of garlic. I could pick large chunks out. Next we chose the grilled vegetables which my boyfriend believed must have been from a frozen bag since he works for a restaurant and knows the difference-however these were not bad. After that I got frutta del mar which is clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari with lunguini. Very OK-I really didn't like it much. My boyfriend (who loves pasta got spagetti-how can you mess that up. He said it was over cooked and filled with garlic. The name of the restaurant should really be garlic. No itialian music, definitely not owned by italians. I think the only reason people go there is because its BYOB. I'd rather pay for over priced wine than over priced and over hyped food. Worst part is that I had to cancel a 10 top for Sunday and have to find a new restaurant for my family(",8/28/2008,lVS-otVesT4AJ7aOUA-nug,h6BDIkBAfKc7rMIG2wEH9w,NGfbRjWoqUh2fGw8DU_pmA,Y,5,0

53271,"I did not know what to expect from this restaurant - I've heard that the restaurant itself looks like any other 'ordinary' building, without the name blazing about. They have valet, but you can find parking a few blocks away (non-permit). You enter the restaurant, and you walk down a short corridor that has purple lighting, and enter to your left. You are greeted by literally 5-7 men, dressed in suits, asking you the same question - 'How are you doing this evening?'. We were seated in the dining area on the ground level, a booth with some comfortable cushions. The waitstaff seems very particular in the placement of your beverages, and cleans up with a damp towel of any morsel or droplet of liquid that gets on the surface of the table. I tried the Green Tea/Grapefruit/Laven der, which was like a grapefruit sparking soda, with a hing of ginger. My cousin had the Ginger Citrus, which tasted literally like a strong ginger ale beverage (definitely better than the one at Wow Bao's). We had the Tasting Menu, and I expected probably a small morsel of anything, but I was actually surprised with the amount they give you for each plate. We first started off with the English Pea, and it tasted like green pea ice cream - slightly thick and creamy, and it was quite nice. The next was the Shad Roe, which tasted like a bacon tempura ball with a twig of bay leaves used as a skewer. The Distillation was a wine glass of Thai liquid, which was the least favorite of the dishes - it tasted like red pepper flakes with a hint of floral. The Pork Belly, which was my favorite of it all, was making your own spring roll with this rice paper that has beautiful little flowers within, and the restaurant presents you a glass platter of different ingredients that you build with - the braised pork was just delicious!!! The next dish we had was the Sturgeon, which were cubes of sturgeons with leek and croutons - great creamy sauce with smoked apple ribbon running across. Next was a cute little 3-part bowl with different tempered-Jonah Crab - it contained lobster mousse, king crab with crusted avocado, star anise bubble (which tasted creamy and black licorice-like). We had an offer of a glass of Sassporillo - really strong orange-colored root beer (not a fan of it). The next plate was the Filet de Boeuf, presented as a clock set-up, with little spoonfuls beef tongue (which was my absolute favorite since it was so awesome), duck was bleh, wagyu beef was kind of soft chewy, the panko too overly fried, the mushroom was just like a wet mushroom, cocksical (from the rooster) was gelatin-like - interesting experience. Next dish was the Duck, with cubes of duck with mushrooms, a cylindrical foie gras encrusted in dehydrated orange. Next was a spoonful of truffle ravioli - liquid 'explosion' of truffle inside. Next was the Earl Grey, the plate being set upon a fragrant Earl Grey pillow - the plate itself contained rounds of lemon curds with Earl Grey graham bits and a hint of rose water throughout. Next was a Chocolate dish, a trio of chocolate - chewy white bits, menthol, pudding, and several coral-like frozen chocolate at the end. As an extra treat, the restaurant gave us a ball of chocolate with melting cream (which was heavenly and good for the chocolate buffs). Our last dish was the Bubble Gum, which was a glass test tube-like filled with long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche - I liked the bubble gum-flavored tapioca balls. The whole experience took about 3 hours, and be sure to ask the waitstaff if you could take a tour of the kitchen - it's cool to see a behind-the-scenes look at each of the carefully-made dish. You get a copy of the menu with explanations of the circles at the end of your meal as a 'souvenir.' Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to experience a restaurant that's rated as one of the top restaurants in the world, and the fact that it was located in Chicago! If I had all the money in the world, I would probably dine here everyday. It's quite interesting to get an attentive service like this, and enjoying the beautifully-presente d food that actually tastes good as well!Yay for this restaurant getting 3 Michelin stars - Chef Achatz totally deserves it.",9/23/2012,JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,JHzpQRxujM64pPudizNwjA,sDYjKyI_67eUhFAqVneYjA,N,4,1

36141,"I seriously wonder what's wrong with people, reading all the glowing reviews of Sun-Wah and seeing how crowded it was tonight. The meal I just had there qualifies without hesitation as one of the most disgusting restaurant experiences in my entire life. The ambiance is awful, the service atrocious - rude, slow and unattentive - and the food (fried wontons and the bbq combination platter) was so bad, I've eaten better in school cafeterias. The appetizer was fatty, doughy and utterly flavorless, only edible slathered with generous amounts of soy sauce. The main course arrived very late and was obviously heated and reheated many times over, but still served cold, rubbery and hardened. Every single mouthful of so-called food had bits of bone, cartilege, sinews and fat and that goes for the rice as well. It was actually as if somebody had deliberately mixed the rice with bone shards, and cut the meat with a chain saw. Granted, prices here are affordable and servings generous - but are those really the only redeeming factors? There are so many many restaurants that are so vastly superior in the neighbourhood, I don't understand the appeal of Sun-Wah at all.",5/21/2011,UpTesK0PXGHMtK03OGwUPA,09mbzv_hZxDdHL-rhoxgdQ,tCkwBTuEFvhuaBoEUWqbuQ,N,3,1

Good flavor on both sauces and thick chips. $4 charge once again is a bit steep, especially when other places include them in your meal at no charge.Dislikes:The food always sounds great, the descriptions of the ingredients and plate presentations are very good. The issue I have is the food never tastes as good as it sounds or looks. Don't get me wrong, it has complex flavors and seems to be made with fresh ingredients, but all the dishes seem to lack salt (I am not a salt lover, but you need a touch to bring out flavors) and other times the sauces don't complement the protein ( a dark mole type sauce does not go with fish, even in Mexico, dark moles come from the intrior of Mexico...not much seafood there).I keep going back because I don't care for greasy tex-mex and Frontera is definately several steps above that.",6/7/2010,fJh0kLMzRUJIeRQj5Pd_9A,GhSbIK6OPKeEbGlvg0yDPQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,Y,1,0
12801,I am a huge fan of Fogo de Chao but Texas de Brazil is every bit as good as Fogo. You are seated promptly by amazing looking hostess and the serving staff are friendly and efficient. The Mrs. prefers Texas de Brazils salad bar as it has sushi as well as soup and warm starters. I personally think Fogos salad bar is better as they have more dressings and everything seems more fresh but there really isn't a big difference between either salad bar. The lady spinning in the wine cave doesn't do much for me but my nephew loves it so again its whatever you are into yourself. The meat in Texas de Brazil can taste salty however the quality of the meat is very good but I do wish they would use less salt. Their Brazilian sausages are amazing and I always eat 5 or 6 at every visit. The bananas and bread are refreshed frequently and any time I have gone the servers and gauchos have all been very freindly.

9915,"Our story starts with me reading that Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen is an owner. Cool factor just went up a few notches. Now....we decide to pop by on a Friday night at about 7:30....we had to wait a bit....but not as long as I thought we would (45 min). It was REALLLLLY crowded and noisy....so if you want a slightly more civil atmosphere....wait for a table upstairs. This place is bursting with energy....and the wait staff was cool and edgy (girls with tats and spunky attitude)....and the service was good (especially considering how crowded it was) Now on to the stuff that really matters....the food. The pizza is NY style thin crust...and I was stoked to see how many topping options they had (many off the beaten path). We ordered a large half veggie (Banana Pepper, Spinach, Shroom and Onion) and half cheese. The crust was thin, crispy and flavorful. The ingredients were garden fresh...and it was piping hot. For NY style....this is one of the best I have tried. Note: I highly recommend BANANA PEPPERS....they are pickled with a hint of vinegar and add a nice piquant heat to your pie. Much more lively than red pepper.... For beverages I feel they fall a bit short due to their catering to the beer snob....I undestand that they are a brewery, but they are lacking a bit on the selections for those who DONT like IPA/Hope Bomb craft beeer.

54112,"Oh my goodness.Make no mistake, this is not a fine dining restaurant, this is not even a casual restaurant. It shares more in common with a Quiznos than with the former two categories. That said, it is phenomenal.If you go when it's busy, you're asked to wait in line for a table allocation before ordering. It's worth it. You then order at the counter and get your food in 15 minutes or so at your table. Everything is super fresh and made to order. I can recommend both the Pepito and the Woodland Mushroom. It's interesting to have something on a yeasted bread that tastes Mexican, but it makes me want to go to Mexico again.After our delicious dinner, we had some churros, ice cream (with a delicious praline that included bacon, yes, bacon), caf con leche, and melted chocolate mixed with almond milk. Rick Bayless may be a celebrity chef, but he's still working the details in his restaurants. He was working on the ice cream machine when we were there. Super impressed that someone of his caliber is still making sure every little thing is perfect.In summary, go here. You may have to share a table with people you've never met, but enjoy it, make some friends with both the people and the food.",4/11/2012,jtDgqJ8w3BKGIHoNjkucKg,Qu5D9o2RlUO7ty-sl-_OHA,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,Y,2,0

No trashing on them yet though, because I still have high hopes. Back to Revolution! The atmosphere is fun and the dining space is very open. I'm not a beer drinker, so I opted for a Belvidere & 7, although my dining partner had one of their beers and seemed to like it. The food was fantastic! I had some burger with sauteed crimini mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese and fried onions. Best burger I've had in a while! I had the blue cheese potato salad as my side which was fantastic!! My dining partner had the fish & chips. The fries were super tasty, and they hand cut them! Also, our food came out super fast, and service was quite attentive.

55893,"Saturday, August 30, 2008Review of terribly rude service from Calo Ristorante located in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. My partner and I have patronized Calo Ristorante on many occasions. Calo Ristorante in my opinion has flavorful Italian cuisine at a reasonable price with mediocre service. However, on this particular occasion the managers' service skills were not present. My partner and I were viewing the menu posted out side of the restaurant before entering. The manager was walking into the restaurant and proceeded to hold the door open for a female patron and let the door swing shut behind him knowingly aware that my partner and I were directly behind him. We proceeded to open the door and walk in to the restaurant to be seated. The manager pretended not to notice that he had just shut the door in our faces as we were entering behind him. We ignored the incident and asked for a table for two. The manager proceeded to escort us to the loud noisy bar side were live music was playing. When I asked for a table on the other side of the restaurant he replied with all sorts of excuse's when there were clearly plenty of tables available for us to sit at. We declined the table and decided to eat else where. I am astonished at how simple it is to treat customers with dignity and respect and how difficult it is for some employees to perform this task. We have patronized Calo Ristorante many times, however, we will never consider entertaining the idea of having dinner at Calo Ristorante ever again. There are too many restaurants in the Chicago area to choose from with much better service and food for us to spend our money at.I thought you should know,Edgewater resident",10/16/2008,yAbUFbU2-Tywrbk5lPJGUw,Ybc2UnOS7VdSfnULvTvK8w,dLS8GPg-K1O-zJ3VJAtiyg,Y,5,0
55870,"I have been to India House many times. The food and service have always been supurb. However, recently I took a friend who was visiting from out of town and was very disappointed. The service was good but not great. The worst was the chilli chicken masala. The dish while very tasty was barely edible because the chicken itself was extremly tough, chewy and dry. We informed the server when he finally returned to our table. He could see that we couldn't even cut the pieces on my plate, so he offered to remake the dish, but at that point we had already waited a very long time for our food in the first place, and then again for the server to come back by our table. We took home the left overs but ended up tossing all the chicken. I think for the caliber of restaurant this is and with the prices it charges it can do a much better job of using better quality ingredients.",12/26/2010,rmOJs-2RhLtlkanBUlt2qQ,dKJAjEgN4zANkph-aQMLEw,dLS8GPg-K1O-zJ3VJAtiyg,Y,5,0

The Pho Bo is a main staple though- reason enough to order!Also they always give you complimentary fruit on the side (for take out at least) and again the staff is so nice.

28433,"I was really excited to go to Frontera. After realizing that reservations are made 3 months in advance and booked up solid, we waited 2 hours and finally made it to a nice spot outside of Frontera (even the fact that it was 9pm by then). Just be wary trying to ""walk-in"" for dinner here. We started off with the chips and salsa ($3 is a good value, but I'd pass here, the salsas are very normal bottle water like). Then came the Shredded Beef over Corn boats with avocado and a out of control sauce. I would order 3 more orders of this. Then the trio ceviche (tuna with mango, scallops, and calamari). All three were light, well seasoned, and perfect. I only wish I ordered bowls of it. Lastly came the enchilada mole. Ok, so I may not be a Mexican expert, but I grew up in California, and have had my fair share of Mexican food. I found the mole to be a bit underseasoned, and not as robust as I would expect a mole that has been cooking for hours. The chicken seemed a bit dried out, actually, a lot dried out. I found the beans to actually be the best part of the dish. Seriously I was a bit underwhelmed by the dish. But, overall, given the prices, the decent service, and the idea behind the restaurant, I really enjoyed Frontera Grill.

30601,"In a town based partially on the beef industry and with a storied history of excellent steak houses, Mastros stepped up to the plate and proved it could play with the big boys. Indeed in the same breath, I will now say, ""Smith & Wolinski, Gene & Georgetti's, Chicago Chop House,... Mastros."" This is my first review, but it details my second visit here. ""Cutting to the chase"" (pun intended), the chef seared the entire exterior of the chop with a butter/oil combination of some sort that locked the flavor into it. The sear did not overpower the beef flavor at all. Importantly, I ordered medium, and I got medium; my friends ordered medium rare, and they got medium rare. These people know how to cook. These people also know how to select a cut. With an eye for detail, my NY Strip had enough marble to cook correctly and taste correctly. It did not have just any old marbling, but rather the cut was thinly marbled so that the bites just melted in your mouth and did not resist a single chew.  Finally, the place knew how to pair, prepare and cook the sides. I wanted grilled asparagus with a very light medium, and I received perfectly grilled asparagus with a slight bit of butter. Their renowned lobster mashed and wasabi mashed potatoes never disappoint and have their own draw. The lobster mashed are not greasy at all, and have the right amount of fat so as not to be overly rich. The wasabi mashed have the best flavor to them of any mashed potatoes I've ever had, and I eat mashed potatoes (and thus go to the gym) about 4 times per week. The sides are the specialty. The wine list is partially professional. If you know your wine, then you'll love it; if you don't know your wine, then the staff will help you love it. I had a Bordeaux, and I went out and bought half a case of the same because it was that good! Furthermore on the staff, professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and accomodating without compromising. They won't let some philistine come into the place and throw down some ketchup, but I also felt that they would not reprimand you obnoxiously for some social or dining misstep. Our waiter made our experience better. The ambiance is classic yet modern, with a sort of cleanliness to it that still makes the warm rather than sterile. You have a traditional, awesome piano bar where they keep booked an outstanding trio of a drummer, piano player, and vocalist. The lights are very, very dim, as they should be. The walls are dark wood, the accents are hard marble and other woods, with a tasteful and plush carpet in the dining rooms. The place embodies simple elegance. Returning to the piano bar, you get a lively but refined crowd of younger to middle-aged socialites, but no trashiness overall. You get all walks of life, older couples, girls/guys on the town, people just grabbing a bite, and those doing a quick business dinner in a really nice bar. Business professionals and classy average joes/janes as well frequented that day. The place has a great vibe. I only saw two hipsters, and both of them were bro's in what you could tell was their finest piece of ironic flannel clothing. Kudos to them for trying to exhibit some sort of manners by wearing some sort of collar and at least partially showering and partially covering their ironic tattoos, and not talking about going ""double-pits-to-chesty"" while INSIDE of the restaurant. Maybe these guys are the refined version of that awful manager at Owen & Wilson (a.k.a Owen & Engine)... but I digress. At the risk of just sounding as though I merely received exactly what I requested and hence was pleased upon delivery, I offer you this: consistency makes champions. However, I'll add that I have never been more impressed with the side dishes at any other steak house, which is what put Mastros into the big leagues. You should go there just to have the lobster or wasabi mashed potatoes some time! They're that good. Regrettably, I need to dock it one star because technically it is a chain, albeit on the higher end of chains. The common threat of a chain is always the stifling of creativity, and though the head chef may be creating in his main kitchen somewhere and have excellent monitoring at the locations, the formula approach always discounts as to the specialness of the location. Let's not hang our hats on that one downside, thought. This place is outstanding. Mastros, my hat is off to you, and I salute you for your excellence. I will be back next week!!",8/1/2011,Zqp1UXD1ktCGYai90jkjlg,BJO0qHeqEI2tp3uSHefrNQ,8d_DiHWB-pjBVW3a7D8EWg,N,4,1

The staff is very helpful and you get full control over the level of spice. With three rooms of dining, any size party is nicely accommodated and the bathrooms are clean. The appetizers are tasty; I recommend as the Satays and the Moo Ping. As for main courses, I usually go with the Eggplant in Oyster sauce. Their Pad Thais and Panang Curries are full of flavor and the soups are served in unique Thai bowls that may or may not double as trophies.

14940,"This place is swanky!!! After our anniversary dinner (and dessert) I suggested that we go check this place out. My boyfriend was on board so we walked down by Big Star and couldn't find anything! Well after crossing the street we noticed that people were entering a mural (yes, a mural). The doorman was wearing all black and we had to stand in a hallway with a velvet curtain with another couple while they found space for us. The house rules are hilarious, you can't use your cell phone inside. You must have proper attire, no flip flops please! The last one is definitely the best; don't bring anyone that you wouldn't bring to your mother's house for Sunday dinner. I haven't seen them enforce any of these rules, but everyone was generally well behaved on a Thursday night. We waited about 5 minutes and then were escorted to a table with two giant (tall) green leather chairs with a tiny circular table. The chairs are set up to be private (so for just the two of us) but there are little pods and all of the chairs are connected. They also have a bar area to sit at as well as booths for parties of more than two. The chairs aren't all that comfortable and it is dark and dim in the place, but that goes with the whole speakeasy feel. It's loud inside. People are chatting, couples are romancing, and the indie music is blaring. Everything in this place screams ""trying too hard"" but it wasn't as if I didn't enjoy the extravagance. I asked for something ""fruity and light"" and our server made the perfect suggestion, the Vodka Cobbler. I could drink this drink all night and my buzz snuck up on me fast. My boyfriend ordered something with root beer liquor. I am not a fan on root beer so I passed but he raved and raved. The service is a bit slow and expect to wait 10-15 minutes or more for your drink to come after you have ordered, especially on a busy night. Since the drinks are so involved (and there are a ton of options) it takes awhile to get your drink. We didn't have any food but the menu was short and to the point.

Getting here for the earliest reservation of the night can be a little uncomfortable... you are greeted by 3 or 4 people standing around in a very spare and modern room... in silence. Where's the music? But once the space starts filling up, and you're onto your 2 or 3rd pairing of wine (which I highly recommend you get! Its unbelievable!), this incredibly special experience becomes truly exceptional. Every dish was amazing. But the ones I loved the most were a pork belly DIY asian spring roll type thing. I am glad I've had some model airplane building experience in my youth, because this one required some assembling and disassembling of the place setting. (Probably also helped that it was one of the earlier dishes, before the buzz of the wine set in!) Also fantastic was the most amazing piece of beef I've ever had... incredibly marbled (was it wagyu, perhaps?). I don't think I can ever go back to having a normal slab of steak.

This was at least 8 giant garlicky shrimp cooked to perfection with rice, beans, and plantains. The BF and my mother had this pork special they normally have that's slow cooked and then fried crispy to order. I'm not a huge fan of pork but I'm coming back for that!

55157,"So I was at Q this Saturday night for a friends birthday. We had an 11 person reservation for 9 pm. I arrived at 8:45 so I could set up the table for the bday girl. It was obvious that they were crowded and overbooked. We ended up not being seated until 9:30 pm. We were asking the hosts for updates on timing when the manager decided to lie to us and tell us that they were running 15 mins late and our reservation was at 9:15 not at 9:30. This was a complete lie as I even looked over his shoulder and saw that it said 9 pm. Finally we were seated with no apology, no complimentary appetizer for our delay but fine, I let it. Then our waiter was completely overwhelmed and took about 20 minute to even get our drinks. I will say that the food is great which is I gave them 3 stars but their customer service in no better then 1 star.",2/20/2011,WqQ9tDzYWf7CyZ3X51YcoQ,DTLX77IJzs6s444CG8T8VA,euO3-H92LCivH2B0CQPlnw,Y,4,0
27336,"LOOOVE Pequod's. The only reason I cannot give this place five stars is because the pizza tastes slightly different each time. Having been here over 10 times, this past experience was the best it prompted me to finally write a review. The sauce was perfectly tart with the right amount of cheese and toppings: half pepp/half sausage being my favorite. The crust is unbelievable and I have no idea where they found the crust caramelizing wizard. They probably lock him in a cage to never see the light of day as this sets it apart from all other pizza places I have been to, and is what keeps me returning for more. The Medium is perfect for 2 as you get a great balance of crust and toppings. My ultimate favorite is the $4.95 lunch deal with pop/beer not only for the outrageous value, but for the balance of crust and the rest. Pequod's doesn't skimp on toppings for the personal size which fosters its loyal following. i dream of Pequod's on a daily basis and am really bummed I can't go here tonight, despite having been this past Saturday.

3999,"I just got back to my hotel following dinner at schwa. My ears are ringing. They're ringing loud and nonstop. My voice is raspy from having to shout to be heard during dinner. 80% of what the food runners said to describe a particular dish couldn't be deciphered above the roar of their music. Talk about high stress dining.... 3 hours of deafening music, helter skelter service, and quite frankly, surroundings befitting a bomb shelter. Further, the music makes no sense. It's blaring for the benefit of the line cooks yet it's directed toward the customers. I'm not sure if there is much truth to their reservation inadequacies. I called the restaurant this afternoon. The phone was answered promptly by a pleasant young lady. I asked about a reservation for the same evening and she asked if I preferred 6, 6:30 or, 8:30. I selected 8:30 and that was that. The host and busboy for our meal was the head cook's brother. A very nice guy. Wired pretty tight, but nice all the same You can read a dozen other reviews for details on the succession of courses. A few of them were very good. A few of them were forgettable. All of them are miniscule. Too many of them have some sort of foam or dried out sauce streaked across the dish. One of the foams actually tasted like soap suds. That which stood out, on each of the 2 or 3 times it occurred, was when something was served that offered some substance. Something to actually bite and chew, rather than just slurp and swallow. Most of their food is baby food soft. When something finally comes along that has some body, sadly, it's just a bite in size. Even their lamb, for example, was served in miniature. 4 slices, maybe 1/8"" thick and smaller than 1"" x 3/4"". BYO. No soft drinks offered. No bread offered. No coffee or tea offered. Overall- I have to give Schwa 1 star- based on the simple truth that I would never return. Not even as somebody's guest. Life's too short.",1/20/2012,AKW8jzCXJoZ6KtZ83TOA8w,r2xywQp9aOCd6IWYer2fUQ,bNXpwTSavHBV9zBk2lUlGA,N,1,1

In sum total, it was THE best restaurant opening I've ever had the pleasure to be invited to. Aside from the fact that it was free (!), guests were provided with THE best lobster, crab legs, crab claws, ahi tuna, and steak I've ever had in my life!....and that's ASIDE from the fact that it was free. Oh yeah...superb wine, desserts (warm butter cake!), service, and overall ambiance as well. Did I mention that the soft opening was all you can eat? Yowzer!! I cannot wait to try this place again, with REAL money on the line. If it's even 75% as good as it was last night, it will easily surpass my expectations. Simply put, I think it may turn out to be the best that Chicago has to offer....in my humble, yet correct opinion. :DFunny aside: A guy in his late 20's was standing in the lobster line ahead of me, and flippantly said that he'd been to Mastro's in Vegas, and that it was the best restaurant he'd ever been to in his life. Of course, I promptly gave him my best yeah, whatever look of condescension. Turns out the joke was on me, since it really was that good.

Anyways, I barely looked at the menu and decided on the $19.99 combo deal. This came with a whole fried chicken, in 2 different sauces, with 2 sides, and 2 drinks. Pretty sweet deal. The chicken had a nice crunch, which stayed crispy while covered in sauce, and the chicken was juicy. The Seoul Sassy sauce was sweet and ginger-garlicky. It's not your typical Korean wing sauce, but it was still tasty. The Crisp BBQ sauce was good with a nice kick. The fries weren't anything special, but the fried mushrooms were great.  They also have chicken strips as well as varioius Korean style rice bowls. I love me some Korean fried chicken and Crisp definitely satisified.

51879,"I have no idea why this doesn't get a full 5 stars. Let's face it, unless I get done dirty, if I post a review on Yelp, it's because I LOVE it! And Gino's is no exception. Now, as far as deep dish or pan pizzas go, Domino's deep dish is my sole experience. Anyway, I'm gonna make this a short review because the mere thought of Gino's crust makes me salivate, and being nearly 2000 miles away, it's not helping me! My buddy and I had two small pizzas, and that was A LOT to eat for the two of us. So much so that one big slice made it back home with us. We had Gino's Supreme with patty sausage and pepperonis. I was a bit disappointed by the sausage patty. It was otherwise pretty damn good! The other one was the Meaty Legend, was seen in Man vs Food, and wow it was sooooo good! But the main attraction was the crust. That big slab of crust that borders the pan is just pure heaven! It's unlike ANYTHING else you've ever had. It's a bit buttermilk and a bit corn bread, but it's a whole lot of goodness! Anyway, if you're a Chicago first timer and a deep dish pizza novice like I was, Gino's East is a definitive stop! BEWARE: The lines are crazy on a Friday night. If you're staying at a hotel, hit up your friendly concierge and they'll hook you up with a ""head of the line"" pass that lets you bypass the line (and enables your concierge to get a little kickback I'm sure).

I mentioned the tasteless stew to our waitress and didn't get much of a response- it's not really the kind of place criticism is taken seriously from the white girl who can't even pronounce what she refers to as ""tofu stew"" and points to the menu when ordering.",4/26/2011,Jju8rN5ytVirU5hlwvC9,flulR0EJKs9sfX13M8_HQQ,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,N,4,1
42725,"We came here for a drink after dinner someplace else and before heading off to a bar to see a band so I can only comment on the drinks and the ""speakeasy."" I think my husband was more enamored with drinking in a room designated the ""speakeasy"" than anything. The girl down there was very nice and suggested I try the Death's Door Daisy (death's door vodka, aperol, st. germain, lemon). My husband tried some sort of rum runner/pina colada-y drink that I can't find online now. There were a handful of tables filled with couples or groups of 4 and it did take a little while to get our drinks. We weren't in a hurry and we were chatting so it didn't really bother us. She brought over a carafe of water while we were waiting which was nice too. My drink was great but I think I could have only had one, it was incredibly tart. It was what I was in the mood for but couldn't see making a night out of this drink without some serious heartburn around 3am. I wish they had a small dessert or appetizer menu down here since the upstairs was packed and I was in the mood for a small bite but I understand.

Then it continues with a continuous parade of excellent beef, lamb, and chicken served to you directly by the guys who grilled it. They can serve you any temperature you like and it's all delicious.

28799,"I have been here several times with friends and it all went well. Love their papaya salad the most! However, there were one experience that killed all my positive energy for this place. It was about half a year ago when it happened but I didn't join Yelp then. It was on my mother-in-law's birthday and our family came here to celebrate. Everything was great until I found 2 cockroaches next to me. One was on the wall and the other one was on the table. Everybody felt so disgusted and we called the server out to show him the evidence (my husband killed them with the napkin). But there were no apology coming from him or any other staff later and the server also looked at our family as trouble makers since we said it out loud. Because of this experience, I haven't come back here and I don't think i will ever again. I also told my friends not to come because cockroaches in the front house is seriously not acceptable!!!! So everybody when you come here and you sit next to the wall, watch for those disgusting creatures.",8/24/2011,DIiadAjqmAxslmD6xNp2Zw,2vpR7ZWFz6RbnIBk5hrvNQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,5,1

I got to the office and was ready for a nap. This place has an extensive menu. They also have an auxiliary Seasonal menu. I spent a fair amount of time making a decision. I opted for the ""Porky Benedict"" from the seasonal menu. Pulled pork, and lots of it, replaced the traditional Canadian Bacon. It wasn't smoked like one might expect from a BBQ joint, but it was very tasty. The description mentioned that it came with fresh fruit. I was expecting an orange wedge and perhaps a few bits of melon. What I got was orange slices, two good sized chunks of fresh pineapple, a big chunk of melon, and a handful of grapes. There was also an ample portion of diced red potatoes. The space is open and bright. The staff is friendly and attentive.

I was happy with our waitress Kelly P. The food was really delicious and I thought that the portions were perfect. My husband and I left pleasantly surprised how low our bill was for the amount of food we had. The Tales of Two Tunas is my favorite sushi roll there so far!

15609,"Jim has been talking about this place for quite a while, so when his birthday dinner loomed, we weren't surprised when he chose Carnivale for the festivities. We were seated relatively quickly, and the staff was very attentive. Drinks arrived fast as did our appetizers -- guacamole (Excellent, chunky and tasty) and Flores y Camarones (SO delicious we all agreed that they could just keep them and the drinks coming and we'd be happy.) both of which we split three ways. After overdoing it the previous week at Maya del Sol, I was determined to take it easier on the cocktails so I only had one, but it was a coconut mojito, and if you think that sounds good you should try it. In fact, try drinking only one! It was heavenly. Just a perfect cocktail. Jim's margarita was delicious, too, but it could not steal my heart away from my mojito. The birthday boy had the costilla des res. Again, not a surprise because he is a serious fan of the short rib. I love them, too, but I saw gnocci with ramps, mushrooms and peas and simply could not resist. I snarfed them down in spite of preferring my dumplings to be heavier. These were like clouds and I still loved them because the sauce was so exceptional. Glinda had the Peruvian-style chicken and I was blown away by how moist and tender it was.  Desserts were the farmers' market special which was a mixed berry cobbler, chocolate cake with almond ice cream and the banana cream pie. With candied macadamia nuts. They took out one of my crowns. Actually I found it kind of funny; it was an old crown and s**t happens. No big. I told the waitress that but she kept apologizing. Then the hostess came by and apologized and comped the pie, which I thought was pretty nice of them. But then I'm kind of easy-going about stuff.  (Which is one reason why, when I give a one-star review, pay attention to it. I am HARD to piss off.) I have to admit that along with excellent food and service the people-watching is fantastic at Carnivale. A couple got engaged while we were there, and the outfits that flowed past the table ranged from ""That looks nice and cool"" to ""Oh dear, mutton dressed as lamb."" to ""What is that guy wearing?"" to ""What DO you think you LOOK like?"" But in the end, the place has such a laid back vibe that almost everything worked. It was fun. It was what its name implied, a kind of carnivale atmosphere year-round. Well done to the owners; they've created a winner.",7/2/2012,NmK1p4VS2lS3-wBW92xJIQ,rQqrE48TgzrWy2yOyYKjTQ,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg,N,5,1

It makes sense though- this place is always packed whenever I walk past.I finally stopped in here the other night with a friend to see what all the fuss was about. Well, there's a reason for the fuss. This place is great! Talking about the atmosphere sounds kind of lame, but the design really is calming and beautiful. Even if you sit outside, you still get a really calming experience.Ok, so to the good part- the food! We ordered the crab rangoon (has a slightly different name- but that's what it is) and it was delicious. The edges were crispy but the center was moist and yummy.We aren't big sushi people, so we played it a bit safe with our selection. We ordered a regular tuna and avocado maki (my fav), the sweet potato maki, and a spicy trio roll. I wanted to compare the tuna to other places I usually get sushi (Whole Foods... yeah, I know). I can safely say the basic tuna roll at Wakamono is the best tuna I've had. The sweet potato was pretty unique, and definitely was a good choice for breaking up all the fish. I recommend it if you're unsure about getting a bunch of fish.They also had a special on house wine, $4 for a glass was not too bad. Overall, I had a very enjoyable dinner at Wakamono and recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable yet great sushi experience.",4/7/2008,P4oGwXVbn86XxHHN7l0b-g,lmKLTMTtQxogGcoWQy1dJg,ms5ge1XY9-Alu7HkybAMdQ,Y,4,0

Very naughty, but comfort food at it's absolute best. DESSERT: Raspberry Pie, Key lime Pie. The Raspberry pie adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream was pure HEAVEN on a plate.

I tried the Trio, Trio, Trio-- a sampling of ceviches so delicious that I don't even know which one was my favorite. I had the carne asada for my entree, which was really tasty as well. As stuffed as I was, I still ordered dessert-- the mango crisp with rhubarb ice cream. It was so good, I wish I had saved more room for it. Frontera loses a star for its attitude though.

They have two things that make this place worth 4 stars, without these two things the restaurant would be a 3 star place.1. The cheese plate menu- The Fat Cat is probably the best but others are really amazing as well.2. The truffle honey that the cheese puffs are dipped in. Both of those things elevate this place to a higher level. The service is entirely dependent on how busy the restaurant is. On nights that are less busy the service can be excellent. However, on nights where things are a little more crowded I have found the services slipping quickly. Otherwise, the food is general good and the wine list is extensive.

Excellent raspberry mojito. I ordered it then almost had buyer's remorse, thinking they may add some razmatazz or something...but was pleasantly relieved to see that they muddled fresh raspberries into the drink. The harmony of lime, mint, and flecks of fresh berry were a great combination. I think this restaurant is in the building that housed The Drink years ago.

57162,"I'm perplexed with the large amount of good ratings with Revolution Brewing. I'm in Logan Square a lot so I was very excited for this place. The hordes of people who descended on RevBrew wasn't a big surprise and the wait usually wasn't too bad assuming you didn't go specifically for a table during peak times. Outside of the interior, which I love, everything about this place is average. The beer, which I was looking forward to the most because I'm a beer snob, was a huge disappointment. The beers are by no means bad but they fail to distinguish themselves. The Workingman Mild tasted too watered down, the Coup d'etat started off interesting but stopped there and the Bottom Up Wit was merely passable. I must admit, however, that the Eugene porter was pretty good. When I had the RevBrew beers they didn't distinguish themselves from other stalwart wits, milds or saisons. The food (only appetizers so far, will return for main courses) were somehow more bland than the beer, an impressive feat which the cooks should be commended for. The spicy sweet potato cakes weren't spicy at all and lacked any complexity, the bruschetta (goat cheese + beats, traditional) was simply awful and the beer cheese soup tasted like something I could have concocted in 15 minutes. In each of these appetizers what was apparent was that the ingredients were subpar. The beets with the bruschetta lacked flavor and the cheese used in the soup was boring. I really, really wanted to like this place. It's a damn shame that the owner decided to play it safe and produce mediocrity because this place could have been amazing.",4/26/2010,BetJMRzC6WMXiqQ-5-blpQ,A_fuT2Eez20vfm8dvNh40w,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg,Y,2,0

47933,"On a long weekend to Chicago, with a late Sunday flight home, were looking for a good place for brunch/lunch that would see us through the day. This was it ! It's similar to a Brazilian steakhouse with food served directly at the table and a salad bar ( Harvest Tables) that you can visit as much as you like. Personally I found the Harvest Table fare a little disappointing as many items were too sweet, but this was brunch so that was to be expected. The table service food, however was excellent. Rib roast, turkey breast, ham, linguisa and salmon (though I don't usually eat farmed salmon) were all perfectly cooked and served freshly cooked from the kitchen. There were also more brunch-like egg based dishes - a poached egg on spinach and a frittata-like dish with corned beef. The servers will keep coming until you throw in the towel - or rock in this case. We definitely ate enough not to be hungry the rest of the day. $24 per person was a very reasonable price for the food offered, though we spent double that as we had a bottle of wine in addition to a sangria and a flight of wine ( 3 x 2oz for $12). Actually the wine selection was reasonably priced in comparison to some of the other Chicago menus I had seen.  All the staff were friendly and very attentive - we arrived at 1pm, there were only a few tables occupied, so I don't know if that applies during busier times. Unfortunately, I probably won't get back to Chicago for years, so I won't be able to check out the dinner at this place.",8/31/2009,9KcXIndBn9YX2RibYLrJAw,i0UxJpJ8aKssT7yXVoUlEw,d6UbRb9W5eA1yL-DuVZ8ug,N,4,1

The environment was pretty nice too, I was surprised at how big the space is inside. The high ceilings help to alleviate the roaring of hockey-ees. Also, Piece is the kind of place you'll most likely see other people you know there. I don't know why...and I've only been once! Anyways, the food was darn good too.

As Crystal and I checked in, we were directed to the bar as the staff gets our table ready. We ordered two glasses of the 2004 K Vintners Viognier to start off the evening. About half way through the glass, we were informed the table is ready and offered a tour of the kitchen before sitting down. The kitchen tour wasn't too interesting, just a standard quick walk-by. The dinner menu was presented to us, one side listing the pre-fixe menu with choices and the other listing the Collection options. Unfortunately the Seafood Collection wasn't available, which was what I wanted to try, but we made do with the Market Collection for the both of us. A different approach to the wine pairing aspect, nothing listed, offered if asked and kind of go on a whim based on the $$ one wants to spend. Not exactly how I would of done if if I owned a restaurant, but that's a different topic. The Market Collection is a nine course menu as listed below, course three through seven were prepared two ways with each of us having a different preparation of the same main ingredient. *** Grand Amuse-Bouche ~Scallop Ceviche, Avocado Puree, Lime Segments ~Tuna, Marinated Trevio, Orange Italian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Chilled Cauliflower Creme, Lemon Confit 2002 Selbach-Oste Zetlinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Kabinett New Zealand Langoustine ~Fresh New Zealand Langoustine, Thai Chili, Lemon Zest, Watercress ~Roasted New Zealand Langoustine, Baby Carrots, Turnips, Fennel, Langoustine Jus 2003 Hirsch Gruner Veltinger Kammener Heiligenstein Duck ~Duck Bouillon, Duck Prosciutto ~Veloute of Duck, Duck Confit NV Rare Wine Company Charleston Sericial Madeira Special Reserve Nova Scotia Halibut ~Nova Scotia Halibut ""a la plancha"", Sea Urchin, Preserved Lemon, Citrus Jus ~Roasted Nova Scotia Halibut, Razor Clams Casino, Bacon, Clam & Spinache Sauce 2003 William Fevre Chablis Montmains Pasta Course ~House-made Farfalle, Chicken Wing Confit, Bayonne Ham & Foie Gras Glaze ~Spaghettini, Carbonara Sauce, Parmesan Reggiano, Raw Amish Egg NV Henri Billiot Rose Brut Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye ~Roasted Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye, Braised Beef Short Rib, Glazed Pearl Onions, Crispy Bacon Lardons ~Grilled Prime Midwestern Beef Rib Eye, Fondant Potatoes, Bearnaise Reduction 2003 Yann Chave Crozes-Hermitage Tete de Cuvee TRU Collection of Cow, Goat and Sheeps' Milk Cheeses Cherry Mint Soup Duet of Desserts 1999 Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 5 Puttonyos Mignardises and Lollipops *** While the food was good overall and we got to try two different preparations, not one single dish gave me the wow factor. As usual, the final meat course failed me once again, although good to see it was ribeye rather than the standard filet mignon, but that's about the only compliment I can give the course. The wine pairing choices were nice for the price they charged, but the word pairing should be crossed out as none of the wine paired well with the food. Not saying the pairing was awful, but definitely more thoughts could be put into the process. The service was attentive, prompt and precise, but WAY TOO mechanical and stuffy. Small talk with the Sommelier didn't go anywhere, seem disinterested. None of the staff at the restaurant had a smile on them except for one person. Same type of service as French Laundry, but not what I would enojy as a dining experience. TRU is not a place I would return, just from the food standpoint, French Laundry, LaToque and Cyrus all out performs TRU. I can certainly name a few other places of different type of cuisine that out shine TRU as well, not a difficult task. Perhaps I am a bit spoiled and too critical, but a restaurant of this level should still show better.",4/15/2007,TZ3LcffffYUcFyoUJ3ob4Q,geJV8EiTITinkq4aKtTz2g,AkfSndWBxnTn-LpmiL8aLA,N,3,1

We came here for an anniversary dinner (last year was Tru and we decided to go for good food with a more chill atmosphere this year (and a slightly lower price point). The boyfriend and I both loved 6 of 8 courses. The quail starter (amazing), the motoyaki, the pork two ways (I wanted to lick the miso sake broth), and the chocolate hazelnut creme brulee were amazing!!!! Neither of us were fans of the loaded baked potato as it was far to smokey tasting (I was sad about this as the concept is so scrumptious), or the reverse cheese and crackers. I appreciate that with a wheat allergy, I could eat almost everything. The service was slow to start (i.e. no one came up to us for a good 10 mins), but was great by the end of the night. The restaurant could use a sign out front, or at least something to display that it's actually a restaurant. But I do love the simple decor and presentation. If you go to BonSoiree you're there for the food and not for any other distractions. I want to give 5 stars because those 6 of 8 were so good, but the baked potato was difficult to eat because the smoke flavor was so strong, and the initial lack of service was a bit odd.

The place was packed but it was easy to get a drink at the bar as the bartenders were on top of their game and alert. We were behind another group next to the bar and the bartender noticed that we needed drinks.If I can make one recommendation it is to get the mussels! So good! I also ended up getting french onion soup which was to die for and the tilapia sandwich, also good. Overall great time with my friends and the bill was reasonable as well.

There was a bit of a wait, but we just made ourselves comfortable outside and after about 15 minutes, the hostess came and got us and brought us to our table.

Having never been to Costa Rica I had no idea what to expect so we deferred to our server who was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Each of us ordered one of the more traditional Costa Rican meals and were more than satisfied with the quality, quantity, and flavor! I became lost in finding all the best parts of my meal, and before I knew it, it was gone!

Oh, how I wish that I could review restaurants in Nepal on yelp...). My funghi pizza was so soggy that I didn't want to finish my pizza. And that's just unheard of. The service wasn't so great either. Yes, they were nice enough to seat us before our party was complete (granted, the restaurant was empty at 5pm) but our server didn't know his pizzas very well.

So many choices up on the wall, but what you should really aim for is getting The Dog, which is just Chicago style and that foie gras dog. The fries in duck fat were only available on Friday and Saturday, so my Thursday visit was less eventful. Although those two dogs were the best I have ever had in my life. Chicago doesn't mess around when it comes to hot dogs. Also, I'm sure this place has had a lot of people come ever since it was featured on TV ... but it still feels like a regular corner joint. The guy at the front was really calm and nice and didn't seem to look down on the two fatties before him who ordered more than two hot dogs (yes, it was us). Hot dogs came up quick and tasted good.

60178,"This was my first time trying this restaurant since I had heard good things. When I explored the online ordering, I was impressed with the ease of ordering and what appeared to be an accurate representation of when the food would be ready (over an hour since we ordered chicken). I think the food was ready much earlier than the time on the website since it was barely warm when we picked it up 10 minutes BEFORE the time noted. Also, they forgot the drink that was included with one item so I had to remind them. The worst part was that when we got home I noticed we didn't get the all white meat on the quarter chicken (and paid an extra $1 for) and they didn't include the extra side of corn that we paid for. When I called in to complain the first response was ""whoever took the order didn't make that note so you weren't charged."" Of course, I had to explain that I had submitted the order online and the confirmation and bill included those items. The response back was an offer to credit free corn the next time I ordered from them and when I pushed for an adjustment on the credit card charge, I was told they didn't know how to do that and would ""leave a note for the owner.""To be fair, the next the owners contacted me and apologized with a full credit and encouraged me to return and a big reason why I will definitely give them another chance.

2237,"Four and a half stars is spot on. Okay. Yes. the commute is a b*tch and a half... but it's worth it. One might argue that there isn't much you can do with a hot dog to make it ""great,"" and one might be right. You can grill it or you can boil it, and when all is said and done, there just isn't as much room for culinary creativity as say, a rack of lamb. Like the Shake Shack phenomenon in Manhattan, you go to Hot Dougs for the experience. Part of that experience, to the dismay of some who just want to fill their bellies with meat and relish, involves waiting in line. You have to go to Hot Dougs with an open mind (and an empty stomach). I won't deny it, the hot dogs themselves are delicious, as tasty and satisfying as any hot dog I've ever had, but a they are still just wieners on buns, good for 3, maybe 4 bites. The wait in line with other tourists and eager first-timers, the descriptions on the wall menus, and the excitement of finally seeing Doug's smiling face waiting for you at the counter, are what make this a great place to check out at least once. We showed up at 930am (the place opens at 1030) on a sunny, chilly, Saturday morning to find a dozen people already patiently standing outside. By 1030, when the doors opened, the line went back about three blocks. Compared to Shake Shack this is not a long line, but the difference is Doug himself takes your order, and also some spends some time chatting with each customer (and posing for pictures in our case), so the line doesn't move nearly as fast. No problem, you can take this time to read the descriptions of the various hot dogs for sale, as well as a menu of Daily Specials. I went with the Kiera Knightley and the standard hot dog, grilled and boiled, respectively. My girlfriend opted for the standard hot dog, with everything, and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli (I still have no idea what Aioli is), Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. We also got orders of the Duck Fat Fries (which tasted exactly like regular fries). My standard hot dog was very good, well cooked, juicy, and pretty filling. I don't really know how else to describe a hot dog... the Kiera Knightley had a spicy tinge to it, but nothing mouth numbing (I guess she isn't as hot as she used to be). If I'm ever here again I'll try the extra hot ""Selma Hayek"" (too bad they don't offer the Penelope Cruz... cuz DAAAMN). I had a bite of the Foie Gras, which was delicious, but I estimate that one bite was worth roughly $3, which could've gotten me another Kiera/Selma. The staff here is very friendly, and they make sure you don't grab tables until you've gotten your food. The space isn't huge, but you don't feel cramped either, even with a few dozen customers inside and a hundred more out the door.  I'd return here again if I am in Chicago, but only if I have nothing else on my schedule. If you are just craving a Chicago style hot dog, then Portillo's in the city is a much quicker bet. One last bit of advice--find someone to drive you, or call a cab for pick-up 15 to 20 minutes in advance. We ended up walking 20 blocks to the subway stop to get back to downtown, since the area is entire devoid of taxis.",3/31/2010,CfSgl6N,cslP1CmBJRx8SBJWN1vW1w,HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A,N,4,1

58621,"So...My fiance wanted to take me out for desert. Although I'm a native of Chicago, I've never been to this place. He figured the ambiance would be fabulous and have an overall inviting atmosphere. SIKE! Let me tell you the story...We walked in and was quickly seated. The waitress came over and asked had we been there before, and if not would we like her to give a description of the meals etc. My fiance says sure.. So as she begins to tell us what they had to offer, he realized that we wanted to stick with what we originally went there for. He says I think we'll just go with the flaming chocolate fondue. Waitress says, Yes, I figured you all would say that. Eyebrows raised but I said nothing. Then we ordered drinks that we had to remind the waitress to get 10 mins. later. The couple sitting next to us commenced leaving and the waiter took all of the items on that table and placed them on ours, although we were still there EATING! Ugh the nerve. Then another group came in to eat and the waiter walking pass and tried not to bump into them and in doing so his butt swiped our table on the same side as our food! We then began to call making reservations for another place, (Devon Seafood) and asked for the check. She took sooo long to bring it, I had to get up and go looking for her.I will never go there or recommend this place to my friends unless they are of the European descent. When I told a coworker, who was European, he was not surprised and said that's just the type of establishment they are and the area you're in and apologized for what took place.

With a group of 7, we knew it'd be a while wait on a Saturday night with the line curling outside the door. Having not made reservations anywhere, we figured that we may as well just stick it out, especially once they offered that we could sip beer or wine as we waited. The food was well worth the wait. We got the chips and guac and I think I can say that it was the best, most flavorful guacamole I have ever had. And it wasn't even close. The tortas were amazing. Packed with flavor and so satisfying. It was a ton of food and I couldn't finish. We topped it off with the churros and chocolate shot. The food was just fantastic.

I would give the food 3 1/2 stars, but a few other aspects of our visit bring down my rating. The oatmeal-banana shake I had was outstanding. My fiancee had the mango-banana which was tasty, but the texture was a bit grainy. Hers was soy-based, which I noticed cost more. When we ordered it, we were informed that the soy shake was also smaller. Wouldn't you think that the price increase would compensate enough? Pick one or the other, but don't charge me more AND reduce the size. I had the Arroz con Huevos, a mix of rice and scrambled eggs, served with avocado and plaintains. Excellent dish. She had the potato stuffed tacos, which came out much more similar to chimichangas. They were good but not great. In the middle of our meal, it also got very drafty in there. Seems like there might be ventilation issues or something, perhaps someone was opening a door to let fresh air in. Overall, it was a good experience, and the staff were nice enough, but it turned out to be a little pricey for everything we got, imo.

53712,"Today I came in and met Doug, who I presume to be an owner or at least a half-owner. I start my review by saying this because I think it's significant; your first impression of Crisp will be that it's a trendy type of place but is run by a very down-to-earth owner. He will ask you for your name and then for your order.I came in for the chicken wings, which were delicious. They're fried and covered in several sauces. Out of the sauces I had, the Seoul Sassy was tasty and on the milder side, while the Crisp BBQ was a lot spicier and bolder. The latter had much of the same spicy flavor you would find in kimchi (without the fermented taste, of course), but also had a sweet component like a BBQ sauce. I may have liked them a bit spicier, even, to balance out the sweet, but I think fans of BBQ wings will like these a lot. My fries were a little soggy by the time they got to my place, but that's just what happens to fried foods in transit. All in all, really great wings with inventive sauces. You can have a half or whole chicken done this way too.I think what Crisp has done well is pander to the crowd without losing its roots. The food is definitely Am-Asian, but the flavors which are put into their burritos and wings are those which are very reminiscnet of a typical Korean meal (at least from what I've had of that cuisine.) You can even get a bibimbap bowl (there called a 'buddha bowl') with their own twist.The combo of trendy modern with down-to-earth people and of traditional Korean flavors with familiar American cuisine is why this restaurant is such a success. The food is unique and different, yet still comforting.

The bill came and the meal was priced at $29.95. We asked our waitress about the mistake and we were informed that $24.95 is the lowest that the meal ""could cost"" but that due to ""market conditions"", mine was priced higher. I reviewed the menu from front to back and there is absolutely no mention of ""market pricing or that the bill would be subject to inaccuracies and fluctuations at the management's discretion. While I've eaten here before and live a whopping block away, I will not return and I will no longer recommend them.

13221,"I am sad to say that we have left Chicago for Atlanta and that Glenn's Diner will be my most missed restaurant in Chicago. My wife and I visited it twice, both times leaving extremely full and pleasantly happy.  Our first visit was for lunch. I ordered the Catfish Poboy. Great bread, perfect amount of batter and the fish was fresh. My wife ordered the Reuben sandwich and said it was very good. We met the owner and the waiting staff was extremely attentive. Our second and last visit was for dinner and it was, in my opinion, the best seafood that we had in Chicago. I had the Crustacean Pot Pie. It was a pot pie with lumps of Blue Crab, shrimp, scallops and veggies. Trust me when I say, these were huge lumps of everything. You could differentiate between each seafood in the pot pit. I topped the pot pie off with a Dog Fish Head beer. My wife had the scallop dish. There were 12 scallops on her plate. Perfectly pan seared, with carmelization on the outside but could cut through it with a plastic spoon.  Almost forgot, I ordered their clam chowder for an appetizer. I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a little pricey but what do you expect? The food portions were huge, fresh and perfectly cooked. When I visit Chicago, it will be at the top of my list of restaurants to go back to.

The food tasted good 5 years ago but now they must have new cooks or management or something. They've gone from Hero to Zero in the years.

58986,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary with dinner at Sunda and had a wonderful experience. The service and food were exceptional. Sunda has a lot of energy, which only served to heighten our positive experience. Our server was talented in his service, and engaging on a personal level--he made our evening special. We were encouraged by our server to try some items on the menu that were unfamiliar to us, based on his personal experience and recommendation, and we we enjoyed each new item. The server took the time to ask/get to know our preferences, and made recommendations based on our preferences, together with his personal experience. In looking around the restaurant, it was clear to us that the customers were all enjoying themselves and also that Sunda had made sure that they hired the best and brightest for their team. We enjoyed every moment of our evening and can hardly wait to return. It was a wonderful anniversary dinner!",10/23/2011,Src8DAXc8dofZRrQA23r2w,27po_pPV9y3xOTMldVDsDg,8d_DiHWB-pjBVW3a7D8EWg,Y,4,0
47,"I was expecting more. That's basically my summed-up experience. One thing I will say, is that half the fun is the surprise element of the food, so reading all the reviews is not the best idea. I did it- because I wanted to know what that price tag was going towards- but it definitely took away from the experience and if there's one thing I'd recommend is STOP READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD. and STOP LOOKING AT THE PICTURES! STOP! RIGHT NOW!! For that much money, I expect the things I eat to be REALLY DELICIOUS. Not just ""good, and cool presentation!"" but REALLY DELICIOUS. Overall I would say maybe 3 courses I would say that, the rest were... pretty good. Like I said, I expected more. Also, I made the reservation for a special occasion (first wedding anniversary) but nobody asked me if there was an occasion when I made the reservation. Most nice places do- even a Morton's will ask you, and then print ""happy anniversary!"" on your menu. Nothing here. Like I said, I expected more. GT Fish and Oyster wished my husband a happy birthday when we arrived, and when we were seated, and then gave him a birthday gift before we left. THAT is service. Alinea could learn a thing or two. However as far as service goes, I was pretty pleased. I didn't have any of the issues I saw other people comment on. My husband and I don't drink, and nobody pressured us to order something we didn't want. We did several of the house sodas which were tasty. The bottom line is that it really is an event to dine here- my husband liked it way more than I did- partly, I think, because he hadn't read all the info on the courses and was genuinely impressed by what came out. I thought it was all pretty good. A couple of courses (everyone mentions the same ones, for good reason) were amazing, and the rest- pretty good. I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad we tried it once. **Side note: funniest part of the night was when one of our courses that comes... well, sort of balanced on other stuff, slipped off onto the table. The servers all froze, and I swear, the guy who dropped the stuff looked like he was going to go do hara kiri in the kitchen in the back. I think I laughed and said something like ""man overboard!"" because I was trying to ease the tension but I don't think it worked.

28938,"I finally made my way to Frontera Grill one Friday afternoon with two California guests. Since this place doesn't take reservations, I knew it would be key to visit the restaurant on a weekday right when they open. We got there about 11:45 and were able to find seats in the bar. Seating setup is unfriendly for odd-numbered groups (seats were in twos and fours), but the staff let us push two tables together - saving the three of us from huddling around a table meant for two. What dismayed us was the LONG wait we had to endure for our food! I think they were understaffed, because the lunch crowd seemed manageable, yet we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got our appetizers. I split the Entrems Surtido appetizer platter and pork tacos with my friend. I HIGHLY recommend the appetizer platter. It lets you try mini portions of their quesadillas, chicken taquitos, ceviche tostadas and jcama salad. Because I was thinking of ordering each of these items for my entree, the appetizer platter let me try all the dishes and still try something else! My favorite was the jicama salad - it had mangoes and the tangy dressing provided a nice complement to the sweet mangoes and crunchy jicama. Even though we had to wait again for our entrees, it was definitely worth it! The pork was marinated to perfection. Featuring notes of red chile, pineapple, bacon and onion, it was a fiesta in my mouth. Each ingredient balanced the others. Seriously, it was friggin' awesome. I'm not a big meat eater, but I will gladly eat a whole bowl of this stuff everyday if I could. We were also served six tortillas so it's perfect to split. I will be back to Frontera Grill. I have to dock one star for the slow service, but seriously - five star food. Give me pork!!",3/8/2007,CimSR,rlcugsgka2oVUfLt84U7LQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,5,1

Her name is Melissa if I remember correctly and she was the best from start to finish. We explained that we were newbies and she offered to order for us! She asked some questions about our likes and dislikes and did her thing. It was such a fun and interesting experience to have someone do this for us. She hit the nail on the head. She made us feel comfortable and taken care of. I highly recommend giving this place a try.

25372,"Went here for the first time w/ a group for brunch yesterday, it was my first time dining at mercat but it was a pretty enjoyable experience. The ambience of the restaurant is very cute & mod... the food & decor are both very colorful. We had the brunch special where u choose 4 tapas plus one botomless specialty cocktail (bloody mary, mimosas, red/white sangria) for $25. There was a wide variety of choices for the tapas, however the menu was a bit confusing at first because it says ""choose 5 tapas & a signature cocktail, however if you order a cocktail w/ the special then you only get to choose 4 tapas. For the bloody mary they had a bar where u can mix in all the ingredients...the ""yellow gazpacho"" was very tasty. We also ordered the paella negra which was large enough to serve our group of 6. It had lobster, octopus, calamari & shrimp..it was very flavorful and if you've never had paella don't let the black squid ink scare you away because you won't want to miss out on this dish! Also the manchego bacon biscuits are really good too. For the tapas I recommend: the gambas (garlic shrimp), the crab omelette, skirt steak sandwich, shrimp & grits..there's plenty of choices to satisfy your tastebuds.",5/30/2012,1573JU7,FNyAKBdaBRQlSXFcanvvyQ,DXwSYgiXqIVNdO9dazel6w,N,3,1
8243,"I've been by Spacca Napoli several times when the patio and dining room has been packed. I was able to go with a friend yesterday before the dinner rush. It was raining out, so the patio wasn't open. We were seated right in the window. I will say that our server, I can't remember her name was void of personality. Never a smile, just flat affect the whole time. However, the food outweighed all of that. We shared a bottle of wine that was spicy and dry and wonderful. We chose the fried zucchini appetizer that was marinated in white balsamic with mint and basil. It was not the fried zucchini that I was expecting. It was served cold along side fresh french bread drizzled in olive oil. Despite being not at all what I expected, it was a beautiful appetizer. The balsamic wasn't overpowering and you got a mouthful of basil flavor followed by fresh mint. It was fantastic. For our dinner, we shared the Diavola. It was with a red sauce, fresh mozzarella, red pepper flakes and spicy salami. The flavors were amazing. The sauce was slightly chunky, which is my favorite. And the crust was chewy and perfect. I wish the crust had been a bit crispy, but it was still soooooooo good! The prices are affordable here. The ambiance is comforting and welcoming. I plan on coming back. I love a local little pizza joint like this.",6/6/2010,Uw3JD21lv9G736b-RuXhPw,LJThzWBzi78rsU3DkZYIUw,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,N,4,1

England has great Indian food and a great selection of restaurants and India House can hold its ground with those. This place is better than Devon Avenue . I have been here countless times for the lunch buffet. In general I am not a buffet fan but this one is really good. My only complaint is they don't have a curry dish, but I will let that slide. There are a few real stars on the buffet that deserve real attention. The Chicken Tiki Masala is great. So good that we joke that their is crack in it, because we can never get enough.  Then the other real star is the mango ice cream.. I cannot say enough about how tasty that is. The dinner is about just as good as their lunch buffet, but costs three times as much.

A little steep for a Corner Bakery type experience. We got seats at a little bar on high chairs and tucked into the chips and salsa. Ok, nothing special, can get the same at Jewel. The sandwiches were tasty, but not special, about the level of a Corner Bakery club panini :) The churros were super gross, greasy and hard, I totally have no clue why people are raving. It looks like they were under the heat lamp for a long time because the minute they were pulled out from under it and put on a plate in front of me they hardened right up and could have chipped a tooth.

I had one of the specials I had read about on Yelp with asparagus and prosciutto, as well as asparagus and cheese stuffed into the crust. It came out fast, hot, had the perfect amount of crispness to the thin crust, and was quite tasty. My friend ordered another special with truffles and fried egg on top. I was disappointed with this one, the truffles were pretty sparse and the egg was under-fried (the whites were very runny). For dessert I had a delicious (and big!) serving of tartufo.  The space is tiny, so be prepared for a lot of neighbor/waiter contact. While it took a while to get our waiter's attention, once he came over he was very helpful explaining ingredients and flavors, and the food came out lightning fast.

Unlike SOME Yelp reviewers who have been to this location a few times and dis it for being family friendly -- I don't mind that one bit. They give kids crayons and something to keep them distracted and quiet until their food arrives, and they have an extensive kids' menu. This is to the advantage of everyone in the place, with the possible exception of people who don't like kids.  So if you don't care for the family-friendly atmosphere, don't like kids and continue to go to this Wishbone location, leave it to a dummy to get on the roller coaster knowing it'll make them throw up and all the while expecting a good time.

My friend and I also shared a basket of chips and guacamole which was great...but my only complaint is I wish the guac portion was a little bit bigger. The chip to guac ratio was like 10:1. It was actually smart for me to order the soup for dinner because they're not available until after 3pm, so after I had been bragging about this soup to my husband, we decided to go there for lunch today. Since we were early it was only a 10 minute wait, but because it was before noon, soup was not ready. Luckily XOCO's menu is set to please everyone. I ended up finally trying a grilled Milanese torta which was breaded crispy chicken, pickled jalepeno, black beans and cheese on bread served with a tomatillo salsa. The portion was HUGE, but honestly it was too good to stop eating. My stomach was saying no, but my mind kept saying hell yes. My husband ended up ordering the Carnitas wood fire torta which not only was delicious, but the presentation was gorgeous. Served on a baguette, there were chunks of shredded carnitas, pickled onions and a chile sauce, served dipped into a bowl of salsa. Much like you dunk grilled cheese into a bowl of tomato soup, the sandwich was crispy, but had absorbed the wonderful sauce. It was a mouth full of heaven. We topped off this last visit with one of the many hot chocolate options and let me tell you....this alone could be the reason why I give this place 5 stars. I have grown up with spanish and mexican hot chocolate, but have found it hard to find in places unless I have it shipped. Rick Bayless, culinary god, serves a long list of different hot chocolate options from the Authentic which is ground chocolate and water to the Barcelona which is pure, thick and rich chocolate. My husband ordered the Barcelona and I had the Ultra which is a shot of hot chocolate with almond milk...and both were AMAZING. Honestly, I know that I went 2 days in a row, but if XOCO was open on a Sunday I would round it out by trying breakfast there tomorrow, but unfortunately I'll have to wait until Tuesday. Don't miss out, this place is truly one of the best in town!",9/6/2010,UZvSvfYhOy6s5BgMrbq,i6782bEhN2jmUJNuf4TAMw,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,N,5,1

51270,"So, I gave it a couple more tries just to see if maybe our chef was having a bad day, but the carne asada is always burnt, chorizo always much saltier than it should be. I actually took my sister here because I wanted to know if I was just being biased based on my first couple bad experiences, but... She actually got sick off her food. She prefers her tacos with just onions and cilantro, and lime... Which she had to ask multiple times for. It's hard to mess that up. so confirmed, they're NOT the best tacos in the city. I did order breakfast once, and the huevos divorciados was actually ok. But I wish I knew it was that large because i wasn't in the mood for such a large breakfast.

The food was very good and the cost was very reasonable. We had the Tiger Cry beef and Steamed Dumplings for starters. Both dishes were fresh and the Crying Tiger had an excellent sauce.  For the main course I had the Peanut Sauce Lover dish with chicken and my wife had the Lard Nar Talay. The Peanut Sauce dish was quite good, I asked for spicy and it was spicy without being overbearing. My wife thought the Lard Nar was okay. It is BYOB so we brought a bottle of white wine.

58947,"A friend recommended Sunda to my girlfriend and me a few weeks ago, and, given that we hadn't had a fancy dinner in a while, we decided to go.My first impression of the place was that both the dining room and bar were very well done. It is certainly a modern, stylish place, but not to the extent that it feels cold or unromantic at all. Additionally, the service staff at the front of the restaurant was incredibly welcoming.Unable to pick just a few items from the menu, we wound up getting cocktails, three appetizers, two main courses, and a dessert between the two of us. The cocktails were solid, but the food was delicious. In particular, the duck/daikon/egg salad appetizer was incredible. It had very strong Asian flavors, but it was not overdone at all. The duck (and there was an incredible amount of it for the price) was ridiculously soft, and the daikon was prepared to perfection. The chef's signature sushi (I forget what exactly he calls it) was the perfect mixture of textures and temperatures. The only small dish I would not wholeheartedly recommend were the oxtail pot stickers, which seemed slightly underflavored. Perhaps if I hadn't had the incredibly rich duck first, however, this wouldn't have been an issue.Among the main courses, the sea bass was truly sublime. My West Coast friends always complain that it's hard to get good fish in Chicago, but Sunda has certainly proven them wrong. The beef ribs were good too, though, for the price, not exactly anything to write home about. For dessert, we got the ""Ridiculous,"" which is essentially tempura-ed ice cream. It was definitely tasty, though perhaps more of a novelty than anything else.All in all, it was a great experience. In addition to the great atmosphere and food, we had an incredibly helpful waitress who put up with our flip flopping ordering tendencies way more than she should have had to. I would definitely recommend Sunda for a date or for a classy night out with a group of friends.",4/4/2010,nC4v7QDpFJPSr-cwq82HJg,aV67bLcoQe5TLWopGo6UpA,8d_DiHWB-pjBVW3a7D8EWg,Y,4,0
7655,"Just had a great 'first time' at Sapori. The restaurant was really nice and really crowded. The four of us got there about 30 minutes prior to our reservation but the host Recardo was able to find us a table right away. We started with the Cozze Scoppiate in the red sauce, it was very good, even my wife who doesn't eat mussels loved it. The sauce was perfect for dunking bread. Then we split a couple salads, the Insalata Stella and the Cesare. My mom kept commenting on how fresh all the ingredients were in the Stella and the Caesar was one of the best I've had. The dressing was nice and light, not heavy like some Caesars, the parmesan had a great flavor too. My dad and I both had the Zuppa di Pesce. It was huge, and had a ton of fish. The homemade linguini was excellent. Well worth the very modest $30, we've paid a lot more for a lot less at other restaurants. The girls split the Vitello Paesana and left nothing on the plate. The Executive Chef Anthony came out and introduced himself and we talked for a bit. He was very nice and shared a few stories with us. We then ordered a couple desserts, Tiramisu and Bread Pudding. We were so full by that time that we could barely eat anymore but we got about half of it down. Also, very good. We'll definitely be back there.",12/5/2011,T0GK9NBW6nqJ2u8h1v9KUA,xtPXUkIZ_PCFQ3sqVugABw,LYppbvgJlBG0SqjSKFiFGg,N,5,1

I would have to agree with another reviewer, that it is odd to encourage customers to go home.

11077,"Piece is my boyfriend's FAVORITE, and definitely his go-to pizza. Thanks to him, I've experienced it in many forms - his leftovers, takeout, and dine in. The leftovers were of the cheese-less kind, which I thought was gross. I'm sorry, I just love cheese too much. Pizza without cheese is just soggy bread with random crap on it that falls off when you pick it up. Then we had their standard pizza (sauce, toppings, cheese) for takeout. Once again, I was somewhat unimpressed, when comparing it with the multitude of standard pizza's I've consumed. BUT THEN, we dined in. The wait was forever long, but worth it. We had the white pizza. Not gross white pizza with alfredo sauce or ranch or something, but just the most garlicky, cheesy masterpiece, made with olive oil in place of sauce. Now, I should mention I was a bit tipsy from the 9% alcohol beer I had while waiting for my table, but I'm pretty certain that pizza was a slice of heaven.

47261,"The burgers here give Kuma's a serious run for their money. I came here, was seated right away, and the next thing I know there was a delicious juicy burger I had just ordered in front of me. I ordered the Lockdown Warden, a certified Angus beef patty infused with bacon, leeks, garlic, shallots, stuffed with Merkt's Cheddar, then topped with fried leeks & shallots tossed in TRUFFLE OIL. Any burger with Merkt's Cheddar is a winner in my book. Pretzel rolls come standard. I substituted the fries for a side of mac'n cheese. I told the waitress I wanted bacon and green onions on my m&c....she told me that was standard unless otherwise ordered. I was even provided with Sriracha to drizzle on my m&c. Goddamn it was good....all of it....every morsel. You can customize your m&c order with tons of options to choose from...I even saw foie gras on the menu as a topping option. Also worth trying here is the ""Prison Yard""...one pound of mussels braised in coconut curry sauce. It came with some nice garlic bread wedges, which was perfect for dipping in the curry sauce. The curry sauce was delicious. I have returned here for the mussels alone. They had several different craft brews to choose from. Hell yes. On a couple of my visits they had Left Hand Brewing Co's MILK STOUT on tap. Probably one of my favorite stout beers in the history of mankind. The ambiance: Metal.

31971,"Full of flavors, and many of them. I've had vegetarian messob and meat and vegetarian messob on my visits. Every item has an individual flavor. Almost all of them are excellent, and none are bad. I love the soft, sour injeera. A messob for two gives each person a huge portion of food. It's rich and a little oily in a way where you can tell you're getting plenty of calories, but the taste is worth it. What we had last week: doro wot - chicken drumsticks in sauce with crumbly cheese and hardboiled egg: This was one of my favorites. It was tender, with a unique herbal flavor, almost minty. ye-beg alicha - lamb in a mild thick sauce: One of my friend's favorites. I think I would like it but I haven't completely warmed up to the gamey flavor of lamb yet. If you like lamb, you'll like it. michetabish - sauce of cardamom beef: If I'm remembering correctly this was another favorite, with lots of flavor. ye-misir wot - red lentil stew: good, spicy kik alicha - split yellow peas: our least favorite, kind of boring shiro - mixed legumes: good. It's possible I'm confusing the michetabish for this, in which case this was one of my favorites. The messob prices seemed reasonable. However this is the only Ethiopian food I've had; my friend informs me that it's usually very inexpensive for good quality Ethiopian food, and that Demera is too expensive.

22681,"My second visit to Greektown in Chicago. Excellent food. Started off with the melitzanosalata, which was eggplant blended with garlic, olive oil, and other spices. Put it on their house bread, it was excellent. I even had a spoonful or two without the bread. For my dinner, I ordered half Vegetarian Moussaka, and half chicken riganati. The moussaka was an eggplant casserole, with potatoes, bechemel sauce, and also olive oil and other herbs and spices. The eggplant was roasted, and it was AMAZING! It complemented the chicken, which was baked with olive oil and herbs and spices. very succulent chicken! complemented the moussaka very well. One of the best parts actually was the baked vegetables that came with the meal. green beans, zucchini, onion and other veggies were drizzled in a tomato sauce. This was a top tier dining experience as well. everytime my water was not filled to the top, the busboy was there to give me a refill. same with my brothers coffee and my mothers wine and soda. I would recommend this place to anyone! they even have valet parking, so that is another plus. Probably one of the best meals I've had in the past 12 months.

20692,"I have to write the review - there seems to be some serious confusion on these reviews about the vegetarian sandwiches. Just because there's no meat on the mushroom sandwich (and soup) doesn't mean it's vegetarian! It's not. The beans at Xoco are cooked in pork. That said, the person at the counter was super accomodating, adding extra avocado instead of the beans for the sandwich. It is simply not possible to get the soup made without the beans. Therefore, the soup is not vegetarian. The sandwich was amazing. Simply wonderful. But I have to take a star off for not having a dedicated vegetarian sandwich, and for misleading all the eaters and reviewers on yelp who are calling the mushroom options at xoco vegetarian.",8/12/2010,g7yz0YQWVoQ8NO4EBDiScQ,5E1IQ6rqYOeyMpEFPuqjtQ,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,N,5,1

30597,"Mastro's is probably one of the most gluttonous restaurants in Chicago. I can't decide whether their specialty is steak, or whether it's the butter cake. Or both? Jordan D (who unfortunately now lives in DC, maybe a blessing in disguise for my heart and arteries) and I started going here shortly after they opened, and in total, I've probably been here 6-7 times. Off the bat, I was pretty impressed. I actually disagree with anyone who says this place is ""too swanky"" or ""a place to see/be seen."" Mastro's is about the food and service, in my opinion. The steaks are...perfect, in my opinion. I really don't know anything about deciphering between different cuts of beef, or whether the have good wagyu/kobe (often overpriced and I am not sure I'd enjoy it)...I just know that I really enjoyed my petite filet there. It just tasted damned good. My most favorite part meal, though, hands down, was the butter cake. Fucking...just...the definition of gluttony in the best way possible. Sweet and also savoury and almost overwhelming, but not quite. This thing is pure amazing. It's basically sponge cake that has some cream cheese in the batter, and it's been soaked in butter twice throughout the baking. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, and some fruit on the plate too, just to make you feel like you're still being reasonable in some fashion.  Basically, I would go here for coffee and butter cake and drinks afterwords---but that's by no means intended to mitigate the awesomeness of their steak. I also like their ""philosophy on plates"" as I'd call it. The steaks do come out on plates that are 440 degrees, so the steak continues to cook for a minute after they put it in front of you. On the converse, the salads come out on plates that are like 32 degrees. I like that. That's awesome. Steaks should be hot, salads should be cold. That's compartmentalizing and delivering dishes how they are to be delivered if I've ever heard of it. The atmosphere is dark and sexy but not over the top. It's an oasis in the middle of downtown chicago. It's well kept. It's not classy because of artwork or expensive light fixtures or a vintage piano or some celebrity/business figure frequents it...in fact...it has NONE of that. It's classy because it's clean, it's dark, and inside it's rather subdued. The service is just stellar. They explain the menu, they make recommendations, they answer questions, they make you feel acquainted. Never rushed, always willing to chat, they will surely find something in common to chat with you about. If you like the pretzel bread as much as I did, and ask nicely, they might even let you take a half a dozen of them home for no charge... I will say that most people were fairly dressed up the times I've gone here. At the very least, slacks and a shirt for a gentleman, and a dress for a lady. If you want to fit in that is. I still go in jeans and a button up shirt with rolled up sleeves. At the end of the day, Mastro's is probably the best candidate if you have a meat craving and you want to go to a steakhouse in the traditional sense of the word. That is what this place is good for. I feel like the gentleman with the cocktail that is part of their....logo?...accurately represents this place, too. Hard to beat, easy to enjoy, and subdued classiness with obvious gluttony is a nice combination.",8/13/2012,1U4n78V1SYkW0v3MO6ApiQ,KMKokAO3wQQxQq4qE0Kerg,Pcg4FtfbvSMMwrYuE1yVjQ,N,3,1

The Fat Elvis (with PB and Banana) was strangely good, I can't remember the second one, and the Punk Bitch (Gruyere & Prosciutto) was my favorite.

8569,"I was really tempted to return to Spacca Napoli tonight, even though I just ate dinner their last night; it's that good. But let's get the ""why this isn't a five-star review"" tidbits out of the way first, though, shall we? It's always much better to end with a bang. First of all, climate control, or lack there of. I know that it was really friggin' cold last night, especially for the end of May, but the restaurant had this arctic draft blowing across it, except for two brief moments when the brick oven's 900 degree heat wave became way too apparent, and the air smelled burnt. Hours later, when I was still relishing the prosciutto, the tiramisu, the crust, my core body temperature was still below normal. Secondly, the waitstaff was brusque; our server did not smile once. I guess I expect at least a little warmth from Italian restaurants. But, ah, there is so much to love about this place, even if my druthers require a sweater and a smile! Walking into the space is like walking into Naples. I have never even been to Italy, much less Naples, but Spacca Napoli has a downright foreign feeling to it. I have never gotten the ""we're not in the U.S. anymore"" vibe from non-Devon Avenue restaurant before. With a great deal of the menu in Italian , red wine served in juice-like glasses, and four Italian bieres and espresso only, this place smacks of Euro-authenticity. The ""Vero Pizza"" banner sealed the deal. Apparently, this is the only restaurant in the United States to belong to this exclusive Italian restaurant association, in addition to winning the ""True Pizza"" award at a competition which is held each year in May. And perhaps our server's cool attitude was really one of genuine jejune. After all, who among us has had an enthusiastic server over on the Continent? Pas moi! The service was precise and punctual, which is what really matters anyway. We began our meal with the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto platter. When the astronomer Galileo sent his daughter, who was living in a convent, mozzarella cheese, he called it a ""buffalo's egg."" The mozzarella that arrived on our platter was accurately the size of an egg, if buffaloes actually laid them! It was artfully cut into so that a slice of prosciutto bloomed from its center. Two large slices of prosciutto framed the ball of mozzarella, and the whole arrangement was drizzled with olive oil and garnished with pungent basil leaves. It was accompanied by five thin slices of baguette, also drizzled with olive oil. The cheese was so creamy and fresh, the prosciutto was perfectly salty and smoky...it was heavenly. Next came our pizza. Spacca Napoli offers about 12 pizzas and 3 special pizzas, all with simple, variation on a theme-type toppings. For the neophytes: 'bianca' pizza does not have any tomatoes. The pizzas that include tomatoes still do not have a true sauce, more like juicy pockets of tomato goodness. My boyfriend and I decided upon the Funghi e Salsicca, mushroom and sausage. I'm guessing that 'fior di latte mozzarella is not made from water buffalo milk, but it was still delicious. While the toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was the real showstopper. ""The charred bits taste like those I would expect from a steak,"" my boyfriend declared. Next came our dessert, a creamy, appropriately rich, marsala-wined moistened but not too sweet tiramisu. Mmm! Washed down with thimbles full of sharp espresso, and the evening was a success. A bitterly cold one, but still a success. I mean, where in this city can two enjoy wine, antipasti, pizza, dessert, and espresso for $50? As the Carter Family sang, ""Keep on the Sunny Side, always on the Sunny Side."" When I can enjoy my meal in the warmth of the summer night in their outdoor seating, I will certainly return.",5/25/2008,ffW8aiSkvUKcWoyaZU8r9Q,mjiR9DJ6lKdIvv_C31cylw,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,N,4,1

For me, anytime you can say that the last bite you have of a meal is the best, well, you have yourself a good meal. It says something of a place when each bite gets better and better. Eat your meat loaded pizzas with a knife and fork, then save the crust and a tiny bit of sauce that escapes from your pie for dipping. The crust is the...freaking...best. The restaurant has been using the same deep dish pans since the dawn of man and all of those little garlic, cheese, oil and meat juices from the pans are seared right into the crust for the climax.

61413,"I'd been wanting to try the original Urban Vegan on Montrose, but hadn't gotten around to it. When I heard they opened up a new spot a bit closer to me, I got excited (good Thai food is seriously lacking in Logan Square/Bucktown) and took the opportunity to get some take-out. This first time I was boring, but just wanted a simple pad thai with soy chicken. After years of only ever ordering Thai food with tofu (and worrying that they wouldn't keep the fish/oyster sauce out), this was a nice change. I got the lunch combo, which came with a little salad (w/ a delicious dressing) and the best egg rolls (eggless, of course) that I have ever had. Warning, they are thinner than your typical egg roll, but well worth it. Next time I'll try something more interesting, like one of the mock-fish dishes (the sweet chili fish sounds too good). But I was overall very happy with my experience (the employees were friendly too).",9/2/2011,InWZPBG72GkTXlffEIRM6A,JxRoSYDX_18vTEPnyLaupw,mCHto10PBQOKnefm7gholg,Y,4,0

And it's not even real crust, it's like a loaf of bread that's been rolled into a circle and happens to have some toppings on it. If you're the sort of pizza eater who loves eating breadsticks and ripping off the back ""wall"" of pizza crust so you can dip it in marinara sauce or garlic butter, then you probably enjoy Giordano's a lot.

53890,"A month or so back, I went to the Purple Pig with a group of six of my closest friends from high school to have our yearly reunion. After 8 years of having these reunion dinners, we have finally found a home. Instantly, the atmosphere, ambiance, music, and full house (on a MONDAY!) struck a chord with us that we had chosen the perfect restaurant. Instantly, we could feel that we were going to have a great time. Not being big wine connoisseurs, the extensive wine list could have been a little intimidating; however, it was quite easy to follow. I was personally happy to find a wine from my grandparents' small hometown in Italy, for a very reasonable price. Even better, the bottle was great and we all ended up sharing many bottles over the course of the night. As for the food, all I can say is that it was unreal. Being in a decent sized group, we all chose something that we wanted to try and passed the plates around to share. We were able to enjoy a large chunk of the menu from the Salt-Roasted Beets, Corn and Tomato in an Arugula Pesto for starters; to the in house cured meats; followed by a lengthy stop in the Smears section which included the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio, Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese (table favorite), Whipped Feta with Cucumbers, and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs; over to the Fried Items where we had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and Prosciutto Balls; and ending with Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (table favorite) and Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki for our entrees. As you can see, we thoroughly enjoyed the food and just kept eating and eating. We ended the night with some grappa. Once more, this was personally appeasing to me since I have not had the chance to enjoy some since my grandfather passed, along with his homemade wines and grappa. The night was perfect; we had the perfect setting in that the place was lively, and us being single guys, was filled with attractive women that the communal seating allowed us to mingle and interact with. I've already been back to the Pig and so have many of my friends. On top of the exceptional food and wine that is readily available, it also provides a multiple array of social settings, be it a place to have a nice romantic date or family dinner, go out with a group of friends and enjoy new foods, or have a small bite to eat and a glass of wine while meeting new people. One last thing is that the service was exceptional. Our waitress was very helpful with any questions we had regarding the wine list and menu. We had to wait a little which was expected with how busy the place was, but we were able to get some wine while we waited for a table. The chef, who is around our age, came over and talked with us for a bite. He was very modest and a nice guy. He went over to other tables as well and I found that to be a nice touch. Having been back there, he and some of the staff have remembered who I am and always find time to say hello.",9/11/2010,uJnr0Qjc-RddoiW1sAI_Zg,ohQgCiFpg8oj01UvkSr8lg,boE4Ahsssqic7o5wQLI04w,Y,5,0

Nothing is worse than sitting down and having someone poor you a burnt, cold or just bad tasting cup of coffee. In fact that usually puts a damper on the rest of the experience, but Yolk's is always yummy and the juices are freshly squeezed. Atmosphere? Yes yes and yes. It's the kind of restaurant that once you sit down you're really in no rush to leave. I would suggest sitting at the bar if you can. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative is the wait. It's going to be busy if you come during a prime breakfast or lunch time and they're only open till 3.

30253,"Typical diner fair, but instead of the food being made with chickens, pigs and cows, it instead comes from helpless soys, seitans and tofurkys. And sometimes actual vegetables. The food is for the most part good, sometimes really good, but is overpriced. I've been here a few times and always like the food, but the prices (and frequently the wait times for a table) are almost always sure to keep me away for the next year or so, sending me to Veggie Bite when I want a vegetarian version of a fast food sandwich. Because this is a vegetarian restaurant, they have real eggs, cheese and other dairy in some of the items, which is awesome. Especially when that cheese is all over fake chorizo nachos. Mmmm....seitanrizo....The sweet potato fries are delicious. I had a spicy cocoa cupcake with cinnamon frosting and a margarita flavored cake with lime frosting - both were delicious and would happify anyone, but I dislike that the cakes were served cold instead of being brought to room temperature first, cause cold frosting sucks. Portions of what I got were tiny, but I saw some massive platters of food going to other people, so I'd have to say that portions are somewhat inconsistent. But veggie or not veggie, diner food is meant to be served in ginormous sizes meant for glutenous overindulgence. But the prices, oy! My veg inclined friends are always telling me how much money I could save by not eating meat - they must not eat here all the time. Vegetarian food - especially sandwiches - should not cost more than meat versions, unless truffles are involved. Good truffles, too. Or maybe unless vegetables from other parts of the world that had to be imported are involved. Maybe. 10 chips, a dollop of salsa and a little glop of guacamole? Like $9 with one refill of chips. They have a children's menu (yea!) but charged me $4 for an tiny apple juice for a 2-year-old (boooo!). Veggie enchiladas for $11? I could see the $5 for the (yummy) sweet potato fries, if only the portion was not like as if it was a part of the kids' menu - you should never be able to count the fries on your plate. I want that number un-fricking-countable. The bill for four people was almost $100 - and two of us only shared veggie nachos, fries and cake... That is not what I'm talking about for diner food - that's my freaking grocery bill. I guess I want more than diner ambiance for those kind of prices. When I go back again, I'm going to be absolutely sure to go before 3:30 pm on a Sunday for brunch - the prices looked to be 25-50% lower than the lunch/dinner menu. And I like their breakfast food better anyway.",7/25/2011,0cRxypE1wjpMlqELDgYACg,PwP8OOd_If9GSHBGRAw-Zg,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,2,1

22904,"Wow, Lao, I like your style! Your food is bangin'. The twenty-minute wait, not so much. I'm not saying a wait is not to be expected at a delicious restaurant, but there is nowhere to sit so you have to stand there smashed up against some other starving waitee and have nothing to do but stare at everyone's food. But, I digress. On to the food. I had been craving hot and sour soup all day, and was delighted when I ordered a cup and it didn't have UFO's (Unidentified Floating Objects) like many a H&S soups I've experienced before. This hot and sour was straight to the point- hot, sour and tofu/mushroom-laden. And vegetarian to boot! Much like the chips and salsa placed on the table at a Mexican restaurant, Lao Sze Chuan's version of this is the spicy cabbage dish served once you've been seated. Slightly vinegar-y, this chili-oil dressed slaw with flecks of chili pepper sucked the sinus issues right out of me! For an appetizer, my roomie and I ordered the green beans in black bean sauce. Chopped green beans with a hint of soy sauce and fermented black beans- absolutely delicious, and not over-powering and filling (ahem...eggroll). My only complaint is the apparent Carpel Tunnel Syndrome I developed from picking up tiny beans one at a time with chopsticks. Oh, I'm just complaining because I didn't want to be the only person using a fork in the entire restaurant. Anyway... For the main event, we decided to get two different entrees and split them after much debate about getting the Hotpot (which we will most certainly explore next time). So, we went with the staple Orange Chicken- crispy and flavorful, and they even asked if we wanted it spicy! Yeah! Also, the Sze Chuan Beef, which was good but the beef was a little soft and strangely textured. The sauce was spicy and flavorful though, and the veggies crunchy and fresh. I think I might just go with vegetarian options next time. To all the vegetarians out there- check this place out. There are TONS of veggie options! Overall...a very satisfying experience. I can't wait to get back there and try some other dishes (all 900 of them).",2/3/2010,BZG5iUsdxOZovbwncLIjuw,X2TrHuQbO-20dHkbIVMhVw,_UJ3KqtHIHjExbAg-iIGUA,N,5,1

Yam gnocchi just oozed goodness, foi gra paired with cherry preserves was like a modern, twisted delicious cherry pie, and the Pillow Talk cocktail was my favorite of all St. Germain drinks thus far. Staff was fantastic and so well-versed with each dish that I felt I was in a Top Chef episode when being explained each one. Luckily, no one got sent home. And if they did can they please come to my home and cook the same meal over again. And of course, the infamous Graham Elliot popcorn that I will never get enough of.

The owner gave us a lecture about how all pizza will have ""some scorch on it."" That's nice, but our entire crust and bottom was BLACK. That's not ""some scorch."" We did get another pizza, but it was only half-baked and extremely soggy. It was also very bland. Wine list is decent, but overall this place is overhyped and overpriced.

54781,My husband saw thier review on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and we went there Wednesday 8/1/12 for dinner. He wanted the Beef Brisket which on the show looked awesum. Your photos on the web site and what we saw on the show are nothing what we were served. The Mussels were average but a nice size serving. The Fries were good. The Brisket was dry and tough I ordered the only Steak on the Menu which was a Ribye and it was severed on a bed of fries. The Ribye was not cooked the way I wanted and was so greasey and fatty I had a hard time cutting it and had to keep wiping my knife and fork with the napkin to get the grease off.

45280,"Went to Anteprima last night with my parents. Made reservations three weeks ago. When we arrived at the restaurant there was only one open table and it was literally in front of the door (It was a balmy 29 degrees last night). Unacceptable. The unapologetic ""host"" told us smugly that ""It's the luck of the draw. Sometimes, we all have to sit there."" That's an exact quote. If we wanted another table, we would need to wait 30 minutes next door at Acre. As we were all the way up in Andersonville, we waited. 45 minutes later, we were fetched from Acre and directed to a lovely table. Our server, was charming. The wine list was great. The food was just ok. Especially for the somewhat spendy prices. We ordered several appetizers. The buffalo mozz with pesto was nice but the portion was dinky. The best part of the grilled polenta were the greens and tomatoes it was resting on. Seafood stew was watery. NY strip was nice -- the wilted arugula was excellent. About 3/4 through our meal, the ""host"" asked the diners at the table next to ours to leave while they were still enjoying their after dinner drinks. Apparently, seating four people waiting for a table is more lucrative than four returning customers. (And the friends, co-workers, and relatives they tell about the experience.) We were shocked -- he didn't even offer to buy them a drink at either the small Anteprima bar or at Acre. Turns out this guy is also the manager. Hosting at a busy restaurant is a tough job and this clown is clearly in over his head. There are so many fantastic restaurants in Andersonville and Chicago there's no need for me to go back to this one.",3/20/2010,MSobXVZnSAiSonGTkdE--w,lgSgMUc7xFVA5NN9AvnbhQ,Btjt4D8dJ-yEdsts3Tj5Hg,N,5,1

First of all, we both despise bars. There is little else that I hate more than having to yell at someone to get them to hear me. My hubs feels the same way. Violet hour is different. In every way. First of all, there isn't a sign saying ""Violet Hour."" to let you know where it is...you just have to know or be told where it is. A guy checks your id and tells you to wait to be seated after going through the 2 HUGE and BEAUTIFUL curtains. Yes, no standing around, no yelling drunk people. It is a nice and classy establishment with beautiful booth-like seats coupled around the room and a bar area. Huge and beautiful curtains deck the walls from a very vaulted ceiling. Beautiful.

49037,"We had only the weekend in Chicago, and after a five-star meal at Frontera Grill the day before, we headed over to the Publican for a Sunday brunch on a Chicagoan-friend's recommendation. Maybe it was because I was still hungover from a wedding the night before, or maybe because eating at Rick Bayless' restaurant made we want to take off my pants the food was so good - whatever the reason, something in me just hated the Publican. We arrived early, reservation at 1:30, hoping to be seated earlier. Instead we were escorted over to the bar area. Fine, no big deal, we'll wait. And wait we did. Waited forever to have someone bring over coffee, then waited that much longer to have that same clueless server bring us some cream and Splenda. Ready for our coffee now? No, not just yet. We then had to endure another wait to have a spoon brought over. And then napkins. Then more wait for some water. It was like the server was in some waiter-12-step program: One. Item. At. A. Time.  While we waited, multiple tables for two were free all over the restaurant. But still we waited. And waited. Sure, the decor was creative and neat-o, but the whole feel of the place began to sour after standing (no chairs in the bar area) for nearly an hour. Our repeated requests to the hostess to be seated at one of the empty tables were in vain. And this hostess was just lost in space. Had that fake Kelly Choi - Top Chef Masters host - all teeth smile. Didn't even apologize for the wait, which would have at least been something. But no, like the majority of the staff, including the kitchen, she just floated around a half-filled restaurant, kind of out of it, not doing a damn thing. It was like the staff at the Publican couldn't be bothered. Or maybe they were all in some cult - all high on shoe polish and ready for their spaceship to land. Though to his credit, I must say our bar-server ended up apologizing for the wait, and bringing us a free piece of coffee-cake, which was tasty, and he didn't charge us for the coffee or the cake. Which was nice, was something.   Finally we were seated by the hostess, who at this point my fiance and I just wanted to throttle. Hostess, eyes half-closed: ""Enjoy your meal."" Us, muttering under our breath: ""Go f*** yourself."" Then more wait. Wait to order, wait for food, wait for check, wait for receipt. Wait wait wait. That was the Publican's theme. And it's not like this place was packed at all. Must have taken us 3+ hours to eat brunch.  Anyway, the food. I couldn't decide on the pork shoulder/bacon/fried egg heart-stopping, comes with a side of Lipitor, sandwich or the wine-poached eggs. The waitress suggested the eggs. Bad choice. They were sour, the prosciutto second rate - all just kind of bland and poorly seasoned. ""How are the flavor combinations?"" the blissed-out waitress asked. The flavor combinations!?!? What the hell are you talking about? The flavor combinations - they suck. Of course, I didn't respond like this - pretty sure I just grunted. My fiance liked her lox bagel, though we had to request the normally standard red onions to give the lox some kick. I thought the lox were way too mealy and salty.  But I probably would have disliked anything the Publican served up at this point. The side of Parmesan hash-browns might as well have been a dense patty of oil, some potato, more oil, and housing foundation. I felt like I had to take a shower after eating them.  The Publican looks great, has a stylish bathroom set-up, but the staff's totally checked-out attitude and the lackluster food just kills the place. The food is by no means terrible for the price, but the restaurant had this atmosphere of arrogance and laziness, which is in no way warranted by the quality of the product. If you're visiting Chicago, head over to Frontera Grill or one of its sister restaurants instead. Even if you have to wait 30 hours to get a table, it's worth it. The Publican is not. So take that Publican.",8/12/2010,0tkcbEdh9S17EvS703RRuA,zZ7Jv1LONquJKkWT4VaSAw,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg,N,4,1

33140,"So, I went here on my birthday yesterday. The first thing that stood out was the fact that the interior was actually larger than I thought it was. I drove by so many times and always thought it was going to be this hole-in-the-wall tiny eatery, when in fact it was quite large with seating for 30+ and very well decorated inside. Once we sat down, however, things got awkward. The wait staff seemed aloof or just a little out of the loop - we definitely got there early, but that doesn't mean we don't expect some level of service. The following conversation with the waitress went as thus: (after the waitress handed out the menus, we were kind of just waiting for a few seconds) Me: ""So ... "" Her: (blank stare) Me: (blank stare right back at ya) Her: ""Oh would you like something to drink?"" I love socially awkward situations as much as the next guy, but usually when they happen to other people. Thankfully, after this little encounter, the rest of the night was okay. I do think they were a little understaffed or that the place needed to train their waitstaff a bit better, but overall the service was good. The owner was very hands on, which I'm a fan of, and I think he could get away with it since it was a smaller operation.

Pretty hard core, I know! :) Well the best way to describe Spacca's way of pizza is exactly how I remember it in Italy a few years back. To the T in the word italy...haha. Anyways had the funghi. Mighty delic (Pronounced Delish!) Anyways pizza came out in literally under 10 min. And thats normal for this place so dont be alarmed....Fresh ingredients, good overally taste, service was exceptionaly great. Then for desert had the special crepe nutella.

59998,"although i have been a faithful follower of las tablas since it opened, my recent experience there left me wondering what are they thinking!!!!! the food was fair at most and the portions were literally half of what they use to be despite no reduction in price. a meal $38 for 2 left both persons hungry and in spite of our complaints, we were told this was purposeful. the waitress tried her best but no one else was available to even listen.

36525,"This place was recommended to me by a friend, and boy am I glad I decided to check it out. If you're looking for a reasonably-priced breakfast/brunch place with an extensive menu of both sweet and savory offerings, this is the place to go. I shared the Stuffed Strawberry french toast and Mediterranean frittata, which left me stuffed, but very satisfied (portions are big -- two dishes among three people is probably ideal). The french toast was more like a dessert than an actual meal, but I was able to balance its sweetness with the saltiness of the frittata by alternating between the two throughout the meal. Though both were delicious, my sweet-tooth favored the french toast, and I'm sure that is the dish that's going to keep me coming back for more. i was a bit too caught up in stuffing my face to really take note, but aside from the high quality food, the restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean, with a friendly wait staff. At about $10 per plate and a wide array of breakfast options, this is a place I know I'm going to be visiting whenever I'm in Chicago. I'm tempted to give it a 5/5, but since I've only eaten there once, the extra star will have to wait.",9/22/2008,NkbHmoWGXKY7RoFvBxYQ5A,X_ixlDh3SugE9Ura3QCxVw,qkfBgSCbekH3DHTanVL1_w,N,2,1

I had an Chicken dinner which was served with spicy rice and salad with humus and pita bread. The rice was dry, cold had uncooked lentils the salad had too much tahani sauce and had no taste. The chicken was again cold and little flavor with humus being the worst i never had eaten humus so bad. How ever there are a few good things about this restaurant the food quantity is huge for the price i guess so many good reviews are due to this fact alone, it was a BYOB with out a corkage fee again a good one.

40216,"I had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place from the instant we sat down......and by ""instant"" I mean the 90 mins we waited on a Wednesday night. Upon sitting, an old, fussy couple next to us inquired pompously to their waitress about the difference between ""sustainable and organic lettuce."" The waitress, albeit with a sort of charming naivete, spent 5 minutiae-laden minutes to explain the difference. After this, I had such an urge to ask if they could make me a garbage salad, but relented, figuring that such a joint already had enough irony. For drinks, my wife's cocktail was decent, but nothing deserving of the mixological hype that this place exudes.....though I do believe I detected a hint of pureed trout anus. When time came to order food, we decided on a couple small plates due to cost of the entrees.....now i understand esoteric descriptions are to upscale restaurants like cop glasses are to the fashion-conscious, cliche' yet irresistible, but these were mostly just frustrating. I would suggest an asterisk or parenthetical translation for us culinary rubes. The tete du cochon was overly greasy with a texture reminiscent of canned deviled ham. In retrospect, I should have had more whiskey.

My review was not a personal malicious attack on the owners but an honest review and MY HONEST OPINION of what I thought of their food. They apparently did not like what I had to say and had my review removed. What kind of people do this when I am giving my opinion. This place is awful and obviously not honest when they only want you to see the 4 and 5 stars but can not take constructive criticism. Food is flavorless. Tamales are nothing but mush no filling just one extra dry morsel of pork. The Cuban Sandwich, the Pork was dry and flavorless. Plantains were not ripened the day we went, I have had them there before and they were OK, white rice and black beans a Cuban staple, no salt no sofrito and they tasted as thought they were from a can, awful. Casa Central has better, authentic Caribbean food, everything is good there and for a better Cuban Sandwich head on out down the street to The Orbit Room, they have a great El Cubano Sandwich and MUCH MUCH BETTER white rice and black beans and they're not even Cuban. I don't know what everyones talking about... this place is awful.I seriously want to like this place because I love Cuban Food.... but I can't, it's a disappointment; and NOW that they had my original review removed because I gave them 1star well that's just plain shady.

60436,"I've eaten there now 3 times, most recently last night. As always, the food there is exceptional and the wait staff is attentive, skilled and very friendly. I really only have 2 issues with this place.  First of all the noise level. I had been there on weeknights before and it was OK, but last night (Saturday) was an anniversary dinner and the place was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard - not very romantic...The other real improvement needed is some work on the wine list. The wines are all Italian...which I get being an Italian restaurant...but they're also very poor value for the money. I had a $34 bottle of white wine that wouldn't stand up to a $9 bottle of California, Chilean, or Australian wine. So, my recommendation is to go and eat there, but go mid-week, when the noise level is lower, parking is easier (on the street), and bring your own wine - it's still cheaper even with a corkage fee.",1/3/2010,fsbO5SAodl_OgtslhYkwFg,yMbrbvKIm2K0sluekjfWSA,Btjt4D8dJ-yEdsts3Tj5Hg,Y,5,0

The beer list is insanely great. This can not be disputed. The food used to be better, though they still have the best moules frites in the city. The sandwiches and brisket that really used to blow my skirt up have just gotten a little TOO greasy, a tad TOO salty. One used to leave Hopleaf after a long boozy night smelling like tons of cigarettes; now one leaves smelling like fryer grease. It's just too crowded and too small of a space to be making that much food. Grease central. I will still go on a weeknight for the perfect beers. Yes, the bartenders are arrogant dicks. But I live too far from the Map Room to frequent it, so what's a girl to do?

56154,"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But on a Saturday afternoon the story changed. The young waitstaff was new and more interested in chatting with each other than customer service. I ordered the Moroccan crepe rather than my favorite, the Icosium, and despite the menu description, it was spicy hot. My friends confirmed this by tasting it. My server assured me she had no idea why it would be hot, and offered to have it remade. The second crepe tasted exactly like the first.  I basically did not eat it, and brought it home, to my gastro distress. As we were leaving we heard the table behind us also complaining that a crepe was very hot even though no hot spices were in the description. The waiter denied it was spicy and the customer kept it.  I hope this was an anomaly, as I really loved the atmosphere and the food here. Now I would hesitate to go back. (My first review was 5 stars).Also, the soup was very salty.

51384,"Sit down at any table in this popular Lincoln Square restaurant and they'll give you some very fresh, very good home made salsa with traditional corn chips. For you spicy food people they have a green version that packs some kick. Or at least that's what I'm told. I'm an absolute wimp. It's great and they are more than happy to refill your salsa, and or chips during your entire stay. I'm sold already and I haven't even ordered. Garcia's offers a host of traditional Mexican cuisine along with some non traditional for you ""gringos"". My particular favorite is their Burritos which are as large and lovely as they come. Skirt steak, chicken, and even veggie, these things come loaded and fresh. I can only finish their burritos when I'm hammered and, because Garcia's keeps late weekend hours I've finished many a burrito. And enjoyed them. Garcia's Burritos are what I believe the people behind the chain ""Chipotle"" had in mind. Outside of Burritos Garcia's offers many reasonably priced Mexican fare. You can easily eat and eat well for under $10. Con's: The restaurant is on the small side so depending on when you go you might have to wait. I've only had to do that once in my many times having gone there though. The bathrooms are on the gross side and they serve pop/soda drinks in stryofoam which is sort of tacky but on the other hand these styrofoam cups are enormous so you are actually making out volume wise. None of the food is gourmet quality. Over all Garcia's is great. It's a staple in the Lincoln Square scene.

4276,"Everything that's great about this place has already been said.  But as a long-time, sometimes solitary, all-girl patron, let me give you a few tips: 1. Don't walk home from here late at night by yourself, no matter how street savvy you think you are, or how tightly you hold your handbag. I can't tell you how many nice conversations I've had with rock dealers after a show. I used to talk to anyone because I was a 22 year old IDIOT. I'm lucky that naivety didn't land me in the gutter. (Those guys always tried to cut me a good deal, though, I gotta say.) 2. This is not a place to come get wasted, unless you do it quietly and to better enjoy the music. 3. It's worth it to take an evening nap and stick around for the post-midnight shows. 4. Please take a Tuesday night and listen to the Deep Blue Organ Trio. You won't be able to fully appreciate Prince until you hear that amazing cover of ""Raspberry Beret."" Truly, truly makes me happy. 5. If you bring a date and get a booth for the evening, you are guaranteed to fall in love. And, OK, if that doesn't work, get a vodka gimlet. I swear, the way they make them here, that's a love affair in and of itself.",4/3/2009,6XCK0ZE,Y84sOsSSpAg766lq4RUDlg,t3pYu8eidmb2ZmexHRHT_Q,N,5,1
8044,"Great Pizza! Great Place with outdoor seating and extremely fresh ingredients. A slice of Italy on the Sunnyside of the street. Update: 4-28-2008 Now down to 2 stars! Maybe I was just in a bad mood, maybe it was an off day, or maybe this place should be called Prima Donna Pizza. How freaking full of yourself do you have to be to think cutting a pizza for your customers is just too much and ""could lower the quality of the pizzas"" Recently My extra special lady friend and 2 friends sat down to have some pizza at what i thought was a good Ravenswood spot. Yeah the pizza is still pretty good (I have had way better since my original 4 star review of this place) but the service was HORRIBLE! Okay so there we are 4 of us sitting at a small wobbly table with 20 plates, three pizzas, 10 glasses, 4 bottles, 6 forks, 6 knives, 2 pizza slicers, and various knickknacks and condiments. HOW IN THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SLICE THESE PIZZAS! When we asked them to please slice them for us at the time of ordering we were told by our server I can bring you slicers but they wont do it for you and that they yell at her if she asks. WTF. So the Pizzas come and the guy who brings them to our table asks can i get you anything, do you need anything? I say yes, could you please slice these up for us? He looked at me like i had just cock punched him and walked away.  Soon our server came back by and ask if we needed anything and was everything okay? I asked, could we please get our pizzas sliced we have no room on this wobbly table and it's just going to be a mess, could you please have the pizzas sliced for us. She went into a ER like state looking for O negative but instead of O negative she was frantic for a slicer. within a minute or two arrived at our now fully stocked wobbly table. Here, she said you can use these and slice them. By this time my Extra special Lady friend and our 2 friend were trying their best to manage the montage of dishes in a mass organizational effort to slice a pizza. I on the other hand was just too pissed off at the utter bullshit i was sitting in front of to eat. WTF.  So, now the owner comes by all sweaty and hairy in his dough and flour stained shirt that he's probably been wearing for days by the looks of it. With his hands clasped together in the prayer gesture of please forgive us he began spouting off bullshit about how they don't cut their pizzas when they come out of the over cause it would take up too much time and lower the quality. I sat an listened as he went on calmly waiting for my polite moment to air my grievance. When that time came some 2 minutes later he interrupted me refusing to let me speak to the point of raising his voice saying sorry we don't slice the pizzas and just walked off. What a harry fat asshole. So, if you like so so pizza that you must cut yourself while managing table space, and eating while frustrated-- this is the place for you.",7/1/2006,IBOZNcKG4FEF,rzF0Bq4F736sHlMKrEy21A,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,N,2,1
30894,"Went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers and came away just a bit unimpressed, but far from hating it. It's a well-decorated, tasteful and relaxing space, but that is the best of it. I found the food to be a bit lacking- although it was not bad it was consistently bland and unremarkable. The service was average for the price point.  The menu sounds intriguiing in print, but the food just didn't quite live up to the expectations established by the menu. For example the chicken and pork adobo was rather dry, and worse, it had no heat to it whatsoever. A dish with chilies as a featured ingredient should have a little more heat to it. Similarly, several rolls that included spicy ingredients also had little to no heat and came off as bland and lacking any character. This included a couple of table-shared specialty rolls that seemed a touch overpriced at 15-16 dollars each for eight small to medium sized pieces. This was followed by the set lunch for $18 that included a salad or soup, an entree and 3 pieces of spicy tuna or California roll. The fish in the rolls did seem quite fresh, and the salad, while simple, was nicely done.  All in all, the set lunch was a fair deal with appropriate portions for the money and I might go back and see if anything else on the menu lives up to expectations, but I wouldn't be in a rush to do so.",6/23/2012,2FhhfXuP2rXgw8MLYk043w,DRmstZ9tUHrpq_XZlghZOQ,Pcg4FtfbvSMMwrYuE1yVjQ,N,1,1

By the time our food arrived, my companion and I had been seated, served and swaddled by no less than a dozen precisely coordinated dervishes. I'm a pretty low key dude, so all of this attention kind of freaked me out (in a good way, mind you; I mean no disservice to the incredible experience they provide). Of course, given that my bladder is the size of a morel-infused poached fava bean, I inevitably had to use the little pilgrim's room. I waited patiently until all of the visible members of the troupe appeared to be swirling around other patrons to make my break. I made it to within 3 steps from the restroom door when someone LEAPED OUT FROM BEHIND A CURTAIN to show me the rest of the way.

26242,"This place sucked so bad that I never had the misfortune of having to sample their food. They might just have the WORST service of any restaurant in Chicago. I attempted to take my girlfriend there for her birthday celebration since she had never had fondue coupled with the fact that Geja's has this glowing rep for being the most romantic place on earth ever since I started keeping track. I made a reservation long in advance specifically requesting a booth. So where do they seat us upon entering? We're placed next to a drafty window right smack on top of another table, hardly what you'd call ""romantic."" I asked the hostess to give us a booth. She replied it would be about an hour wait for one, even with my reservation. Obviously, I'm less than thrilled with this outcome but since it was more about the special occasion then myself, I was willing to entertain this. So we decide to sit at the bar and wait it out. About ten minutes later, I had the great displeasure of meeting rocket scientist/general manager Kirby. He babbles to us that while we could wait the hour for the promised booth that we in fact would be displacing someone else's reservation, so in fact we couldn't have a booth no matter what that night. Huh?!? No offense dear Kirby but I couldn't give a rat's ass about your other reservation woes. All I know is you failed to honor mine. But it gets even better. The coward attempts to blame it on the poor female hostess, claiming that she spoke out of turn and was inexperienced. He then tried to get us to settle on two other crappy non-booth tables. I probably would've taken them but it was my girlfriend who was so incredibly put off by this horrendous service that she stated she'd prefer to eat dog food then be treated like one. I couldn't have agreed more. We walked out, both incredibly thankful I didn't waste money on a place that didn't appreciate my business.

But the real winner in the dish was the thinly sliced beef, which was still medium-rare when it got to the table and had cooked all the way through by the time I finished it. So tender, so delicious. I can't honestly remember what my roommate got, but it looked good as well. They also serve this really delightful condiment plate which includes fresh peppers, bean sprouts, leafy herbs, etc. to compliment your meal.In addition, they have a new delivery service. Sold!In summary, I would recommend Tank Noodle to anyone. Go there.",7/18/2009,Tu2t8rjMzgmazz6FqltnrQ,G44m_ocpZvrzZgi0mgwuXQ,ALwH81_sqskLmwfWS-_eeQ,Y,4,0

31778,"Been to this place a couple times now and I have to say that I'm impressed with the overall experience I've had every time. I have mixed feelings about asian fusion restaurants because some dishes are so good when prepared traditionally, that someitmes the fusion version just doesn't measure up. Anyways, here's the details on food, service, and venue: Short summary: Highly recommended, great food, lively ambience, but a bit loud and difficult to have a conversation with a group. But what can you expect from a restaurant that's really popular and hot right now. Food: Great selection, there's sushi, hot/cold apps, entre dishes, noodle dishes, and dessers. My recommendation is that you order a number of dishes and just eat family style. It's the best way to try everything. My favorite dishes so far: crispy brussel sprout salad, rock shrimp tempura, truffled tataki salmon and tuna sashimi, and buddha style grilled ahi tuna and pork salad. Also good, but not faves: filet mignon(served chopped with side of kim chi and other ban chans), pad thai, and miso glazed black cod. The truffled tataki sashimi is just awesome. If there is one thing on the menu that I had to pick as a must try, it would be the truffled tataki sashimi(both salmon and tuna). The combination of fish and truffle oil just washes over your tastebuds and leaves you feeling decadent and wanting more. One flavor doesn't over power the other and you just get a harmonious taste. The sashimi melts in your mouth and the truffle oil just gives it a nice luxurious finish. Superb dish. Service: Very nice service. I would say above average, but nothing like fine dining service. The servers I've had were very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. My water was always filled and the dishes were always cleared. There seemed to be a manager(maybe owner) that roamed the floor asking each table how they're doing. And he seemed to chat up some regulars that he knows, which was nice. He also helped me out when I coordinated a private dining event and one of my guests was vegetarian. He really did a great job in showing that guest their vegitarian options and adding it to our fixed menu. So I would say great service in the private dining section, and above average service in the general dining room. Venue: Heavily asian themed in decor, the restaurant is beautifully designed and layed out for every type of taste or group setting. It is very open floor concept, and it seems like each section takes on a different feel or mood. The restaurant has a big dining area that has a few sections. There is a sushi bar you can sit at, there's a fully bar right when you walk in, there are high tables near the bar and sushi bar for a more casual get together, there are many different sized tables on the main dining room floor, there is a glass wall that separtes a long dining table from the general dining room(semi-private), and there is a private room that can hold from 12-50 people on the second floor(private bar up there as well). The main dining room can get loud and I found it difficult to carry a conversation with more than 1 person at a time. That would be the only complaint I have.",12/26/2011,6CvuKushCmTEd58B93amkA,5T5GNkSeJgd7dgAS5rN1Mw,8d_DiHWB-pjBVW3a7D8EWg,N,5,1

The spicy tuna was very fishy, and we couldn't bare to eat it. When we complained about the taste, the manager said that everyone else is eating it and not complaining.

47448,Best specials in the neighborhood. Half off every draft? Are you serious? YES YOU ARE! Food is really good from the apps to the burgers. It seems like someone really put some effort to appeal to the veggie lovers like me and having to not pay an upcharge for a good salad instead of fries gets me every time. I love even more that they recently took a rez for my date and I for the UFC fight with GSP. I've never had that and was so sick of fifty/50 and they're deep fried menu this was a welcome sight. The manager even sold me some wine from a personal bottle he got from upstairs because they don't sell wine anymore.

32961,"If you're looking for a place to have a hearty breakfast, look no further--Yolk is your place.  When you first look at the menu, it may be a bit overwhelming, as they have so many delicious items to choose. However, I'm more of an omelet person, so I have tried almost all of their omelet dishes and they are quite tasty. My boyfriend usually gets their skillet dish; which to my amazement, he manages to eat it all. FYI - The portions here are pretty generous. If you do plan to visit this place, expect to wait between 20- 25 minutes on weekends. I usually wait outside and sit along the flower beds. They have an outdoor intercom so you can hear when they call your name. Some opted to wait inside; however, it's just a big open space for people to stand. As one reviewer previously noted, wish they utilized the open space---they can easily put 4-5 additional tables there, or provide seats if they plan to use it as a waiting area.  The ambiance is modern, vibrant, and airy. The service is prompt. The location is excellent---just minutes away from the Millennium Park.

24766,"After finding out that Geja's was on the list of participating restaurants for restaurant week, I immediately made a reservation. I've been wanting to come here and thought taking advantage of the deal would be great way to experience it for the first time.  We arrived early for our 6:30 Saturday reservation and sat at the bar while we waited for our table. In my opinion, we had the best table in the entire restaurant. We had the corner table in the room farthest from the bathroom on an elevated landing. It felt so secluded and intimate. It was dark at our table that our server had to use a little flashlight to help us see and order off the menu. We both ordered the aged beef tenderloin and shrimp. The Swiss Gruyere cheese fondue with apples, bread and grapes came out with the salad. The Dijon vinaigrette was tangy and the cheese fondue was delicious. I love Gruyere and all the dipping accompaniments were perfectly matched.  While eating the cheese fondue, the oil was heating so it was hot and bubbling when the platter of our beef tenderloin, shrimp and veggies were presented. This platter took up half the table. The cooking directions were given as well as the times. I noticed the beef and the shrimp needed a little longer than the 1-2 minutes they stated. The food was phenomenal. The veggies were tasty although the broccoli gave us the most difficult time. The darn thing kept falling off the skewer! The beef was tender and the shrimp were huge. We cleaned the entire plate but was able to pace ourselves and enjoy every bite. No one rushed us. The chocolate fondue was a great way to end the already delicious meal. The flambe was a nice touch for me to burn my marshmallows. I like them that way. The crushed graham cracker was perfect to make a version of smores. The chocolate was decadent and the fruit delicious. The coffee was strong and excellent. I like the whipped cream instead of cream. I think I might even do that at home. Overall, the service was outstanding, the food beyond delicious and the ambiance intimate. This was my husband's first experience with fondue and loved it. We are definitely coming back for a special occasion. This is a place you want to take someone to impress.",3/22/2009,uNm9slwtMI4EDe2l9DHtwQ,w_FrX_gRd63sgvFtPTrgSg,F7IQngaDDBgYvhA3U31q-g,N,4,1

54517,"Okay so, I just got home from eating at the chicago diner and it was super duper good! I had a college visit at UIC and had to check it out. I read a ton of reviews before going so my expectations were high. Upon entering, I was shocked my the small size. Its super tiny! I (4 year vegetarian) came with my mom (meat eater) and there was like three 2 person tables available and we were seated almost right away. It was full of hipsters with their skinny jeans and tattoos. haha, it was cute. The waiters/waitresses were super hip and sweet. My water was never empty. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer and it was good but not great. It coulda used more spinach but we still ate it all. I got the avocado tostados since i was nervous about the whole fake meat thing. My mom got the chili. My tostados were crazy good! sooo yummmy. I'm still full. My mom loved her chili and ate every bit of it. However, the people sitting next to us, (literally like right next to us. its small.) got the ruben and now i am regretting my meal choice. It looked amazing to say the least. Still, Our meals were delish. I wanted the cookie dough shake but they were out :( pooh. so i got the chocolate peanut butter. it was good and tasted like a resse cup. All together my bill was $34. not too bad. We plan on going there again when i take my placement tests and other school stuff. This place is a must for vegetarians/vegans! even my mom, a proud meat eater, added this place to her top 5. try it out",5/18/2008,26U44uW0iBd3PzNyY9NvbA,tp4JWhNFnfI_TIdPPTRiYg,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw,Y,2,0

42626,"Captivating, intimate, warm, and welcoming- an unbelievable restaurant for a perfectly crafted cocktail and an amazing meal with that special someone. Gilt Bar has been hot for a while now and I have been kicking myself for not getting over there to try it out, but that all ended last night when I finally took the plunge. The place oozes sexuality from the moment you pull up to the minimalistic location tucked away in the back of River North off Kedzie in the shadow of Merchandise Mart. Upon entering you are greeted by a dark and smoky atmosphere with really eye-catching lighting. The restaurant is laid out well and there is a really good flow to the place.  As we made our way to our table it was impossible not to notice the hip attractive crowd enjoying the crazy looking cocktails I've heard so much about. The tables and dcor are also spot-on. Distressed wood tabletops and heart place setting really went well with the aesthetic the place was going for. As for the food... It was outstanding. The starter menu features items ""on toast"" and my guest and I went back and forth several times before finally deciding to try both the Foie Gras and roasted bone marrow plates. Both were fantastic although I will say I felt they should have done a much better job with the bread selection. The plate was overcrowded with huge pieces of crusty bread that- while delicious- were tough to handle and really made a mess as we had to tear them apart to get usable pieces. For our main course we ordered the salmon and pork belly and both were cooked to perfection. As a side we had to try the blackened cauliflower with pickled onions and chili- that was superb as well. The presentation for all 3 dishes was wonderfully simplistic and highly approachable and the flavors of the dish really spoke for themselves without too much distraction. We did some nice sampling of the drink menu as well starting with two different white wines at the recommendation of our server as well as a few of the specialty cocktails. I can say without a doubt that the wine was well suggested and my ""Pimm's Cup"" was beyond good and the perfect summer concoction. Finally we just had to go for dessert and we jumped right in when our over-the-top banana split showed up. The ice cream was beyond decadent and there were toasted candied pistachios crumbled over the top of the entire thing, which was just a fantastic touch. Overall I would say this place was as good if not better than everyone has been saying it is. The atmosphere is perfect for a date or a more intimate gathering with friends before- say- a night out, the food and drinks are outstanding, and the location is just far enough off the beaten path for you to feel like you've made a real discovery on your own.",1/28/2012,9MDN,DugPUyqWoWeWpt7H6jnhHQ,sDYjKyI_67eUhFAqVneYjA,N,5,1

Very friendly wait staff who are happy to make suggestions if you don't know what to order. We tried the combination plate and ordered two veggie and two meat dishes. All were full of flavor and the spicy dishes had some heat but nothing approaching burning or painful. The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food. The portions were good- not so tiny you feel cheated but not so huge you can't finish. Just right in my opinion. With two glasses of wine plus the combo plate, for a dinner of two the bill came to just $25!The crowd was a good mix, which suits Uptown perfectly in my opinion. There was a family with a child, several small groups, and also several couples. It's a nice but casual place, so you will not be out of place dressed up or dressed down.

Everything's better in dark rooms and candlelight. I got 3 lime/traditional Margs and was pleased they were given to me in tall glasses and strong; I dig robust and big things. I went with the steak comal. Oh, you cunning, little role player! You came on a skillet, all laid out before me, but completely blanketed in some deceptive sauce. It almost resembled a Chinese entree (and I don't have a yen for Chinese) and it was heavy and bland. When I have it heavy, I want it hot, or sweet, or both. Moreover, I prefer my meat naked. If it's good; it doesn't need to be cloaked. The much raved about pistachio chicken was super tender and succulent, magic in my mouth, but I wanted more of the crusty nuts.

You almost have to live the moment to understand where im coming from but trust me you will understand.  Obviously this place isnt made for your healthy veg summer diet. I had to make the sacrifice coming here knowing that my fav piece of meat is one of their delicasies, even though I try to eat it as least as possible.  At the sametime, I'll make this as easy as possible and give my best recommendations: The best - Porchetta - Basically a fat filet, but seriously the best piece of fat Ive ever had the hints of rosemary and roasted apples accented this perfectly! It seriously just melts in your mouth, but smacks your pallette w/ flavor.  Must get - Dover Sole/Hamachi/Lake perch/Potato Salad/Spicy pork grinds Should try - Pickles/Farm Chicken/Oysters Wasnt impressed - Country ribs All in all this was a fabulous place the family style portions are decent, the wait staff is great, nice hip place, this was a winner!

Everything tasted great! Although I sometimes had trouble distinguishing between different kinds of steaks. But they are all great! Salad bar and the side dishes were also good. One of the side dishes was something like corn bread and I loved it :) Service is great! People were nice in explaining how things work here for us. Would want to visit again if I get the chance.

55850,"We've lived in Andersonville for 5 years and have taken all of our out of town guests here for Chicago deep dish. Tonight they messed up our pizza order - forgot the pepperoni (the manager claims there was pep, yeah, no way - 3 adults agreed there was no pep and even the waitress saw no pep). We had two small children with us and instead taking the waitress up on a remake we decided to eat it and avoid impending child chaos of waiting another 20 minutes for a fresh dish. Then the bill came - $1 off of an incorrect order on a $80+ tab (2 pizzas, kids meals, 3 drinks). When we asked if they could make it right (maybe discount us the $3.25 per topping after 1 topping rather than the $1 for the first topping? Comp one of the drinks or a kids meal?) the manager was extremely unhelpful. We'll be taking our family and Chicago guests somewhere else for deep dish. So sad. I really liked that place, but it only takes one bad experience to turn away loyal customers. I know I'm being picky but we ordered all of our pizza from them and dined in regularly.

5319,"Let me preface this review by announcing that I AM the QUEEN of bacon! Don't put it past me to have a plate of bacon for breakfast, lunch or dinner. No joke. So I was more than just a little esctatic to sample the Italian tapas menu @ Purple Pig. Sat down at a tall communal table a little after lunch time with Beth W. & company after some intense Power Point slide editing. Didn't quite beat the lunch crowd but then again only waited 2 minute for a table. Service was definitely just right. Our server didn't give us the evil eye for turning her away about 4 times before we were finally focused enough to stop chit chatting and have our orders down. Plates are small yet made for sharing, so order plenty! Items from the a la plancha portion of the menu are slightly larger. Never had brussel sprouts before and boy, is this the right place to try them! They were served as fried crispy flakes with a refreshing dash of lemon flavor. I couldn't get enough!  Tried & loved: *fried brussel sprouts *bite sized fried aracini balls stuffed with winter squash & goat cheese with sage pesto *Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki (they should bottle up & sell their tzatziki sauce!) *Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes (mmm....tender porky goodness!) Didn't try but will go back for: *prosciutto bread balls *pig's tails braised in balsamic *wine!! how could we not try the swine but not the wine?! *Affogato dessert...this is my new found favorite sweet treat!

49268,"Great cheeses, wonderful wines, adequate service. We made our own cheese assortment: Australian Persian Feta, Grayson, Morbier, Robiola Langhe, Pecorino, and Parmigiano Reggiano. The Grayson, from Meadow Creek Creamery in Virginia, is a new one for me. It's a nice strong semi-soft cows milk cheese. The Australian Persian Fetta was nice, but I won't go looking for it in a cheese shop.  My wife did a flight of white wines, I did a flight of Spanish reds, then we had a few glasses more of those we liked best (the Chilean Casa Silva Viognier and the Spanish Tempranillo Codice). Very relaxing on a Friday after work. Bin 36 always works for me, whether it's just for wine and cheese or for dinner too, and in spite of the sometimes great, sometimes not, service. A bit more generous servings of cheeses would be welcomed, but I'll keep coming back if only for their broad selection of cheeses.  Hint - If you select your own assortment of cheeses, ask them to bring you the nuts and other accompaniments that come with the standard assortments. For some ridiculous reason, they don't automatically do that, but will, for free, if you ask.",11/11/2008,6bHdO0qgyiyi4oJHr-6fkQ,LFzCNWu8tIxGNPk358QVJg,xjZ9eqYrzMrl2v6_1Kv6hA,N,4,1

It was packed, but there was enough room to squeeze into a corner table by the window.  The waiter was informative and friendly - the atmosphere in that place is completely relaxed and fun, and the music really gets you in the mood for some traditional Cuban cuisine.  I had the special, some fried pork that had been marinaded overnight, along with some black beans and rice. The pork was savory, tender, and melt-in-your mouth good - the beans and rice were average, but a nice compliment.  We also ordered a shared plate of the famous Yuca fries, which unfortunately were served cold. Whoops. But no problem, we notified the waiter and he brought out a hot, fresh plate with a smile - great service and the flavor of those fries totally won me back.  Desert? Si, senor.

I'm particularly a big fan of the aparagus beef and tuna tartare.",7/9/2011,AaH1qV6fJaZfLUhm5PcfZw,Auw-d-fvSqVXnWDekZd-bw,mlhHPnHmjO2_ypcP5Vc9Zw,N,4,1
7403,"In a decade that increasingly is dominated by deal creaters, finders and connectors, paying full price for anything these days makes you look like a loser. Felt somewhat smart then, going into Sapori on a Monday night, when the deal of the day was a 4 course family style dinner option for 20 something a head. The restaurant wasn't exactly overflowing - insufficient or less than effective promotion? Or maybe deal snobs do exist! Which had me wondering how Sapori would look on a non-deal day. The food was good, well part of the food at least - my favorites were the pesto gnocchi, rigatoni and tiramasu (one of the best I've had, and I don't even like it that much). The caprese, the butternut squash soup and the wines were mostly forgettable. But definitely not the kind of mouth watering Italian that has you lining up at their door, and paying full price. The ambiance is rather nice, the restaurant surprisingly spacious considering the neighborhood it is wedged in, validated discounted parking ( not free as their website suggests -watch out!) is a perk, but the service was excruciatingly slow. Overall, even though I spent more that night than I expected to (these darn birthday dinners!), I do believe Sapori offers a great bang for your buck - so if you want to give the home kitchen a break on a Monday night, pay a visit to the Sapori kitchen!",8/5/2011,zo9UmND3ggVnGpWh9HQiKg,nMN8t5MSDRLDE1Yrzj0vhA,LYppbvgJlBG0SqjSKFiFGg,N,3,1
16179,"On the outside an unassuming warehouse; on the inside a burst of color and panache. It really felt like my friend and I were at a Carnivale celebration. My friend who had just visited Chicago and recommended this place. I am glad we followed her advice! We started with the Ropa Vieja. It was amazing. The meat was incredibly tender and the plantains were the perfect complement. We also had the ceviche as an appetizer. I thought it was okay-- the chips were my favorite part, although the fish did taste fresh. I also had a strawberry mojito and it was delicious! The perfect pairing for a Latin fiesta! For dinner, I had the chuleta. The pork chop was pretty tasty, not dry. However, I didn't like the sauce very much, so that dish was okay in my book. Finally, we ended with the blueberry tres leche cake. I have never had a tres leche cake before, but the the moistness was a nice unexpected surprise. The blueberry flavor wasn't overpowering, so that was nice. Overall, the dinner was pretty pricey ~$100 for the two of us.

59244,"This is one of those places where the customer service makes the otherwise good food taste like a wet sock. Been there twice and, unfortunately, was served by the rudest server (Chuck) both times. The first time we met him, about 10 minutes into eating our food, he asked us if we wanted boxes and kept coming back to ask the same question ... even after we told him that we need time eating since we did order quite a number of dishes. We felt rushed and unnecessarily so,seeing how there was no queue of people waiting for a table. But we laughed it off telling ourselves that he probably used to work at the Container Store and thus is obssessed with boxes/boxing stuff.The second and what will be my last time, we asked for the peking duck and bbq'd chicken but was told that since it's almost closing time, he cannot serve us anything bbq'd. Ok, understood. But after seeing a couple who came in after us being served bbq'd chicken, we asked another server who confirmed that yes that IS bbq'd chicken and yes they are still serving it. When we asked Chuck about it, the two of them talked in Chinese, concluding to the other server retracting his previous statement. We were annoyed but, oh well, wouldn't let him ruin our dinner. My dinner wouldn't have been ruined IF it came, but it did not. I ordered wonton soup and did not get it. After I asked Chuck about it, he said 'oh' and offered me the to-go dish that my friend ordered for her husband. Seriously. To offer me another person's food as a peace offering is just demented, a simple apology and an effort to check kitchen for wonton soup would've been more appropriate. Yes, the food is good. And if you want to go, ask for a table as far away from the entrance as possible (seems to be Chuck's domain).

50721,"The last place you need another review for is Wishbone, but today I had a brunch there that made me question my prior affections for their brekkie. Yes, true as you all say, passel of yuppies with screaming, generally undisciplined tots all resulting in a train-terminal-in-rush-hour ambience. I've tolerated that because I can get so many different southern-y or more adventurous breakfasts and, in the past, could suck down some of the yummiest spicy bloody marys. Today, it was the same typical cacophony, herds of yuppies and their spawn, same exact menu, but nothing was GOOD! What? The point of enduring the otherwise unpleasant surroundings on a weekend would be for reliably good food. Today? Not so much! Here's the rundown: Coffee: totally watery and weak Bloody Mary: watery and weak, not spicy at all, no discernable vodka, and celery that looked like it just completed a death march into the glass -- all brown and broken, you wouldn't give it to someone to eat at home, or eat it yourself, so why garnish a drink with it, you dumbass? Crabcakes Benedict: eggs were not even remotely poached, completely overcooked hard-boiled quality yolks. Underneath it all, the english muffins were blackened and burnt and actually difficult to cut. Side of cheezy grits = cold. My boyfriends poached eggs were also cooked to rubbery. To their credit was our waiter, who I asked ""what's going on? Everything is totally weak and missing the mark?"" and showed him my overcooked eggs. I told him I didn't want another replacement meal, but he brought one anyway and on the 2nd go, they did get it right.

It was delectable and creamy with a central garlic marshmallow. So far, so good. THEN, to top it off, the bisque contained Corn Nuts! Who would've thought that? That was the defining moment for me as far as his genius and innovative use of ingredients. The substitution of truffle and parmesan popcorn for bread was another one of his avant-garde calls. The only thing funny was that it tasted VERY SIMILAR to the foccaccia served at Avec. I know the ingredients are similar, just wasn't expecting that. The service was attentive and friendly. Not stuck-up as I was expecting. I want to give GE 5 stars, but.......wasn't a fan of the lobster (sorry, Graham). Don't get me wrong, the lobster was very tasty and the edamame spread was delightful, but the lobster meat was stuck to the shell. It was semi-embarrassing battling the hell out of this dead lobster as other diners glared on. In the end, the lobster won. I had to leave 50% of the meat behind. I know. So sad, so sad.

The Masaman curry was the perfect size for the two of us and was delicious! We ordered two servings of sticky rice to accompany it, but I wasn't really a fan - probably should have gotten plain jasmine rice instead.  The portions aren't enormous, but they are totally an appropriate amount of food and the prices are good.",1/25/2009,TBFS0nkBLYpJPOioeifO7A,W7ANVRMQLf7h-YdjC4THtw,NYhIkpTi4ffmkAu4o2aKuA,N,5,1
314,"Simply put: the service and food were so amazing at Alinea I didn't minding dropping $500 on the extended menu with wine pairing. I've never said that before (and I will probably never say it again).  Alinea is definitely a ""culinary experience"" and not just eating out.  They even made some special new dishes just for my wife because she was a vegetarian. All in all, if you can afford it, you should make it a point to visit Alinea. I would say that you can probably just do the shorter menu and still have a great experience but like I said already, I have no regrets about going all the way!",4/16/2007,FwferUb8h982xZlgdJx7GQ,gX4-uAQBfpZ9s_cMEJMLVA,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,N,5,1
47893,"I would have given this place 5 stars....but the service was just not there. The decor in the restaurant is really nice, very modern though. Also, lots of people at the bar area, probably there for happy hour. So here's my experience, let's start! We made reservations and were seated quite quickly, given we came on a weekday. Then, our waiter took FOREVER to greet us. After 10 minutes, he came and gave us the skinny on their setup, then said he'll be back to get our drink orders. After 20 minutes, he decides to show up and get our drink orders, and another 10 minutes to get our drinks (I had the blueberry mojito and it was DELISH!). So then we headed over to the salad bar and they had awesome gourmet selections, from simple grilled vegetables to mushrooms with goat cheese dressing! Simply amazing :) After we enjoyed the salads..we hastily put our stones in the middle to indicate that we are ready for some meats! Well, we waited for probably 10-15 minutes before a chef noticed that we were waiting for entrees. And after we had finished our 1 slice of meat, we waited another 15 minutes before another chef came....and this happened all throughout dinner = VERY LOOOONG dinner, longer than it should have been! As far as the actual entrees, they all were VERY good and they had stuff you wouldn't normally see at your regular Brazilian steakhouse, such as lamb, goat, and venison that were cooked to perfection! Also, the seared tuna with seaweed salad and wasabi mayo was amazing, we asked for it twice (but it took 30 mins for it to come..booo) Dessert was amazing, we had the mango creme brulee, bread pudding, and banana creme pie and all were amazingly tasty and delicious! But, again...our waiter gave us our menu and didn't come back until 15 minutes later to get our order.... So in recap: Food is gourmet and AMAZING but the service is SLOW....so if you're planning on dinner here....ensure you have no plans afterwards :)",1/20/2009,-AIhwdG9XS-v03zcqkSXww,0Pz27lyl_y2F4DKNdU6H3Q,d6UbRb9W5eA1yL-DuVZ8ug,N,4,1
61252,"Sad to say, it's gone downhill big time since they remodeled. I don't get it...did they hire all new cooks? is it different management that just doesn't care? I used to love their burritos and tortas here so so much. Garcia's was an institution. me and my girlfriend both loved the place, were regulars. However, We've been there twice in the last few months since they re-opened and our dinners were just awful. On both occasions the meat was burnt and unedible in our dishes. On the last occasion my Al Pastor Torta was so burnt, there was no flavor beyond the burnt meat itself. Charred to a charcoal back, all the meat. How could they serve that? the first time we were disappointed, but we wanted to give them another chance, but when that happens twice in a row, something's wrong. We won't be coming back, and were loyal customers for years. what HAPPENED?",3/22/2011,IYqQyRUHFCKKJMLJPfTr9g,sb86BBktjsINvFgWlx82pw,08X_5WTOVNvk4SgPRKBjjQ,Y,5,0
26228,"Warning: Huge! Loud! If you're looking for something intimate, this is not it! Half the tables seem to be groups that insisted the server take pictures of them. Seriously so very loud: with kind of loud techno music playing loudly, and two stories of space above the loud crowd for noise to loudly reverberate around. Also, really big! Not lettuce entertain you big, but it sort of still felt that way. A note about the space: the dining room has enormous arched windows that face east onto Michigan, so the room is flooded with that orange sodium light. (A plus in my book.) Also, there are several bar / lounge areas to wait in, with lots of nooks for chatting with a small group. So if you're up for a kind of big restaurant experience: the food is fantastic. (The normal small-plate place caveats apply here. It's probably more fun with more people because you can taste more things, it can probably get quite expensive in that way, etc.)  Since we were only two, we did the tasting menu. It was... well, tasty, but they don't give you much of the distinctive food, and the portions were really too big. My favorite part was the wine pairings; there were three, and they were all really interesting and/or delicious. (I asked for a list of the choices and our server forgot it.) The wee tater tots (patatas bravas?) with spicy aioli are great. The grilled scallops were good, but crazy salty. The flatbread was flavorful and complex. Octopus was outstanding - tender and spiced in a really nice, balanced way. I will happily go back if a group of friends suggests it.",8/31/2010,q1xWzIj0PRVVwWvyF1U7-A,6EHbIv5w2I4XbXs3dG_D1Q,DXwSYgiXqIVNdO9dazel6w,N,4,1
56529,"We have eaten here several times. We always love it. If you want a table without waiting forever at the bar, you have to wait outside. I suggest showing up before 4:30 if the door opens at 5:00. You should really be there by 4:15. But, waiting at the bar isn't so bad if you don't have kids. The topolo margaritas are fabulous.I don't think you can go wrong with the menu. We always get the Sopes rancheras to start. Just get enough plates of these for your party. They go down like candy... candy with braised meat on it! I can't remember all the entrees we have had, but my favorite was definitely the roasted goat special that is served on Mondays or something. The steaks are also fantastic. Its not that the sear is special or the beef to die for--I couldn't tell because the seasoning was so bold. But my brother said his Asada Brava was the best steak he's ever had. The tacos al pastor would be a good safe bet.We have also been for brunch, which my wife and I loved. My mom wasn't so thrilled. She's not as adventurous, and the brunch menus is not just American dishes with chipotle on the side. Rick keeps to the traditional Mexican stuff, and the flavors are just as exciting as at dinner.If you can't handle the wait, go next door to Xoco. There is still a wait, but less, and the sandwiches are great.

Another twenty minutes and a few more seatings of other parties later, I finally got the message I should have gotten sooner: Don't choose hot. see-and-be-seen restaurants-of-the-month where favored clients are permitted to leapfrog those who precede them.

4594,"Amazing! Food highlight of our Chicago trip. We were looking for a place to eat on Sunday night and this place came highly recommended on our Lonely Planet Guide.  It's literally hidden, tucked away beside Nordstrom's huge building on North Michigan Ave's Magnificent Mile. I literally walked right past, retraced my steps and found it. Tip: If you see Michael Jordans Steakhouse on Michigan, skip that place and look directly across the street and you'll find the Purple Pig. Popped in shortly after 6:00, left my name with the host table, then cheated a bit:. Rather than stick around at the bar, I walked back to our hotel @ 10 mins away to pick up my wife.  We both arrived just before 7:00 and they seated us right away at a patio table.  Food was awesomely different. Beets with goat cheese and pistachios was amazing. Greek salad very nice. Pigs ears, an unusual choice, very nicely complimented by a loosely cooked fried egg that our server recommended to stir into the crispy bits. Very interesting taste, I'd describe as a chewy pork crackling for my British friends. Milk-braised pork shoulder to die for. Very simple dish, super tender, nice use of (mild) spice.  Turkey leg confit: amazing taste, HUGE portion. Overall very nice! Not super-pricey, either.

20332,"The Gage was my second and last stop during this year's Restaurant Week. Branch 27, my first stop, was great and I was hoping to continue the streak here. I was at the Gage once before a few years ago. I had a variety of homemade sausages and a Scotch egg, and I remember enjoying it. This time, however, not so much. We made reservations for 7PM and got in with no problem. We sat more towards the back of the restaurant this time. This place is much longer than I thought it was. The first time we ate here, we sat in the front bar area, which is small, cramped and dark. This time we walked past the bar and into a devoted dining area that is much brighter and better laid out. We were seated and ordered some beers. The Gage has a pretty decent beer list, which is always nice. We were also given a few menus, but we were only interested in what they were offering for Restaurant Week. That menu was surpringly light on options--only 2 choices per course. We both ordered the lobster bisque for the first course. I wasn't a huge fan. It was very bitter. It did have a very prominent lobster flavor and there was a dab of shredded lobster in the bowl, but something wasn't quite right about it. For the entree, I ordered the hanger steak and my friend ordered the white fish. The steak was a surprisingly small portion and again the flavor was lacking. It seemed suprisingly dry for a medium-cooked piece of meat and overall it was very dull. The small splash of sauce and salty greens didn't add much either. For dessert we both had some sort of chocolate/peanut butter mousse that I enjoyed well enough. Overall, the Gage is a nice place, but the food just didn't measure up to everything else it had to offer--an incredibly disappointing realization.",11/22/2010,X7Iwni8-3xtsmlsLQ3D,G_OLc98NjQkU0Mc4iJSfFQ,mlhHPnHmjO2_ypcP5Vc9Zw,N,3,1

46771,"The short: Great casual place for a burger, but not worth the wait if crowded. First disclaimer: I would jog by this place all the time when the weather was warmer and be cruelly tempted by the greasy goodness inside, as well as told time and again by a friend who lives nearby that they go all the time and that I should try it, so I have to say that I had a little bit of expectations before I came here. Second disclaimer: I went during Zoo Lights. It made perfect sense to me, so why did I not anticipate that it would make perfect sense to a multitude of others? Yet somehow I did not... The experience: Waited about an hour for a table on a Tuesday night (was told 45-50 min). My date and my thoroughly cranky self were escorted to our seats, where fortunately we were thin enough to squeeze through the narrow passage and fit into our tiny booth for two. Fortunately, the experienced picked up from here. Fast, friendly wait staff who took our orders quickly and delivered our appetizer of nachos while I was still perusing all of the framed photos of women on the walls and debating with my girlfriend what exactly defines a ""dive restaurant"". Nachos were typical, meaning great: chili, cheese, guac, sour cream, and salsa, enough to alleviate some of my starvation, but not so much as to overwhelm. Our burgers arrived shortly afterwards, my green chili burger and her veggie burger. Mine was awesomely thick, replete with giant slice of green pepper and grated cheddar cheese, while my girlfriend set to work on the biggest veggie burger I have ever seen. The homemade chips were a nice change of pace-- I myself enjoy both chips and fries, but only consider myself a sucker for the Five Guys' variety, but this was a nice hybrid that was truly original. I was able to conquer my burger, but my poor date only could finish about half her meatless monstrosity. I forgot to try a bite of hers, but I really have no credence when it comes to veat patties. At this point, Grunts was on a roll, but then I had to use the restroom. Weaving back through the tiny maze of the restaurant not only again required nimbleness, but so did sliding into the single stall of the men's room. The evening ended with a modest bill (we only had water to drink), but a loss of my girlfriend's gloves which she forgot at the restaurant, and unfortunately disappeared by the time we returned not ten minutes after we left. So the most important things were there-- good food and good service. And the casual atmosphere reminded me of simple eateries at my past residences (South Bend and Pittsburgh). However I would never put up with that crowd again, both in terms of the wait and in how claustrophobic the place is. Maybe if it wasn't for Zoo Lights, I wouldn't have had to wait an hour for a table or be up to my arms in small children (disappointment was as strong as the relief I felt when one little dude narrowly escaped death by revolving door). Only because I had been told to go for so long and happened to be right there already did I accept the ridiculous wait yesterday. In a city like South Bend that has few alternatives and fewer people who actually eat anything but American food, I would have expected this crowd, but in Chicago?

Their bourbon and whiskey selection is, of course, mind-blowingly extensive, and though I abstained this night, I dare say it might be worth a sipple at my next visit. We were there more for drinking than for dinner, but a few Harvest Sidecars in and a little food seemed fitting. As a group we sampled from the small plates menu: frog legs, veal sweetbread, and meatballs in creamy polenta were had and I don't think anybody was disappointed in the slightest. Those meatballs alone will be the death of me. I thought pricing was fair, and it was actually less than I was anticipating for our cocktails and small plates.

31509,"Went here for ""guys night."" Decent place, however, I'm not the biggest steak fan... which would explain why I went here and ordered the Lamb Chops. They were really great, and my friends loved their steaks. If you go, be sure to get their French onion soup... OUTSTANDING. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, we shared sides of the creamed spinach - I've had better; the gouda mac & cheese - very good; sauteed asparagus - OK; wasabi mashed potatoes - AMAZING. I only had a non-alcoholic drink, but my friends went ahead and ordered bottles of wine that were 3 figures each. So at the end when the bill came to a crazy amount, I only have myself to blame, since I didn't taste any of the wine myself. Anyways, the service was very good, but a little overkill at times, like the water being refilled each time I literally took a sip.

Shrimp shumai and chicken satay are my favorite appetizers, and the Pad Thai is an absolute must have -- I've never had better. Curry fried rice and the beef salad are also favorites.

28980,"One word: Frustrating! If I were to rate this place just on the food, I would happily give it 5 stars. Yes, it was pretty darn good. The fried tofu's sauce had a nice kick to it, the som tum salad was very good, very flavorful, and spicy, and the panang curry with tofu was sooo good. The curry was creamy, rich, peanuty, sweet, and savory. Yum. The decor was pleasant. There was artwork on the walls and woodwork all around -- the woodwork was not just your average panelling, but had lots of impressive carving in it. The ambiance was nice. All good stuff, right? So what went wrong? The service. I can't really say that the staff was outright rude or anything, but they certainly didn't seem to care all that much. My lovely panang curry came with a big, nasty, black hair in it (clearly not belonging to my husband or myself) and they barely even acknowledged it. If I were running a place, I'd freaking comp something on the bill, not to mention even really saying sorry to the customer and seeing what I could do to make it up to them. Yuck.  They never came back to our table to see how we were doing, and as soon as it came close to 10 PM (their closing time that night), the cleaning fluid odors were overpowering the place and the lighting that had created the ambiance was switched fully to ON. Oh, and they didn't ask if we wanted dessert, which I kind of did, and did the same thing to a table near us, where I heard them hand the waitress back the check (she was trying to get them out of there -- this was at 9:15-ish) and ask for dessert. I opted to ignore dessert and get out before becoming overwhelmed by the cleaner smell.  So that's it: I was so bummed by the service that I have to give this place a 3 star review. It made me not want to go back there, which really sucks because it was uncommonly good food. Grrr.",7/29/2010,Axv-54Xtl,PfJfadcpj1zxTT7WXj62LA,DXwSYgiXqIVNdO9dazel6w,N,1,1

You get tons of sides, and the meat portions are reasonably large too. I was surprised how good the squid was, very tender. Great place to go after a night out as it's open pretty late, although the sign says open til 5, a few friends and I tried to go at 4:30 and they said that they were close. Not a huge deal. The servers are pretty Korean, so it wouldn't hurt to bring a Korean friend along, but they were friendly enough for my parents and I, on par for most asian restaurants at least.

59873,"Loved it! Loved it! loved it! Everyone had a different menu item and each was as full of flavors as the next. If it was steak, it was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tender with a hint of rosemary. Salad was good. The Chops were almost sweet as the juices melted the meat on your tongue. Even the pasta was fabulous. If the menu said it was served with prosciutto and red pepper cream sauce, that's exactly what I tasted. Wild mushroom risotto was great, which can be difficult to execute without going to starch or mush. Mr Kinzie (Raphael) was fabulous, helpful, utterly attentive and funny. I go out for the desserts and I don't care who knows it. I had creme brulee because I always have creme brulee and can spot a good one instantly. Yep. The Chocolate terrine was exactly what they said and a wonderful combination of flavors. But my daughter had the PISTACHIO SEMIFREDDO! To die for. and I don't say that lightly, ever. In addition to having a wonderful meal we all said the atmosphere was perfect for our get-together. Because we had a corner booth, we were protected from the noise in the center of the room.

60387,"I had the worst service experience of my life here. My friend complained because it took almost an hour for them to make our pizza. I understand that these pizzas take a while to cook and a long wait is the norm, so I wasn't going to make a big deal about it, but it mattered to my friend. The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary. Then the manager ripped the pizza out of my friend's hands and charged his card back and yelled 'THERE, now you can go wait somewhere else for your meal!!'. He continued to verbally abuse us as we walked out in a stunned silence.I reported him to the corporate office the next day, but they never got back to me. After repeated phone calls and emails I finally reported them to the Better Business Bureau. I called other branches and one of the guys I talked to said it was a known problem at this branch, but the manager is related to one of the higher-ups in corporate and nothing is ever done about it.It reminded me of another experience I witnessed a couple weeks earlier, when the manager had been berating one of the workers in the kitchen, loudly and angrily. It was awful to be around, but it wasn't directed at me so I didn't take action.This was the worst service experience of my life, and I certainly will never go back. The fact that they keep a manager with known anger management problems in his position and ignore the complaints of the customers he harasses says a lot about them as an organization.

Perfect thin crust, just enough seasoning, and not too chewy. The red sauce with pepperoni really hit the spot. However, red sauce with chicken and spinach did not do it for me.

Maybe have it warm with the fat actually mixed into the popcorn and not just as a topping. The pork belly sandwich was pretty good. Not as heavy as I had thought. The only complaint was the wait. We got there at 7 for a table of 5. We waited over 2 hours and still no table. Eventually we had to ask for a table of four with a extra chair pulled up. Why they did not do this is the first place is beyond me. There were tons of tables for four that were filled after we got there. Instead of asking us if we would want a table of four with an extra chair the staff just had us wait over 2 hours.

24803,"After reading all the yelp reviews for Gja's Cafe, I still decided to go there with our party of 6. I didn't find this place romantic. Mostly because of the tables in the middle of the room, strong oil scent and the noise level. In our reservation (2,5 weeks ahead) I requested a table in more quiet area of the restaurant, but instead we were given one in the middle and nothing could be done to change it . The place was getting crowded and there were no other options for group of 6.  Our guest seemed to like the place ( or maybe they're being polite, not sure), but me and my husband couldn't wait to go somewhere else and finally relax. and we did go out the same night to meet our friends and they all greeted us with:"" What's that smell??? fried fish? Ehh."" yeah..I could smell it in our car even the next day.  My problem with Geja's was, that I expected it to be more classy but fun and the food was lacking practically any flavor ( the main course.the appetizer and desert were still O'k).. Maybe, if I went there just with my husband on a weekday night and we got only cheese/ chocolate fondue and a bottle of nice Pino Noir.... Still, I am not looking forward to this possibility. And it was not even about price/quantity/flavor disproportion . Geja's isn't the first overpriced place we went. It was just absurdly fake, just selling this idea of fondue as some exotic thing, wrapping it all in a ""romantic"" glaze.

45985,"MUST GO TO RESTAURANT IF YOU WANT A GREAT DESSERT...... Grand Lux Cafe is a tough place to review for a serious foodie. First of all, as so many other people have pointed out, its just like the Cheesecake factory and has the feel of restaurant where they ""turn and burn"" the tables. The little foyer at the main entrance is where you leave your name for the long wait you will have to endure if you go at a peak time. The food sizes are crazy and if you actually finish your main course you are an official fat b*stard/b*tch. If you go here for a appetizer or main course, you will have a very average experience. However, if you go for dessert after eating in another restaurant you will be in for a great time. The desserts are baked to order and can take over 20 minutes to arrive (its worth the wait). The Molten Chocolate cake is amazing (takes 30 minutes to get to your table but sooooooooo worth the wait) and is as good a dessert as i've ever had. The New Orleans Beignets are also amazing and great to share. I rarely give a shout out to service staff however Joe K. has served me a few times and he is an extremely nice guy, with great knowledge of the menu and is always prepared to go the extra mile for his customers. If he serves you, you are guaranteed top notch service. Go to Grand Lux late in the evening, after all the madness of the dinner rush is over and have amazing desserts.",1/22/2011,SDhMsm7q,09_Mk4Mdr6cqw0TYP6FHXg,4wreIFjaPMppyEnzKHbozg,N,3,1
47895,"Didn't get to experience the rooftop this past Saturday because it was closed due to rain. We hung out in the lounge on the first floor, right in front of the wall-to-wall TV screen. I appreciated the atmosphere - candlelit & cozy. We were there having a few drinks before going out for my friend's birthday. I had a cranberry tequila Cosmo (or something like that) & it was ok...Without the sugar rim I probably wouldn't have finished it. Everyone was super nice & helpful, from the hostess to our server. I definitely plan to go back & actually eat something next time.",10/3/2009,dgPo6oOm,Q38vLH-PxvhX0cF6FqONcQ,d6UbRb9W5eA1yL-DuVZ8ug,N,4,1
28539,"My husband and I visited Frontera with some friends on Saturday. We called in advance, and learned from the hostess that they only take reservations for approximately 10% of their restaurant. Since they open at 5, she advised us to arrive at 4:30 and wait in line to be in the first seating. We all had some spare time, so we headed down early to find a parking space and window shop around that area -- I'm glad we did. When we arrived at 4 o'clock, the line was already 15 people long. By 4:30, it was half way down the block, and at 5 PM it wrapped around the block to the next street. All of those people create an excitement, an anticipation for the food, and I guess that is where this restaurant went awry for me. Was the food good? Yes. Was it even close to great? No. Was it worth the hour wait? I wouldn't do it again. We wanted to try a mixture of Rick Bayless' recipes, so we started with a few appetizers. They were out of the Elote I had been hoping for (hadn't they just opened?!?), so we opted for a big bowl of guac (it was ok, nothing special) and the appetizer platter. The appetizer platter had Quesadillas Capitalinas, Jicama Callejera, chicken taquitos and ceviche. The presentation is lovely, and the food was wonderful. We were excited for our meals to arrive, and I ordered a hibiscus daiquiri to pass the time.  I'm allergic to peppers (and eating at a Mexican restaurant, gasp!) but the waiter worked with me to find a dish I could eat, and he was very pleasant about it -- that lone earned them an extra star. We had the Poc Chuc de Puerco (orange marinated pork), 2 Tacos al Carbon (with steak, one spicy one mild), and the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. We ordered a side of the plantains, which were served with cheese and sour cream -- they were excellent! However, not one dish was hot -- all of the food came out luke warm, and the mole was so cold it had to be sent back. Overall, we were underwhelmed with the entrees -- there was nothing special, nothing awful, nothing we passed around to share, and no one really said ""Here, try this!"" like you do with an excellent meal.  The portion sizes were on the medium side, and we had enough room for desert, but nothing really caught our attention, so we ended up calling it a night. Both on our trip into the restaurant and on our exit, it was so crowded we could barely walk. Along with the wait and the so-so food, that was the final straw that made us decide we'd rather eat at the Mexican dive down the street.",7/29/2011,VwgXddtxeCn2PnRsA0LxBw,-gnA4aesGpa4w9YPnWuV9A,XgGUnYs2bjbbNvBefFtWxA,N,5,1

The food was good so I was ready to overlook the service. It just got worse from there. Our waitress disappeared and never returned. After waiting for almost 20 minutes with dirty plates in front of us, I asked another waitress for water, to-go boxes and coffee. They had to make more coffee which took 15 minutes. I had to keep flagging the other waitress and owner down. We ordered the white chocolate cream and berries. What we got was one strawberry, pears, oranges, and mangoes. Those fruits do not go well with chocolate, but of course no one was around to complain to. I asked for the check and 15 minutes later I had to go and find the owner to get the bill. He then had the nerve to request the tip be put on the bill for me. He could of at least offered the dessert or coffees for free, but instead became angry when I refused to include his tip on the bill. What a shame! Never will go to this place again.

7274,"This is where my boyfriend took me on our first date, so maybe I'm a little bit biased, but hey - we've been dating for over 1.5 years now, so I suppose that says something about how great Sapori Trattoria is! I've never had anything on the menu that I thought was sub-par. Everything from the bread to the salads to the entrees and desserts are delicious. You really can't go wrong. The service is excellent and the staff is really knowledgeable when it comes to their menu. They're really helpful when it comes to wine pairing. I would highly recommend going to Sapori Trattoria on a nice summer night because you can sit outside. The trees along the sidewalk are decorated with white Christmas lights, making the ambiance very romantic. Also, at busy times, it gets you out of the crowded dining room. Sapori Trattoria is great for date night or a special occasion with friends and family. It's fancy without breaking the bank (especially if you sign up for their mailing list).

The server spilled oil from a potato dish on my neck and shirt, ruining the shirt. I wiped my neck off at the time but didn't notice that the shirt was so heavily stained until my companions told me so outside the restaurant. When I spoke to the manager on duty (David), he was uniquely rude and condescending. David said that I was hassling him and that the fact that I called him after I left was weird and then he proceeded to hang up the phone on me after attempting to belittle me. As our party had been at Mastro's for a special occasion and had spent a lot of money, I expected a lot more in the way of customer service. David was supremely unhelpful and difficult and I therefore have to rate Masto's very low in spite of their very good steak.

16430,"Let me start by saying I'd have given this a four-star review, but I'm docking India House one full star solely because of price. The food was absolutely delicious. They have a very extensive menu with both northern and southern Indian dishes. The food wasn't overly greasy like many American Indian restaurants are. The spice level in the food was enough to be flavorful and leave your mouth tingling for a few minutes, but not so hot that you couldn't enjoy your food. I think that this place is so expensive because they are paying such high rent to be in River North. I ordered the papdi chat, butter chicken, channa masala and aloo gobi plus and order of naan, and that ran me $66. All of the food was absolutely delicious and they were pretty generous size portions. Another annoyance is that India House doesn't do it's own delivery - they use an outside delivery company that charges $7 for delivery, plus automatic 10% gratuity on orders over $50. Fortunately I live close enough that I was able to go pick it up myself. I'd definitely go back, especially since there aren't too many other good options in this area for Indian food, but it's definitely expensive.",1/8/2012,OUR,xLlyrwQtqGlW5wRKgORvcw,dLS8GPg-K1O-zJ3VJAtiyg,N,3,1

6077,"It's official... I am in love. Twas the night of a birthday celebration and I, yours truly, was the first of a nine person celebration. The hostess, ever so sweet, greeted me, took my name, and I sat at the bar. I took in my surroundings and a glass of a wonderful malbec. The restaurant was different that I remembered. However, I was here when it was under another name. This particular evening I was charmed by the rustic feel, parts of wine crates layering the walls, wine bottles stacked along the walls in the brick arches, interesting light fixtures, and the laid back vibe of the crowd. At 7:30pm on a Monday there were a decent amount of patrons, but by 8:00pm you would have thought that we fast forwarded to the weekend! Where did everyone come from? My friend Bahi K showed up shortly after I did, followed by another friend. Bahi, who had been here before, took the bull by the horns and ordered some starters for us. Focaccia di Recco was offered compliments of the bar staff. It appeared to be your usual flatbread, somewhat benign. I took a bite and then it was all over... To sum it up in one word: LOVE. The buttery goodness melted into my tongue and I gasped. I was captured unexpectedly. My friend ordered several delights: crispy pork belly + apple mostarda, tomato on the vine with fresh mozzarella, and pizza with foraged mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio, and truffle oil. First of the all, the crispy pork belly reminded me of a traditional Filipino delicacy 'cept fancier. Yummy. The tomato with fresh mozzarella was mouthwatering good. And the pizza!?! I normally hate mushrooms, but this was enough to convince me otherwise. All this was just while we were waiting for our table. More of our friends joined us, alcohol started flowing faster, and we were eventually seated in the back at a large table. Bahi ordered more of the same and added: Cacio e pepe (basically spaghetti), Uovo in raviolo 'san domenico' (ravioli), truffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus, and finally, roasted beets + walnut butter + creme fraiche + candied walnuts, and don't forget the unforgettable, roasted squash + farro + whipped goat chees + hazelnuts + watercress. For the record, I LOVED LOVED LOVED every single morsel that entered my mouth. It was like that impossible true love we all seek to find, except in a restaurant. :) The service is awesome, the food an even higher superlative. It was the perfect place to spend a night of indulgence with friends. And unlike more recent love affairs, I know I won'tregret this in the morning.",11/22/2010,--QF4qzucAMvIZdqZ0JKVQ,1HT6nQf5cUt1NEeLoPDcjg,IvdOI86_CSCRFpid2atnyA,N,5,1
58378,"Great bbq. Pricey. Almost worth it.More specifically: delicious bread & butter pickles and potato chips brought to the table with the menus. The potato chips are very crisp and salty. We'll get back to salty in a moment as it's a keynote taste at Q.There's a bit of sticker shock at the prices - about 2x - 3x what I'm used to paying for bbq. The server's introductory speech made reference to raising the standard (or bar or something) by using extra-special ingredients. That these ingredients justify much higher prices was unstated but strongly implied. My wife and I figured we'd order basic items and add others if we were still hungry. We split a lettuce salad. There was enough that we each got a large soup bowl of salad made with fresh greens. I had a pulled pork sandwich and fries. My wife had a half-slab of ribs and cornbread. Those are - for us - the standards by which one judges a bbq restaurant.Pulled pork sandwich: lots and lots of pulled pork on a pretzel bun. Reminiscent of Manny's deli-sized portions of corned beef. There are bowls of spicy bbq sauce, mild sauce, and North Carolina vinegar sauce. The pulled pork was delicious without any sauce. It was, however, very salty, probably from the rub that was applied before smoking. All three of the sauces were excellent on the pork.Half-slab of ribs: meaty, lean ribs. Very tasty - also most likely due to the extra-salty rub. No sauce needed although the sauce didn't hurt anything.Corn bread: Dense, grainy texture, slightly sweet taste. Very good.French fries: Served hot! (I hate it when the fries are luke warm.) But not crisp. Almost undercooked. Limp. With all the attention lavished on the other items it seems as if this were intentional. I can't imagine why. Oh, yeah, and salty.We took home a quarter of the pulled pork sandwich and about three of the ribs. The portions were that large. This morning the scale showed I'd gained 1.7 pounds since yesterday. I'm guessing about 1.5 pounds of it is water from all the salt at dinner.-js-",1/8/2012,GXclAbjmnsGVtkG_ut95yg,eN2wL5WZ1Wp-BD1z6LS36w,euO3-H92LCivH2B0CQPlnw,Y,3,0

The atmosphere is very elegant, dark and cozy, sexy and intimate all at the same time which is surprising for such a big space.The first thing you should know about the menu is that the pricing reflects some of the most inexpensive food you can get in river north these days. The cuisine is rustic, inventive with very fresh notes (homemade pastas, etc) and with the owner's background, I would have not expected anything less quite frankly. The wine list features most of the wines under $30 and both times I dined here, the sommelier recommended a great bottle.Overall, service was friendly and attentive and, if we might have waited a little while at times, the ambience made it up for the wait.In conclusion, I wish I would have some criticism, but really, this looks like the kind of establishment that is going to be around for a long time.",11/7/2011,VEXx8OTNeLa4Rct4EqtFSA,8EZVqhpcLHNGySjPSvstYA,CQ75CQSyrsmb-S3UAwCHpw,Y,4,0

The dining room itself is really cozy, our server was wonderful and the food itself was unbelievable. Out of the 5 courses we had only one minor complaint - the pumpkin soup could have used a wee bit less cinnamon. The main course (braised shortribs) was supremely tender- the meat practically fell off the bone as I was just looking at them. I love the fact that they are BYOB since I am on a budget-plus the corkage fee is really reasonable. ($5 per bottle) The only thing that I think could be improved about the whole restaurant is the website layout, if you've never been to the cafe and try to get an impression off the site its a little amateurish, it honestly was holding me back from visiting the restaurant sooner.

54797,"A hophead living in Chicago for over five years, I finally decided to take a group of friends to Hopleaf for the very first time. The four of us walked in at 6:30 and were seated immediately, which was a pleasant surprise. The draft beer list was good, but certainly not the best I've ever seen. I had a Bell's Two Hearted and my wife, an Allagash White.We skipped appetizers as nothing looked particularly appealing and moved directly to two orders of Mussels for two. Mussels are my latest obsession and these did not disappoint. I will say, however, that the mussels offered at Logan Square's Revolution Brewing we far more fresh and the sauce much more nuanced in flavor. Nonetheless, I ate to my hearts content.By the end of the meal I could sense that the restaurant was getting busy. During a trip to the restroom I caught word of a purported two hour wait. By the time I returned, our service had completely stopped. Our server was within earshot as we all discussed which beer we'd like next but we were never offered a second pour. The message from the wait staff was loud and clear: we'd like you out of here. I can understand that given that kind of wait they want to turn the tables over as quickly as possible, but we were willing to keep ordering and build up the check - what gives? We passed on getting a second drink (I had already tried everything on the draft menu anyway) but decided to get desert - they had some fantastic-sounding options. I had the apple cake and our guests had the mousse. The apple cake was completely unacceptable. Dry layers of bland cake stacked between globs of sour delicata squash and marshmallow-esque cream cheese filling with burnt brittle served on the side. If they weren't so busy, I may have sent it back.Overall: a good experience, good ambiance, but please: if your wait time is any longer than 30 minutes, it's time you leave the north side and find a better less-hyped restaurant.",4/11/2007,ZhePRFzQ0RHRQizNbSNXDw,2LheG0IvdtXflu4-1wNCXw,tCkwBTuEFvhuaBoEUWqbuQ,Y,5,0

We were enjoying ourselves and can honestly say Mike rolled with the punches and never missed a beat. This was not our first time dining at Wildfire, so we knew to expect a delicious and well prepared meal. The Appetizers were delicious. The Prime Rib, Filet Mignon trio, and Brown sugar glazed Salmon were done perfectly. One of my friends who does not even eat fish tried the Salmon and commented that it was excellent. Desert was decadent and a chocoholics dream.

48669,"The food is just eh. The raw dishes and vegetables - arugula salad, oysters, fish crudo, grilled cauliflower, etc were all good, but frankly with fresh produce, those are dishes hard to miss. The entrees we got were well below par - the whole fish and the country ribs lacked any considerable flavor, while the duck breast was poorly conceived with the smoke flavor taking over the delicate duck flavor. Far from impressive, but worth considering a re-do if the service warranted it. The service though, absolutely awful. Our server was inattentive and seemed to go missing for 30 minutes at a time. He failed to mention another bottle of wine would be substituted (ours was out of stock) until after it was delivered, not giving us much of a choice in a re-order. We also ordered the whole fish entree, and not only did he come by 10 minutes AFTER the dish to fillet it (as we were sitting there hungrily staring at it), he completely botched it to the point of almost being inedible with bones everywhere. I know how to fillet both raw and cooked fish, he had no clue! With a dish like that, flavor and execution are equally critical to ensuring the diners have a well served menu item. For beers and some apps after work, maybe on the company dime. But for a delicious Saturday dinner out, there are much better places for better food within the same concept (Girl and the Goat, The Bristol, etc).",1/28/2010,21Vl5DzicRnFaLeuDnLBlg,aAlmlLWv8lPxr0Ndt8tZEQ,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg,N,5,1

43716,"Next week is going to suck! See, this week I really spoiled myself with two excellent prix fixe dinners. A few days after popping my Restaurant Week cherry, I ventured to Kinzie Chophouse to dine with some Yelp girlfriends. Kinzie is featuring their Winter Delights prix fixe special, which runs until March 19th. $20 gets you a choice of 2 salads, a choice of 4 entrees and a choice of 3 desserts. For my meal I went with the Chophouse salad, herb-crusted salmon, and chocolate cake. The salad was fine, a simple mixed green salad with a balsamic dressing. My entree was a generous serving of salmon over mustard sauce with a side of broccoli. The salmon was well prepared; it was both flavorful and moist. My only complaint about my entree is that I wish the mustard sauce had more kick, I found it to err on the bland side. To cap off my meal I went with the chocolate cake, it was so good! The cake was warm, with a soft, gooey center and chocolate sauce drizzled over the top. My plate was garnished with some whipped cream and strawberries too. I'd seriously consider paying $20 for this alone; if I could get a larger portion of course. Service was attentive and friendly. Our waiter was always there when we needed him, but not in a hovering sort of way. Refills on waters and beverages were also taken care of promptly. I loved that our server subtotaled our meals on the check so we had to do minimal math to figure out what each of us owed, it was a nice touch. At the end of our meal a member of the staff (possibly a manager) checked in to see how our meal was. My only complaint was with regard to layout. We were seated in the south room (the first one you see when walking in) and the tables are very close together and very small. Our 4-person table really would have been optimal for 2. I was afraid if I scooted my chair in further I'd knock knees with the person across from me, and I'm not exceptionally tall. Winter Delights is a fantastic deal, you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck.

10120,"Rating Piccolo Sogno's indoor and outdoor dining areas simultaneously is a big misunderstanding. Could they be any MORE different from one another? The outdoor dining area is too dreamy. It reminds me of home... Europe. A big, beautiful tree is the centerpiece of the spacious patio. The exposed brick wall complements the natural color palette. Little lights are placed tastefully throughout this green space. Ivy crawls on the wooden fence. A true escape from urban madness. A place to rest the senses... Oh and did I mention that the food is great? The indoor dining area on the other hand is a rude awakening. So disappointing. A complete departure from the magical, romantic, natural environment of the patio. The color selection, light fixtures, seating arrangement, modern and rather cold furniture, new bar and awkward bar dining area... why? why? why? Piccolo Sogno: You're hurting my soul! I know that this is a restaurant, and maybe it would be better for me to focus on the food (which was delicious by the way) - but after eating here 3 times... this is the thought that resonates most. ps. My family threw our post nup party here in August for a little over 100 guests, and we worked with the owners and staff here closely to make sure everything was perfect. We had food and drink stations. Chef Tony Priolo and the restaurant's manager were both there throughout the night to make sure everything went smoothly. And it did! I have to say that we were more than pleased with the customer care, input, and service - The staff was always present and attentive, but subtle enough that we felt we created a very intimate atmosphere. I highly recommend Piccolo Sogno for private events. If I had gotten married in Chicago, I would have probably chosen this outdoor venue for our small reception.

40855,"Bear with me. This is going to be a long review, but there was simply no way to keep it short without missing key elements. Wow. Just WOW! My good friend is a huge PITA when it comes to food, but in her defense, she lives in the suburbs, so when she and her husband come downtown for dinner, she wants to make sure she's getting a quality dining experience. I can't really blame her for that. Bonsoire had been on her list for awhile, and me? Well, to be honest, it wasn't on mine, but I'm always game to try something new, especially a place that has such rave reviews. She made the reservation for the March Underground about 4 weeks ago and she was really excited about it. She forwarded me the menu and told me to look it over and advise them of any dislikes or food allergies. The menu looked fantastic, and the only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the scallop course. My friend conveyed this to them, and they said they'd substitute something else for the scallops. This past Saturday evening was our reservation. My friend and I arrived and joined my friend and her husband, already deep into wine. We got comfortable, poured wine and waited for the magic to happen. And magic it was. A feast for every sense. First course: Fried Mozzarella, Charred Haricot Vert Salad with Japanese Eggplant, Aged Balsamic, and Plum Tomato Sorbet. What a well-executed starter. The mozzarella was crispy and the haricot verts were a great accompaniment. The real scene stealer, though, was that plum tomato sorbet. It packed quite a flavor punch. Second course: Pumpernickel Crusted Lamb Loin, Buttermilk Blini, Maple-Karashi Butter This was a perfectly cooked piece of lamb - not an easy feat. It melted in your mouth. And the blini was like a little tangy pancake and an ideal foil to the lamb. Third course: Artichoke Vichyssoise with a Bacon-White Anchovy Dumpling and Preserved Lemon Imagine if you will, the most luscious thing you can put in your mouth. OMG, I love artichokes and this was the most intensely flavored soup I've ever tasted. The dumpling was a tad fishy, but only because I am not an anchovy fan. It was not overwhelming, but you could definitely taste it, which is the point I suppose. I think everyone at the table would have licked the bowl clean had we been less well-mannered. Fourth course: Seared Suzuki (Japanese Sea Bass) and Grilled Barramundi with Gnocchi and Crispy Mushrooms This was the substitute for the Twice Baked Scallops that I opted out of. Definitely my favorite course of the evening. Everyone at the table gave me grief for passing on the scallops...until they saw what was laid in front of me. Both fish were cooked perfectly. Garnishes included crispy mushrooms and gnocchi. I had never had, nor heard of suzuki before, and I am not a huge fish eater, but this was some of the best fish I have ever had. Everyone at the table tried it and agreed, and wished they had gotten the same thing. Not that their scallops weren't great, it's just that this dish blew everyone away. Fifth Course: Tiny Bites of Foie Gras Cheesecake I was skeptical and apprehensive too. Organ meat in cheesecake? As the server explained, it was meant to be a bridge between the savory courses and dessert. It absolutely nailed it. Very rich, but they were only three small bites. It was absolutely both sweet and savory, and while you couldn't particularly discern the foie gras, you knew there was something in the cheesecake that wouldn't normally be there. Sixth Course: The grand finale. Dessert. I knew the closing course would set the bar high and indeed it did. Pumpkin and sesame seed ice cream with golden raisin caramel sauce, and ancho chile truffles. The heat of the ancho chiles played off the creaminess of the ice cream and the sweetness of the caramel sauce. The service was stellar too. Our server kept our wine glasses full, cracked jokes, explained every course in detail, and wasn't intrusive. All servers should take a cue. I just wish I could remember her name. She dialed a great evening up a notch. We all agreed it was a fantastic dining experience, and it was truly, an EXPERIENCE. At $85/pp, I am not likely to make this a habit, but that will only heighten my anticipation and pleasure in returning. Bonsoire is truly a destination restaurant that any lover of good food should try at least once.",3/21/2008,5gf2xU08AYYunCc0Pa5B3g,CdJ1M_EJhcdG4Cul6Tc62w,28gamO9SwWMHxwB0nP_plQ,N,5,1

15665,"No sign. A wooden plank for a door and thick velvet curtains separating the people waiting patiently to enter from the patrons inside the lounge. The place makes itself feel more exclusive than it have to but I guess it's all part of the appeal right? The set up in the lounge is excellent. When you first walk in, you see little pods of seats with high backs that allow couples all the privacy they want (or they would like to think). There is quite a bit of PDA going on in there but it works for some reason. I don't get grossed out, which is good. Lights low and music not too loud. Servers tend to you just the right amount. Great spot to catch up with friends! There are booths in the middle section for larger groups.  To the drinks - extensive menu which I like. I don't always chat up the bartender but from I've learned, Violet hour tries to support midwest breweries. There were a couple pretty good Michigan brews I've tried. I'm bad with remembering beer names so it helps that the waitor/bartender has no problem helping me select one. Haven't been disappointed yet  One gripe I have is that the last time I was there before I entered the lounge, I was asked by TWO not one but TWO ppl whether we have a friend joining us. I gave them her name. My friend doesn't show up at our table until 20 minutes later. We realize she was held up in the front for most of that time. The bouncer kept telling her there wasn't a group in the lounge waiting for her. They were apologetic but still, don't ask if you won't do it. Miscommunication? Maybe. I'll still give them 4 stars.",4/6/2011,-MgyKFDv7WZKQZNeNb,S8KXGZo4JHOXrOEK3vemZQ,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,4,1

Eating in is always great, as the atmosphere is fun, Italian-ish, has a bar, personable waiters/waitresses, and just all-around a good time to be had.The food is spectacular. It is the best deep-dish (or otherwise) pizza I have had in this city so far. I have had Giordano's, Connies, Uno's, etc, and Giordano's wins hands down by far. It is even great delivered, if not better. I had Giordano's, in fact, twice this week with friends from out of town, and the better of the two (if I can even compare them) was the delivered pizza, I think. It may have had to do with the temperature of the pizza, but I'm not sure.In summa: great pizza, great atmosphere, great service. The only downside is, sometimes, the wait be a bit long.

58326,"The seafood crab combination dinner we had for 2 was good, not great. Bad judgmental service is what this is about. Might have been luck of the draw, and maybe the other servers are nicer. And maybe you'd have a better experience if you plan ahead to make reservations. Either way I don't appreciate judgmental service though. My bf and I sat in the bar table area since we did not have reservations. The waiter was initially average. I am not a very high maintenance person, so usually even average service will buy you a good tip. We don't drink, so just asked for water. The table next to us immediately ordered a number of drinks and appetizers. We could hear a totally different tone of the waiter with this couple. He returns to ask if want an appetizer, which we tell him to give us more time to look at the menu. He seems slightly eh and just walks away. Meanwhile still completely different tone to us versus table next to us. He returns for our order, which we order $100 worth of food. He immediate jokes with us a bit and his tone becomes more pleasant. He was fairly pleasant at the end before our check, when he packaged our desert because we were too full. At the end of the night I handed him one of the Let Us entertain you scratch coupons for $15. Immediately his tone changes to being rather rude. He assumed I was going to stiff him I suppose, since I was using a coupon. He doesn't say much more to us and is rather cold. After I sign my credit card receipt, immediately he leads two ladies over to our table and hovers over our table before we even gather our belongings to push us out. He does not offer a thank you, have a good evening, but purely only addresses the ladies he's trying to push into our table. I am apalled by the way I was treated purely based on his judgement of me. I do not only eat at nice restaurants when I have a coupon, but if I have one, I have no shame in using it. I do not believe I am too good for it or low class if I use one. I have been to plenty of nice restaurants and have not been treated so rudely. I usually tip 20% and if i use any form of a coupon its prediscount that I tip. It was even hard leaving the guy 15%, which I still did because that was still lower than I even normally tip. Bottom line is I don't understand nice restaurants putting out a coupon if they assume people are suppose to be too good for them And that anyone who uses them is going to stiff their server and never come back anyways. Why even put a coupon out. Also it bothers me that the way our system is set, encourages servers to gauge you to determine their level of service. If they assume you fit a stereotype that will not tip well, they are absolutely different to you. I have been treated so much better at many other expensive restaurants.",7/17/2011,TLYEZjEq33Dl6D1CSQknXA,LthpZdRIuyiAesVYHrC-CQ,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA,Y,1,0

29307,"My two cents. Great for a date or say that last minute meal you need to help soak up all the drinking you've done after hitting up Mai fest or Oktoberfest in Lincoln Square. Thursday nights are opportune for bumping into a table full of attractive ladies, FYI. Check out Opart's photos and you should love their atmosphere and dcor. There aren't many Asian restaurants (in or around the city) with as much dcor from the motherland, so when you do come across it, it's memorable. The atmosphere feels warm and furniture is comfortable for the longer dinners with ample conversation.  I want to love this place because of their expansive menu and numerous options of soups and appetizers. If there is an appetizer menu at a restaurant, I typically want to order many; I like having many small plates of things to try. So, the fact that they offer their appetizer plate with servings for four for $8.99 is sweet!  However there are a few details to this place that are lacking.  Service and their attitude are lacking. No helpfulness is seen and I've never yet had an amazing experience with a waiter or waitress. Asian menus tend to only list what's in an entre, but neglects to depict to its reader the taste associated.  When I try varieties of Ethnic food, I like to try different items and try to stay away from ordering the same old shit. Everyone orders pad Thai, basil chicken, panang curries, lard nar, etc. It's when you branch out you discover other entrees or appy's that are taste worthy. For this feat; help is needed and that is missing. Try asking for a recommendation and get either no result because they are uncertain of your tastes or if you're lucky they might recommend one of the typical dishes I've listed above. Ask about a curry or what's the difference between yellow, red, green, or brown sauce and, well, I'm still trying to process the answers I've received.  If management is reading, a picture menu would be awesome. If you see a bunch of tables with a fancy looking metal bowl with soup within, don't order it! We followed other tables and got some kind of Thai hot and sour soup with chicken and it was terrible. Too much lemon grass and lime juice and to top it off it contained a crotch full of cilantro. I like cilantro, but that was horrid.  Again if waiters spent less time trying to impress us with their sashaying down the runway and more time listening and paying attention. I think the overall could be hella better. Solid three and a half stars in my book.",8/5/2009,8ZC7Casn2EKvZzl0pXy3,aFuSGYtq1ygh9W2XA2QdQg,XgGUnYs2bjbbNvBefFtWxA,N,5,1

The place was buzzing--always a good sign late on Sunday evening--and as a result they were ""running 10-15min behind"". No problem--10-15min is a wash--but by the time we got seated it was almost 10pm. Kitchen was winding down so it was 10:30+ before food arrived.Orechiette were nicely al dente but the lamb sausage was lukewarm and very oily.

58186,"I visted Alinea this past Friday night. I am torn about what to write for this review. Overall I enjoyed the experience, and I thought some of the dishes were absolutely hands down the most innovative food I have ever seen or tasted but I didn't leave there feeling completely blown away. Now, the only experience I have to compare is our visit to Per Se. While the techniques and presentation of these chefs could not be more different, I do think it's fair to compare and contrast ingredients used, atmosphere and service. I did the vegetarian menu and my husband did the standard tour. It was fascinating to see the Alinea's chef be able to play with each dish and make them aesthetically identical. His presentation was incredibly whimsical. However, for the price, which is $195 plus tax and gratuity, (which ends up being almost the same price at Per Se,) I didn't feel as if I got the same satisfaction out of the vegetarian menu as I did at Per Se. I feel that they should lower their price point for that menu. The standard tour, I unfortunately felt the same. No frois gras, lobster, caviar, sweet breads, or similarly rare and or pricier fishes or meats. With that said, the dishes were executed to perfection and everything tasted delicious with the exception of a consomm and custards that were simply over salted. The other thing that struck me, at Per Se there were SO many extra little courses and touches that weren't on the menu. An amuse, amazingly delicious bread course, pallet cleansers, cheeses, extra dessert courses, and a goodie bag of treats for each guest when you received your check. There were NO extra's here...not even a single piece of bread. Now, the atmosphere I found to be strange. I believe it's attempt was to be minimalistic, but it came off as very cold, and certainly, if I just ended up there without knowing anything about the place, I would never in a million years guess this was one of the world's top eating establishments. Now on to the staff....where to begin....I always try and remind myself that when I leave NYC, I can't expect the same type of white glove service at high end restaurants. But, when you are paying over $200/person, all bets are off. Your staff, from the top down, should be professional, knowledgeable, and they should be an intricate part of the diner's experience. A place like Alinea and Per Se, isn't just about eating dinner, it's about having a food experience. We sat at 5:45 and you could hear a pin drop in our part of the dining room, that is, with the exception of the four staff members that stood in the corner watching us eat, and seemingly talking to each other about their guests. So for the first hour of our dinner, it was quite uncomfortable to only hear the chatter of the restaurant staff as well as having them stare at you while you eat. I don't think I have ever quite experienced that. The sommelier was horrific. We wanted to stay within the lower price range of their bottle list $50-$100 - he offered us no help once he realized he wasn't going to be able to sell us what he viewed as expensive bottles of wine. It was truly offensive. Because we love wine so much, I recall our experience with the sommelier at Per Se to be amusing and so enjoyable. He had a wonderful sense of humor; he brought us tastings and without even having to ask, pointed us to many different price rangers of bottles based on our flavor pallet. We never had to say what we wanted to spend after we ordered the first bottle, because he got it, he understood what price point we were going to be in and or around for that evening. The sommelier at Alinea's response to us when we asked him what he thought we should get after giving him a brief description of what we liked was Well...I don't really know, it just depends on what you like. What kind of response is that from a sommelier?? We were so taken aback and quite frankly that could have ruined our experience except for the fact that we know our wines and in all honesty didn't need his help. The food runners were all fantastic and one of the captains on the floor who was a short red headed young woman was fantastic as well. But again, not one staff member had the polish or the expertise that I feel is essential to working at an establishment that has received the kind of notoriety Alinea has. All in all, I don't regret going, it was such a unique and memorable food experience. Def go if you have the money to spend, but if you are looking for a meal that will leave you wanting to come back for more, my money is best spent at places run by Chef's like Thomas Keller, Daniel Bolud, Eric Ripert. After eating at Alinea, I confess, like my wine, I much prefer the old world rather than the new. But I wish this place all the luck and if he can bring his service up to par with the quality of his cooking, it will be around for a long time.",7/19/2011,8fDuwp6K0kRSTwrWL0RgHg,4e9NRCSwmxha1tp3rAsO7w,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,Y,3,0

53166,"I had a hard time figuring out where to start with this review, because I really enjoy the food at 90 Miles but there are a few things worth noting that keep this restaurant from being a 4 or 5 star establishment. I would say that their failures are in running a restaurant and not in making food.  My wife and I went for lunch and, having been to their other location, had an idea of what we were going to have. We sat in their enclosed outdoor seating area, which was stiflingly hot. The seating area was mostly empty and a huge table had been set up where a woman, I'm assuming a manager or owner, had a small photo studio set up and was taking pictures of their menu items which were coming out of the kitchen. This really wasn't that big of a deal, but being a previous owner of a restaurant I know that there are plenty of ways to get work like that done without having it near your customers. We were greeted by our server, who asked if we had been there before (and we said yes) and we placed our order. I ordered the Bistec Sandwich and a Tamal... the server told us about their ""flavored"" iced teas and I said I would like just unsweetened ice tea tea, if they had it. The server said ""I'd have to brew some and then chill it"", with a look of discontent on his face. I said ""OK, that sounds fine thank you"". In the world of service you either ""have"" something or do not... if you have it, I don't need to feel that I am putting you out by ordering it. Just bad practice. My wife, feeling guilty I think, ordered their mango iced tea which was an over-sweet mess. My wife ordered the Cubano sandwich (which was the reason she wanted to go there), upon ordering the server said ""have you ever had the Media-Noche? It's like the Cubano but on a sweeter bread""... Now I give him credit for trying to talk her into trying something different from the menu... but usually you do this to people who are regulars or have never been there before. It was just annoying. So now comes the real cluster-f__K. This is the order in which our food arrived: 1st. The Cuban Sandwich, 2nd the Tamal and Mango Iced Tea, 3rd. The Bistec Sandwich and then 4th and finally the unsweetened iced tea (Earl Grey, nice touch - they should just make some and put it on the menu, I can't be the first customer to ask for iced tea). Why they couldn't bring everything at the same time is beyond me... and why our drinks didn't arrive before our food is something else that puzzles me. Our server was assisted by another person... apparently it takes two people to incorrectly serve two sandwiches, a tamal and 2 drinks... it just seemed like they had never served food in their lives. Then, as we ate our server did the ultimate ""slow"" restaurant mistake of 'hovering'. standing in the hall between the outdoor seating area and the kitchen door and watching us eat... all this with the manager/owner sitting right there (of course she was too busy playing with her digital camera to be bothered to manage the restaurant). Now... the food was quite good. I would say the only failures would be that the mango iced tea was indifferently made slop (one of those ideas you have in a menu enhancement brainstorm that should stay on the flip chart - either that or they just threw mango, iced tea and some simple syrup into a glass and put it on the menu before tasting it or trying to figure out how to make it perfect). The other failure was the chimmichurri sauce, which was not good at all... in fact it just plain sucked. Now I know there are hundreds of variations on chimmichurri, and this may be a Cuban variation but its just not good. Usually it contains cilantro, parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt and crushed red pepper flakes... their chimmichurri was mostly onion and lacked any real flavor. The sandwiches were quite good (good bread is the key to a good sandwich and they seemed to get that) and the plantain chips were thin and crisp and seasoned perfectly with salt. The tamal was quite good garnished with a perfect amount of sliced raw onion... I just wished that the menu (or our server) said what was in it. I mean it didn't matter, we eat everything, but I am not the biggest fan of surprises in dining that I'm not expecting. All this for $25.00... I don't know I felt a little ripped off. i mean I don't care about price when the restaurant delivers a great experience... but this was average at best. Overall, I gave them 3 stars because I enjoyed the food and I would return. Its not a 5 star restaurant, but could be a 4 star if they would get their act together a little. Maybe take-out is a better way to go... or maybe when they are busy the ship runs a little more smooth. I don't know... but it is a good place with a lot of potential to be a great place.",2/5/2011,D5,-16CIQ7yQkzV9fPn7rjd_A,mCHto10PBQOKnefm7gholg,N,3,1

58465,"The Gage is in my top ten in Chicago. The management is exceptional, actually worked with Terry in 1986 @ Bistro 110, so clearly he has vast experience. Dave has been an executive chef for literal decades, again he has real experience to run the front of the house. The menu is fantastic, the servers right on. Kid-friendly? Not so much, but my 3 year old survived the experience!!Unfortunately, Open Table is not quite fine-tuned! Changed my reservation from 4 to 5 people, never noted. The Gage rocked the discrepancy, we had the best table in the house!!Apparently once upon a time!!To the General Manager!!I thought it was crititcal that I drop you a note after your complete dismissal of me lastnight! Whilst I understand you are incredibly busy, now that you are the General Manager of two restaurants, it could not have occurred to me that you have become more important than the customer. The simple need to speak with you after being cut-off lastnight, might have earned you the judgement to realize that yes we had so imbibed, but we were certainly coherent enough to have one last drink!!It's interesting when placed in the middle of a confrontation, as I was, that to close my eyes after an incredibly hectic day (as most of my days are), it so be determined to be over-served. It is my guilty pleasure to introduce friends and clients to The Gage, it far exceeds my budget or boundaries of leaving my neighborhood. But I do understand that you have to place implicit trust in your host or maybe incredibly inexperienced manager to make judgement calls to so preserve the reputation of The Gage, the establishment.Lastly, whilst our server was brillant, she took $120.00 cash, of which I told her she should take a 20% tip and place the rest on the balance, then apply balance of bill to my friends' credit card. She took all of the cash and charged my friend the full check amount of $215.00, we were both incredibly displeased. I'm a little fuzzy on how and when that is even remotely acceptable when perceived impairment is involved, but will assume might be standard practice?That being said, thanks for the appetizers, you're a gem! However, I would not consider to patronize The Gage again, due to the blatant disprespect that I received from you last night. How unfortunate that you are so saddled that you cannot consider a customer, let alone an old friend!Happy Holidays Big Guy!!M",7/14/2007,eeaLf_tDv9seBJqdeS3KfA,oODVOwKwUHZ3GcrkDzvOgg,vvhfPV-Llkd4fE2SHuLVvA,Y,5,0

48640,"As a huge fan of both Avec and Blackbird, I had been looking forward to the (over-hyped) opening of this place for several months, but I gotta say I was a bit disappointed. It specializes in beer, oysters, and pork, and since I'm not a fan of oysters or beer, I can only comment on the pork. While nothing we tried was bad, nothing was really amazing either; the flavors were very one note, without the complexity you'd find at either of their two sister restaurants. We tried the steak tartare (the best of the bunch with perfectly cooked frites and a side of pickles; a fairly traditional preparation with a raw quail egg on top; raw egg + raw beef = yum; no, really); the potted rillettes (basically pulled pork that you spread on toast points; EXTREMELY salty -- which I liked -- but my partner found off-putting); the whitefish fry (good, but lacking in fish; again, EXTREMELY salty; brine, perhaps?); and the blood sausage (average; came with giardinera which were more of a sweet pickled variety, than the typical spicy kind) The service was good, even if our waiter was a little snarky. The manager (owner?) came by and asked how everything was, which was nice, but we couldn't help noticing that his pants at the bottom were showing about three inches of leg (Hey, when's the flood?!). As for the decor (supposedly German beer hall chic), I was also disappointed. I'm guessing they spent some money on this place, but it doesn't look it. The lighting is full of these hanging globes which are in every bad Lakeview studio apartment. They covered the ceiling in textured wallpaper, but it resembles a bad popcorn ceiling--not the look I'm sure they were going for. The bathrooms, however, are cool and worth checking out.  Also, enough already with the damn communal tables!!! I know it's trendy, but I don't want to sit next to strangers.

It's blah, with 1,000 black olives, 1 slice of a Roma tomato, and 1 tablespoon of shredded carrots. The creamy garlic dressing tasted like sour cream with garlic powder mixed in. We should've split the fried zucchini. :( Oh well, lesson learned. I'm not sure why people refer to this as deep dish - it's not. It's pan pizza, it even says so on their menu.

58181,"The occasion: our 10-year anniversary. The destination: the one, the only, the legendary Alinea. The company: our friends, first-rate foodies who were looking for the right excuse.We were shown to a nice table surrounded by four comfortable chairs. As soon as we sat, a cartoon-like time-shift occurred: we slowed down while the staff around us went into a frenzy. They simply had no time. While I was in mid-sentence, they stepped in, placed a dish, explained the dish, and disappeared. All within a blink of an eye. We were left dumb-founded. Where did these dishes come from? What were the secret ingredients? How were they used? So many questions unanswered.The process repeated again and again. Dishes presented in haste. Explanations mumbled. Wine, seemingly unrelated to the food, was poured with little to no explanation. We never found out what two of the ten wines were. We tried. We really tried. We tried asking about the food. We tried asking about the wine. For our efforts we were rewarded with an additional five seconds of incoherent mumbling. My request to tell us more about the unusual caponata on my plate was answered: the eggplant is not pureed.Much of the magic was gone. The conversation centered on all but the food. Ah, the food. Yes, I almost forgot the food. Twenty-courses ranging from the absolutely divine to the downright mediocre were placed in front of us, in a rapid 5-hour succession. From the heights of the razor-clam to the lows of the single oyster leaf. From a white-truffled risotto a notch above perfection, to a truffled pasta a notch below. From the sea urchin the likes of which I've never had to the cold borscht that plagued the meals of my childhood. 'Inconsistent' would be the perfect word to describe our dining experience. Presentation won at the expense of taste. Dishes such as the squab were left for us to interpret and construct without the guiding wisdom of our host chef. The last desert, the dark chocolate, for all its pomposity was a meaningless collection of random tastes. We all agreed it simply did not work. The king is naked.Imagine a scale where price and hedonism battle for gravity's reach. We came looking for the ultimate decadent dining experience. We knew that the sum paid would be beyond the realms of logic and justification - Alinea complied. But the scales wouldn't balance. The hedonistic animal within us left unsatiated and ashamed. The food didn't reach the glorious promised peaks; the service didn't break the surface of polite friendliness; curiosity was not satisfied.

One thing worth mentioning -- the hot sauce from the roasted sucking pig tostada almost put me in the hospital...I LOVE hot sauce, and have never had an issue before, but I was seriously having complications.

53662,"I ate at Schwa when it first opened, once after he re-opened the restaurant after Chef Carlson's sudden close of Schwa and recently during last thanksgiving week. In summary, I think it has gone down severely in terms of food and service. When it first opened it I thought it was some of the most innovative food with flavors and preparation that were nothing short of mind-blowing good. It reminded me of Mugaritz with its bold and intelligent flavors and food combinations.After Carlson shut down and re-opened, I had another fantastic meal which was actually better than our meal at Alinea which we ate at the following evening. I have eaten at Alinea at least a half-dozen times and always thought Carlson was or could be in the same league as Grant in terms of sheer cooking talent and his deep understanding of flavors. In addition, the small atmosphere and unconventional setting at Schwa was always more to my liking than a 'big statement' restaurant.However, my last experience dining at Schwa was awful. The food preparation and presentation was sloppy at best and most of the dishes simply did not work compared to our past dining experiences. Although there was some interesting ideas, most of the dishes were clearly not refined yet and there were large inconsistencies on the same dish between each of the 4 diners at our table.The service was beyond awful. When we asked if one of the ingredients in one of dishes of the 9 course tasting menu could be substituted because someone in our party was allergic to it, our server laughed in our face and rudely say 'no fucking way'.  That sort of set our expectations for the rest of the evening. It then became quite apparent that our server, a rather larger person, BO was overpowering the food. In addition, he rarely told us what each dish was and if we dared to ask, he seemed annoyed. Although Chef Carlson did greet me when we first walked in, he was busy serving other 'local' diners who were obviously getting extra dishes and much more personal service.The quirkiness of Schwa is one of the things I did love about the restaurant and although consistency was never a term that you would attribute to Carlson, I think the restaurant has gone down in terms of service and especially the food and we will unfortunately have to skip it for a while until I hear if things have improved. The good news is that there are quite a few other great places to dine when visiting the Chicago area.",6/4/2010,RGFJuX2sVokVC61Pp7BPCw,79JWx6FTfWk6YzEI25i13Q,bNXpwTSavHBV9zBk2lUlGA,Y,5,0
44288,"This is truly my favorite sushi spot in Chicago. The fish is fresh and the prices are reasonable. Why I love it so much is that it is always consistent. Whether I am dining out or ordering in it always tastes great. When dining in the atmosphere is ""trendy"" (I really hate using this term) without being pretentious. For example, I took my mom here tonight and she loved it. She didn't feel out of place at all. I think it is a place for everyone. When ordering in (same with Ping Pong), I feel like Martha Stewart has packed up my order. Everything is so neat and tidy and in the cutest containers. I know it's nerdy, but the littlest things go a long way. Hands down my go to sushi restaurant.",11/3/2006,RCJKXXNqxfNmH,qjkOmSEFFEeWVTtsIl0aAw,xjZ9eqYrzMrl2v6_1Kv6hA,N,5,1

13922,"My husband and I went here for breakfast in April and we were pretty unimpressed. My husband's cajun burger came with a mayo sauce that wasn't listed in the description of the dish, and since he doesn't eat mayo, he had to send it back to be re-made without the surprise ingredient. It took forever to turn the order back around, so I was done with my meal by the time his reemerged. Coffee mugs were filled once and then sat empty for the remainder of the meal. As a capper on the experience, when we finally got the bill, we'd been charged for both hamburgers, so we had to wait while the server corrected the error. The whole meal took way too long, and for the price, was pretty disappointing. I wasn't even all that taken with the much hyped potato pancakes.",5/8/2009,UoHvLbv9J,IdZ8fS8TAr6YhKiiREjkOQ,50gFzdVglOz88eFJ6v-26A,N,2,1
19163,"Sorry Rick Bayless... Not impressed. I was dying to try this place after several foodie/non-foodie friends recommended it, and with the Rick Bayless name behind it there was no question that I had to go. I've been a Rick Bayless fan since I was a kid watching One Plate at a Time on Channel 11 so I was really looking forward to this visit. To my dismay, the experience and food quality was just NOT up to par. After working at one of the city's River North hot spots, I understand what it is like trying to seat your tables with what is open so I was not surprised about the 20 minute wait for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. As we were waiting for our table, the host kept asking us to move down closer to the register which made it really awkward for those that were ordering to go with us breathing down their necks behind them. Once we were finally told to order, we went to the assigned table number to find that we were sharing the table with a couple who was already in the middle of their meal. This is something that normally wouldn't bother me (again from formerly hostessing at a restaurant using the same seating practice), but the fact that there was an empty table for 4 right next to us which never got sat throughout our meal is disappointing. To start we ordered chips and guac. It was overall pretty tasty, but there was a little too much lime to my taste. Then our tortas come out, we ordered the chicken, short rib and chorizo: Presentation - not appealing. For the price of this sandwich, I expected better presentation instead of it cut in half sitting in a basket over a piece of parchment paper. And for functionality it was difficult to eat from, plain and simple. Taste - pretty bland, and not the best quality which is what set me off! At a place with this kind of prestige I expected good cuts of meat, yet the chicken was very fatty and chewy (made me want to gag, chicken fat is not the good kind...) Besides the fat it just wasn't very flavorful... we didn't even touch the other half of this torta. My short rib was really tough and dry, and the chorizo was a little too greasy. With the short rib there was pickled jalepeno on it, so I was expecting a little heat and spicyness but there wasn't any of that. Disappointing yet again. Bread could have been good. For how chewy it was the toasted top part got too hard as it cooled and scratched our mouths a little more than preferred when eating this type of bread. For all the hype I had high expectations. I understand that Xoco is trying to bring Mexican fare alive in a new way, but for the prices you pay you can do much better than Xoco with the quality of food presented to you and experience. The only positive thing I can say is that I was full after this meal. Not impressed.",3/23/2012,3LIt5CAfLQc2jKWMPFdq3Q,Fx7oW4F18YgFqoGxBZQHdg,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,N,2,1
5241,"This is a great spot, I only wish I wasn't traveling by myself when I came here. Luckily there's a bar area so it's pretty easy to eat on your own, but the menu is a lot of small plates so coming in a group would be a lot better. There is pretty good seating for groups too - high-top tables for 6-8 people. Everything sounded good, but I just went with the prosciutto balls to start (which were good, but not amazing) and the turkey leg, which was really good. I love lentils and that was the side for the turkey leg, but it wasn't really what I was expecting -- just a few lentils and they seemed until cooked - they were sort of scattered along the leg, not an actual side of lentils. There was a good selection of wines, but I felt like the prices of many were steep, $14+. I had one for $9 and it was pretty good. The service was fast in the beginning, and the food came really fast, but the waitress sort of disappeared at the end and had to track her down.

But the reason I'm a regular here has to do with what makes this place unique: it is the rare place where you can go to chill, read, get a great cup of coffee as well as a drink (they have a fully stocked bar) in a great atmosphere.

I started with Hansenn's kriek (a cherry beer).  Hansenn's is a traditional farmhouse brewery, still brewing beer in open fermenters that are infected by wild yeasts in the air, creating a sour brew. Hansenn's is especially good because they don't add sugar at the end of the brewing process, so the kriek was very tart, virtually uncarbonated, with a nice sour cherry palate. It was better and much drier than the sparkling wine my drinking partner had. $12 for a rare beer that most Americans would spit out and flush down the toilet! I LOVE this place! Next was the Tripel Karmeliet, a more standard Belgian golden ale served on draft in a goblet. Wonderful, strong stuff, but it's served too cold for my taste - the aromatics that Belgian malt-driven beers are known for can't come out properly. Again, this is very unusual stuff to find in a bar, on draft, and it's why I come here. The Tripel Karmeliet was only $7. Curiously, the bartenders were not mean, cold, and unapproachable as they often are here. It was packed and noisy downstairs, but we bought our drinks and went upstairs - full, too, but we sat on the windowsill seating.",9/11/2009,dB6tWHpN7SbMrFxXEB3KaA,2K_-DFpCQAJVrl-eO-zkVA,sR4EOfPuI-at41uIxIZPhw,N,5,1

8118,"Holy meat lover's fortune. Unapologetic carnivores like me will die happy at Fogo. The house special (Picanha) must be among the most tender morsels of steak I have ever had, perfectly seasoned with just a slight bite of sea salt. The pork sausage (linguica) and roast leg of lamb were major highlights, both juicy and perfectly game-y. Also, I am not a salad bar girl. To me, bars are for liquor, not for vats of slimy shredded lettuce, mayonnaise-drenched mush and neon canned beets. I was tempted to walk right by, take my seat and demand hordes of grilled meats directly from the skewer to my mouth. Then the manchego caught my eye. And the lox. And the marinated olives, jamon iberico, fresh fruit, hearts of palm, artichokes and roasted bell peppers. Delicious. I suggest keeping a plate of salad around as a palate cleanser between meat courses. The whole game at Fogo is fun - the stop/go signs, friendly waiters and strong capirinhas make for a delightful time. The only surprisingly unimpressive bit was the filet mignon. It was chewier than I would have hoped, but so easily overlooked among the dozens of other sizzling skewers this churrascaria has to offer.",5/6/2009,EH6f3eNXzDxHHpAL5d2knA,bXlUT_K-Bjxi2T4BJygIhg,43rd1LKcZRIunySzbMsyLQ,N,5,1

Doug does not screw up, ever. weather it is sauerkraut and Gouda on an spicy sausage or elk, antelope, venison with blackberry butter, you will not be disappointed, he is simply a wizard with encased meats.  One more thing to mention, I would suggest that you get a corn dog, I am pretty sure they are laced with something, it is the only explanation for how unbelievable they are, also on Friday and Saturday the fries are cooked in duck fat... just unbelievable, simply mind blowing, take the trip, bundle up (you are gonna have to wait in a line that extends outside) and enjoy the best dog or sausage in Chicago.",12/15/2007,TBmGhWu7YkmFZK0Bwrg4bw,tRgZXC7QgLkH0_tR7kIUGg,HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A,N,5,1

The only bad food experience I had was with the dumplings. I felt that the dumplings' dough was far too thick and tasted raw. The stuffing in the dumplings is so bland and boring that no dipping sauce could redeem them. The waitress very kindly exchanged it for me which I really appreciated. In addition, I did not like the coconut cake. It was so heavy in my stomach I felt pretty sick afterwards. It looks so soft and fluffy I thought it was be like sweet air but it tasted more like a sweet tub of margarine.

I want to like it so bad, but I think I settled on giving up this last time around.I want to mention that other than the 15 minutes we waited for a server, the service has always been consistently great and accommodating, even when they are training someone. Always very knowledgeable and friendly :-)Though the burger was great, cooked nicely at Medium Rare, loved the pickled onions. Also a fan of the sweet potato fires with goat cheese fondue, but the fondue is hit or miss, salt-wise. Usually severely under seasoned.This has echos of a place I was a cook at back in the day where the chef had what seemed like an allergy to salt. The steak was average, no hint of horse radish in the condiment it is served with, the basic fries are odd. The compound butter lacked salt as well. The fried smelts were good quality seafood, but lacked flavor in the batter and accompaniments. The greens are seasoned with... I'm not sure? Just lemon? I wish they were a little more exciting!I always like the poached pear cake dessert, but this last time around the (always delicious) Black Dog Gelato was the wrong gelato and the cake was a little cold and stale :-/ My friend hates that it's advertised as a poached pear dessert, but has a sliver of pear.

I was a solo diner and had a fantastic time. The staff was great and every dish was an adventure.

I have been there a number of times, but last Saturday night I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday before heading to the Double Door. We had a large raised area to ourselves which was great.

The pizzas arrived and we all were digging in. I had a slice of white pizza with spinach and mushrooms as well as a slice of pepperoni. Both were very good. The crust was crispy but still had that floppy quality you like when you pick up a slice. By this time the place was really crowded, so we didn't happen to notice that a tiny older woman had slipped in behind our table. Unfortunately, she took the cash out of my wallet and another girl's wallet before one of the staff saw her from across the bar. He tried to catch her but she took off in a white minivan getaway car that was waiting out front! Myself and the other girl had no idea what was going on....talk about excitement and drama. We ended up sitting in a cop car out front while the manager gave a description on her. This was definitely a freak thing, and the manager felt awful. He was great though, and gave us both significant gift certificates for the next couple of times we came in.

Anyways the drinks here are by far the best. They are experts at their craft. The mixologists take time to perfect each hand-crafted drink, constantly measuring and tasting. If you ever have a chance to sit at the bar, do-so. It's wonderful to watch them create. Besides the emergence of the Lincoln Park (plastic) crowd, it's the best place in the city.

30496,"I live the American capital of hippie vegetarian/vegan food (San Francisco Bay Area) and there is nothing here to even compare to the Chicago Diner. All of our veggie restaurants here are either a) Morningstar products heated up and put on a plate or b) the most fanciful, expensive and outrageous vegetable concoctions you could ever imagine. Neither is very fun. The Chicago Diner is the perfect, amazing veggie restaurant. All of the food is original and prepared well. I had the seitan medallions over Asian noodles and it was freakin' amazing. And the vegan mint chocolate shake that my boyfriend ordered (and I stole half of) was quite possibly the besk shake (milk, vegan, etc) I had ever tasted in my life -- and I don't even like mint! Seriously, if you are vegetarian and/or vegan make it a goal to eat at the Chicago Diner sometime during your life. It's really that amazing.",11/29/2005,Rn0iTF54K8M,NLF7wQwSQxIo4E34TMaRoQ,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw,N,4,1
17821,"As one who has eaten at both MOD and Del Toro, I was curious about the new use of the space, so naturally I had to check out the new joint behind those 'post no bills' signs. Do I feel like the concept is a bit gimmicky and a 'flash in the pan' concept? Yes, I do, but i it is a gimmicky and a 'flash in the pan' concept with wonderful drinks and service. I wasn't as impressed with the decor or the ambiance as a lot of the reviewers are, but my cocktail is what made the experience a positive one. I will definitely go back for another cocktail as those are impeccable and worth the money (and I'm usually not one for expensive fussy drinks, but I like do good liquor and was happy to see a menu of non-vodka based drinks). However, I find the whole mystique of the place forced. Go for the drinks, put up with the silliness. Silliness which sometimes gave off the vibe that it is a bunch of kids playing ""lets be sophisticated, exclusive and cool"", but really aren't. There were only two people ahead of me in line when I showed up, otherwise I wouldn't have waited to go in, nor do I suggest you wait longer than 5-10 minutes either. Honestly, the place only gets four stars because of the drinks, and it is because of the drinks that I'll go back, but the rest of the place just doesn't do it for me.",3/16/2008,jsjvhJ8pLZKnnkzu6,9Aq7mt9qMV0xsTDfDnhqpg,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,N,4,1

Otherwise you'll only get the standard sides: garlic and cheese mashed potatoes, fried polenta, plantains, cheese rolls. Another tip: Make sure you request any meats that you want to try b/c some meats don't always come out on the floor. In essence, GREAT food, GREAT drinks, and GREAT service...worth every penny.

50142,"I had a reservation here on a Saturday at noon that I was able to get without a problem, which surprised me as Chicagoans are crazy about brunch. Regardless, we arrived a few minutes early and decided to wait a few extra minutes past our reservation time to get one of the few outdoor tables on their back patio. While we were waiting we took in the beautiful atmosphere indoors which was very classically old southern. The restaurant was mostly full and bustling, but it didn't seem to incredibly loud, which I noted for our next visit when the weather may not be as nice. The back patio was tiny, maybe 6-8 tables that could accommodate parties of four and two. They did a great job with the space though by adding huge plants that break up the area in between the tables all nestled within a huge privacy fence that hides the fact you're pretty much sitting in the alley. We had a very attentive waiter who quickly brought us water and took our drink orders. I was happy to see that the coffee they serve is an Intelligentisa Blend which is always tasty and a great accent to a brunch/breakfast. One of the members in our party ordered their freshly squeezed orange juice which looked amazingly pulpy and delicious. I heard no complaints from her and when she ordered a second I knew it was solid, and as it should being over $3 a glass. After we all had mulled over the extensive brunch offerings, we put in our order and we were served up some complimentary beignets. Being somewhat ""new"" to southern style cooking, I had actually never had one of these. They were essentially less sweet donuts doused in a pile of powdered sugar. The dough itself was a little bland for my liking, but dipping it repeatedly in the powdered sugar helped remedy that issue, making me glad they weren't incredibly sweet on their own. This definitely helped whet my appetite for the destruction of my brunch which happened shortly thereafter. Here's the damage that was done: 1) Eggs New Orleans (Ponchartrain blue crab cakes with poached eggs, popovers, and bearnaise sauce, served with Potatoes O'Brien): Delicious. Absolutely delicious. Dare I even say INCREDIBLY delicious? I mean, I knew I was in for a treat as soon as my eyes glanced over the word crab and poached eggs. The very meaty and minimal to no filling crab cakes were nestled neatly into two soft popovers with a poached egg delicately perched on top. There was just the right amount of bearnaise sauce on top that mixed wonderfully with the egg yolks when they were broken. It was the tastiest mashup of flavors that I've had in awhile, and I inhaled the entree. The side of the Potatoes O'Brien was also a treat as the hashed browns were perfectly browned, giving it a nice crunch, along with the bites of onions and peppers. I'd absolutely have this entree again. 2) Big Jones Benedict (House cured and smoked ham simmered in Kilgus Farmstead cream, served on a traditional farmstead biscuit with poached eggs & Potatoes O'Brien): My boyfriend got this dish and I nabbed a bite, and it was also incredible. It was essentially the same as the Eggs New Orleans but with ham instead of crab. I'm pretty sure his was also served over popovers, but I could be wrong. The ham was some of the best I've had brunch wise in awhile--it literally flaked apart and had an amazing smokey ham flavor. 3) Gumbo Ya-Ya (Gunthorp Farm chicken and house andouille in a deep, dark, smoky roux, with steamed aromatic Arkansas rice): One of my friends ordered this, and I snagged a bite after I gobbled up my food. It was a huge difference from my rich and savory meal, so the flavor contrast was huge. It was VERY smoky tasting, almost to the point of tasting burnt. I wasn't a huge fan, but I feel like had I been eating it the entire time I would've liked it more. He finished almost every bite, so I feel like that speaks enough! 4) House Cured & Smoked Bacon and Early Onion Omelet (House-cured smoked bacon and organic baby swiss cheese with Spring onions and local spinach, choose potatoes or creamy grits): The other member of our party got this one, and she seemed to love it! I was past the point of fullness to try hers, but the omelet was huge and looked awesome, I probably will venture to get it on one of my next trips here. 5) Side of Bacon: Thick cut, slightly crispy, but not burnt. There was a slight hint of maple and it was fantastic. When it comes to thick cut bacon this is second place in my book behind Au Cheval. Trust me, I don't mess around with bacon. I'll definitely come back in the future, but now I'm intrigued to try their dinner and lunch offerings. If you want a different take on brunch from your standard offerings definitely make the trek to Andersonville and hit up Big Jones.",11/10/2010,4ZBvej0OdJeFpA-pRp1LRg,ocKNqM0sim2LiB_jLO0IyQ,6gZTET0y7ARZMrbJRmI2mw,N,4,1

He needed to talk to the chef about the menu and I called after the weekend, like he told me to (4-26) He still didn't have the menu together, he said his chef left already and if he could call me back the next day, well that was fine (kind of). So I called him (4-27) cause the event was not that far away. Omar asked if I wanted the whole room or just half of the room I again reminded him what the event was for and how half of the room was fine so he could still do business being mothers day and all. I still didn't receive a menu but told him I don't mind spending $25-30 per person (even after he told me $15-20 depending on the menu), I was upset; still waiting for some type of food menu, and after another talk on the phone I felt everything was still ok! When we hung up the phone he called me back 15 min later to tell me he didn't realize it was mothers day and he doesn't take reservation on holidays....OMG I talked to Omar 2 other time to info him on what this was for and I mentioned the christening and mothers day twice!!!I know this is what I went threw with NANAS! I got in my car and went over there to talk face to face cause the phone thing wasn't going on anymore. Omar stated we didn't have a written contract so I guess his word isn't worth anything.

54020,"I am willing to put my vote in that the Violet Hour is one of the very best bars in the country, if not the best.I have long been a fan of the bar, and followed the bartenders' methods and formulas for crafting drinks. Everything on the menu is solid; there is a perfect drink for everyone, and for every season. Having some of the best cocktails in the country isn't the very best part about the Violet Hour. What makes it the best bar in Chicago is how it set the trend for all of the great bars to come along since, and led the cultural revolution that is craft cocktails in Chicago. The Kold-Draft ice you see in any establishment that wishes to be taken seriously, the fresh juices, homemade syrups and bitters, these are all thanks to the Violet Hour.My most recent visit was just as phenomenal as all the others, but rather than talk all about every drink that I enjoyed, I'm writing this review to call out a lot of idiotic ideas that turn up in countless yelp reviews:-Stop complaining about the ice: Anyone who thinks the large chunk of ice in their Old Fashioned is taking up all the space, and leaving them with less booze is a moron. That's not how surface area and volume work. Cheap, crappy ice is designed to fill your glass more efficiently, taking up more space, meanwhile turning your cocktail into a watered down mess. That big ball of ice in your drink is your best friend.-The drinks are not over-priced. Granted, not every night is $12 cocktail night for every person. We all have our priorities. However, when you are looking for a good cocktail, $12 is a damn fair price. Considering all of the care and work that goes into using fresh, homemade ingredients and fine spirits, you are drinking creations that could easily go for $20. When you can go to a high-end restaurant and still pay $8-9 for nothing but lame flavored vodka drinks, why is $12 considered pricey for some of the best stuff on earth? New bars are already starting to charge $13, or more on their cocktail menu. 12 is nothing to complain about.All in all, for people who like a really good drink, there is no place better than this. This is a force for cultural good in Chicago, and the entire country.",9/12/2011,iEEourQH_194Vt6W-YiFZQ,0pF-tPYFAQB1zZnGv1VwAg,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg,Y,2,0

Our local bartender makes a better one.But here's the worst part: the food was nothing special. It was OK, but it was NOT the exceptional. The pork I had was a bit dry.

The Workingman's mild is too mild, the belgian style is decent, the Anti-Hero IPA is very bitter but not necessarily in the good way I like, the coffee punch to the mouth they call the Stout is pretty good, but the Willie (their highest proof concoction) literally tastes like a Curad alcohol-soaked band-aid. Seriously give it a sniff and a slug and you'll see what I'm talkin' about. Now that I've got that off my chest, the place is actually really cool, well laid out, and the food I've had was really good - Cheddar burger with beer onions, and Margarita Pizza.

Was it as amazing as I had hoped? No but it was good. I heard their fries were terrible, but they are known for their homemade cottage fries (chips) so maybe that's to be expected.

And for $28 for a medium with 4 toppings, I'll go to Lucky Vito's and get a grand slam sausage slice for $2.50. Oh, and their beer is less than good. For being a microbrewery, they need to learn that all the different brews they offer should not taste crazy hoppy. I'm surprised this place has lasted as long as it has. Out of 100 reviews, I guess I'm one of the few that requires good tasting pizza for $30 and better tasting microbrewed beer for $7.",11/4/2009,XaNRKNMWhYG5CEOgR9PpmA,VS00VsR_su1efnIEWkATKQ,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA,N,1,1

As usual, Hopleaf was packed with a crowd as eclectic as its extensive beer list, but we did our best to limit ourselves to a few beers and an order of frites. The frites are served with a healthy portion of garlic aioli. In addition to all the Belgians, Hopleaf also offers many craft beers including local brews from Half Acre, Metropolitan, and Goose Island.

6206,Went there for a dry run and they did a great job (they do have tons of experience). I prefer vegetarian dishes and Davanti has very good choices for me. I have to comment on the ceci beans. They were very tasty and presented in a unique style. The sweet red bell pepper and onion toppings really made this dish. The wine list was good. I love the wine cellar look to the place.

6039,"Upon recently moving to the River North area, my boyfriend and I have been making date nights out of the hundreds of restaurants within walking distance from our apartment. ""Wildfire"" caught our eye as there were many people waiting for the valet and the menu seemed right up our alley- as we are total carnivores. We were seated right away and caught a glimpse of the ""decade"" decor and fire behind us. Water was served without ice and only filled half the glass....I should have walked out after this, as our experience got much worse. Ten minutes later our waitress arrived and practically forced our order out of us. Guess she was too busy at 9pm on a Sunday night. We decided on a wine flight, french onion soup, chopped salad, lamb for me and porterhouse for him. She returned another ten minutes later to inform me that the lamb special was out. I requested that the manager allow me to have the other lamb dish she recommended for the special price- but he declined. I ordered the prime rib instead. At this point I was slightly disturbed and the fruit flies flying around our bread were not helping the mood. The salad was tasty, the soup was overly salty...and the wine was decent. When the steaks arrived.....i gagged at the color- it looked rare to me and the two bites I had instantly made my tummy hurt. He hardly touched the porterhouse as well, because the consistency was stringy and mushy....I'm still unsure why that was. After complaining to the manager for the second time- our practically untouched steaks were taken off our bill and the waitress finally got the hint that the overall experience we had was far under par. Regardless of their last second attempt to satisfy a customer, I will not be returning to any of the Wildfire's. So $50 bucks later- sans steak- we walked home with two tummy aches. Take my advice and try Sullivan's a few blocks south- for a few bucks more a pop, its well worth it.",6/11/2007,lq8d6d0MDhn00RqKnIk1mA,avVsoPFAXnR56Qrw_CUuqg,CQ75CQSyrsmb-S3UAwCHpw,N,2,1
52547,"Yay! I AM a fan! So many of my reviews are geared towards carnivores and this trend will continue. All you can eat meat...where is the downfall? Well there is one...$$$  It's a bit pricey and you have to make sure you can eat about $50 worth of food (or in my case have a friend who can eat $100 worth). I like this place better then Fogo mainly because they have the fried pineapple and the jumbo shrimp (which I did not see at Fogo). The only other downside to this place is that it is kind of sensory overload and there is a crazy salad bar and you have to be a really experienced eater to know how to pace yourself. So come prepared and you will not be disappointed.

Although there will definitely be changes, I am positive the quality of their food (they use as much organic ingredients as possible) and the drinks (extremely creative) will be just as good.

They were dry though. 6/10 I ordered the crab cakes because of yelp. I rarely ever order them, and truthfully can probably count on one hand how many times I have ordered them. I do love crab though and per the reviews these are good. I was not disappointed. Full of crab with a good white sauce. 9/10 Side 1 was Mac and Cheese. For a southern style restaurant it sucked. It was a hard layer of cheese on top with barely cheese in the noodles at all. 3/10 Side 2 Sweet potato. It was mashed like regular potatoes, with milk i believe which was odd but not bad. Had some nuts in it also. I would prefer honey/sugar over the mashed variety though or just plain with a bit of butter. 6/10 Drink menu was very limited, even for beers.

53889,"After visiting The Purple Pig on multiple occasions for lunch and dinner since the restaurant opened, it is easy to see why Buon Appetit magazine recently rated it one of the country's ten best new restaurants. The food is delicious. The staff is very helpful, always professional, and they look good too. The atmosphere rocks. At Michigan and Illinois with outdoor patio seating, it is up there with Chicago's best. I have broken down their menu by section below. What I recommend: Antipasti: Pork Fried Almonds (You never thought an almond could taste this good.) Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans (This is a must try!) Salads: Mixed Greens with Feta, Radishes and Red Wine Mint Vinaigrette (I don't eat salad often, but this dish makes me want to start.) Fried Items: If you can, try everything from this section of the menu. I highly recommend the Prosciutto Bread Balls and Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg. The Melrose Peppers are a must have. Panini: The Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese and Black Olive Tapenade Panini makes for a great lunch. Cured Meats and Cheese (I combined these 2 sections of their menu because, ideally, they would be eaten together): You won't find them like this anywhere else in Chicago. All of them are must haves especially the Prosciutto di Parma. Smears: I've never really been a big fan of feta cheese but I wish I had a jug of the Purple Pig's Whipped Feta with Cucumbers in my refrigerator at all times because it is that damn good. a la Plancha, etc.: The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Pork Blade Steak are two of my favorite dishes of all time anywhere. These are must haves. You can't go wrong with either. The desserts are all very good. I just had the Panino con Nutella the other night. I will definitely order that many more times in the future. I haven't even began to discuss the drinks at The Purple Pig. Their wine list is very deep and broken up by region. They have a couple of Italian red wines from Calabria that go awesome with dinner. The beer selection is intriguing; you will find something that you like. If you have any questions, ask a member of the staff. They are experts and will easily find something to your liking.

4408,"Ok, here's the deal with the Green Mill: It's a great place to go and catch some great jazz. Music there is always top notch, but be aware of what kind of jazz group is playing that night. Jazz is a HUGE spectrum, and I love almost all of it, but when you get into the ""free jazz"" style, I lose interest (look up Ornette Coleman or Cecil Taylor on You Tube for examples). The Green Mill has a lot of charm. The interior is all original from the early 20th century (I think it was first opened sometime in the 1910s). The dim lighting adds to it and makes you feel like you're back in the 1920s. Be aware that the only credit card they accept is American Express. This place is for people who really enjoy jazz or really want to get an idea of what jazz is. It is NOT for people who simply come with the intention of having drinks and being loud with the music merely being in the background. Jazz is an acoustic music for the most part, and any electric instruments used are not to be played loud and drowning out the rhythm section. This place is first and foremost about the music. That is their main focus. If one or two groups get loud they drown out the music and then the people that want to listen can't enjoy it. It's not a dance club and it's not a bar with rock bands with their amps cranked way up and a drummer hitting away as hard as he can. In places like that the music is so loud that it basically drowns out any talking, so anybody can still hear the music and talk. That doesn't apply here and people need to realize that. I love going on Thursdays for the big band, and if anything, come that night if you want to be able to talk because the band is loud enough to the point where talking will not keep anyone from hearing the music. However, there are also awesome bands like Chuchito Valdes' Afro-Cuban Jazz Ensemble, which plays some killer Latin jazz. These guys are SERIOUSLY talented musicians. Anybody who calls the music at this place ""Disney jazz"" is simply a complete moron. Another thing to keep in mind is that the cover charge on Mon - Thurs is $6 and the one for Fridays and Saturdays is usually between $10 - $15 (usually it's $12 the vast majority of the time). These are top quality jazz bands and I have no problem with the weekend cover charge for the caliber of musicians I get to see. I don't see how people can complain about paying 12 bucks to see a top quality jazz band, yet they have no problem going to some dance club and paying $20 to sit there listening to the same pop songs that are on the radio 24/7 playing over the speakers. I'm sure if you read the reviews you'll see a recurring theme here: 1. Serious music fans love this place. 2. People who come here to just have drinks and talk - with the music being thought of as background noise - hate it.",6/8/2011,PZKamuFyqOj5j8Gwnn2WLQ,HOAifOM_qbHmprQNXWNG_g,t3pYu8eidmb2ZmexHRHT_Q,N,5,1

The atmosphere is calm and warm, which helped us since it was pretty cold on Sunday night!Our waitress was really helpful in selecting dishes that would satisfy our cravings at the time. We ended up ordering the summer rolls and avocado wontons for appetizers. The summer rolls, albeit their name, were perfect. Very crisp and refreshing with the perfect accompanying sauce. The avocado wontons were a bit heavier, but were definitely a guilty pleasure due to the cream cheese and the avocado fusion.For entrees, my brother got the beef short ribs while I got the sate shrimp. According to him, the beef short ribs were decadently marinated to satisfy the taste buds. Whatever that means (ugh, those literature majors!). The sate shrimp was just how I requested it--spicy! The portion was a bit big, especially after the appetizers, so I took it home for leftovers. Regardless, it still tasted delicious the next afternoon for lunch at work.My brother left with a good impression of this place. Hah, too bad he lives in Houston! I'll be back more often without him. ;)",1/4/2012,kfWG2Rva8n60t3yWT0GhPA,hpbivIwMNullccw0TVMogg,N7juvW8YoFIj7sEBzVF8GQ,Y,5,0

21826,"This place is unique and fabulous, hands down. I am a lover of sandwiches, but sometimes have a hard time finding one that really stands out since there are so many great sandwich places in Chi-town. But, this one did it for me.  I came here for lunch and as expected, it was PACKED, with a line out the door. We probably waited about 40 minutes, but it was well worth it. I ordered a sandwich with pulled pork and the pork was one of the most tender, juicy and flavorful pork's I have ever tasted. It came on wheat bread which was soft, chewy and delicious, and although I am forgetting exactly what else was on my pork sandwich, it doesn't matter because it was something fabulously tasty and you couldn't go wrong with this selection. My mom had a sandwich with chicken which was also superb, and my dad had a cream of squash soup along with a sandwich made as vegetarian friendly as you could get. What I mean by this is, the only downfall of this place is the lack of truly vegetarian options. There is one dinner bowl that is vegetarian but not available for lunch, and many other things although they don't contain a slab of actual meat, we found have been cooked with meat. This was a little frustrating and disappointing mainly for my Dad, but the quality and tastiness of the food could not be questioned. I am all for communal seating and meeting the people next to you, and it worked out great here, although always packed they did have a good system of ensuring that no one is left standing with no table after waiting 40 minutes in line to order your meal. It is a little small though and I personally feel it would be a good idea to expand to have more seating, but hey, that's just me. The Mexican-style spicy hot chocolate was rich and delicious, a perfect end to an almost perfect meal. Next time I will leave room for the churros that everyone raves about, I just couldn't do it this time.",9/16/2009,WtHGvF-jKd7AR-K8i9gg5A,tTmPKCEaGgLnwymxasvhTw,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,N,4,1

My yet to be used small ""bread"" plate was dirty as well. When I asked for a new one, the server simply took it away without a word and never returned with a new one. When I payed the bill in cash, it took an inordinate amount of time to get my change. I thought that excellent BBQ would overcome the disappointment of the service. The ribs and brisket were almost tasteless- no smoke flavor whatsoever. And the side sauces were no help, in fact they were simply not good.

If your entire party is not there within 15 minutes, they give away your table. No questions asked. We were seated at the bar, and while initially annoyed, it turned out to be a great experience. Why?The bartender (who is supposedly a reality tv star) was SO nice and took charge of ordering for our table asking us only what we definitely would NOT eat.

The wait staff is very friendly and are happy to get you a beer even if you cannot get close to the bar tender; its been that full. I have had Cross of Gold, Eugene, Workingman Mild and Bottom Up Belgian Wit and really enjoy them, especially the Cross of Gold. I even thought about joining their Mug Club, will keep thinking about it though, maybe in the Spring. I was there with my cousin who enjoyed very much the Anti Hero IPA with a Forest Burger.

Topped with beany sludge, cheese, like a pound of carne asada steak, guacamole, sour cream and more cheese.I don't know what they don't just call them nachos and I don't care, I just want to eat them - all. Their guacamole and all of their salsas are so fresh and delicious tasting. Their horchata is perfectly sweet and creamy - and their large is pretty damn big. They also have a dish of little quesadillas topped with onions and drenched in this mild orange-y sauce - scrumptiously messy. Only minus - the beef is sometimes too...chewy, kinda grizzly even... The workers here are some of the nicest ladies period. And my one real criticism of this place is that they regularly get jobbed, because even though you can pay for your food with a credit card, you can't leave a tip on the card. So you're supposed to have both on hand? I'm pretty sure that means they go without tips all the time, which is really fucked up. And the ATM there is always out of order. Bottom line, they should fix that. Other bottom line - if you can, tip very generously - they graciously deal with a lot of drunk assholes and they deserve to be tipped well.

The maitre d' was very nice & we had a drink in their lovely bar while we waited for a table. The servers were friendly and prompt. We were in a good mood, so we splurged on a $50 bottle of Moet. The nigiri was promising, but when we got to our rolls they were mushy and somewhat tasteless. The place does not know how to make rice! While we were underwhelmed by the food, we were still having a decent time, but it was completely ruined by some little Asian man in heavy-rimmed glasses approaching our table shortly after we paid. He asked us to leave - he had people waiting and wanted the table. We were still finishing our champagne after dropping over $200 (including a very healthy tip)!!!

Awesome. The first slice was the best- after which, we both declared Piece our new favorite non-deep-dish pizza. The crust was so crispy, with the perfect amount of cheese and toppings. However, as time passed, the crust got to be tough and chewy. Not a biggie because you can pop the leftovers in the toaster oven and it's fresh again.

1599,"Hot diggity dog! Chicago has a few claims that no one can deny. Among them... ...crooked politicians ...cold weather ...a flippin' big lake ...damn good dogs Even New Yorkers can agree (http://leisureblogs.chic) that our dogs are the Rolls Royce of the encased meat world and while you can find a proper red hot on nearly any corner in the city, there's really only one place to complete the sausage tour d'force in a single seat. Hot Doug's. I'll leave the background to other more knowledgeable Yelpers (many of whom consider sausage a religion), but just let it be known that Doug has been making award-winning red hots since your pappy was dipping cocktail wienies. He does the classics. He does head-scratchingly bizarre. But just like grammar, you have to know the rules before you can break them. Doug does. So here's my recommendation to all visitors, whether old timers or newbies: get it all. God knows you're going to be spending an hour plus waiting in line to get in, most likely in sub-freezing temperatures (see things Chicago does well, above), so you might as well make it worth it. What I mean is (especially for newbies), you have to get Doug's take on the classic Chicago dog. You have to try an Italian sausage or Polish. Have to. From there on out, you decide how weird you want it to get. With unique takes on foreign cuisines (on my last visit I had a Thai chicken sausage with seaweed relish) and more exotic animals than you can find on an African safari (buffalo, ostrich, alligator, snake all come to mind), you're only limited to your own boundaries... or the size of your stomach. The good news is that's it's all good. From A to Z and everything in between. And if you ever find yourself lost and confused, just ask what Doug suggests. Yup, that's him right there at the register, day in and day out, preaching the gospel of the sausage who anyone willing to listen.

35457,"The 8 course Goose Island dinner at Sun Wah last night was EXCELLENT! Not only was it one of head brewmaster Greg Hall's last (if not his very last) beer pairing dinners before he leaves Goose Island, but this dinner gave us a chance to taste dishes that I had never ordered at Sun Wah before. As expected, all of the beers (312, Lolita, Fleur, Sofie, Madame Rose, Pepe Nero, Juliet, Matilda, Pere Jacques) were tasty.  Although this was a special event, all of the dishes prepared can be ordered off of Sun Wah's menu regularly. Food courses in order: 1. Minced fish nuggets with iceberg lettuce: In concept this dish sounds a little suspect, but as someone who grew up eating all types of weird minced mystery meats, I can tell you that Sun Wah's minced fish nuggets/balls were deliciously flavorful and not the bad kind of fishy at all. The sauce was great and the lettuce was refreshing.  2. Sauteed bok choy: You can't mess this up! Delicious. 3. Pan-fried shrimp with bell peppers, onions, & thai chiles: One of my favorites of the night. Shrimp, with its shells on, were pan-fried to crunchy perfection. It was excellently seasoned. 4. Beef chow fun: The noodles were perfect. This used to be one of my favorite dishes growing up and it's really easy to mess up if the noodles aren't the perfect texture and size. Sun Wah's is really close to perfect. 5. Stir-fried tofu medley: I enjoyed this because I like tofu. If you don't, I wouldn't order this. 6. Roast pork: I judge every Hong Kong-style BBQ place I go to based on the execution of this dish. The meat should be flavorful but not dry, and the skin should be crispy and not chewy. For the most part, Sun Wah does great. 7. Peking duck: The mini sandwiches came completely prepared already, which is understandable since this was a set dinner. But the duck and the steamed buns got cold really quickly. The Peking duck is normally AMAZING, and I would definitely suggest going to Sun Wah for its signature dish. That being said, I still enjoyed it and the Matilda paired perfectly with the duck! 7.5: Duck fried rice (made with the leftover Peking duck): We weren't expecting this, but it's awesome that they don't let anything go to waste.  8. Chicken with bittermelon in a black bean sauce: I was not a fan of bittermelon when I was a kid and I am still not a fan of it. What does it taste like? Like a squash that has a bitter taste that somehow lingers even after you've swallowed it. Sorry, but not my favorite. After the meal ended everyone was super stuffed and you could tell that the entire restaurant was considerably louder due to everyone being nicely liquored up from the beer.

Yes it's different. Everything on the menu looks great but it seemed my food was lacking in execution both times. They should learn to prepare greens properly or stop serving them. They aren't a salad and shouldn't be treated as such. I would say the food was more like someone who visited the south and then tried to make food like it. I ordered the ""country breakfast"" just to sample several things and it seemed like everything came out rushed.

60015,"Now this is good southern cooking. After failing miserably to find some good southern food (see review of Dixi's Kitchen and Bait Shop. The Worst!) we heard about Big Jones. It's much closer and much much better. We have been twice now and everything is always great. The service, the cocktails, the food and even the owners are great. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, no problem, but the owner (I assume) was so apologetic. We were seated and our server was at our table quickly. He was very attentive, professional and friendly. I ordered a mint jullip that was tasty and strong. The warm corn bread with butter and honey was delicious. We decided to try frog legs for the first time. They were good and meaty and not fried just right. We shared the jumblia and the chicken special of the night. As always my wife wound up ordering the better of the two, that's why we share, but they were both delicious. On the way out the presumed owner again apologized and thanked us for coming. It was completely unnecessary but very nice. I have mentioned Big Jones to friends and they all rave about it as well. We will defiantly be back many more times.

60369,"Wakamono used to be a small establishment. Back then it a little more quiet, cozy, and the food arrived quickly. Now it has expanded (a testament to the quality), but it doesn't appear they've hired any more sushi chefs. This had lead to what I consider a very, very long wait for my meal. The quality is excellent. I've been to this establishment more than a handful of times, and each one has been a delight to my tastebuds. But that is where the joy ends. The restaurant is far too large for the number of chefs they have. And the noise is just excessive. The entire place is built with very eye pleasing wood, but with the very loud music and large number of people, it makes conversing very difficult. Truthfully, during the nicer months, I would never eat there if I couldn't be certain of seating outside. Not being able to converse with my dinner mates is a serious issue.Suggestions for the owners (I'm sure they read this): Invest in some noise absorbing materials and turn down the music. We're not at a club or a bar. We're at a restaurant, trying to enjoy our meal and talk with friends. And get a few more chefs. You could turn more tables and make more money. Waiting an hour for food is just not cool and may drive people to find quicker delivering establishments (they exist).I wish there were more options for ranking instead of a single star rating.

58533,"Love this place! I read about it on yelp and since it's super close to my old apartment my boyfriend took me here for my birthday.We went on a Saturday and it was super busy! I'm really glad we thought ahead to make a reservation because I think I overheard someone being told the wait was about an hour.. at 7pm. We were seated in the back room, which was slightly quieter than the front room confusion but as our meal progressed the back room also became very busy and super loud. However, the food was so good I am willing to forgive the fact that I couldn't hear anyone, much less our very nice waitress. We ordered the calamari as our appetizer, and you are now warned- it is huge! I was so full from this that I could barely eat any of my pasta. My boyfriend had.. a meat dish that he said was one of the best meals of his life. (Both of our dishes were from the seasonal menu). Couldn't make it through the entire tiramisu, but it was wonderful. My boyfriend had let them know ahead of time that we were celebrating my birthday and they printed out special menus for us that said Happy birthday, Elizabeth at the top. It was a nice touch.

10070,"I was sadly disappointed with my experience at Piccolo Sogno.  I had been looking forward to it for a long time. PROS: + Excellent service. Our waiter and the bus staff were properly attentive, pleasant, and well informed. + Great Wine List! All Italian, but approachable. And our waiter was more than willing to help. + Good menu. The menu is as advertised, true rustic Italian (not Italian American) - even if the food didn't do it, the menu made my mouth water. CONS: + The food. The simple pork entree was so dry and overdone that I needed a drink every bite just to swallow! How hard is it to mess up a pork roast? Ok, it happens - but they served it! I should have sent it back, but I have never done such a thing. All of the accompaniments were tasty. Also the mixed seafood grill appetizer was certainly mixed. Some it was cooked properly, but most of it was WAY overgrilled. Holy chewy. OUT OF FAIRNESS: + My wife had the whole fish and it was very good. Nothing special. + Neither of us had a pasta dish, whish we are told are very good. I might return to Piccolo Sogno to try a pasta dish, but with so many excellent, true, rustic Italian restaurants in Chicago - I might not bother.",12/22/2010,-F9XNuxo8UnLOWsfAKtZtw,3j1UjF6WT2C2DlqoZFQKNA,JMa9cTNQA5mm4GbR2W8Oiw,N,2,1

54086,"In a nutshell, this restaurant has unique very flavorful food but has an overlycomplicated ordering/seating process and is overpriced. For the food, I ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, one of the caldos, churros and a beer. The chips and salsa are perfectly fine but come with an incredibly skimpy quantity of guacamole. I had no idea what a caldos was and was surprised when it was delivered but ate it with an open mind and enjoyed it immensely. Think of the caldos as mexican pho. The caldos are intensely flavored and have a perfect balance of flavors.  The churros were good as well but perhaps too doughy.My main issue with this restaurant is the bizzare method of ordering food and being seated. You are assigned a table but order at a register. When I entered the restaurant I walked to the register to order and was asked for my table number. I did not have one since I had not sat down. I was told to see a hostess. The hostess told me all seats were taken and instructed me to stand at the front of the line (at the register) and wait for her to come give me a table number. So, I waited for 5 or so minutes like a dope in an empty line looking at a person waiting to take my order at the register. When assigned a table number, I ordered and was shown to my seat and food runners brought my food to me. Very awkward and over thought for a restaurant that is somewhere between chipotle and casual full service mexican. So, 5 stars for food, minus one for the stupid ordering/seating arrangement and minus one more star because the basic meal I ate cost $37 with a small gratuity, which is way too much to pay for the atmosphere, quantity of food and lack of table service.",7/31/2012,-TrZaEUt6TlgpW9WtMw2og,Czbn9mGOziIQqskUXMGSqA,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw,Y,5,0

The food was soooo good and it came out without delay. Teddy, our waiter, did an amazing job juggling all the orders. It's so refreshing going to a restaurant like this in Chicago.

417,"Was with Tracy O. at Alinea. I had the full tour menu with wine pairings. The service was amazing - they strike the perfect balance between being attentive and trying to meet your every need and expectation without somehow smothering and hovering over you. Although, maybe waiting for me to get out of the bathroom to push in my chair was a bit embarrassing. Especially, since I was sidetracked by the Alinea book on my way out. Also as a note to servers: don't get irritated with a customer because they didn't tell you they don't like X when you specifically ask ""Are you allergic to anything?"" How was I supposed to know you wanted to hear about my recent campaign to stop the disgusting overuse of truffle in, on, and around everything in Chicago? I don't use ""allergies"" as an excuse. So how about asking if I have any dislikes or preferences? Food - to be perfectly honest I was rather disappointed. I was happy I had had the ""Alinea Experience"" but was rather unimpressed with the food. There seemed to be far too much of the same textures (aka mushy squares and gelatin squares). The only dishes I would say were good were the pork belly, the bacon - sweet potato -mustard (served as a threesome) and the desserts. I did also enjoy the cauliflower which I almost hesitate to mention since me liking veggies means the rest or your food must be.... Wine - Oh my goodness. Amazing. What I craved after my dinner at Alinea was to come back for a night of fantastic wine, baskets and baskets of the amazing bread, ""donuts,"" rolls and cheeses as unique as your wine.

37213,"One star from a loyal customer for the past five years. New owners, new management = fire all the good employees and only have the absolute minimum of staff working even at peak times. It's obviously all about the bottom line now. Deli section? Be prepared to wait for about 20 minutes before someone notices that you need help. Meat section? Stand in line for 30 minutes. I've been given old stinky chicken twice and almost gagged from the smell. Yes, F&O is great if you want olive oil that was cold pressed in Rome by the Pope (and you're prepard to pay for it).  They're usually out of everything else. Simple basic things that you want they never seem to have in stock. The cashiers frequently over charge so I always have to check my bill and I find mistakes more often than not. I still shop here for bakery products and tall grass beef, but everything else I get at Dominick's. As Holden Caufield said ""I quit going there entirely, eventually"". EDIT: Just found out this morning that the new Cafe manager informed all the employees that they will no longer be allowed to accept tips, and that any tips received by management will be donated to the Chicago Food Depository. WTF???

39721,"Longman & Eagle is the type of restaurant that stands out in many ways. Its creative food menu sounds amazing on paper -- and actually backs it up taste-wise. My fiancee and I opted for one order of the ""Fight of the Pig"" tasting menu (an absolute steal at $45/person) and then supplemented that with a few other dishes. The rundown below: * Amuse: Country pate. Pretty much what most pate tastes like. As a pate fan, I was pleased. * First Course: Grilled sausage. Rich, rustic flavors. It came with an Ephemere Beer Syrup that was absolutely delicious. * Second Course: Roast Loin with bluga lentils. The roast loin was a little on the dry side but still quite good, especially paired with the tasty lentils. * Third Course: Crepniette of Fresh Ham. In case you're wondering what is a crepinette, imagine a big meatball made of pulled pork. Terrific dish -- full of flavor. * Fourth Course: Braised Belly. Very fatty but what do you expect with pork belly? It came with a black caramel sauce which sounds odd but tasted amazing. * Fifth Course: Tet de Cochon. Grounded up and served as a thick patty. Nice crunch on the exterior and porky goodness inside! Excellent dish. * Dish 1: Duck Rillettes ($5). Comes in a little jar and served with crispy pieces of bread. Essentially duck paste -- and I mean that in a good way. * Dish 2: Smoked Sweetbreads ($10). Not as heavily battered as how sweetbreads are typically prepared at other restaurants. It brought out the gaminess of the dish, which I actually enjoyed a lot. * Dish 3: Sunchoke Bisque with Nantucket Bay Scallops ($9). The bisque had a rich flavor, which was accentuated well by the sweetness of the scallops. My fiancee is normally not a soup/bisque fan but she enjoyed this dish a lot. In terms of libations, there's something for everybody, with a definite emphasis on whiskey. I stuck with beers (nice selection of draft and bottled options) but I might be tempted to give one of the whiskey flights a whirl next time. Service is friendly and laidback in that Logan Square kind of way (think tats, piercings and lots of flannel). The ambiance evokes a neighborhood watering hole feel, which is to say very bustling and lively but neither pretentious or douchey. Only minor complaints would be that the wait time can be a bear (we ended up eating at the bar, which turned out to be fine) and parking is difficult in the area if you plan on driving (nearby street parking is enforced by 24-hour zone permits). That being said, Longman & Eagle is definitely worth the trouble and a terrific addition to the Logan Square dining scene.",9/17/2010,IGZXBEUD,jt49xjEjQisu6wTTGn6B3A,m5_GCJP2W4zEJnyVgxa3eA,N,3,1

Then the parade of amazeballs meat starts....and it keeps coming. Bacon wrapped filet mignon? Yes, sir. Ribs? Why not. Care for some pork loin? Who wouldn't. House sirloin? Gimme. And still, there was more. To go with all these meats are some fabulous sides, that are readily replenished (I think I ate 4 of those big honkin' plantains). But obviously, the meat is the star of the show here. And I had plenty of that.

We decided to split a papaya salad and three entrees - tofu with sprouts, catfish in a clay pot, and some sort of chicken/lemongrass dish. The food came fairly quickly and everything was so delicious and flavorful. The papaya salad and the chicken lemongrass dish both had very fresh, bright flavors, while the catfish was nice peppery.

60095,"Good food and good service. I went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed--line ups out both doors. If you go alone or only with a couple friends then you probably won't have to wait too long because they'll seat you wherever there are seats, even if it means sharing a large round table with strangers (I sat alone at a table with three friends, a couple, and a old man). When it's busy, don't bother waiting for help to come around. Just get their attention and they'll be more than happy to help. The food was pretty standard fare for a good Vietnamese restaurant, and it came out pretty fast despite all the people. The price was fair although I've had cheaper for the same quality, but that's hard to find. Two spring rolls, vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and shrimp and egg roll, and iced coffee (unless you like your coffee bitter, make sure you get it with the condensed milk) ran me $15 and change.If you don't want to wait, I suggest you walk down the block to Vietnamese Thai Binh Restaurant.

This was served atop a root vegetable hash and stuffed with a fois gras stuffing, I say again...Amazing!!!! Between the second and third course we were pleasantly surprised with a course consisting of complementary local hard cider and the best grilled cheese I have ever eaten.

3533,"Who knew that the best fried chicken in Chicago would be can be found at a Korean joint? Well, it is. The boyfriend wanted to go out for some kick-butt chicken to celebrate his birthday, and he'd suggested this place. I was a bit leery, knowing that the neighborhood isn't the easiest to park in, but figured what the heck. I'm glad we went. So, last Sunday, we headed out to try something completely different.  Parking (metered street parking) wasn't as bad as I feared. When we walked in I was a bit surprised at how small the place was. I'd estimate there were about four large picnic-style tables and counter seating around the walls & front window. The place was pretty full, but we found seating without too much trouble. He got the funke chicken combo (a whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 sodas) and I got the Baby Budda bowl (brown rice ) with a side dish of Kim Chee (There's a choice of cabbage or radish style). The Plain Jane chicken was great. Just the right amount of spice and very crispy, yet tender. The onion rings and fried mushrooms were awesome and I really liked the spicy mayo dip that came with em. The BF was VERY satisfied with everything too. I was also impressed with the Kim Chee and the portions were very generous. That 'Baby' Buddha bowl was HUGE, excellently spiced and totally satisfied my semi-vegetarian soul. Even the fried egg on top was good. The best part is that when the BF mentioned it was his birthday, they gave him a coupon for a free chicken on his next visit! AWESOME!!!

Portions are perfect, with not too much sauce or too much cheese, its nice when you're not being smacked over the head by an overdose of a particular flavor. The service at Giordano's is significantly better than the other big pizza chains. Even when its really busy, as it always is, it seems like we're well attended to and treated very well. The biggest problem with Giordano's is that there is always a wait of at least an hour or more, unless you get there for lunch right when they open. They won't take reservations, so you have to wait around all night for it, so its not something I frequent.

And no I am not moving, I am boycotting and I suggest taking care when you go there and who you bring with you. This has been my favorite chinese restaurant since I moved to Chicago four years ago and I have never had a problem until I went yesterday with a friend who'd never been there. I have always been served quickly, friendly, over the top good when visiting in the past and I raved about the service and great food to my friend I brought with me this visit. The service we got was an outrage. At first I thought it was just because it was kind of busy (all of the tables were full but there was no one waiting to be seated). But as time passed not only did I notice something was up, my friend noticed...and the table of five sitting next to us noticed to the point they even commented on it. I thought it was us as a pair. Two people taking up a four chair table during the dinner rush...looking around though there were a couple other tables such as ours. Maybe it was how we were dressed...nope couldn't be; my friend had a nice blouse, sweater, and nice jeans on. I had a skirt, clean, unwrinkled tshirt on. We looked very presentable.Maybe they thought we would not order enough. It's family style plates...we ordered four dishes between the two of us. So couldn't be that.I thought it was just busy and they couldn't do for us what they'd do when it was slow...nope they took care of all the tables around us with utmost care. My friend needed extra napkins, then a box. Both times it took at least three attempts to politely get someone to acknowledge her before she finally got someone's attention by being a little rude. I needed a box. I did a casual look around with that I need something look on my face and three people ran to my aide. I should probably mention that I am white, my friend is black.It was not us they did not like it was my friend. I am HORRIFIED that they discriminated against her! Had I known they treated people differently I would never have given them my business. I most certainly would never have suggested going there to her had I even thought they'd treat her (or anyone) poorly, and I most certainly will never go back! Oh and in case you are wondering, it was not in our heads that this happened. It was so obvious that the table of five next to us even commented to us that they could not believe the lack of service directed our way when the staff went out of their way for every other table in the room.",4/7/2011,MLt2TOhiYOuurEXyEE2UfA,WZnRrpcK7D8Aa-O8cUYgrg,yBRaSkuYwFhYEoucDyD0lA,Y,5,0

26574,"Very, very good Mexican, Tex-Mex! Went here on Friday night at about 7 pm. This place was packed.  The set-up is kind of odd for the table wait. A line just forms through the front dining room in between tables. So if you're so lucky to have one of those tables, you'll have a constant line of people hovering over you pigging out on your food. And the line does not stop! The line was constant 20 deep through the front door. The good thing about the line is that it goes pretty quick. We waited for about 15 minutes. When we were seated, they give you chips and two salsas. A red salsa and a verde salsa. The verde salsa was smokey and definitely better than the fresh red salsa. They was give you a bowl of picked vegetables that had a real spicy bite. All the entrees are cheap! Most things are in the $6-12 range for a ton of food! My wife had the tamales which she loved. I had the Fajitas Nortenas which were thick cuts of skirt steaks. This dish was huge. I made 3 fajitas and had enough to make 3 more that I brought home. I must also say that refried beans was so good. I usually don't like refried beans, but these were the right texture and creaminess. Paying for your tab is also kind of odd. There is a cash register at the back of the room by the kitchen where you bring your check and pay. I think the waitresses can actually take your payment also, but that probably would take some time. The service was fine, but our waitress didn't come around too often and left us sitting for awhile before we were able to get our check. All in all, this is great, cheap place for Mex food.

I came here with my sister early morning before the crowd and we got our order in and a table. It became busy super fast (lots of STROLLERS, omg, kill me now) and when we got our food, I was so disappointed. It was bland and nothing special. I had some-type of pancake and it was a bit dry. I don't know if I was expecting too much since I was hoping to go here for sometime. Sis had the huevos rancheros and they were okay, but nothing different from other breakfast places. It was also a bit pricey. I finished my food and was hungry again rather quickly. Coffee was good at least.",9/27/2011,JvN7Xlbal5OGMn6N6bqduw,rfL8lz9kpTMsi72KGAlUZg,qqax04alS3UPx0Yp4jJNDQ,N,3,1

Both of us had to get to go boxes because the food was so good and good portioned we couldn't finish it all.Our server Maria was also the perfect touch.

Our first impression was really messed up by a hostess that made us sit at a table near the door (it was like 40 out and cold as hell) while there were open tables everywhere. We asked if we could take some of the other tables but were told they are all reserved. Our first instinct was to leave right then but we decided to stay and give the place a shot. We really were disappointed to see that all the ""reserved"" tables remained empty the entire time we were stuck next to the door freezing our azz off.

41171,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Chicago since I proposed the idea that it would be a fun place to go to for his birthday. He had never been before so I figured it would be a fun, short trip. We always do a traditional dinner and so after a quick search at our hotel lobby's computer, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse popped up! We both had heard of the popular steakhouse so we gave it a try. What an AWESOME idea! The service was wonderful and the food was out of this world!!!! We both ordered the Ruth's classic which is a combo dinner you can get that includes a soup or salad, the entree with a side, and a dessert. Our server, Andy, was great and even brought my boyfriend some raspberry sorbet along with some candles for my boyfriend's birthday dessert! I ordered the caesar salad which was above average for your typical caesar salad. The dressing was in the perfect amount for me. My boy ordered the onion au gratin soup (which was pretty much French onion soup) and it was SO good. Honestly, I could not describe the flavors because you will just have to go try it yourself. YUM. I am drooling just thinking about it. We both ordered the filet with mine being medium, and my boo's medium rare. The steak came SIZZLING, and I mean SIZZLING on its plate in all its glory! It was an excellent cut of meat and was cooked to perfection. The garlic mashed potatoes were good as well! The service was great and the food better! I would highly recommend this place if you are craving a perfectly cooked steak!",11/11/2011,PBeqQLv3TF4KnuSJQFvRLg,slcevKgjt8SolEsWukqXOQ,ALwH81_sqskLmwfWS-_eeQ,N,3,1

58444,"I think I must have lived in Chicago in a former life because ever since first visiting it in 1995, it has always felt like home to me each time I return and I try & return a lot! Anyway - on to Calo's. I was introduced to this restaurant about 3 years ago by a dear friend who lives in the area and that was my first encounter with little pillows of heaven called Asiago (or Gorgonzola) gnocchi. There are literally not descriptive enough words to describe the flavor sensations provided by those little morsels. To be honest, I didn't notice much about anything else (ambiance, service staff, other food) even though I've been back several times until my last visit on February 20th, 2010. This visit was exceptional in every way. Had a reservation for 8:30 but arrived a little early and spent that time in the bar area, drinking a wonderful tanq10 & tonic and watching the Olympics while chatting with my dinner partner.  I would say the age range of the people there were late 20s to mid 50s and the crowd was a pretty eclectic mix. We were seated maybe 10 minutes after our reservation time but it was extremely crowded that night so I didn't mind. We were seat and our wonderful waiter, Juan, was there almost immediately while the wonderful focaccia bread & fresh french bread was delivered to the table. He was so nice as to show us a plate of one of the specials (my partner is apparently in need of visuals) and took our appetizer order.The steamed mussels in red sauce were DIVINE!!! Hot, tender, tasty, the sauce not overbearing the seafood. We ate every single one and then sopped up the remaining sauce with the bread. YUMMMM!!!!Next came minestrone soup (for my partner) and salad with balsamic vinaigrette for me. Love that the salad comes on a cold plate and the salad was very fresh & crisp and tasty! Partner totally enjoyed the soup. Now on to wonderfulness - my pillows of heaven (asiago this time) and lamb chops for my partner. We shared both and both were just amazing in both presentation, taste, temperature, etc.  And last on the list - dessert. Obviously after that big meal, there wasn't room for much else but I need something clean - perfect answer: Italian Lemonade (really a lemon ice). Slightly sweet & tart .. perfecto! Juan, our waiter, was absolutely the best - so attentive, we never had to wait for anything. As I said, it was a really busy night but he managed to keep up with our needs as well as what seemed like a 1/4 of the main restaurant. The manager came over & introduced himself about half way through the main course and inquired how things were. It was my partner's first time there so he got a little more attention. Manager (can't remember his name damnit!) was very nice & actually came over one more time right when we were ready to go.I would recommend this place to anyone that is going to be in the Andersonville area. It's prices are reasonable and the ambience and service as well as the food are worth every penny! Enjoy!",1/12/2012,WYhMvgHmEheuKu-emQz_DQ,3C_GbZaX0xoarBTP7dppog,oLM9piDKbj2PDgy-m3XEcQ,Y,1,0

Once seated it turns out they had given our $25 bottle of wine which was in the fridge to another table and gave us a cheap bottle that was left in there. We received no comp for the mistake and no apology. After waiting for 2.5 hours, we were rushed through our meal b/c it was almost closing time. Shame on us for waiting that long.

I've come a long way since my dad and my uncle convinced my sister and I that the calamari at Olive Garden were onion rings.  Anyway . . . my friends and I split two specials, both of which were quite tasty. The menu is varied and the wine list is reasonably priced. Also, you can sign up for their mailing list.

Speaking of their own beers, recently they have released a new one called The Marquis, which is a great, great Belgian-style Tripel.

31078,"I had been dying to try Sunda since it opened. I recently started working right around the corner and was craving Asian so decided to take the opportunity give Sunda a try. The only positive was that the staff was surprisingly very nice, especially the bartender who handled my takeout order. The negative = the food. I ordered the Loompya and Lo Mein with beef off of the lunch menu. I really wanted to try the sushi instead but couldn't fathom spending that much money on lunch ($30 wasalready pushing it...) I'm pretty convinced the Loompya came from a freezer bag. You know those terrifying frozen snack taquitos soccer moms feed to their kids? Yeah... I'm pretty convinced the loompya here is made by the same company. They didn't taste fresh to me whatsoever. Several of my coworkers tried them as well and agreed, many of them joking that it's something that would be decent when you're drunk --- but that's about it. The Lo Mein was super greasy (and that's going out on a limb for me since my grease tolerance is pretty high, ha). The dish in general was bland and so greasy that I could only eat about 1/4 of the dish before tossing it. The only positive was the bok choy mixed in. In short? I don't get the hype. I'm guessing that perhaps Sunda is better known for their sushi than for their other dishes? If I had bought the loompya and lo mein from a street cart or a food court and had paid $7 for it, I'd totally be fine. But getting it from such a buzzed-about restaurant and paying $30 for things off of the lunch menu? BLEH. Not a fan.",3/16/2012,Tsb7Vh7KoXsGw1BfY,dxuFzLpA3Fz8dWJbw8Unrg,8d_DiHWB-pjBVW3a7D8EWg,N,5,1
21507,"Ok, I've been to XOCO for breakfast once and lunch twice now. Time to write a review. Breakfast: Went at 10:10 to avoid the breakfast 'rush.' There was only one person in line at the time. Maybe I was more into brunch that day. Who knows. All I know is that they were out of everything when I went there, save for the egg and chorizo torta. I had this and a churro for breakfast. The torta was $7.50, and pretty much worth the price. Had avocado, mushrooms, egg, chorizo...I'm thinking cheese, too. Came with a mild green salsa. Overall, wasn't amazingly flavorful. Not a 'knock your socks off' chorizo spice - more mild. But good. The churro has an interesting flavor to it. Can't place it exactly. Came out warm and sugary. Almost too sugary, maybe...but I'm not complaining. It was good. Next time I am coming earlier for the empanadas. And bakery - which looks great! Lunch: 1st visit...came at about 1:45pm, again to avoid the lunch rush. Waited for maybe 3 minutes behind two or three people. I asked the cashier's opinion on what to get. They suggested chochinita pibil torta and the 'royal' mexican chocolate drink. I obliged. They gave me my number, I got some flat spring water that they have on tap - also have the sparkling spring water on tap and some tasty looking flavored waters/juices, which I didn't get. Sat down at a table and waited. Maybe 5 minutes later they brought out the mexican chocolate, and I rushed into it and burned my mouth. Whoops. Wait a moment when you get it. It is worth it. Very rich and delicious. Then, maybe 5-10 min later I got the torta. It comes on a harder roll with shredded pork and pickled onions. At least I think they are pickled. It also comes with habanero sauce. I have been here twice and people always burn their mouth off with the habanero sauce. Be careful! I did this too, then tried to drink the hot chocolate to wash it down...disaster. Ouch. From what I could taste after that, the sandwich was delicious. The bread was a little on the tough/hard side, but overall I really enjoyed the meal. It was a little expensive, though. I remember paying upwards of $20. Oh that's right, I had the tres leches cake too. That was solidly above average, and I'm not even a big fan of that type of cake. Lunch # 2 consisted of the guacamole and chips and the 'pepito' torta. And some mexican chocolate afterwards. The guacamole is really fresh and good, but there is not enough based on the amount of chips you get. Oh well. The pepito is basically a shortrib sandwich with cheese, and green salsa on the side. It was really good. Warm, oozing, flavorful. I would order this again. They were a little late giving us the mexican chocolate. No biggie. This time I got the version with spicy stuff in it (Aztec in the title?). That was really good. Maybe it was because I could taste it this time, but it was better than the royal version I got the first time. Not quite as thick, with a hint of spicy. I would say about XOCO that I never walk away saying 'oh my gosh that was amazing!!' It is always solid, but I don't crave it afterwards. I want to, but I don't. Is that weird? I'll probably keep trying, though. Solid place overall. Worth at least 2-3 visits before you make up your mind because they have a diverse menu. And you'll probably get to see Rick Bayless if you go during normal hours, as I have seen him there as I walked past the window several times.",10/13/2010,tVJHACWl5Vj7weMyb9nMAw,T2sxp4M0XId87UHFRrgqoA,xXSMc3pDWTRQHLgjBTtTUg,N,5,1

30753,"The Sunda Experience -as I'd like to call it- is one not to be missed! It begins the moment you walk through the door. You will find that the staff here is quick, attentive and extremely accommodating from beginning to end. The decor of Sunda is stylish and chic yet inviting. I can honestly say I have been in here several times now- mostly dinner and once for lunch- and I have never been happier each time! Sunda continues to get better and better- with the food and the service! The place definitely gets crowded as this seems to be THE spot for dinner and drinks on weekends and even weeknights. A reservation is recommended as the wait could be long... even so, I assure you this is well worth the wait. If you do find yourself with a wait, no biggie because you can start with a cocktail in at the bar or in the lounge right behind it! I love their Blushing Geisha, Strawberry Delight & Divine Lychee! Sunda offers a wide array of Asian dishes with a Sunda twist. The following are some of my favorites that you can't go wrong with: Appetizers- the Oxtail Potstickers are absolutely to die for! These potstickers have braised oxtail meat that is full of all the right flavors and super tender Hot Dishes: Rock Shrimp Tempura:honey glazed shrimp with walnuts and cream aoli...*droooooollll* Whoops excuse me* , Longevity noodles: lo mein with a garlicky and buttery goodness, try it with blue crab! Miso Black Cod, Chicken Kurry (lunch menu) Sushi favorites: Golden Child Roll, Summer of Sunda Roll, Handcut Tuna & Jalepeno, & Seared Kobe Beef Tartare- the last two are on a top of crispy rice! Dessert: I forget the name but its this fried ice cream with caramel and cake- a must get as well!!! This is big enough to share. Sunda has also been offering happy hour specials and sunday brunch from what I hear...which I still need to try.

54940,"Bucktown is lucky to have such an accomplished cafe, that-- for some reason-- has yet to garner big crowds. On the surface, Bonsoiree looks the part of a quiet, neighborhood joint; a place to hang out, grab coffee, and maybe write email. But behind the casual facade, is a seriously talented team of chefs, who kick out a thoughtful and fresh range of flavors.Though I've eaten brunch and dinner at Bonsoiree, I've become a brunch regular and, like another yelp reviewer, have developed a bit of an addiction to the truffle omelette. It's fantastic; perfectly prepared every time I've ordered it. And the manchego hash browns are an excellent combo for the smoky, earthy wedge of truffle heaven beside them. I've also had the grand marnier french toast, and it was stellar, as well. What about the coffe? Some cafes are content offering Intelligentsia brews. Fine. It's decent stuff. But it's not nearly as good as the Italian beans Kurt and Shin grind. Four cups of Intelligentsia and I start sweating like Jeremy Piven on speed...the Bonsoiree coffee is much smoother, less acidic, and well balanced. My wife and I live in the S. Loop, and though there are a few spots to find a nice brunch (Bongo Room, Cuatro, Giocco), none compares to Bonsoiree. When the place gets its close-up on Check Please, it will be farewell to the quiet, no wait walk-in brunches and dinners, but a well deserved bow for Shin and Kurt. Bravo guys! PS.

I arrived at Grand Lux on a wednesday night, in the middle of dinnertime, with a party of 4 and no reservations. we were seated within 15 minutes, at a nice booth with a view of the city. our server was attentive and informative, letting the Lux virgins (myself included) know how the fresh-baked desserts work and answering all of our questions happily. we started with some appetizers - chicken lettuce wraps, calamari/shrimp/veggie tempura, and the soup of the night - and drinks - I went for the watermelon martini (very tasty, and a nice presentation). after eating most of the tempura myself and a few bites of soup, I was already completely satisfied - the portions are huge! luckily, I ordered a small salad for my meal, and was able to finish most of it without feeling heavy or overly stuffed. I also tried the thai chicken pizza and a beef dish that I didn't catch the name of, both of which were delicious. for dessert, which is baked when you order it with your meal, and delivered to your table hot, we had the new orleans style beignets - fried dough puffs filled with sweet cream and covered in powdered sugar. they're served with three dipping sauces - chocolate, raspberry and more sweet cream, and are seriously amazing. I ate way more than I should have, and still had to take about half the order home with me! for a meal so big and so delicious, the prices were suprisingly low.

I ate it, because it's CHEESE, but it was so salty...I'd probably never order it again simply because of that.I agree with most on here who says the food seems like it was sitting around for a while...I ordered the seafood kabob and the shrimp were hard as rocks...I mean they were TOUGH! The entire kabob was really bland, so needless to say, I really didn't enjoy eating it. The salmon was cold and chewy...I KNOW that kabob was sitting out..you could tell by the texture and temperature of the food. NOT GOOD GUYS. My baked veggies that came on the side were actually veggie mush...it looked like stew....they were WAY overcooked. I just couldn't see what the big deal about this place is. The staff were OVERLY hydrating us by constantly filling our water glasses after ONE sip.

We had the empanada and the ropa vieja to start - loved the presentation, loved the flavor. For dinner, I ordered the fillet and the boyfriend had the arroz con mariscos. Our server had described a rib eye as the special, accompanied by, what he called, ""potatoes on crack"". Baked potatoes loaded with goat cheese and bacon and some other amazing additions. I REALLY wanted those potatoes with my fillet. Really.  I knew this was not Burger King - and therefore I was not guaranteed to have it my way. The server hedged. I protested ""It's my birthday! Do you think the chef can make an exception?"" To which our server responded, ""EVERYONE in here is celebrating a birthday. Believe me, that's not so special."" Ouch. Just when I was considering we should knock a few bucks off the tip for 'smarminess', our dinner arrived and I was happy to see that I did, indeed, have the 'potatoes on crack'.  They were DELICIOUS...as was the fillet. So tender and flavorful. We were told that Carnivale serves up an average of 900 dinners on a weekend night. Given that number, they'd have to be spot on with quality. And aside from the not so spot on comment from our server, this was a mighty fine birthday dinner, indeed!",4/23/2007,t80e3GqC3EQoEJwRB7QQVA,vVGUu4CBBQBfgHPvOOl-fQ,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg,N,4,1

55162,"This place is awesome!!!!! We just went there last night for my boyfriend's birthday. I made a reservation on Open Table and to my surprise a variety of times were available to make a reservation. I could write a step by step, detailed review, but it is very simple what this place comes down to. The service (host, busser, waiter, manager) was EXQUISITE! The bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips that welcomed us to our table were outstanding. We ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppies ( I know, right ?! Just typing it sounds naughty) to start. And, yes, they were out of this world. My boyfriend ordered the St.Louis competition ribs with pulled pork and I ordered the flight of BBQ. I truly felt that I should have started a human tunnel for our dinner to be brought to our table because of how great the meats were prepared. We ended with the seasonal cobbler. In addition, the wine and beer list was great, not an overwhelming number of choices. However, the selected items on the beer and wine list were well thought out. I have ventured to Lillie Q, Smoke Daddy, and Honky Tonk. Don't get me wrong, those places have great BBQ as well; but Chicago Q is a step above and is the over all package.",10/26/2011,8s6zfBel2n3OnidSxRNBTQ,oR5ucI9DSr4KlbpKGrhEUg,euO3-H92LCivH2B0CQPlnw,Y,2,0
36746,This place is everything I dream of a breakfast place being. My friend and I were totally undecided at noon on a Saturday about where to go for brunch. We were riding our bikes somewhere else when we approached it and I yelled STOP!!! My friend had mentioned how good this place was the day before. The wait was nothing. Maaaaybe 15 minutes. I like the size. I really appreciate how they have so many 4top tables that are only seating 2 people. It makes it far less crowded than most of the brunch places in this city. I have only amazing things to say about this place. I ordered some kind of smoothie with bananas and nonfat frozen yogurt and hazelnut and it was amazing. I got the standard two-egg breakfast and everything was as perfect and simple as you could hope for. The reds are sooooo good. Amazing fresh jams. Super good coffee. Everything cooked to perfection. And there are so many things on the menu I want to try. And they have a juice bar. I heart you Meli.,12/28/2007,G0SfcNReD17VHhzen0zBTw,3_eK7S3FSWeosQ8mavK8AQ,qkfBgSCbekH3DHTanVL1_w,N,4,1
40829,"Writing a review for Bonsoiree is quite daunting because the food is just so unique and full of creativity. I could barely keep track what occurred in my mouth between courses as the tidal wave of flavors and textures nearly short circuited my brain. So therefore: The food at Bonsoiree is quite good. We've been there twice for an extremely playful Underground dinner as well as their thoughtful Valentine's day aphrodisiac menu (Yes, it got me laid). The crab/scallop motoyaki and ""pub crawl trio"" haunt my taste buds' collective dreams. If I had to pick a weakness it's that the desserts couldn't stand up to the previous courses' amazement. But that may due to my personal preference to savory over sweet. And I am in love with their silverware. THEIR KNIVES STAND UP! The only reason I am subtracting a star is because the chefs kept hitting on my girlfriend when I used the restroom.

I couldn't decide between the Shepard's Pie and the Meatloaf, so going off the waiter's recommendation, I went with the meatloaf. I was not disappointed. I hadn't had any meatloaf this good - well, ever. And the onion rings were melt in your mouth deliciousness, as well. All in all, this place is comfy, cozy and HUGE.

However, we were seated exactly when we made a reservation for. We got there a little early for a drink, and after having my first drink the bartender suggested a pomegranate martini, which I was a little unsure of. The bartender made me one and let me have it on the house. The food was great - we had baked clams and shrimp cocktail for appetizers. My husband loved the extra spicy horseradish in his shrimp cocktail sauce. We both had some sushi which wasn't the greatest that I have ever had, but didn't dissapoint either. The yellow-fin tuna was excellent and had a great sauce.

58124,"Mercat a la Planxa is a great restaurant for a casual evening with a loved one or with a group of friends. The variety of tapas is similar to what you may have experienced at other tapas restaurants, but with a little upscale touch or twist to them.Upon arriving I was a little put off by the fact that some of the seats in the small entry-way bar were reserved. To my friends and I it was a little strange that there would actually be reserved seats in such a tiny space. Mercat a la Planxa has an extensive list of specialty cocktails as well as house-made sangria. We all opted for the sangria. It was good and multiples were ordered, but it was not outstanding. Having said that, at the time of our reservation we were escorted upstairs to the dining room which was like a breath of fresh air; two-story, lots of light and fun decor.At first, the menu can be a little intimidating even for someone who has had tapas many times before. Our waiter explained the menu to us and the layout of it made much more sense. The waitstaff was excellent, very attentive and more than willing to answer any questions that we had. I would describe the food as traditional tapas with a twist. An example would be that traditional bacon-wrapped dates are actually bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with almonds. This was definitely a favorite at our table. My table started off with approximately 4 -5 plates and kept one of our menus so that we could order more as we felt necessary. Our waiters recommended 3-4 plates per person and their recommendation was quite accurate. Please keep in mind that these are small plates. Some of them are much smaller than others. The pasta dishes are quite small.All of the food was delicious with a couple exceptions. Of course this is all based on individual taste. Presentation was excellent for all of the items we ordered as well as the items we saw arriving at other tables. One item that stood out as something that may need a little work was the walnut sorbet. After tasting it, I thought it tasted like something, but couldn't put my finger on it. My other half had the best description which I thought was incredibly accurate. They described the sorbet as tasting like Play-doh.My friends and I can't wait to go back to Mercat a la Planxa and try the many other items on the menu. We averaged approximately $60 per person for both food and drinks including tip. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great tapas and a good time.",2/12/2012,fvaBgAJC9PrE6maaIuSxww,sxg4CJGFnNJ6FBR54Rsjaw,o4NcUfco7JxOcyfKFWyAhg,Y,4,0

43858,"Going to a steakhouse is not commonplace for me. Although I am a meat lover, I find it difficult to focus all my energy on just a piece of meat....so I went to a steakhouse last night and ordered fish.. We had a reservation and were seated immediately; however, it was a Sunday evening, so I did not expect anything less. The restaurant looked nice, but a little cluttered with a lot of tables fitted into the front room. The back room looked like it had booths, but I only saw that from the corner of my eye - so I could be totally off. The table for four that we were seated at was small for the number of things they had on it. I felt crowded, but after a while got used to it. The rest of the dining experience was positive - good, prompt service.  I ordered the halibut was cooked to perfection, sprinkled with coarsely ground, black pepper, and served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus. The sauce had the just the right amounts of ginger and lime, making for an appetizing, filling and reasonably healthy meal. The three diners I was with ordered the summer special, which included a choice of appetizer (1 of 2) entree (1 of 3) and dessert (1 of 2). The portions were nicely sized, although the grilled shrimp entree only included 4 shrimp. The veggies were fresh and nicely seasoned. The Decadent Chocolate Cake was delicious, but I felt the Chocolate Terrine could have been less chilled...kind of difficult to get the full effect of chocolate mousse if the temperature is not right. I also tasted the rum cheesecake, which was good.  I started this review with four stars, then took one away as I realized that my dining experience there was good but not stellar .  P.S. for those who have children and like to frequent steakhouses, we saw an infant at one of the tables. Another peculiar observation - the majority of people were really dressed down - shorts, tank tops, jeans etc. Not quite what I expected.",4/29/2010,lLALj-FckX-MEbLoObvEdg,ZER5cxahfU7AN8okZu9InA,rnjz2KNgsQ2YaC_kjeuuAQ,N,4,1

It gets really loud too if its crowded, and its pretty much always crowded at night, so if you want a little bit of a quieter setting, brave the cold and eat outside in the tented area and sit near the heater :) The service here is really great - They didn't have any seats open when I called in, and they said they would call me back when one opened. My friends and I decided to walk around and go to a wine bar across the street and when our seat opened, they called us. I explained we were in the middle of a glass of wine and they told me they would hold our seats for up to 15 minutes, which I thought was great, considering how long the waiting list was. The servers were all very knowledgable about the wine they served and what would pair well with what you ordered, and they didn't try to push anything on us. I got the panini, and it was just okay, nothing special. Same goes for the bread balls. For both of those, they are perfectly okay, but I probably wouldn't get them again.

Staff seemed very attentive to the regulars and large groups who came through.Appetizer: The bread and Parmesan they bring out is mediocre. Won't spend time beating that up, just bleh. I ordered a Caprese salad which was plated beautifully, taste was average. Served with now balsamic, just oil and pepper. 2 starsMain Course: Asked for the chef's recommendation for the main course. The waiter laughed and said, So you mean my recommendation? He threw out the spaghetti and meatballs or the honey and milk short ribs. The ribs tickled my curiosity so I went with that. The meat was well cooked, very tender not over done. Flavor was everything someone should expect from milk, honey, and meat I guess. Didn't really do anything for me. Not bad, but not a 4. 3 Stars.To be fair I saw some other patron's dishes coming out and had a few Ohh whats that moments. Unfortunately I just seemed to be out of sync with what a lot of you Yelpers have experienced thus far. Dessert: The dessert was far and away this meals saving grace. I went with the tiramisu and wasn't disappointed. It was out of this world. The waiter mentioned it is homemade every day in the restaurant. 5 Stars.Wine: I had the house red throughout the meal with a port for dessert and was pretty satisfied. 4 Stars.So long and short, I was expecting a once year kind of experience and was sad to say it was very average.

Whether or not it is, I'm glad Irazu served vegetarian food. I got their ""award winning"" veggie burrito. Even as a vegetarian, I've never heard of an award-winning burrito. How can that be? Well, Irazu certainly impressed my taste buds with their veggie burrito. I don't know about award winning, but it was definitely winning over my hungry stomach. First of all, their veggie burrito is monstrous! My hand only wraps around half of the girth of this burrito! Their veggie burrito's tortilla has been grilled on the outside. Reminds me of Taco Bell when they tried to grill their burritos shut. It was good stuff! Thank you Irazu for grilling the exterior of your burritos. As for the stuffing, it was actually a lot of rice and not so much black beans (but this is a great thing for me as i'm not a big fan of black beans). The first half of my burrito that I ate tasted awesome because I think I got the bulk of the creamy avocado slices and not too many peppers. But my second half was mostly peppers and my mouth wanted to die!!!   My bf got their steak casado. It looked good on the plate, but the bf did say that the meat ended up being too dry and he wasn't too thrilled with his dish. Based on everyone's reviews, we knew we had to try their oatmeal shake.

35336,"Preamble: Party of four- ordered the duck the night before with no issue Lets just say this place is now the mayor of Bold City Flavors, USA on foursquare. We ordered the Singapore Mai Fun in addition to the Peking Duck Feast, that was really on point. Noodles were spicy and the pork, shrimp etc were good. The duck come out shortly thereafter, and at that point, i was staring at some all time food porn, you guys. Almost got cut while he was slicing the duck up because i wanted all the crunchy skin parts to myself, but it worked out. Bao's were tremendous...drumsticks were crunchy - again very bold. Duck fried rice was good - the fried rice wasnt incredible but the duck was a nice touch. Didn't really have room for the soup - this place gets the fifth star because of the price: whole bill with 1 drink apiece totaled to $22/per person.

30414,"Came here on Christmas Day (yikes!) with the bf's family and my mom. It was crowded of course (being Christmas we expected lots of people) but we were seated promptly which was nice (FYI they would not seat us until all of our party was together, so if people are running late, etc. plan accordingly). We refused to pay the $11.99 valet service fee. really? The ambiance of Sunda is nice, with warm lights and Asian inspired decor. However, it is LOUD. I could barely hear myself think. My mom, who has trouble hearing, could barely make out anything people were saying right next to her, let alone the waiter talking about the menu at the other end. We basically had to shout at one another at one table.They had music playing, which in the end, was not needed as people's voices took over any sound in the speakers. gross. They have Sapporo on tap, so that's good. My mom wanted a mango ice tea. Several minutes later, servers set down two carafes of plain ice tea and soda water. They then set down mango and pomegranate syrup so we could mix the flavors into our drink of choice. A nice effort, but there was no explanation of how much syrup to mix in a glass, or why we had to mix our own drinks in the first place. We had to help my mom get her own glass of mango ice tea because she didn't understand the concept, and really...I can't blame her. Appetizers were decent but overpriced in my opinion. Everyone seemed to be raving about the brussel sprout salad, but I...just didn't like it. It felt overcooked but no one else complained, so I guess I have weird tastes. The egg rolls tasted like hot dogs, and the crab dish we ordered came in a pot of cooked hot peppers that seemed only to serve as decoration since the crab itself was not spicy. I will say...the shrimp toast with tuna ""jam"" was the best thing we ordered. I usually don't eat tuna, but this was amazing and the textures were just right. I recommend it highly! The entrees were better. We ordered chicken, sea bass, braised short rib, and pork. The ribs fell right off the bone and was seasoned nicely. The chicken was decent, but nothing to write home about. The pork skin was a little too crispy for my taste, but otherwise delicious. The bass was cooked perfectly and tasted great (I recommend that one too!). We were pretty full by this point, but we ordered a few desserts to try. My mom insisted on the chocolate lava cake, which was AMAZING. I love chocolate and anything that oozes chocolate, so that was a win. The fried ice cream also gets my vote..for some reason it tasted like something from my childhood, which brought back crazy memories of summer for some reason. The chef's special dessert of the evening was a walnut/caramel cake with strawberry compote and that was...interesting but not my fave; I found it to be on the heavier side than the rest of the desserts. all in all, an enjoyable experience but I'm not sure if I want to return. Too pricey for what you get; and what you get is a loud room with mediocre appetizers.",1/15/2011,jo-1nZf-0hSZIRsLQE5uog,dQDuJcOq_9k0XfMrkT74PQ,7mCeefskNUtOkzxt_MLHKA,N,3,1

29358,"Let me start by saying if it were just the food, this would be five stars, hands down. I had the duck tacos, and they were fantastic. Everyone at my table loved their food - especially the mole which was to die for, and we shared guacamole and queso fundido, both of which were some of the best I've ever had. The margaritas, too, were delicious. But, I have to drop it down to three stars because everything else was that bad. It's not the restaurant's fault we were there in the middle of a heat wave, or that we had to stand outside for two hours to get in. But it is their fault for not having properly functioning air conditioning or some appropriate alternative. It was literally hotter inside than out, and we were grossly uncomfortable. Everyone was complaining, including a large party eventually seated next to us, which prompted the manager to bring a fan out of the kitchen and point it directly at them. Of course that didn't help everyone else. In addition to being that hot, the service was painfully slow. After waiting two hours and then being seated in the sweltering heat without any explanation, our server took so painfully long for EVERYTHING. It was close to two hours before he brought our meals out, which was excessive even considering that we'd been there about an hour before he ever bothered to take our orders. He was awful and totally unapologetic, the kitchen was slow, the management seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I would love to go here again for the food, but unless we somehow ended up with a reservation and it was 60 degrees outside, never again.",7/9/2012,YbsE7UASvNUtW35IimiV0w,ZCwFd2FOf34LMYwRnxu4fw,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw,N,3,1

We ordered the Bufalina pizza (mozzarella made with buffalo milk), a beer, and a Diet Coke. The Diet Coke came in a cute little glass bottle, something I'd never seen at a restaurant. The wood-fired pizza was a little over-done and had a few burnt spots, but had an excellent balance of cheese and sauce (definitely not cheesy like the pizzas I'm used to).

I feel like they could cut the portions (especially on the omelettes and toast) and the price, and be a way fairer deal.

Their veggie casado wasn't very inspired, but their veggie burrito (maybe not 100% traditional Costa Rican food - something my friend in Costa Rica gave me a hard time about), is AMAZING... especially when you add mushrooms and zucchini.

It was by far the juiciest, most flavorful cut of meat we had had in a very long time. I also felt it was a great value. The a la carte items are good portions that can be split.

16825,"In an unmarked building. Looks like a boarded-up construction site. There is a door panel that opens in a white plywood wall lining the streetfront. Once inside the door pass through a series of curtains to find the Violet Hour. They really don't want people to find the place easily, and don't want random people to wander inside by accident. The complete opposite of every trashy dive bar in the Wicker Park area. They have a dress code, the staff wear suits and are friendly and knowledgeable, the patrons are classy, the music is excellent. Mixed drinks are served in a chilled cocktail glass with a small accompanying glass flask containing the remaining portion. Bartenders are very skilled and meticulous about the preparation of the drinks. Considering the expertise and technique required to prepare them well, the price is reasonable. Better value than innumerable other places where drinks are watered-down and carelessly or incorrectly prepared. Also many tasty items on the food menu which are above-average fare. One of the bartenders went to culinary school and was apparently a chef before joining the staff. I misheard something that one of the servers said: ""The house cocktails are listed on the thirty-fourth page of the menu"" - actually what she said was: ""on the 3rd and 4th page of the menu"". There might as well be 34 pages, though. For example there is an entire page devoted to varieties of mezcal, which was impressive because not many people drink it at all.  There are three large seating areas in separate rooms. Most seats are free-standing arrangements of high-backed square chairs covered with pale violet cloth, there are also booths with a similar minimalistic motif. There are two sections of the bar in separate rooms which have a limited number of additional seats. There are fireplaces with mantlepieces built into the walls. Basically, come here with friends, or with someone whom you want to get to know better, because it's not a place to mingle with new people. It is not a see-and-be-seen place, either, no one will be looking at you. Perfect place for quiet intelligent conversation. Very subdued setting. Not pretentious, it is totally chill. Almost surreal place which would take a lot of writing to fully explain, read some of the numerous reviews below, put them together, and you will get the general picture.

5679,"I really hate writing negative reviews, but I had an unpleasant experience here last night. I was supposed to have dinner here with 3 of my friends. Two of us showed up and were told that we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. So my friend and I sat at the bar, ordered a couple glasses of wine, and then got the prosciutto bread balls because my friend was starving. The third member of our party showed up and the place was starting to get extremely crowded (it's very small) so we nicely asked if we could be seated now, because our fourth person was going to be there in 5 minutes. They still wouldn't seat us. A few minutes later, our fourth person arrived and we went to the hostess stand and let them know our whole group had arrived. We were told it would be an hour before a table of 4 would be available. My friend looked over her shoulder at a huge table with nobody sitting at it and said, ""Why can't we sit there?"" And the hostess said, ""I have a party of 10 coming in soon and I have to seat THEM there."" So, basically, they don't take reservations or hold tables...for most people. And they'll hold a table for 10 people who haven't shown up yet, but 3 girls out of a party of 4 can't be seated. So we left and I have no inclination to go back there. The wine and food were good, but overpriced (sorry, $13 for a decent but not amazing glass of wine is just crazy to me).

I recently discovered ordering extra cheese to it makes the pizza even better! Im a creature of habit and almost always order my pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese, sometimes ill venture out and get mushroom, sausage and spinach. Either way, you can't go wrong! The crust is a carmalized cheese, which happens due to the pan they use (or so i read somewhere) its nice and crispy. This place gets slammed on game nights, especially during hockey season....actually i think its safe to say its slammed every friday/saturday/sunday night. The pizzas typically take 30min to make so call in ahead and make your drive or order when you get there and enjoy a beer or two at the bar. They serve thin crust as well, pretty good, but i go here for the pan/deep dish...i tell everyone visiting or new to chicago that this is the plac to go to for good chicago pizza.

42479,"Don't let the dark kitschy decor fool you. This is honest good ole fashioned cooking at its best. The restaurant operates humbly and honestly. Everything is so simple and, as a result, extremely enjoyable. Gilt opened in the space formerly occupied by Aigre Doux and has quickly become an instant powerhouse. Don't even think about coming here for dinner or drinks after 8pm any day. Chicagoans have been flocking to Gilt from the day it opened. And with good reason...they have some of the best Bone Marrow in the city because the bones are sliced lengthwise not widthwise. This has 2 advantages: (1) easy to scrape out the marrow (2) create a crispy caramelized crust on the surface of the marrow. For $12, you get three halves of Marrow Bone with 4-5 grilled pieces of bread, parsley, and onion jam. This is a great dish for the table to share. The onion jam is sweet so I use it sparingly. All you need is marrow and their perfectly grilled bread slices. So delicious! Gilt is also arguably serving the best piece of meat you can get in the city. The Chef grills a thick cut of boneless Ribeye steak old school-style over charcoal. The technique adds a natural smoky flavor while charring the outside of the meat. The result is one gratifying luscious hunk of steak that has every attribute you want in every single bite: crispy, fatty, meaty, tender, and juicy. A nordic Viking would be proud of this steak. The restaurant charges $1.25 per ounce for a 18-22 oz piece of meat. The gf and I shared this with a side of brussel sprouts. The menu is very well priced. Where else in the city can you order a 20 oz boneless charcoal grilled Ribeye steak for $25??????? The dinner menu doesn't have any items that are expensive (entrees above $35-40). The wine list is small, but there are some delicious red wines by the glass. And the restaurant offers a $4 house white and red wine. The restaurant also has 4 seats in the rear that serve as kitchen bar seating. Come here and order the $4 house wine and share the bone marrow and the Ribeye. I'll def be a regular at Gilt.",1/24/2010,ELXKvJMwbh3hemu1M5T6QQ,c7X7WQUogj5IETFh09AxCw,ALwH81_sqskLmwfWS-_eeQ,N,4,1

16205,"Simply put, Canivale was amazing! From the scene to the service to the food...it was all fantastic.  The lady and I went here for Valentine's Day and it was understandably packed. As we waited for our table we decided to start things off with a few mojitos. I had the regular and my gf had the Raspberry, and they were both outstanding. Very bright and refreshing, definitely my fav in the city. We walked through the large main dining area as we were escorted to our table and it was truly a sight. The room was bright, vibrant, and full of energy.  We decided to have a sampling of Ceviche and the Ropa Vieja to start our meal. For the Ceviche we went with two Tuna and one Scallop. The Tuna was fresh, but certainly not your typical Ceviche. I would have enjoyed a little more acid, but it was still quite good. I'd describe it more as a Latin inspired Tuna sashimi. The Scallop Ceviche was outstanding. The Scallop and Oyster tasted like the ocean, just how fresh seafood should. The tangerine and chipotle salsa provided a nice balance of sweetness and heat. The Ropa Vieja was amazing! It was ridiculously flavorful, moist, and tender. Along with the beautifully caramelized plantains, this dish was the perfect blend of sweet and savory.  For our main entrees we went with the Churrasco and Carne-Aguayon, along with a side of Mac & Cheese. The Churrasco was very tender, well seasoned, and had a nice hint of smokiness from the wood grill - overall a fantastic cut of meat. The Carne Aguayon was also very flavorful, and was perfectly cooked. The truffle fries would be more accurately described as large potato wedges, but they were still good. The mac & four cheeses was rich and flavorful, just like a good mac & cheese should be. Another caveat, the macaroni is actually rigatoni, but it was great nonetheless.  Service was also very friendly and attentive. As I mentioned, we were here on V-day and it was extremely busy, thereby causing a delay between our appetizers and our entrees. Our waiter was very apologetic and stopped by periodically to keep us updated. The table next to us waited even longer for their entrees but the the waiter and the host treated them to some complimentary guacamole and cocktails to compensate.

38417,"Hands down best Chicago Styled Pizza I've had! The ambience was great, the decor was great and food was spot on. I walked into this place already anxious for some real Chicago Style Pizza for the first time. The awesome aged wood for walls with tags and notes of ""... was here"" made the place feel warm and inviting.  We got the ""special"" stuffed pizza. The cool thing is that when you get pizza with sausage, they give you a choice between ground sausage or a layer of pretty much a sausage pancake. I was skeptical of the layer considering how salty most sausage is, but can't deny the sausage lover in me, i go for the full on pancaked layer. the pizza didn't look like much coming out but once you slice into it and see all the delicious ingredients oozing out you can't help but to drool. The crust is so buttery, light and crispy. The toppings tasted fresh and not so canned, like some other restaurants make it. Thinking that this is how chicago styled pizza is supposed to taste I also visted Lou Malnati's (the ""first"" chicago styled pizzaria). The ""Malnati Chicago Classic"" pizza there was good, but did not have the bold flavors i liked in Giordano's pizza. Also the sauce on the Lou's vegetarian pizza also had the canned tomato flavor that I don't really like. So all in all Giordano's is the place to go for good pizza. I'm gonna have to try Gino's East.

19578,"Coast is one of my favorite go-to sushi restaraunts, and here's why. It's nicer (and pricier) than your mom and pop joint, but not a place that will break the bank either. You can come with a small group of friends, or make it an intimate date destination. Either way you play it, the great ambience + awesome fish + good service + BYOB = a truly stellar evening. What I don't like is the typical hour long wait to get a table. So imagine my absolute surpise and delight when I recently showed up on a weekend night, to a nearly empty waiting area (good for me, not so much for them, I realize). Either way we were sat within 10 minutes, and our server, a friendly redheaded guy took great care of us. Well-versed in the menu and the specials, he made great recommendations and let us continue to order as the rolls came out so we could judge our hunger on a roll-by-roll basis. Very nice. Some of my favorites are the spicy scallop maki, volcano roll, and the toro, kani, and hamachi nigiri. I also really enjoy the gyoza, and the hamachi carpaccio appetizer with the jalepeno and sweet sauce is pure yum. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a roll or piece of fish here that I didn't enjoy. The real test? I recently brought my dearest sushi-lovin' companion, and Coast made him a believer as well.

I had a hard time deciding between the shrimp and grits or the cheddar corn cakes. Actually, there were a few other things on there I wanted to try, as well! I finally decided on the corn cakes with a side of okra. (Talk about a heavy meal!) The corn cake dish was HUGE and was good. Next time I would probably split it with someone. The fried okra came with a yummy sauce and was lightly breaded and fried. Very delicious! The atmosphere and decor was really nothing that impressive but nothing to complain about. Our server was just okay, though. She was a little flighty and wasn't the best with our table, but nothing horrible. I definitely do want to go back and try the dinner.

Had Friday 8pm reservations for two and waited just long enough in the bar to order Sangrias and admire the updated 70's decor. We were seated in 2nd floor the ""party room"" looking over the main dining area and it was an amazing view and our room had nice decorating touches that really added to the experience. I had the Seasonal Sangria and it didn't knock my socks off so I ordered the Red Sangria later, and that was fabulous. Up there with the BEST!

59971,"This place is no longer the food-focused, quaint red and green steakhouse that was across the street. When we revisited this restaurant with some ex-Chicago residents, all of whom originally loved this place, we were surprised at the differences. Right when we arrived, the hostess told us Las Tablas is no longer BYOB for beer, so our beer had to be kept at their bar. She told us that you can BYO wine but, as others commented, there is a small corkage fee of $8. If they are trying dissuade BYO and boost their bar sales, they should get rid of that option entirely. However, some might like the option. Considering that the corkage fee would almost double the price of any wine I would bring, it might be better to get drinks from their bar. The hostess then charged us a $5 cover to get into the restaurant. Apparently Las Tablas has a band after 9 and they charge patrons a cover if they arrive after 9 looking to eat dinner. This may be something that they do only on the weekends, but it was definitely the first time we have been charged a cover for a restaurant. Well, we were seated next to the band and when they began to play our table discussion ceased. They were good, but loud--not really the atmosphere to catch up with visiting friends. I agree with the other comments, they still have decent food and good service, but their atmosphere has morphed into something more commercial. The bar option and the cover charge expanded the total cost of our restaurant experience and the band took away our ability to talk to each other. The quaintness of Las Tablas has suffered because of their expansion.",12/30/2009,U6P3bQ0axiNk0717LenErQ,p9Zr0XWML0EZgMSONtvAIQ,2WoMT3wSpp9vxZeTv6u-cw,Y,5,0

The food was nothing special...no vegetarian selection at all. After I told the waitress I wanted the veggie burger, I was told the veggie burger got too many complaints so they took it off the menu....yet there it was, written on the menu?!? Mediocre service, scrambled eggs, a cheeseburger with a small fruit salad and a veggie fritatta for $35 before tip.

I'Ve waited two hours to eat at Frontera and it was amazing , so needless to say the wait doesn't bother me if the food is good. The problem here is that I never was able to try the food because I would not support this place after the conversation I had with the manger . First off he was rude . He just came off as curt and seemed disinterested in helping a group of young women. He instead kept ushering in big guys in suits . He told me that whose people were VIPs and they get first seating . I asked why all customers weren't considered VIP's and he laughed with this little chuckle and actually said to me Lady , we can all only hope to have the money these guys have someday , so until you do these gentlemen are VIPs and they go first , if you don't like that you can leave.WHAT!?!

We were seated in the main dining room and right behind us was a picture window opening to a small banquet space.

48505,"Its simple, this place is fantastic. Publican brings the Belgian beer hall to Chicago and continues the Paul Kahan juggernaut in the city. Publican is about three things; pork, oysters & beer. From the list of hundreds of beer choices you will be able to find one that matches whatever you order. We were there this past week for brunch and tried the saurbraten sandwich and the ham and eggs. The ham was a huge slab of pork the Publican brines in the restaruant and was served with perfectly cooked eggs. The saurbraten sandwich was not whatever you had at the last German restaurant you went to but was a rich marinated piece of moist pork on a fresh roll served with Belgian style fries (no Belgian style mayo though). You have to order the side of bacon which is closer to looking like shortribs than what you may think of as bacon but was so rich and flavorful we were talking about it days later. They also make fresh cooked pork rinds, aged hams, rilletes and charcuterie none of which you can go wrong with. We have been there for dinner and its also amazing. Make reservations and be prepared for communal tables but go for the amazing pork and beer combinations that you can get nowhere else in Chicago.",4/11/2011,59tpVIF3HF7nUhfyMR9WCw,9xFVIsCPLTd_33DMHWJRhA,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg,N,3,1

58073,"New years day, my family and I wanted to try something new, so we pop up on yelp and see the great reviews for this place, so we decided to try it. The Place was packed and understandable so we made a reservation and explored the area while we were waiting to be called, so we're in the gift shop across the street when the manager comes yelling in at us for not picking up the phone, so they sent us upstairs where we stood outside in the cold while no one came to open the door for us until a nice customer of the restaurant had to stand up from his seat to open it for us. So the waiter look baffled as we walk in like we didn't belong there, Then after he guides us to our seats, We sit for a long period of time before they brought us our menus lol. Now that was just what we saw in their service lets go on to food.We looked around in the old broken menus for a while and decided to pick their deluxe hotpot special, thinking that trying something new might be interesting so we wait over half an hour for our dinner to come out, back you wouldn't have guess what dish came out first... our desert idk why they would even do that our appetizers came out some time after, so we left the desert lying around. The appetizers were average compared to other restaurants we've eaten at so not much to say there.So during all of this we were humored by their staff which I could have sworn did not know proper English except for our first waiter who we could see did not want to be there. We never got a proper bottle of soy sauce and chili pepper sauce which we actually got up and asked for... in a Chinese restaurant for real? Okay so there other problems whit the service which I could go on rambling about but lets go to the main course.The hotpots came out, we tasted the stock in the pot, it was below average tasted kinda bland. The raw seafood and vegetables came out looked liked a regular setup for a hotpot meal, cooked up the seafood and vegetables and tried it. the seafood tasted old especially the mussels and squid. There was some positives about the meal i got to try some new items like fish meatballs and bamboo which tasted pretty good, but we didn't trust their vegetables. The meats came out, the beef was mostly fat tasted hard and old. The lamb after it was cooked tasted pretty much like beef with a bit more texture nothing special there. Oh yeah almost forgot about the sauces they did give us, my recommendation to you don't try it garlic sauce was terrible smelled like my old science fair project no lie. The barbecue sauce had some hard precipitate in it, tasted expired. They looked like they just came out of the freezer so we ate everything bland no sauce and never got that soy sauce. We ate the cold desert and so they brought us the bill... about $300 great they even included the tip ( which they did not deserve), way too overpriced and to end things off they didn't give us enough fortune cookies :) never coming back here again...",3/13/2012,jyNAuKnEEc41EE7O5IB79A,PF4nALqZono-f2RUAWRCFw,yBRaSkuYwFhYEoucDyD0lA,Y,4,0

37282,"This is one of my favorite bars in Chicago to try interesting beers. Their menu is also interesting, but I can't say I remember what I ordered the one time I've eaten here. I prefer to go to Hopleaf to try new beers and for good conversation. Bell's Hop Slam provided the fab Brett D. and me with ample inspiration for good conversation. In fact, I almost bought a six-pack of it the same night for our BYOB sticks and rice excursion. But the beer packaging failed to mention anything about ""ample notes of Grapefruit on the back end"" and 10% alc. by vol., for a night to remember, along with a hangover you'll never forget! Seriously, Hop Slam is one tasty beer that packs a wallop! I love the laid-back atmosphere to the Hopleaf. It has the atmosphere of a lively German Rathskellar or a hip college hangout. Except hip college kids seem to be in awe of striking blondes! Can't blame them one bit, but the Hoparazzi seemed to take an unusual interest in glancing at us all night. Guess we looked like we were having too much fun with our Hop Slams! I love the Hopleaf! And Bell's Brewery, I loved your beer, and we'll be in any Hop Slam ad campaign you want to run!

The doors were open, and people were seated outside as well. If your goal is to eat outside I would say get there early! Patrons tend to sit and stay....all night. There's a sizable menu of wonderful beers and wine's to taste and I can see why those who were there last night stayed at their table for 4 hours.  We opted to eat indoors versus waiting for a table and we were not disappointed. For 4 people we ordered 3 small plates, one salad, & 3 Entrees. This was just enough food for 4 people. Every single dish had something to love. I can't complain about any of them. I highly recommend this place.  It is first come first serve.

59347,"LIke many others, we've loved F&O since moving to Streeterville in 2003. However, In the last few years it has declined in so many ways. Sorry to see it folding.   Today's experience:  We've bought French jambon madrange (ham) regularly for years. But this spring, each time we've gotten it (at the deli) it has been of inferior quality compared to prior years. Today it had hard spots (sign of poor quality), odd coloring, open spaces(large holes), and was shredded/stretched along the edges -- as if the meat slicer was sticky, gummy, not cleaned, and had stretched it. We always ask to have it cut thicker, not shaved, so we do notice these changes. I think if you accept their pre-shaved stuff you won't notice these defects in quality (they hope?). This pricey ham should be ""gourmet"" quality, and for years it was. Not now.   Worst example of F&O's current attitude: hot dog buns are 4 for $2.99, but they only had 2, so charged $1.99, not $1.50. Bakery explained that it's policy to charge more when they don't have four in the bag (these are pre-bagged items, not sold individually). Nice way to treat any customer, especially a neighborhood regular. We have many other great choices of places to shop and other places seem to care more than F&O does these days. No meunster cheese, no baby swiss, on and on. Never know what they won't have in stock so cannot plan a menu.    Suggest people pay close attention to sell by dates, opened items, and to see if the meat and cheese slicers are clean.

Last Friday me and my friends ( who came from another state to visit me ) had a not so nice brunch from Nightwood, I decided to treat my friend to a better breakfast place, and it was NANA .I really like their decor, their dining room arranged to be sch a nice homely environment , with big windows and lot of sunlights ,it gives you a morning boost right the way . I had learn from my past experience from NANA that their potions are somewhat too big for me , so I ordered only the side dishes -- Smash Squash -- YUMMY !! IT's so refreshing , with a hint of pumpkin and spices ! Side Salad -- I love the dressing , and the greens are excellent ! Sunshine up eggs and toast -- nothing special , but I like their mixed berries jam ! My friend ordered the cheeseburger ( he ordered the same thing from Nightwood but the meat was way too raw ) , this time at NANA, it was perfect ! The only thing I don't like about NANA is their staffs , they barely talk to you , they also charge way too much for a small glass of juice , $4 for a small size orange juice ? I can buy a 1-liter size fresh squeeze OJ from San Jose down the block .",3/27/2011,902DQ9Dvtnb568Z-3qOAZw,352ZByKlcqDnvFu0RXkQaw,DBtXy8wcPsVr80oFfz-CbA,Y,5,0

I'll start by saying my mom has tried to copy their salsa, and while hers is great, Garcia's has a knack for some good salsa. And that's only the START.....they are cheap ( and not in the negative way), authentic, in a nice area, and.....have a juke box!!!! how cool? I suggest that anytime you go you MUST start your appetizer with NACHOS!!!! and from there.....anything goes! because there that good! also, my parents and aunt seem to really enjoy the margarita's here!",12/15/2008,qAlKD1e7RC5W,nbKnn2hFSpjiaTz9-AW6cw,08X_5WTOVNvk4SgPRKBjjQ,N,3,1
20735,"Couldn't resist all the rave, so had to go- Went for Saturday early evening around 5:45pm, the wait was as anticipated for we sat at our table at 6:30. But be reminded that we were a party of 5... it seemed that smaller parties got seated a few minutes earlier. My friend and I shared two tortas as they are cut in half. Ahodaga - the carnitas torta was DELISH! The sauce/broth that it's served with defintiely made the dish. We ordered medium hot and definitely still had a kick. Yes, the bread might have gotten soggy had it sit in the sauce longer but we picked those babies up right away and chowed down. The bread was crispy yet soft enought to fit right into my mouth for the ultimate satisfaction. SCORE. Milanesa - the chicken milanesa torta was also great but just not as good as the Ahodaga. It was served with a salsa verde, but I kept going back to the red sauce from our Ahodaga plate to pour on top of the Milanesa. I would probably like to see a little less cheese, but that's just how I like my sammys. Churros - 3 for $3! They were so yummy, rolled in sugar and housemade ground chocolate. Since it was a humid day I shied away from the hot chocolate and went for the homemade soft serve vanilla icecream to dip the churros in. YUMMMMY! But I found my self dusting off the sugar as I thought there was a bit much. Overall, something I'd do all over again regardless of the line or the weather. I'm not sure if I'd still find the experience totally awesome if I wasn't as hungry as I was when I went.

5157,"The recent pervasiveness of the pig has had me giddy ever since restaurants like The Publican and Purple Pig have been on the scene. I'd like to consider myself swine chic and frequently drool over new and interesting pork-themed dishes. The Purple Pig is often packed, so expect a wait. You cannot be seated until your entire party is present and they do not take reservations.  Have a drink at the small bar and enjoy the lively atmosphere as you wait for your table or guests. You may be seated with ""new to you"" pork lovers, so be prepared to swap restaurant tips with those at your table. I hesitate to call them strangers, because these fellow pig enthusiasts are just friends you haven't met yet. I've dined here 3 times now and thanks to their tapa portions, I've shared about 70% of the menu with friends. This is comfort food at its best. Don't pass up the pork shoulder, pig's ear, pig's tail or fried manchengo cheese! And if you order the pig's tail, pair it with the burrata cheese. It was a delightful (and for me, an accidental) combination. You must try the fried deviled egg, if it is available. They serve the dish after 5:00pm, and often run out. I was finally able to try it on my 3rd visit, and it was well worth the wait! The wine list is extensive with a range in varietals, price points and portions. Feel free to snag half a bottle of wine if you're pacing yourself. I'm not a beer drinker, but I believe they have a nice selection of beers as well.  My only criticism of the restaurant is that they often run out of dishes, but I've never been disappointed in my alternate selections.  The Purple Pig offers a lively and friendly atmosphere. The price is very reasonable and the food & drinks are of excellent quality and satisfying portions.  As an example, our total for 5 dishes and a bottle of wine was $77.

56508,"Loved Frontera Grill!!! My husband and I went with another couple to celebrate a Birthday, and we had a fantastic time. We made the reservation several months in advance, and it was well worth it. We walked in, and they took us right to our table. There were so many fantastic choices on the menu, so we asked the server for recommendations. We started with guacamole for the table. It was the best guacamole I have ever eaten, and I've had lots of guacamole. I read a few reviews that said they'd skip the guacamole for that price tag, but I totally disagree!! The avocados were so perfect and creamy! Our server suggested the Special that night which was Cochinita Pibil, a pork dish. It was so yummy!!! I wanted to lick the plate clean. It came with habanero salsa, which was the spiciest thing I have ever tasted in my life. It was the perfect companion to the pork. The portion was so large, I couldn't finish the whole thing. My husband had the Oaxacan-Style Carne Asada, which was also delicious! The plantains with this dish were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, adding just the right amount of sweetness for the beef. We also shared the mushrooms and green beans at the table. Again, great recommendations from our server. We ended our meal by sharing the Tres Leches de Coco. The kitchen had added Happy Birthday and a candle to the dish, making our friend's night. This dish was heaven! The cake was not too soggy and the mango sorbet was so fresh and light!!! Loved it!Everyone at the table said the drinks were fantastic. There was a variety of Topolo Margaritas and Mexican Mojitos. My only complaint - being pregnant I asked if they could make a virgin drink and the server pointed me to the soda section. I was a little let down with my selection, some sort of homemade soda that was quite sweet. Overall, we loved this restaurant and cannot wait to go back!!!",6/4/2012,y58KCe2Igs2qJ8l6cELTsQ,FNdIQnREBTsd4a_70rYREQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,Y,1,0

26439,"Stopped into Mercat the other night for a glass of wine before trivia at Grace O'Malleys. I'd been meaning to check it out for quite some time since the chef owns one of my favorite restaurants in Philly (Amada - check it out next time you're breezing through the city of brotherly love). Anyway, we went in and secured the last 2 seats at the bar of the downstairs lounge. At first I was a little skeptical because the bartender had one of her friends sitting at the bar so I was worried we wouldn't see much of her, but she was actually extremely knowledgeable about wine, the chef, the food and so on. What do you get for a $15 glass of wine? Well, you get a huge pour, and an extremely knowledgeable bartender who will pour you ample samples until you find one you like. (hmm maybe I should open some sort of business called Ample Samples because that's sort of a great name, but bah! i've gotten off subject yet again!) I told her that I have been on a long and arduous hunt for the Smokiest red wine I could find, and she let me try their reds until I found one I liked, which was great!! Then she brought out some complimentary bar snacks, some sort of foccacia with tomato puree on top? It was delightful. Who doesn't love some complimentary bar snacks? We ordered the chefs selection of cheeses, which came with these wonderful jams. So fresh and dynamic tasting. It was great! I'd love to go back for dinner sometime.",2/26/2012,KHNCHCcX2x0gQD7H02h77Q,mPJCciRjke0bQxazimZf8w,N7juvW8YoFIj7sEBzVF8GQ,N,5,1

Unacceptable. My second time there it was my birthday and my mother made reservations for us, but we still waited 45 minutes for our table. Then the service was terrible. My third time there, the waiter was impatient, like he was just waiting for us to leave, and kept trying to take plates away that we weren't done with. I think he asked a total of 5 times if we were done.

44780,"Deep-dish Pizza is what you get when you have Irish immigrants try their hands at making pizza. It is the bastard child of a savory pie traditional of the Irish, British, and Scots with the flavor and ingredients of Italy. Deep-dish pizza flirts with its identity and pushes the definition of what is pizza to its absolute limits and is by far the most unique of all the styles of pizza one commonly finds. Even the crust is more like pie crust in texture and flavor then anything remotely like any other pizza you've had. It so happens that the crust is absolutely the best part of Giordano's pie. Sadly, the sauce is dense, sweet, and more reminiscent than I'd like to canned tomato paste. The cheese and toppings are fairly average. The whole experience is also pleasantly less greasy than one would expect. Giordano's fancies itself as the pinnacle of deep-dish Pizza. It's good, not great and certainly not fancy or gourmet. The flavors were also not unique or striking and bore a little too much similarity to the deep dish pizza at the national chain Uno Chicago Grill for me to get too excited about it. You could do worse, but I find it hard to believe there's not somewhere with a much better deep-dish pizza.

I also enjoyed the high energy with all the vibrant colors...so ambiance and food get a 5/5.Now onto the bad...ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE I have ever had at a restaurant. If you go for dinner at Carnivale, I do NOT recommend Andrea the waitress. Upon being seated, she took a very long time to order our drinks and serve them. Once served drinks, she took a while to come back and check on us, see if we'd like to order, etc. I ordered guac and chips for the table (it was a party of 8 for my birthday), and asked to order our meals with it (because we noticed service is very slow). She followed that by saying 'can you hold on one second?, turned around to a couple who arrived AFTER us and took their order. She then left and came to get our table. Never saw the guac and chips after waiting about half an hour, so I asked if the order was coming out soon. Her response was that she didn't receive an order for that. I told her it was ordered before the meals, and that was followed by not an apology, but backlash/attitude from her. She then brought the guac and chips and left. She left us with empty drinks, not checking here n there if we were doing okay, etc. A friend asked for his drink twice, and she still hadn't brought it. Once she finally came back, we asked for his drink, and that was followed by more attitude by her saying Did he REALLY ask for it twice? and walked away to get his drink. While waiting longer for our meals, we noticed the table next to us had a problem with her as well, and lo and behold a manager shows up to talk to them. Once our meals came out we asked for our bill right away because we had other reservations after and didn't think 2 hours would be too short a time for dinner at Carnivale- we were wrong. Andrea forgot my mac and cheese and the bill, so by that time I was beyond ready to speak to management. Multiple times my friends and I witnessed her (most likely) talking about us to another waitress, as she looked very annoyed. Eventually a manager came over, we explained everything. She adjusted our bill and we were able to remove the gratuity that was automatically included if we wanted to. You bet I took off her tip. Even AFTER talking to management, Andrea didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for anything. I also never received the complimentary trio cake being that it was my birthday. So although the venue is gorgeous and the food was good, I was thoroughly disappointed with Carnivale and the damper they briefly put on my birthday celebration!",12/30/2009,iNaIk4CJQDj993lSXIGi5A,lEgR-kQl8vLVJ0tu0eZ41Q,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA,Y,1,0

18212,"I was really excited to eat at Xoco on my most recent trip to Chicago, and it did not disappoint in any way. I will add at this point in my review that my hotel was just 2 blocks away. When I walked into Xoco, the line was nearly out the door. I stood in it for about 2 minutes as I stared at a sign above a cash register that directed customers to place take out orders there. So, I opted to just jump out of line, which was not really moving at all, order to go and walk back to my hotel to eat. I had the Saturday special torte of braised goat barbacoa with tomatillo pasilla (sp?) sauce and avocado and chips/salsa. The torte was unbelievable. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, which was so yummy with the sauce from the meat soaking in. The meat was flavorful and juicy. Delicious. The sauce was smokey and the avocado provided a richness and texture that pulled it all together. The chips were tasty and delicious and they came with a red salsa and a green salsa. Although both were flavorful, I would've liked the red to have a bit more heat.  All in all, it was an amazing meal.

I picked off friends plates, wishing i was hungry enough to order my own. The wings were cooked perfectly, moist and juicy and the batter was light and so very crispy (despite being doused in some of the best sauces I've ever tasted). Favorite: Seoul Sassy. Sweet and sour soy/ginger. I loved the rolls of paper towels on the large community tables. And of course... bendy straws for drinks (surprisingly hard to come by these days).

8416,"A pretty good Italian style pizza in Chicago. The service was good, but I was hoping for a little better pizza based upon the reviews I had heard. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good, but after eating at places like this all over the country, I was hoping for a bit more. I always order the prosciutto and arugula pizza at every Italian pizzeria, so I ordered one here. The crust was really tasty, but the pizza was soggy in the middle. I prefer my crust to remain crispy throughout. I was also able to try the four cheese pizza, which actually was tastier that the prosciutto. Also, the restaurant only had bottled iced tea. It was imported from Italian, so I guess that is why they carry it, but I would like to have had plain old brewed iced tea as an option. The service was helpful, but a little slow with the water refills.",4/12/2010,ZRDrP3h9zaZXb-TRg5tnVQ,cD9vAXIG-UQnASjnBjsQLQ,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw,N,3,1

We're not here to steal your cups or spoons B.) We're not here to start problems C.) We're just here to enjoy a brunch with family.

40596,"I was in a foul mood when we headed to L&E for dinner with friends. We arrived pretty early and were told we'd have to wait about an hour and a half, which put me even more down in the dumps. I had previously checked out the menu and being a rather unadventurous eater, I wasn't very excited. Fast forward about 60 minutes and two beers later, we were seated. We started with a few appetizers but the one that struck me was the olives. I was expecting (especially from a Michelin star restaurant) about four olives on the plate. There were tons of them in the little bowl and I ate more than my fair share. I got one that had already been pitted that tasted like it had balsamic vinegar marinade in it and we all spent the rest of the bowl searching for another one like it because it was so good. I settled on the burger and it was one of the best I've ever had. Every element of it was perfect and it all went together flawlessly. I can't even tell you how delicious the beef fat fries were. I had a bite of one of the desserts but I can't even remember which one it was because I was in such a food coma of happiness from olives, burger and fries.

31061,"I'm continuously awed by both the mediocrity of the Chicago Diner, and the fact that I continue to (occasionally) go back. It's a very strange phenomenon. They have a very extensive menu, and perhaps I talk myself into believing that I will order something that is anything better than ""meh!"". I usually leave asking why I went again. First off, I should mention the Chicago Diner is going to move directly across the street soon. Hopefully this will solve some of the seating problems. The restaurant is pretty small and at peak times, the wait can be long for a table. When the weather is nice, the outdoor seating helps out a lot, but if you go during the cold weather season, be prepared to wait out on Halsted. My problem with the Diner is this, it's supposed to be the incredibly well known vegetarian restaurant. Visitors know of it and flock to it, but it just isn't that good! Many of the faux meat items I have had tried are either rubbery (most recently, the chicken style seitan in the stir fry) or overly greasy (chicken parmesan sandwich). I just think that the reputation this place has, coupled with it's long history should lead to much tastier food. They do a few things well, the vegan mac and cheese is pretty tasty, but overall I find this place inconsistent. The only thing that I have ever ordered more than once is the biscuits and gravy, which are good... but can't touch the Handlebar's. One good thing about the Chicago Diner (and the thing that got them three stars instead of two) is that the desserts are excellent. They have great vegan cakes and cheesecakes. They also have great vegan milkshakes, they aren't cheap (6 bucks!) but, they are pretty damn good. If you have to go, get a coffee and dessert, that way you won't be disappointed. I almost feel bad, as a long time vegan, giving this place a less than glowing review. I am glad it's there, but I just wish they would work to make it better. When I travel to places like New York, I get a taste of what can be done with vegan food (Red Bamboo, S'nice, ad infinitum) and the Diner isn't in the same league, not even close. November 15, 2007 EDIT: I have since found a very good sandwich at the Chicago Diner. The Radical Reuben. It is thickly stacked with seitan, sauerkraut, and a side of vegan 1000 island dressing. A side of the vegan mac and cheese and you have a great meal. I still think the Diner has lots of room to improve their menu, but this is a good one.",2/3/2011,RnbewOXbt6Wfv7JYeRcGog,2UnyWLKpOvKTbixrTRHfBQ,DBtXy8wcPsVr80oFfz-CbA,N,5,1

56156,"It seems like everyone else really loves this place, but it was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. I even signed up for a Yelp account just so I could negatively review them.I came on a weekday for dinner with three friends and ordered their signature crepe - I think it's called the Icosium something obvious like that - and the whole experience was just bad. It began with my lamb soup which had absolutely no lamb in it, just globs of lamb fat. Grossed out, I didn't eat it. Then I remember sitting for a long time with a mint leaf in an empty glass because, despite being overstaffed for the amount of people in there, it took forever for them to get around to filling water glasses. When they did fill them, the water was room temperature. Next, the crepe. Good God, the crepe. This thing was so overcooked that texture was somewhere between rubbery and crispy, loaded with luke-warm filling. It seemed like it had maybe been sitting out for a while. Grossed out a second time, I didn't eat it. Now, at this point, I would be disappointed but it wouldn't be a huge deal, but it only got worse. The waitresses, seeing that I took maybe two bites of a gigantic crepe, didn't bother asking if everything was okay. After ten minutes had passed since everyone else's plates were cleared, she finally comes up and asks me if I was finished. I say yes, and she takes it away without even asking if I might want to box it up (obviously I didn't, seeing as it was nasty, but she should have asked). Then, when I went to pay, I asked to speak to the waitress. I told her that the crepe was not enjoyable and that it seemed like it had been sitting out and that it was overcooked. At this point, any normal waitress would offer to remove it from the bill or offer to replace it... or at least apologize. Not her. She totally started arguing with me! She told me that I should have sought her out if I didn't like my food, that I had plenty of time to tell her something was wrong, and that it was somehow my fault. I work in a restaurant, too, and I have/would never start an argument with a customer like that. The food was bad and that wasn't her fault, but it also definitely wasn't my fault.I have always been proud of what a good tipper I am, but I left her nothing.

For instance, I was thinking, ""Man I could really use a refill on my water because I cannot take all of this awesome savory delicious flavor."" Then all of a sudden my waitress was there with the pitcher asking if there was anything else I needed with a smile might I add. I everytime I am there I enjoy it. The food is packed with flavor, and filling without making you feel like you over ate which is always a plus. The rice is amazing they offer dill which I love and regular jasmine, but with some butter on the side to make it even more delicious! The pitas go great with the small platter of veggies and goat cheese they give you as well as the meat. I go there with my family a lot ""I love them"" and we get a type of family platter where the pitas are under the meat giving them flavor and a different texture that makes it even better.

The ratios of ingredients made the burger fall apart, the meat patty itself was perfectly shaped... suspiciously like the shape you would expect from a frozen patty. Usually when i've had tall grass burgers they've seemed hand formed. The bun was, really good but crumbly, strange.

I would encourage the owners to think service-service-service. We saw him refuse to sit a much older couple when their party was incomplete. Ok, that's their policy, but when the husband asked for a chair for his wife, that was also refused. This was at 6:30 on a Wednesday, the place was easily half empty. He then sat our party next to the bus station--again, the place is empty. He very grudgingly and with much eye-rolling moved us, but the night was spoiled.

56454,"My husband and I went here for the first time 4 years ago (Dec 2009). We went on a cold December night and were fortune it enough to have had made reservations in advance. The place was packed but we were seated fairly quickly. We were even fortune it enough to be there on a night when Rick himself was there. He was nice enough to sign a book for my husband. I had their signature steak, plantains and black beans. This dish was AMAZING!!! At the beginning of this year I knew I would be going back to Chicago in March and tried to make reservations. They said they only took so many reservations and that I would need to come in as a walk in. So, my husband and I went there on a Saturday night (March 2012) and stood in the overcrowded bar for THREE hours and were never seated. We left there hungry, frustrated and mad. We just went there again on Friday night (August 17, 2012). We had made reservations ahead of time and were seated very quickly. However, their signature steak dish was such a disappointment. The steak was flavorless. The plantains that were so creamy and wonderful that first time I came in, this time were dry and overcooked. The black beans were the same too - dry as a bone. We also tried two different kinds of tamale's. I LOVE tamales and I've actually learned to make them from Rick's book. So, it was so disappointing when they came out. The black bean tamale stuffing was dry and way too thick for a tamale. The other type of tamale was so awful we sent it back. My husband and I are huge foodies! I am a huge fan of Mexican food! I'm also a huge fan of Rick Bayless. I first started watching him on public television years ago and now have DVR'd all his new shows. FYI - I like the older shows better! It's hard for me to write such a bad review about someone I'm such a huge fan of but after our experience Friday night I told my husband I would never drag him to this place again.",3/27/2011,sIFPQ6eyGwyZx04W3Up7DA,1nroR7cWqRc0vwnBGJTTFQ,N7juvW8YoFIj7sEBzVF8GQ,Y,5,0

Uh, what? Order for the whole group? While standing in the lobby, waiting? Can't I sit down and sip a beer first? This kind of ruined the experience for me.

59534,"I'm completely baffled by all the good reviews for this restaurant. I've been to this restaurant three times and I never had good food there.I came here last week for dinner and decided that it would be my last time there. We ordered some very standard Korean dishes - jap chae, yukgaejang, and ddukguk, and they were all really disgusting. The jap chae looked like it had been sitting all day. It was very limp and not fresh. The first thing we noticed about the yukgaejang and ddukguk was the rancid smell. I can give a bit of a handicap for the yukgaejang because there are many different ways to make it and most places don't make it well. But the beef obviously was not fresh. The smell was very bad and the soup itself was mediocre at best, though it's hard to really gauge since the smell was so bad.  But the absolute worst had to be the ddukguk, which is one of the simplest soups to make. The smell was terrible, the color was terrible (it was brown instead of clear), and the taste was terrible. I'm not sure what the reason was for the bad smell. My friends thought it was the beef. I'm not sure, but it's curious especially since most people come here for the Korean barbeque. The only reason to even contemplate coming here is because it's open 24 hours. But really, if the food is so bad, then why bother?",3/9/2011,fCnrKJcnzWXiU13SjgS_xA,KXyK0il5-rCndnMFxDwbQw,_n3OmwreEGPQmiHKklsD8w,Y,5,0

31741,"This is a great organic little restaurant my husband and I were introduced to by a friend. Our 1st experience was really good. The wait staff was pleasant and the small intimate atmosphere was nice to dine in. The menu was small but filled with good organic options. We are use to having a little more to pick from but we both found something we liked. The food is nothing to rave about. It was cooked well but nothing I ate (and I tasted some of everyone's dish) made me want to come back for more. My husband and I were in the neighborhood last month and decided to stop for a mid afternoon meal. There were only 2 other couples in the restaurant. We were seated by the hostess who told us in 10 min. they would be serving from the dinner menu. We looked at both menus and decided we like more of the dinner options. When our waitress came over she was very cold and have a very fake attitude towards us. We explained that we may want to wait for dinner and her attitude became more apparent. We were growing hungrier and asked to get food from the lunch menu. When we began to ask questions about the dishes we were thinking about getting, her responses were very rude and not helpful.

The wait on a Saturday around 12:30pm was 30-45 minutes (although they said an hour at the door), but it was totally worth it. My boyfriend and I tried the churros, authentic and Mexico City chocolate drinks, the lemongrass jamaica, the Pibil torta, and the Ahogada torta. I thought the chocolates and churros were just okay, but my boyfriend loved the churros. I could drink a gallon of the lemongrass jamaica though. Both tortas were super delicious - well spiced, salty, crunchy bread, and some citrusy flavors. Even though my mouth was burning, I couldn't stop eating minuscule bites of the habanero salsa that came with the pibil. So good! We sat at the counters near the windows, so we could people watch and actually have enough room for all the food we ordered plus my purse. Even though it's a small restaurant, I didn't feel too squished. On a second trip on a Friday around 11AM, there was no wait. By the time we finished eating though, a line had formed. The churros were better this time because they were still warm, plus we got the chocolate dipping side, which was nice. Bf got the Ahogada again, and it was just as solid. I got the pork belly vermicelli caldo, and although it was good, I prefer the tortas. Maybe it's the excellent Labriola bread? Either way, it was still tasty.

26941,"Given the long nature of our dinner (15 courses plus amuse bouche and intermezzo spread over 4 hours), I'll share the highlights (good and bad) and spare you the uninteresting. I labored over whether this was a 4 star or 5 star experience, but settled on 5 because if you walk in knowing that you're going to pay a lot ($459 in my case for 2 people), then you can just focus on the chef's food; in this case, although not every dish was great, I could taste Graham Elliot's personality (even in the not so great dishes). That's not something you can say about most restaurants, and in this respect, I think he succeeds.  We ordered the REPERTOIRE (the ENTIRE menu). It's a lot of food, despite the small portions each dish comes in. I was food fatigued at the end.  FAVORITES: 1. wagyu tartare (asparagus salad + pommes frites + roasted porcini + bearnaise yolk) Just after being confused by the Tomato Panzanella, the wagyu tartare came out and wowed. Composed elegantly and certainly not confusing to eat. The bearnaise yolk was perfect and added a certain refinement to the dish. The flavors married together perfectly to create something new, and I can honestly say the wagyu was necessary in the dish (sometimes it's just an expensive ingredient tossed onto the menu to connote high quality).  2. corn bisque (spiny lobster + toasted coquito + vanilla marshmallow + micro chervil) This dish is served without the bisque at first and they come by to pour the bisque in. This was wildly successful-- if each ingredient were a color, imagine closing your eyes and seeing a different color pop into your head every couple seconds, and then have all of them come rushing into your mouth at the same time in a blend. Coconut shined through especially bright, and the bisque... oolala good. 3. ricotta and beets (this was a special on the house) Very, very small portion. Beets perfect and how did he get the ricotta to be SO EXTRAORDINARILY fluffy? 4. local whitefish (smoke mussel + potato confit + artichoke relish + lemon sabayon) The fish was slightly crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. The mussels were so tender, I wasn't even sure they were mussels!! And the potato confit was poached in duck fat, which made them absolutely decadent. And sabayon that's properly whipped and not in the least bit runny -- A+. 5. king salmon (blis roe + garlic scape + shaved fennel + dill crema) Easily the winner of the night. The salmon is sous vide, and it literally melts in your mouth. I've had awesome salmon belly that basically melts in your mouth, but this took things to a whole other level. (Discarding all dirty images from your mind for a second), this was a party in your mouth.  MISSES: 1. tomato panzanella (baby arugula + grilled cioppolinni + ciabatta vinaigrette, caper powder) Served deconstructed. It was a classic Graham Elliot concoction right off the bat. However, I hate food that looks pretty but confuses the eater. Was I supposed to eat each component separately? Was I supposed to eat them together? Which components together? Each item was great, but I'll never know what they were supposed to taste like together. Also, the caper powder was literally smeared onto the plate with a finger (the smear was so small I almost missed it). It actually looked kind of like the plate was dirty. Fail. 2. deconstructed caesar (gem lettuce + brioche twinkie + white anchovy + parmesan fluff) Aside from a successful sauce with the familiar Caesar flavors but much more softened and refined, this fell on its face. The brioche twinkie didn't deliver in spite of its inspiring name, and the rest was just bland. The dainty white anchovy was delicious on its own, but didn't help the dish. Although it's touted as a Graham Elliot favorite, I can't see why that's the case, except perhaps it's easily the item on the menu with the highest mark-up. 3. jidori chicken (dirty rice + country pate + fried okra + gizzard jus) The skin on the chicken was crispy and nice, but the chicken itself dry. The dirty rice was crispy, but didn't add a needed texture and once you dug your fork into the dish, the rice scattered everywhere. 4. the desserts I thought they were all misses (or at the very least, unspectacular; downfall of all the Top Chefs, no?). The basil ice cream actually tasted like basil, which was cool... but their strawberries tasted like canned ones.  All in all, a meal I'll never forget.

The vegetables on a platter, we all shared, were just zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, red onions and white onions sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. I can do that! My brother in law and sister in law both ordered the pastas, which really looked home made and delicioso! They said it was very good. The dessert we shared was a round formed cup of chocolate, filled with a spumoni tasting gelato. All in all, it was a great dinner because of the service and atmosphere.Would I go back? Maybe next year to sit on the patio. But, I would not exactly refer to the restaurant as an oasis, unless you live in a noisier, busier neighborhood of Chicago.I also recalled that my husband and I had been to this restaurant patioa few years ago. It was called Thyme. I loved that restaurant and was sad when I could not find it. The Thyme menu was oh so much better.I would also recommend if you decide to dine at Piccolo Sogno, thata dressier attire, suitable for church, would be more appropriate.Thong sandals and jean shorts don't cut it. This place was hoppin' at7:30p.m. on Saturday night with some well dressed customers and OMG the parking lot was full of high end automobiles with lots of bling!",10/19/2011,qKsGoee2wb92416P-OcYdA,HOdBdkVR0h3DhPItrSPrGw,JMa9cTNQA5mm4GbR2W8Oiw,Y,5,0
53316,"This was the single best, most memorable, eye-opening, and flavorful culinary experience I have ever had. As a teacher, my salary does not allow for frequent dining splurges, but I try I find a way to visit some of the country's best restaurants when I can (Chez Pannise, Fench Laundry, etc.). My visit to Alinea was SO worth the penny pinching needed to go there. So if you are like me and wondering if it is worth the money....DO IT. Also, for so upscale a restaurant the service was friendly and playful, not stuffy at all. We ordered the smaller tasting menu, which did not include the truffle explosion. When I called in advance to see if I could add that dish (indicating I would be happy to pay more) they said it was no problem. Not only did they include the extra dish, they didn't even charge anything extra. I won't go through the long menu dish by dish, I will just say that every one of them was just amazing. Most of the time I was eating, my eyes were closed so I could focus in on the unusual flavors and textures. Not sure my review adds anything to everything else that has been said about Alinea, but I wanted to write a review to emphasize that if a dinner here is a big splurge for you, you won't regret it.",9/13/2011,3WnnORLIhPl2CgM7hxLS3Q,ijXrm1gWWsYVV3ep4l8kfQ,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA,Y,5,0

What is that supposed to mean. There were about 5 servers and only 25 tables in the entire place, but it seemed like a chaotic mess. After our bitchy hostess mumbled something incoherently my party of two went to the bar where we were ignored for 10 minutes by at least 3 servers.  This place seems to be run by a bunch of people who hit the pipe a little too hard the night before or on their last break. After being told I could not eat what I wanted (which was on the chalkboard) until 3 PM, I was ready to leave. Had to wait another 15-20 minutes to get our check.

61305,"I will NEVER go to this place again.My boyfriend and I had made reservations for Valentines day over the weekend. As soon as we got there, they told us that even though we had a 6 o'clock reservation, we would not be seated until 7 because of how many delays they were experiencing. My boyfriend explained to him that we had tickets to see ""Million Dollar Quartet"" at 8 so we needed to be seated as soon as possible. The hostess said that she understood, but they had overbooked for the weekend. While we were waiting for our reservation to be filled, a man walked in with his date asking for a talbe and was told that they could not seat him because it was reservation only. He must have slipped the hostess some cash because he was seated 45 MINUTES before us and still sitting at a table near us when we were finally seated.We were very rushed to eat and could not enjoy the experience because of how late they sat us. We ate what we could manage and then went to the valet still giving us ample time to get to the Appollo Theater. However, the valet LOST OUR CAR KEYS!! Yes, you read that right. After telling us for 30 minutes that the car was on the way, they pulled us aside and said that they misplaced the keys. What actually happened was that the key broke off the autolock key chain, causing the key to lay in the street the entire time we were in the resturant. By some glorious miracle, the valet attendant found our key on the ground and brough the car to us. We were so lucky that some passer by didn't find the key before he did. My boyfriend was SO furious that he told me to wait with the car (45 minutes after we asked for it) so he would go talk to a manager. From what he told me, he went inside and asked the hostess to speak with someone, and the hostess simply ignored him. After several minutes of waiting, she finally looked at him and said NO, the manager was far to busy to listen to anyones complaints.We were not able to make our play (Appollo Theater understood and reissued our tickets for next week) because in total, we were an hour and a half late for the play. Today, I called Brazzaz to complain to the manager, and he said that he understood why we were upset, but there is nothing he can do for us at this point.I will never go back here nor will I recommend this resturant to anyone I know.",3/29/2010,RiNpaRN9ZlS3mNkDWg8m7Q,e7L_CRiR4DhztI4MfjRz1Q,1iehp7Z2kejBq3RSeb4Dxg,Y,5,0

Well, no real eggs in it and no milk and no processed sugar - oh my god, it tasted like crap! I almost cried.Radichio salad is good, though the dressings have always been rather bland to me-pretty disapointing. I don't know how they managed to mess up oil and vinegar but they did.I had a very pretty but disapointing lasagna in there once, and a noodle with mock beef dish - again, oh so pretty but so disapointing in taste!

All of the flavors and ingredients come together perfectly. My friends and I each ordered about 2-3 differnt kinds of hot dogs, cut them up, and sampled all the different kinds. My favorite was one that had saffron and smoked gouda. We also had the duck fat fries and they were absolutely amazing.

Upon learning of the Rick Bayliss establishment based on Mexican street food, I immediately put it on my short list to try. I finally had the opportunity to do so for lunch lunch with a friend. We started with an order of the guacamole & chips.  Not the best guacamole I have ever had, but it was very good. For my main dish, I enjoyed the Tuesday torta special - Pork Tinga: Chipotle-braised Gunthorp prok, chorizo, Napa cabbage, fresh cheese, avocado, black beans.  It was excellent! Flavors were spot on as one would expect from Bayliss.  Overall, I had a great experience at XOCO. It is a bit pricy for what you get, but it is much more approachable for lunch than Frontera or Topolobampo.

Midway thru dinner for the all you can eat crablegs, the waitress informed us that our table was waiting for other customers and that we only have a two hour limit and that we should put our orders in right away if we wanted more crablegs. She also ran out after us into the street to inform us that we did not tip enough. Granted it was an oversight because we were literally rushed out of the place. After retabulating the bill, seems as tho she added an extra 20 bucks on there any way for air maybe and miscalculated it herself. And they should not call their lobster roll a lobster roll when it is not! They should just call it crab salad sandwich if anything. Leads you to believe it's authentic when it is'nt.

19820,"It's been a foodie dream of mine to go to a Rick Bayless restaurant for quite a while. Last weekend Alisha and I were downtown for our anniversary and got to have lunch at Xoco in the River North neighborhood of Chicago. The food is a nod to Mexican street food. If Topolo pampers and Frontera dances, then XOCO rocks. Though the word is Mexican slang for ""little sister"" (from the ancient Aztec language), there's nothing little about XOCO's big, bold Mexican marketplace flavors. Open early, late and closed on Sundays and Mondays, this quick-service cafe from Rick and Deann Bayless proffers contemporary expressions of Mexico's most beloved street food and snacks: hot-from-the-fryer churros and flaky empanadas; frothy Mexican hot chocolate (ground from Mexican cacao beans right in our front window!); warm, crusty tortas (Mexican submarine sandwiches); and made-to-order caldos (meal-in-a-bowl soups) that feature everything from roasted vegetables to seafood to pork belly. We got there early for lunch (about 10:50 am, they start to serve lunch at 11:00 am) which ended up being a good thing. By 11 there was a like almost out the door. The restaurant is set up like a fast casual restaurant where you order up front and your food in brought to you. The service was fast and polite. No complaints. I decided on the special of the day 'Goat Barbacoa: Oaxacan pasilla-tomato salsa, avocado, onions and cilantro' and Alisha got the 'Chicken Tinga: Gunthorp chicken, black beans, chipotle-roasted tomato sauce, pickled onions, avocado, queso anejo, arugula.' Both were priced around $10. We also ordered the 'Guacamole & Chips: Frontera guacamole, tomatillo salsa 3-chile salsa, just-made chips' and the bean-to-cup 'Aztec: fresh-ground chocolate + water + chile + allspice.'  The tortas were really amazing. The goat was tender, extremely flavorful and not gamy at all. The avocado and pasilla-tomato salsa was tangy and tart. Probibly in the top 3 best sandwiches I've ever had. The chicken was great as well. I rarely order chicken in a sandwich because I feel like they ofter fall short on flavor, not this one. It was like a party in your mouth (yep I said that). The bean-to-cup Aztec was like nothing I've ever eaten. It wasn't sweet (almost at all) but had insane depth of flavor. It was bitter, acidic, creamy and spicy. Their bean-to-cup menu is something everyone should try. The only disappointment I had was that I didn't try any of the soups. They looked so good! There's always next time though. Overall, I couldn't have been more happy with my visit to Xoco. It's on my short list of 'must try' casual food spots in Chicago.

What the hell.At the deli counter, only ONE guy knows what it means to slice the cold cuts ""thin"". The rest need to go back to school.

NO KETCHUP!! you have to ask for it! Chicago style hot dogs don't have ketchup! MY FIRST BITE INTO THE HOT DOG. . . . HEAVEN.  it's so plump and so juicy and so aaaaaaaaaaaah. I have been here 5 times and each time, that superdawg just makes me cry because i am so happy! when I die, i would like to be burried with a superdawg right next to me.",5/7/2006,2j7CfBJNtqZ6cxKkPzvBDw,p2psA6WAXXpXbgwpl9nLdw,FCcgXODBs6O7MGH3VZNyLQ,N,5,1
41451,"I had a great time here. The food was sooo good! Though expensive, it is worth it.  What did I have? -Lobster bisque -8 oz. filet mignon -mashed potatoes -chocolate mousse cake with a cookie crust.  Everything tasted wonderful. My only concerns were that the mashed potatoes seemed to be soaked in butter and I like my mashed potatoes less soaked. I didn't end up finishing all of my chocolate mousse cake as it was a bit much for me, but from what I did finish, it was delicious!  As for drinks, I stuck with having a mojito before dinner and shiraz with my dinner. My boyfriend ended up trying one of their cocktails that had strawberries, vodka, and basil -- similar to a mojito. Boyfriend said it was pretty good, so if you're feeling adventurous, you might want to try that. The atmosphere is rather dark with a small candle. This makes it rather difficult to read the menu or sign your credit card slip, but other than that, the ambiance is rather romantic.",10/16/2010,n1i7GZ0NkdnX4quBt1gsdg,VpA2Kkm9TuaB7SZhcSzyxw,n-mj6IJkWyCu4BuD2dvm0A,N,5,1
54975,"I have been here 2 times now. I was blown away the first time and had a great meal the second time. We did the 4 course menu both times and it is a BYOB restaurant, Yay!!. Everyone at the table must do the same amount of courses. If you are lucky enough to experience the scallops as one of your courses, clap your hands and jump for joy because they are absolutely amazing. We only had one disappointing course in our two visits, but I forgive them, as they graciously gave us another course. The lamb chop was under par in the opinion of our entire table. It was just a bad cut, very fatty and extremely difficult to cut. They gave us some yellowfin sashimi afterward and it was very good. This time around, dessert was a delicious, warm molten lava spice cake with a pear galette and vanilla ice cream. I will definitely be back for a third time.",1/8/2010,PwSfyapims4jZozZjz7m3Q,b-nDDDc9QcsMiMinC3rZiA,q-_jW5lauONk_58S-wVIrg,Y,5,0
53688,"Shockingly, stunningly good. Each course was refreshingly unique, and exceedingly successful. I'm one-hundred-percent positive that I want to eat Jellyfish pad thai for the rest of my lunches from now until eternity. My girlfriend and I went to celebrate her birthday and my recent move to Chicago. I work in the restaurant business and we go out quite often. Because of that we both are averse to putting out fellow restaurant workers, and so try to be as low maintenance as possible. That being said, we have food restrictions (i.e. allergies, vegetarianism) though we try to get dishes already on menus rather than trying to get special meals.  We didn't have to worry about that at Schwa. Executive-chef Michael Carlson personally tailored a 10 course meal for each of us. Mostly it was just subtle changes in the current menu, but I didn't even ask (I figured that we would just have half the courses and that would be that) and he just created a couple new dishes for us. I brought a paired beer, wine, and spirit for each course as Michael gave me a menu 2 weeks before we dined. The staff was exceedingly friendly throughout the entire experience and I have mountains of good things to say about Schwa (and not a single negative comment) which I will mishmash-paraphrase: Musicriffic, drunkenilicious, not just bang but Ka-boom for your buck, meal. That aside, I know that a number of my friends, as well as a couple of reviewers, have been down in the doldrums because of the difficulty of getting a reservation, so I will give you, the reader, the same piece of advice that I gave my friends: You can certainly sit on your couch and call occasionally to try and get a reservation at a place that only has 5 employees who spend the entire day prepping amazing meals (and don't have much time to answer phones), or you can walk your lazy asses down to Schwa and talk to them in person. They are extremely accepting of people walking in between 3-4pm and you can usually get a reservation for sometime in the following 2 weeks. It's worth it. It's worth every imagined inconvenience and every penny spent.",10/8/2008,ZvW-n7ybZnJTcU9bZqvlZg,tJv9tRg1c1ZEpfkdeDqT8w,bNXpwTSavHBV9zBk2lUlGA,Y,5,0

41082,"I'm rather unimpressed. I first went to a Ruth's Chris Steak House in White Plains, New York. I was more than unimpressed when I took a tour of the kitchen, and foud the ""chefs"" were just unpacking pre-cut and sealed steaks from plastic wrap ""to guarantee the same experience at all locations"". Foo. This trip was many years later--I figured it must have been a one-off. Not so much. The steaks were good, I'll grant that. Except mine was overcooked, even though I stressed the fact I really, REALLY wanted very VERY rare--Blue, to be precise. I also love lobster. I didn't want to order just lobster at a steak joint, but they offered a (miniscule) 8 oz. tail as an option with a steak. Ok, WTH. Except it was cooked within an inch of rubber. Seriously, I debated whether it was still food. Meanwhile, we got nickled and dimed to death. By the time we were done, it was $600 for four people. No joke. Now, I don't *mind* $600 for a really outstanding meal. But Ruth's Chris puts itself out there as a #1 restaurant--and frankly, didin't meet the bar, but certainly BILLED as if it did. If you want to be a world-class restaurant, for Ghod's sake DO IT. My Dad was an executive chef; I most absolutely know what they SHOULD deliver. They didn't.

38484,"I LOVE THE MUSSELS AT HOPLEAF! I like coming here late Sunday afternoon with the husband, sitting in the bar at the front (at one of the tables), drinking great beer, and eating/sharing mussels for two with him. Good jazz music in the background, good beer, good food---who cares if it's a bit dark and collegey and the bar has many regulars---I'm with my true love sharing mussels and beer! The back dining room is good too. We went there once with the daughters for dinner (either a Mothers Day or a Fathers Day dinner) once. I liked it too. I had the most delicious enormous diver scallops! It's possible to order saugsages, and other things at Hopleaf, but I don't return for those things. My love affair with the Hopleaf began and continues due to the mussels and the beer selections!

55450,"My failed attempt at dinner at Piccolo Sogno was the worst dining experience I've ever had in Chicago. The staff was inattentive and rude. I had called in advance to see if it was possible to reserve a table in their courtyard and I was assured it was. Upon arriving, I found out that they do not reserve tables outside and I would have to wait, despite having a reservation. When I mentioned that I was assured a table outside by the woman I spoke to on the phone, the hostess told me I was mistaken, and I was immediately brushed off. Despite this initial disappointment we decided to get a drink at the bar and wait. After being ignored for 15 minutes at the bar by all 4 bartenders, I decided to abandon the drinks and return to the waiting area. While waiting, I spoke with another couple that was told the same as us about a table outside. They had been told their wait would be 30 minutes, and after checking the status of their table after 45 minutes they were told they would have to wait longer, and the hostess did not know how long it would be. After hearing this, we finally decided to leave. It was an incredibly uncomfortable and disappointing situation, which is inexcusable. There are plenty of great dining options in Chicago, and I would recommend planning a night out somewhere other than Piccolo Sogno.

8723,"OMG. Last night was the first time I went to fogo de chao. I have heard amazing things, but until last night, I did not get to delve into all the goodness. I am familiar with the area, so I knew that there wasn't going to be any parking available. We opted to valet our car, although there was a lot across the street for $9. We met for a friend's birthday and made a reservation for 8 people. When we arrived at 7:30pm for our reservation, our table was ready. It was one large table in an open space and it was perfect. Often, when we reserve seats for a large group, restaurants put several tables together and it is in a crowded spot. The salad was delicious! Lots of great choices, but while the girls were eating their salads, the men began eating the meat, so of course we got jealous and ditched the salad plates. Everything was so delicious, amazing seasoning, great choice of meat cuts. I liked the bottom sirloin the best. I found some of the cuts to be a little fatty, but there at 16 total choices, so I definitely had a lot to choose from. The service was AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. Bill was pricey, but we knew what we were getting into. As a couple, two dinners, 2 cocktails, 3 beers = 167.00. I believe they have the same selection available for lunch at a cheaper price, that may be the way to go. At the end of the night, our car was even warmed up for us first.

52444,"It's taking all the energy I can muster to Yelp this place instead of falling asleep at my desk from food-overload. I think I may have just eaten 3 whole cows and 15 pineapples. My boss is awesome for taking us here. My roommate warned me before I went - she said skip the salad bar and just wait for the meat. I don't follow directions very well, and there were lots of delicious treats at the salad bar...I couldn't pass up a trip. The apple salad is phenomenal, there are so many giant (and beautiful!) veggies, and they have all of the ingredients for making your own little caprese salad (or just eat a bunch of mozzarella balls). Post-salad, my coworkers and I munched on fried bananas, polenta, and little fried rolls/puffs of bread while we sipped on champagne. We decided it was time to turn our little buttons over to the orange ""go"" side, and the meat just started showing up. I tried every red meat available, the chicken, and the pineapple. I'm not really a pork person, but my coworkers loved the parmesan-crusted pork. I think the flank steak and the sirloin won out for best flavor, but everything was delicious. And pineapple goes with more things than you'd ever expect! The server places a small boat of sauces on the table, and I had a hard time deciding whether to use them - the meats are very tasty by themselves, but the sauces aren't so overwhelming, and they complement the meat nicely. The servers are excellent. They can spot a turned-over button from anywhere in the restaurant, and you will not have an empty plate if you don't want to. The guy with the flank steak is SO HAPPY to give you flank steak. He'll tell you every time that it's his favorite. Seriously, it made me happy FOR him that he got to be the flank steak guy, because he was just so into it, and then I ended up getting about 4 lbs of flank steak. The pineapple guy is great, too. He figured out that I was the one at our table that was going to get pineapple every time, even if my button was turned down, and he cracked a joke about getting me some pineapple to go. I don't actually know how I had room for dessert, but I guess my stomach just put up a white flag about 20 minutes in and didn't care how long I was going to keep going. The mango mousse is tasty but light, and it's got pretty pink stripes on the side (I think that was the deciding factor, actually). So yeah, I'm a lot heavier this afternoon than I was before lunch, but it's completely ok.

28484,"In a word: no. Went there on Saturday night and was disappointed on three different levels: 1) The food just wasn't that interesting. We tried the tasting menu, which is usually the chef putting his best foot forward. Too bad for him. We knew that the portions would be small, so we even ordered some extra dishes to supplement the tasting menu - more on that later. The Caesar salad was nothing special, and potato bisque was decent but it's not something that you couldn't have a million other places; the scallops themselves were fine but the almond paste was way too overpowering, and beef was actually quite good, and the chocolate dessert was too salty for my taste and the guiness ice cream going annoying after the first bite. We also had the risotto (horrible and overcooked) and the mac n' cheese, which was something I could make at home - save for the unnecessary truffle foam. We were waiting the whole time for it to get good, and it was just nothing special. And the drinks were watered down and tasteless. 2) I get that this is supposed to be a tasting at a fine restaurant and if you want a huge bowl of pasta or a whole slab of ribs then go to a chain family restaurant - I get it. But the portion sizes were ridiculous. I kid you not - the caesar salad (tasting menu, remember) lettuce leaf - note the singular on ""leaf"" - was the size of my thumb. The entire time we were eating, we were hoping that the portions would get just a little larger so that we wouldn't have to stop for more food on the way home. We even added two dishes to the $70 tasting menu. No such luck, and then the worst happened.... 3) They served my friend her beef and literally have of it was fat. Remember that the ""regular"" beef that we had was only 5-6 bites to begin with, so her losing those three bites was upsetting. And the beef was honestly the bright spot in the entire meal. We were so hungry and disappointed that we politely pointed out to our server that we had been served a portion that was too fatty. He honestly had no idea what to do. We just asked if she could have another piece and he said he'd have to check. He came back and said ""that's the way it is"" and instead offered to give us free dessert wine. (??) I'm not sure in what language beef = port, but whatever. We had gone for my friend's birthday, and needless to say, I was embarrassed. The whole thing was a joke and I think this restaurant is a little full of themselves. I can deal with the snobby attitude on the portion sizes and even the ""we serve fatty beef"" response, but then the flavors better be damn good. And they simply weren't. Over spending $400 on three people, we had to head down the street to Elate to finish up dinner. We spent 1/8 at Elate that we did at Graham Elliot and we were fed, had good drinks, and a wonderful server who had a great attitude.

48488,"I would never run back here with so many fabulous restaurant spots in Chicago. To be honest, with such good ratings, this one causes me to lose trust in Yelp.

This is from someone who has rarely missed a meal and LOVES food. Normally, I'd be licking the plate in a place like this. To add insult to injury, I had three different wines.

58636,"I am always amazed that Nuevo Leon has such a strong following. As a lifelong Mexican Food aficionado, IMHO the food at NL is not just bad, it is horrible. There are no redeeming qualities to this restaurant. I believe that it is successful because many are unfamiliar with real mexican food and/or have such low expectations of mexican restaurants. Every couple of years, I am compelled to give Nuevo Leon another try because so many folks rave about the place. Yet, on my last visit, a bland tasteless salsa was brought out (we even witnessed salsa, after a customer left, being put back by the waiter into a large bowl, only to be scooped up again to be served anew; yuck!), the chips were soggy, greasy and tasteless, and there was an energizer battery in the soup (yes, this happened to us!). No apologies for having a lithium battery in the soup. The only explanation was that the cooks are a playful bunch and like to prank each other. It is a wholly unsannitary and tasteless experience. There is no charm to roaches, rats, spotty service, tasteless food, unsanittary conditions and, on top of that, long lines.

Although, in my lonely opinion, the gigantic hotdogs are a bit cheeezy, Superdawg is the standard which I judge and compare all hotdogs to. Although I cannot explain what makes the hotdog so special -you have to try it for yourself- the french fries are just as awesome as the hotdogs. They are so crispy and so simple : salt + potato + oil = perfect french fry . Moreover the milkshakes are well balanced and tasty : they are not too sweet and heavy like most milkshakes yet it is satisfying; in other words, the milkshake doesn't overpower the hotdog, but complements it - I know this is an odd description, but this is true-.

3985,"Wow. So my husband and I celebrated our first anniversary last night. Our boss managed to get us a reservation at Schwa and we may be indebted to him forever. No, he won't hold it over our heads. The experience was just that good. He recommended some types of wine to bring for ourselves (dry riesling and a cote du rhone). Though it's BYO, the guys had some stuff they poured for the tables, including a really awesome beer. Make sure you take something to the kitchen. We were told wine, which is what we got after a long beer versus wine debate. (My chef husband and all his friends usually prefer a cold beer after their shifts). It seems they really dig whiskey, so that's a good option. We did the 9 course, and there wasn't a single disappointing dish. They sent a few extra things, and we loved every bit of every dish. The ""meltiest"" salmon I've ever had was served to me last night-- and I mean that as a compliment. It was.. happiness in a dish. We've eaten at some amazing places, but this was our best meal in Chicago. I know I write that fairly frequently, but I mean it each time. The food was fun and playful and delicious. I like how Carlson and his guys never let you get bored-- you'll get something very savory, followed by a primarily sweet dish. My husband, who loves ground cherries like nothing I've ever seen, said he would eat the ""flowers"" dish on his death bed. Before that dish, I didn't really care for ground cherries. Now I'm a convert. The food is amazing. Everything's well balanced and anyone who says they love food should eat at Schwa. Service-- For anyone who doesn't know, there is no real wait staff. The chefs and Michael Carlson's brother, Seth, do everything. They are awesome and, really, who better to talk about the food than the folks who make it? They joked with the tables, danced randomly to the music, and made us laugh. For the first time ever, I was really sad to leave a restaurant. I want to be friends with those guys. Atmosphere-- So relaxed. We were completely overdressed-- I wore a black dress and he wore a suit. (Those worries disappeared as soon as we were eating). This might not be the best place to take your elderly, conservative grandparents, but it's great for anyone who likes to have fun. The music was completely unexpected, but set an awesome mood. At one point (I believe we were eating rabbit), a song in which ""Kill her"" was repeated started BLASTING from the sound system. It shocked everyone and I thought they'd rush to turn it down. Nope. And I'm glad. I usually whine about music being too loud, but my husband and I could still converse so it was fine.  I want to go back as frequently as we can get reservations. I've never had such a good time during a meal. I know it's hard to get a reservation (and from what I read, hard to keep one), but the struggle will be rewarded.",10/9/2011,b8eVB33jldBSU3Izt5nHTQ,4A1lJvjAffIwuVAeT_pFXg,bNXpwTSavHBV9zBk2lUlGA,N,5,1

Expect a dimly lit, lively interior, alongside an open kitchen. Plenty of staff around, service was fine. Our table got the (3-course) tasting menu. It was kind of hard to hear what the declaration of what each dish was. The tapas ranged from meh to ""omg, I could pop those braised rabbit dumplings with brandied cherries like candy"". Besides the rabbit dumplings, the other highlight of dinner was the tender lambchop, and I'm not a huge fan of gamey things either.  Other tapas served just seemed like fancy versions of flatbread pizza, bruschetta, goat cheese, and prosciutto spinach salad with alright flavors. The garlic shrimp and prawn smelled better than they tasted. I liked the idea of the paella croquettes, but I thought the flavor was lost next to the crispy texture of the croquette.

58397,"I'm going to follow up to my partner James G.So we had the Quiche (aka Egg Jello) and Egg-Layonaise (aka Steak n' Shake French Fry Salad) and amazingly, following our review, we received an email from Sarah the general manager. I am sure that you are (like we did) expected an explanation of the dishes maybe, a little bit of info, maybe we can even stretch as far to say a condolences let alone an apology, but no. No such luck.Instead she told us that we clearly didn't get her joke about there being tables inside the dining area we could be sat at, suggesting a) that she knew it was a stupid place for a table and b) that it is our responsibility to make sure we are properly taken care of at her restaurant (actually, that doesn't sound half bad, looking back at it, I would have gladly gone to the kitchen and just cooked myself some scrambled eggs and toast had I known what I was in for)EDIT: I totally forgot this: She said it was really funny that those were the two dishes we got and were unhappy with, because they were the two dishes that she received the most compliments on, and that no one ever complains about....Mind you, we picked up on the term Egg Jello from Amanda R.'s post that was also pretty recent...So yeah, we're not the only people that think it, and apparently Sarah reads her reviews, but she doesn't really read her reviews, or whatever. End Edit.She also stated that she would never have made someone pay for a meal that they were dissatisfied with, and generally I completely agree. I absolutely agree, that if you as a customer do not give the restaurant, store, etc the opportunity to make up for something you are unhappy with, you have no business writing a poor review. With that said, we were never given the opportunity to. Our server's check-back literally consisted of him carrying food to a table near us, looking over his shoulder and saying Everything looks good. Sarah claims that she spoke to us, not once, not twice, but three times, and that each time we just nodded. As someone that used to work in the field, I can tell you that's waiter-speak for I know i should have checked, but maybe if I suggest that you just didn't hear me, you will believe that I really was doing everything I could, even though I know damn well I performed less than adequately. Also, while on that note, we had no idea she was the general manager, if we had, we would have flagged her down, we thought that she was just supplementary host staff. All she did was hang out in the front by the host stand, and help carry food to larger groups, so we waited around for our server, but eventually hunger took over and we tried to piece around the parts we could handle.Now, there's a come a time, where as a considerate customer you finally look at your plate and say Well, I came here to try new things, I tried something new, I hated it, but now I've sort of eaten half of it (3 bites) and it's really too late to make a fuss. If both of our dishes are terrible, I am going to assume that the rest of them are, so I don't particularly want to replace them. I am also going to assume that if they don't care enough about their guests or their food to make sure that the two connect, then I can just chalk it up to one more reason why I am going to continue to go to Sola instead.In conclusion, If you want to brunch were the service ignores you, the management is confrontational, and the food leaves you sick to your stomach all day....Go to IHOP, at least there you can honestly say you got what you paid for.",12/14/2009,J8saW9cBpIg2QfXTT6oh8Q,-WS3ezCvlfkyqXgPwBadXA,eHtnZ0ISo63_0zr9rFotjw,Y,5,0
60948,"3 friends and I had dinner at Bin 36 last night. We had an enjoyable evening up until the last 10 minutes of our meal. After spending over $300 on appetizers, wine flights and entrees my friend asked if she could take home a few of the complimentary breadsticks for her husband. The waiter said sure, ""for $1 a breadstick."" Surely he's joking we thought. She asked for 20 breadsticks and sure enough there was a $20 charge for breadsticks. We paid the bill and on the way out I explained to the manager how angry we were about being nickel and dimed over COMPLIMENTARY breadsticks after spending over $300 on dinner. She apologized for the confusion and offered to return the $20. We said that would be fine and when she handed my friend her money back she took the breadsticks back!!! WHAT!?! We were absolutely livid by this point and when I asked her to explain the policy of charging for a complimentary item she said ""they didn't want to get into the business of selling breadsticks."" Really? Is that that big of a problem at Bin 36? The restaurant was half-empty and they were more concerned about the potential crisis of getting into the business of selling breadsticks opposed to taking care of customers who otherwise would have left quite happy. Now over a few silly breadsticks that probably cost them a few bucks TOPS they've lost 4 customers and the countless number of people each of us will tell about this ridiculous, inconceivable policy. I'm in the food industry and have had the honor of working with some of the top chefs in the country and I simply cannot imagine any of them treating a customer the way we were treated last night.

47185,"I feel awful for writing a 3-star review among all the glowing 4 and 5-star ones, but I really did think that it was just ok. Tuesday night is 1/2 price burger night - the place was packed, but we got a table right away. We were seated inside, where tables are close to each other and the music is LOUD. It was quite difficult to carry a conversation without screaming. Our waitress was pretty cool. She seemed genuinely concerned when she delivered the bad news that the Warden is not included in Tuesday's special. That's alright, I thought. I came here for that particular burger and who knows if/when I'll be back. It took forever to get our food. Thankfully, Lockdown has a full service bar for those looking to speed up time. When the burgers arrived, they looked great, although we had to ask for our sides, which never came with the burgers. You can smell the truffle oil from a mile away. The fried shallots, though, were a bit confusing and unnecessary. I have to say that they got the pretzel bun right- see, the pretzel bun can be either very bad or very good, there isn't anything in between. Lockdown's was very good. The entire burger, though, seemed to be missing something and I couldn't help dipping it in ketchup. I guess everything that needed to be there got stuffed inside the burger- the patty was at least an inch thick. The Warden was not what I envisioned and was a bit salty. I dunno, maybe I'll be back and try the Green Mile, but it will be a while before I finish completely digesting the Warden. I would definitely request a table outside.

42511,"I really can't find anything wrong with this establishment. Wasn't even supposed to go out last night, but a game-time decision led us to Gilt Bar, a favorite of my friend Anthony (who is in the industry and knows where those in the know go). Being behind Merchandise Mart, it isn't exactly easy for the tourists to find, which is also a plus. Dimly lit, wood tables, dark leather booths, exposed filament light bulbs, candles, and that awesome gold chandelier that reminded me of gold fireworks - it just screamed date night to me, but there were also communal seats perfect for a group. It was busy at 830pm but no wait. We receive the menus, and the first thing I notice is all the cocktails made with St Germain. I am sort of obsessed with St Germain. I got a Champagne Cokctail, with St Germain, Lemon, and Prosecco. It was good...but my buddy got the corpse reviver # 2 (St Germain, Lillet Blanc, Absinthe, aperol and deaths door gin) and it was freakin' incredible. Next time, I'm all over that. Nice craft beer list and wine list as well. Not the cheapest drink menu either, but they did have PBR and ""table wine"" for those on a budget. Then the food...wow. I feel like the prices were the same as Nightwood, so not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Meat from small producers, seasonal fruits/veggies. The trendy bone marrow was on the list of appetizers, salads, multiple sides, pastas, meats/seafoods. I ordered pork meatballs with white grits, brown butter, and thyme. Delish. Outside was charred and inside was pink. SO tender, so delicious. Grits were great too. However, I am still thinking about those potatoes. Smashed red potatoes with roasted garlic & chicken jus. Now I know what you're thinking. That doesn't sound all that exotic...big deal. Well, I am one of those people who gets her steak rare just so I can eat potatoes mixed with the juices and blood. I don't like dry food, and I love extra sauce on everything. So I get these potatoes, and there is the chicken jus floating on top. Oh my god I was in HEAVEN. SOOOOO good!!!!! My buddy got the duck confit pasta with english peas and mint. The peas looked really bright green, so I bet they were delish. However, I don't care for duck so I just had a bite of pasta and had enough. Sorry, I[m sure it was good for what it was but duck is gnarly, in my opinion. Same with teh escarole my buddy ordered. I don't like soggy lettuce and that is essentially what this was. They did pair it with toasted wheatberries though, so a wilted + crunchy contrast. Once again, good if you like that kind of thing. As you can see, this is foodie food. However, they do have a coal-fired ribeye with cracked black pepper that even the simplest of palates would enjoy. Then dessert. Oh boy. You know how at most upscale restaurants, when they list 3 ice creams, you assume you get a trio of small scoops on a plate? Well guess what? When you order all three here, you get three REAL scoops. I got a huge goblet full of three scoops of ice cream. mint chip, vanilla bean, and milk chocolate fudge swirl. With a side of hot caramel and a side of hot fudge. I am not sure how I didn't have an explosion in the bathroom after that. Well it is handmade, with the best ingredients. So I suppose that's why my bowels didn't hate me all night. The hot caramel was awesome, with tht burnt butter flavor. They have caramel corn too, and I bet they use that on top. Hot fudge was like a dark chocolate, also good. This isn't your baskin-robbins topping, that's for sure. All in all, a great experience. They are also open late, and the bathrooms are cool as hell.

32557,"We went here because the reviews said it was a cut above the rest of the Chicago Ethiopians places. And it was. It's a little more Western-paced and less laid back than some of the other African restaurants we've been to. The tables are western, no traditional woven mats or anything, but at about 8 o'clock, when the traditional dancing lessons begin... it becomes clear that eating here is supposed to be an Ethiopian experience. I'm not going to promise that you will get lessons in chest-bouncing dancing every night, but this place starts out very respectable and then gets quite lively as the night goes on. You're not just coming to eat. You'd do well to arrive late on a Friday and expect to stay a while for dancing. The meal is what you might describe as a variety of curries eaten with injera soft low-gluten flat bread. It's not literally Indian curry, but that's the idea. The servers create your meal with you based on a brief discussion of the menu, which has some complexity to it. If you drink, you have to drink the honey-wine of course, though there are many other options.

11273,"Piece is just OK. I give it two stars because the brewery selection is pretty good...Golden Arm is a solid choice. It does have a good selection of sauces and toppings, I suppose, and the pizzas are massive, but it's nothing to write home about. I'm starting to really dig Chicago-style pizza, so maybe that's it; Piece is just regular pizza. It reminds me of Mellow Mushroom but without the awesome parmesan crust. Oh, and the caprese salad, which is one of my favorite things on earth and is pretty difficult to screw up, was weak. The mozzarella, CLEARLY not buffalo mozzerella, was sliced into thick rectangles and there was little, if any, balsamic vinegar. Not tasty. I may venture back if an event draws me there, but I won't go there if I'm craving great pizza.",4/25/2008,EsA0jvfTes9WQ3mFbxZPxA,f6Pq3Mw0u2Rtupe7gPNoAA,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA,N,2,1

32571,"I have eaten here twice and I am not a big sushi guy. The first time I ate at Sunda I did a variation of the miso soup and had the firecracker. I was not a fan and did not like my food or the service the first go around. The server seemed as though she was not on top of the things, she messed up a very basic set of orders but did apologize profusely for her mistakes. The second time at Sunda I did the miso soup, dragon roll and the beef dish entree (cant remember the name off the top of my head was steak like with awesome seasoning maybe wagyu, would have to look at the menu) that meal was unbelievably good. The beef was excellent, the dragon roll was much more my speed and the miso of course was miso.  What I learned from my two trips at Sunda is that you need to order lots of different things off the menu. Try everything you think looks good because the portions are not large. Also, you must be very specific and stern with your server as they are fleeting and seem to think if you don't make a big deal about the little things they can put you off while tending to the other million tables they are waiting on. The menu at Sunda is deceiving, though it appears as though you can eat decently here for 30 dollars, that is clearly not the case. To enjoy your meal plan to spend 70-100 each.  For sushi in Chicago this is one of the places you have to go to, just mentally prepare yourself for suspect service.",11/19/2010,WYs4eCCliczArggyLo,DSE3ye6aFW6h3QZWA2QFxg,8d_DiHWB-pjBVW3a7D8EWg,N,4,1
33113,"My husband and I went here because I had purchased a Groupon. Being that this place is a bit on the pricey side, the Groupon was a major help. First, the place is very easy to get to via public transportation. We walked from the Belmont Blue stop. We noticed several buses nearby. The place is really nice and cozy inside and was clean and well-kept. Our server's name was Daniel, and he was excellent. He explained the menu items and was just very friendly and polite. The dishes we had were excellent. I had the vegetarian goulash. One of the main reasons I wanted to try this place as I'm planning a trip to Romania in a couple of years so I thought why not try the cuisine and get a feel for it. The portion size was very large. We also got the flaming cheese appetizer which was delicious.",4/20/2012,jhzTewWcRganjmHE03MFEg,cVX9uszVLZsERDcpa1jBwg,O6uWHgJzylSjWjPSJKGhnQ,N,5,1
27588,"Creme Fraiche! Like Randy Marsh I was in food bliss. I had read all about the hype of Pequod's as the city's best deep dish (or is that pan?) pizza. I'd need reinforcements for this excursion. My buddy that just relocated to the area met up with Kris and I for our afternoon feast. No waiting to be seated and we had a nice booth in the corner. Based on a little Yelping research I knew deep dish was the thing to get here. Great taps of seasonal brews from Half Acre, Sam Adams and New Belgium. We put together an order while we got started on pitcher one of NB's 2 Below. Spinach, mushroom, garlic, extra sauce and light cheese for the lady. Sausage, pepperoni, garlic and extra sauce for the gents. It would look kind of odd if Kris and I both got our own pies, so I'm glad my buddy solved that problem for us. About the time we moved onto our second pitcher, the dude showed up struggling to hold our pizzas. Right here dude! These things clunked down on the table like they were Grandma's old cast iron skillet. They smelled fantastic for starters, that would be the garlic. We wasted no time tackling these pies. It's a little thick for my taste (that's what she said) which is why you'll want to go with extra sauce. The sauce is tangy and a bit spicy, but not sweet at all. I liked the charred cheese around the rim of the crust. That's a nice touch that added another level of flavor. The garlic and pepperoni kicked in with some spiciness and the big chunks of fenneled sausage were tasty. Pretty damn good. I liked this one better than the veggie, but they were both great. Our beer and za gluttony hit Thanksgiving levels as we caught up and the brew flowed on to the third pitcher. Things were not expensive at all. I think our pies were $25 even with all the toppings and the pitchers were about $17. That's a steal that we'll surely take advantage of again. I also liked that they had all the accompaniments of red pepper, grated cheese and herbs on the table already. I had an excellent afternoon buzz by the time we left and had such a great time that I halted the cab dead in it's tracks when I realized I had forgotten our leftovers at Pequod's. I think I was about halfway down the block in pouring rain when I heard Kris ask if I was really going back to get them. Is this man serious about pizza? I think so. 4.5 stars",8/17/2011,riNufplaCeAOQbKUjVgKlQ,YuwgxESPRUGFo97IdE4eyw,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,5,1

58459,"The short of it: heavily garlic and salted tomato based sauces I would say are American Italian...not authentic to the least. Service was horrendous...which makes it worse since italian restaurants cater to not only the food, but the hospitality. Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in the city, do not make the BYOB be the only reason you go there. Can't believe this place gets 4 stars. The long of it: My hubby and I were craving italian food and our usual spot was booked solid. So, we looked on yelp and saw that Caro Mio was well rated and that they make their own pasta...figured if they take the time to do that, it has to be good. We got there early-ish on a Saturday night at 6pm and walked int the door. We stood there for over 5 mins while the head of the house stood on against the bar in the back staring at us and talking occasionally to someone else. We were the only ones at the door, everyone else was sitting. This should have been an indication of the service we were about to receive. We sat, had a lovely waitress who was attentive with drinks, took our order of one app and two entrees all the while, the restaurant started to fill in. We were ignored for the next 30 mins, had to flag our waitress down who informed us our dinner was almost ready... I reminded her that we still had not had our appetizer. At which point she said oh my god and ran off to the kitchen. She returned promptly saying the kitchen is almost finished with our dinners but could hold them back a little if we wanted the app. I said fine, two mins later, we received our mildly warm app.  Expecting our dinner to be out soon after since the waitress said it was almost up...we made eye contact with her every time she left the kitchen. Stopped by 2x to say they were almost done. then they finally came out 45 MIN LATER after the app.  Pasta should never take 2 hours unless you are making everything from scratch to order...I guarantee they are not. Not once did the manager stop by to apologize or did we receive any type of apology after the initial thing from the apps. Ridiculous. The food was mediocre at best. It was definitely on the American side with heavy tomato based. Service, terrible.",9/11/2010,Hw633lFbznPQjsx0qyfIQw,xygIHSsAyVXVUr8pWvEFnw,NGfbRjWoqUh2fGw8DU_pmA,Y,1,0
58300,"Vegan. There's a word that can scare the appetite out of you!! I heard about the Chicago Diner from some of my crazy runner friends and I drove past it yesterday on the way to my friend's house (A.K.A - Polish party girl, who always finds herself in the midst of some kind of sh**t-storm, only to drink vodka and laugh her way out of it). I didn't have a lot of time on my hands, but I decided to park with my hazards on and run in to check out. Inside I was greeted with vintage ads and neon lights, what I understood to be the atmosphere that owners Mickey Hornick and partner Chef Jo Kaucher were going for. They were quoted as saying they wanted to make the restaurant as American as mini malls Instead of french fries, they serve home fries. They offer vegan milkshakes and not dogs for kids. Most importantly...they have dessert. When I walked up to the busy counter, I looked behind the glassful of cakes and promptly took the suggestion of the woman in front of me to try a piece of their carrot cake ($5.95). I waited about 5 minutes, grabbed my piece, and walked out. When I got in my car, I realized I had minutes to spare before I was to meet the Polish Party Girl. I opened the container and dug in. I was absolutely shocked at what the first bite brought..so I piled more into my mouth. I sat in my car and devoured that monstrous piece of carrot cake in less than 10 minutes, and it was by far the best carrot cake I have had in my life.This had to be a trick. Where was the butter, egg whites, and cream cheese?? No sir. This was vegan cream cheese frosting that was richer than any regular frosting I've ever tasted. These were all natural ingredients and cane sugar. And this was delicious. After I sat back and realized I was a closet eater (who eats cake in their car???), I also realized that if this was vegan...there might be a whole new world out there for me to try.

27919,"Hello, We visited Graham Elliott at the suggestion of my fiancee.  We entered the restaurant and were greeted at the host stand in a rather curt manner. They asked us to leave by 7 PM because they had a reserved guest coming for restaurant week. They redeemed themselves by seating us in a table for two by the window on a wonderful afternoon. The atmosphere is energetic and the waitress was really hip and cool. The service was outstanding. Our water glasses were always filled. The silverware was changed at each course. The table was wiped down in between courses as well.  From the beginning, the prices seemed high for fine dining in a bistro atmosphere. As the meal progressed, my opinion of the place deteriorated. We started with Foie Gras mousse loillpops coated in pop rocks. They were overly salty and devoid of the flavor usually found with foie gras. The pop rocks actually saved the appetizer, but neither of us finished it. Our next entree was a cold beef carpaccio. The presentation was awesome. The appetizer consisted of four cracker sized portions of beef sliced lunch meat thin and placed on top of cream cheese (it may have been mozzarella but it lacked flavor). I know that marbling of beef indicates extra flavor, but this ratio of fat was a little unappealing. We then had our hot appetizer, pan seared scallops. The waitress did explain that these small plates were not meant for sharing.  Again, the presentation was incredible. However, it is hard to taste an appetizer when one is served only two scallops. By comparison, if you order pan seared scallops at other restaurants in the area, there are usually 5-8 large scallops served. They are prepared the same way, but the presentation isn't as good. Personally, I prefer a little less eccentric presentations with more food of the same quality. When dinner came, the halibut was a 2 inch by 2 inch square. Given the $31 price, we figured at the time we ordered that the plate would be large enough to share. The last few times I was charged in this price range for halibut, it was for a decent size filet, presented elegantly with enough accouterments for sharing. It was also at restaurants (Morton's Roy's, Hugo's Frog Bar) that are at the same caliber Graham Elloitt claims to be minus the trendy atmosphere. As dessert came, I was dissatisfied, but not angry. When it arrived and I saw that we paid $10 for two peeled strawberries, a half a scoops of melted lavender ice cream, and a few crumbles of angel food cake, I was mad. The presentation was incredible, but I am not one who likes to pay $122 to eat the creation of someone playing with food. When the bill came, suffice it to say, I was livid. A four ounce soda pop with ice was $3 per serving. Thus, I paid $6 for a can of Coke. I drank water through out the meal to keep my palate fresh and saved the coke for the end because 1) I limit alcohol to special occasions and 2) there was so little starch in the entrees that I actually began to feel dizzy. I honestly felt ripped off. The portions were so small that I actually had to order a pizza later. When I brought this to the attention of the restaurant via e-mail, Mr. Bowles responded himself with: On 5/21/10 8:35 PM, ""Graham Elliot Bowles"" xxxxxx@gmail.com wrote: (e-mail address concealed to comply with Yelp privacy policy) Brian, Is this a joke?

27126,"I have been to GE twice, once in early September with my husband, and once last night with a group of girls for a birthday dinner. I was happy with the experience in September, although I am ashamed of myself for spending $13 on an appetizer with Cheez-Its in it. My husband had short rib stroganoff and I had a salmon ""BLT,"" both of which were very good. However, the experience last night was not good, at all. We waited nearly an hour past our 8:45 reservation. No one offered to take our coats or to get us drinks (the bar was full and there was nowhere to sit). When we were finally seated, it took FOREVER for the food to come out. We shared the potato bisque and the sweetbreads for a first course. The sweetbreads were great, but I agree with the prior review that said the potato soup tasted like it was from a can (I've actually had better from a can!) I tasted almost everyone's entrees, the monkfish was good, the skate wing was good. The beef tenderloin was so overly smoky I couldn't finish the small bite my friend shared with me.  For dessert, we shared the green apple fritters and the deconstructed Snickers bar. I've had better apple fritters at apple orchards and farmer's markets. The others LOVED the Snickers dessert, but I'm not much of a peanut fan, so I didn't much care for it.  Drinks and popcorn were fabulous - I highly recommend the Indian Summer. Yum! Beyond the strange service and how long it took for the food to come out, I had a major issue with the bathrooms. THEY ARE DISGUSTING. GE is not a bar, therefore, when I am spending upwards of $80 on dinner, I fully expect not to have to ""hover.""  The garbage was overflowing, there were no paper towels or toilet paper, and there was pee all over the place. Sick. I probably won't be back - I've been there twice, it's pretty good but not outstanding, it's pricey, and there isn't the attention to detail that I expect from an upscale place.",2/25/2012,QGFVSRyTVckwKQtjBBdNqg,SHEziY_V4G60mVyLNvjLSQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,4,1
33201,"Sultan's Market is the definition of hit or miss. Their sandwiches are cheap and awesome. I'm not a falafel fan, it's almost always too dry or greasy, but I've had the falafel sandwich more times than I can remember at Sultan's. It's just great. It's also kinda healthy, filling dinner for under $5. Ask for the spicy salsa and you'll really get a kick out of it. The chicken shawarma sandwich is really good too. They're both served in a pita pocket with some veggies and stuff (Jerusalem Salad, tahini, I think hummus, etc.). The pita can break apart because of the liquid in there, so be careful, but I still think it's worth it. Now, if you get a normal meal there, like a normal chicken shawarma dish, then you're in for one of the worst meals of your life. How is this possible? I mean the same meat goes in the sandwich as goes into the dish. Yes, but in the dish, there's no real sauce or anything else decent to dress it up. The rice is bland, and, just ugh. I wish I could explain it better, I really do, but I can't, so, just trust me. For your own sake, trust me.",2/22/2011,xzIMWYFtrClQuFXoFolNfw,IyJW3_X2a9--vAjnitt8FQ,O6uWHgJzylSjWjPSJKGhnQ,N,5,1
29157,"Recently, I started a journey to find the best Pad Thai in the city. I have been all over the place looking for decent Thai food that isnt too americanized. In comes, Opart Thai House Restaurant. We were randomly in the south loop and decided to check out this joint. We parked on the street (metered parking) only to find out that they have parking in back...hmm good news because I plan on returning to this place. We both ordered Pad Thai, I ordered vegetable and my bf ordered chicken. I found out that the veggie pad thai was lacking in vegetables so I asked for more. They charged me $3 for a few extra veggies! WTF? I mean its only $3 but no one told me and I only got a few extras pieces. Overall, the Pad Thai is very good (not the best ever, I am still on my hunt). I also felt extremly rushed and the restaurant wasnt even busy. We had time to kill before our movie and basically got kicked out. I will return, hopefully to better service.",3/13/2009,Y1B4uIF-ALt5kITEmKDHhQ,3jX6-TtDnHZ02a5gYsEHsQ,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w,N,5,1

I always get the pasta special with the meatballs and the sauce with onions and garlic. Penne cooked al dente and with just enough spice. Food served hot and they give you enormous portions! Waitstaff are amazingly friendly! We had so much fun with our waiter last night that we asked him to join us for a glass of champagne. The only downside was that although the dipping sauces for the bread are great, the bread is like the basic stuff you find at Jewel. I wish they would get better authentic Italian style bread. Espresso wasn't strong enough and desserts are good but not amazing. This place is very accommodating for big groups and is well worth the wait!

50191,"I live and the neighborhood and absolutely love big jones! My husband and I make it a point to go at least once a month as we are part of their ""bourbon society"" (you get a free tasting every month of a particular bourbon..once you try them all, you get a 5 course meal with bourbon pairings....admittedly this will take us about 4 years, but we are patient people ;) ) My husband loves the gumbo and thankfully it is on both the dinner and brunch menu. I am originally from the gulf coast and love having a taste of home readily available such as shrimp and grits and collard greens. The ingredients are fresh, local and they cure and grind their meats in house which I find impressive. I'm really partial to their hamburger and whatever seafood they are serving that day. Their shrimp and grits are better than any i've had in the south. I have a gluten allergy/intolerance and surprisingly, this is one of the most gluten-free friendly restaurants around!  Their complimentary cornbread is gluten free, as are most sides, and if I'm ever interested in something, they never hesitate to make accommodations for me. Recently they opened a patio and I'm very much looking forward to spending a lot of time their this summer. Also, it doesn't jump out at you on the menu, but their warm oat cake with ginger and coconut ice cream is AMAZING.  Its more like a spice cake, the ice cream is only very subtly flavored with coconut, and the crystallized ginger and rhubarb jam all come together very well. My husband was not interested when I ordered it (and indeed ""oat cake"" does not scream ""tasty dessert!"") but he was blown away by it as well.  best part (for me): its GLUTEN FREE!  if you are someone who likes, carrot cakes, snickerdoodles, gingersnaps, biscoff cookies etc...youll love this. I appreciate that its not a huge dessert, and again is made to order.  Next time I order it, I will request more ginger...yum! I have only been here for brunch a couple of times but it is already one of our favorites (and Andersonville is pretty much brunch central so that's saying something). Dare I say that I like it even more than M.Henry?! Esp now that they too have a patio. For those complaining of the prices, please do your homework and check out the menu online before coming. Its not selling itself to be something it's not: you are NOT going to come here and get a plateful of food for $5. The prices reflect the QUALITY ingredients being used (did I mention that they cure and grind all meats in house? everything is made to order, each batch of bread is made as its being ordered etc).  It's an upscale twist on gulf coast food...I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a hamburger of this quality and taste.  Big Jones is definitely a unique restaurant and one I hope will be around for years to come",5/29/2012,3DO406PN2srmtKhIJEg,JDonj7kuVePqs1fhMZE9ag,ElCbMJRjgu9LDj4MxOKXew,N,5,1
54554,"I'm actually surprised this place has gotten such high reviews. I'm assuming most people must be new to the place otherwise they'd have noticed the significant decline in the quality of the food and service over the past few years. Considering this used to be a spot I frequented 2-3 days a week, it pains me to see such a great place starting to fall offThe food is different depending on what day you go and who the guys behind the counter are. Sometimes it's ok, other times it's just plain awful. Their falafels are made well but usually sit out under the lamps for god knows how long which, combined with the runny, bland, Jerusalem salad, results in a cold, wet/soggy sandwich.  These are NOT the same Sultan's falafel sandwiches I used to know and love. The lentil soup has a different consistency everytime I get it and unless you add a ton of lemon juice, it's pretty bland. The salad bar doesn't seem to get rotated with fresh vegetables regularly so by the time you come in for dinner, the lettuce is wilted, the veggies are all mixed together, etc...besides, with so many people lined up next to it on a daily basis, I'd rather not take my chances. On the upside, their egg & cheese fettia and spinach pie are both still pretty tasty, they have a pretty good selection of beverages, it's fast (sometimes to the point of being rushed), and their prices are cheap (although the people behind the register have been known to overcharge).",11/20/2008,1YnBwV_WE6LeS8109efyaw,LVSaaichoeLkWadzCcNpQA,O6uWHgJzylSjWjPSJKGhnQ,Y,5,0

The physical space is nothing extraordinary - you order your food at the counter and eat at the few stools inside or on the patio (weather permitting). They were more than willing to accommodate our BYOBottle of wine with no corkage fee.  For such a small kitchen, the menu offers several choices of authentic apps, sandwiches, entrees, pastries and smoothies. We tried the Media Noche - a Cubano on sweet bread served with crispy plantain chips, as well as the Ropa Vieja - a very generous portion of shredded beef which was slow cooked and well seasoned. All dinners come with rice and beans as well as plantains, which left enough for a little midnight snack. Another huge bonus - food comes out fast!

54787,"I was really looking forward to having dinner at the Hopleaf since I have heard great things about their food but left feeling disappointed. For openers, we arrived before 6:00 and the dining room in the back had maybe 3 people in it. Knowing this, the hostess wanted to seat us behind a wall and facing a stairway and an emergency exit. Since the place empty I told the hostess to give us a better table. Duh?  For an appetizer we started out sharing their signature Mussels Belgian style and they were excellent. For my entree I ordered Montreal brisket and it was extremely dried out and should not have been served in my opinion. Perhaps more disappointing was the Stliton cheese mac which not only didn't taste of Stilton, it didn't taste of anything because it was so under seasoned. My dining partner had the Steak Frites which was a success in terms of the steak but a failure in terms of the frites which were soggy and so over salted they hurt your lips. This coupled with a robot waiter made the experience a downer. Sorry, but I won't be back for the food.",10/14/2010,0IYffRM6sipyimrTEyYPbw,CA7oL9W4vBsMAQONwqMHmQ,tCkwBTuEFvhuaBoEUWqbuQ,Y,4,0

Pancakes with toffee bits in them served with a buttery, warm toffee sauce and fresh bananas sliced thin piled all over the top. Perfection. Five stars. I will dream about them.

20060,"I stared at this for a while trying to decide how many stars to give. I must say, I was very very close to giving 3 stars... I am a huge Rick Bayless fan. I own books...I dvr his show. I think he's a great chef and I love to eat his food. This place however just doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion. I tried the Ahogada because I'm a huge fan of good carnitas. I expected to get some of the best tasting carnitas ever and what I got were arguably the worst. I felt the meat was very dry and pretty tasteless. I had to bathe the sandwich in the hot sauce that came with to get flavor. I must say, I was quite disappointed in that. If I had to guess why it was lacking, I would say they probably don't prepare the whole pig by slow roasting it overnight. I'm pretty sure shortcuts are taken. That is my own speculation though. Either way, I definitely do not recommend that sandwich to anyone who wants good carnitas. However it is prepared, it isn't very good. My wife got a Milanesa (Chicken) torta and had mixed feelings. At first, she wasn't blown away, but it helped when she asked for avocado. I tried it and thought it was pretty good, but nothing special. We both ordered chocolate milk and they were both just ok.  Lastly, we got churros with ice cream. I actually thought these were very good and I highly recommend them. They probably saved my rating this time around. Overall, I feel I may be a little harsh in my words, but I feel this was a very average meal. I'd like to add that my feelings definitely weigh in that you are paying $10 for this sandwich and a couple bucks for a small cup of chocolate milk. The truth is that I could get a better tasting torta at half the price almost anywhere else that I frequent. I think it is kind of ridiculous to pay so much more for a sandwich that isn't twice as good (As stated above, my sandwich wasn't even as good...much less twice as good). The only reason this is not a 3 star is that I decided to give it one more shot...one day.

After the reconfiguration, the seating became tight and uncomfortable. Secondly the service went from being friendly to surly. Finally the quality of the food and service has taken a huge nose dive! Three times I had made advanced reservations, for a moderate-sized group (six people) and two out of three times a table wasn't ready for us, in fact, we had to wait more than a half hour for our table! On one such occasion, when we had an advanced reservation, there was an open table reserved for a same sized group behind us, yet they didn't make any adjustments to sit us and give the group behind us the table. We were forced to wait for a full hour, while those who had reservations behind us got seated ahead of us! Then another time my girlfriend and I went there, and the service was so poor, the waitress never checked if we needed more coffee or water, or to see if the food was OK. We only got one cup of coffee, no extra water and the order was incomplete! We decided not to go back for a while. When we did, they had Mrs. Butterworth's on the table. I asked the waitress if Glenn's had Maple Syrup, even for an additional charge (which I gladly would have paid). She pointed at the bottle and said 'dat's all we got.

48533,"Publican is a unique experience that tries hard but doesn't deliver. I really had a hard time deciding on the star rating because part of my issue with Publican is personal preference vs. failing to deliver. Bottom line, I wasn't overly impressed and probably won't be back. Background: Dinner, 7:45 on a Tuesday night Food: The quality of the food is, for the most part, good. However, the menu selection leaves a bit to be desired. Basically, the menu is set up as ""Tapas Plus:"" larger than tapas, but not a meal in and of itself. Here is a rundown of what my friend and I shared:   Chef's choice oysters - good selection, good flavor...but then again  oysters don't require cooking.   Daily Pickle plate - bread and butter pickles with some pickled vegetables as well. I really like pickled foods...but really didn't like this these items, simply based on flavor.   Trio of Hams - delicious thinly sliced hams. One of the best items we tried.   Steak Tartare - A steak tartare, what can I say. It was fine.   Boudin Blanc - The best item we had - deliciously seasoned. Beer:   Ohhhh the beer. They have a very substantial beer list. Luckily, they also have a very knowledgeable ""beer expert"" that can help you pair with what you are eating. The Saison with the oysters was a good call. Service: This is where the bottom fell out. Our server was HORRIBLE. He greeted us promptly, but then we said we need just a minute to look at the beer list he left us for 15 minutes before returning. When we asked him about popular items and to describe a few things he acted like it was a huge inconvenience. After the first round of beers our glasses sat empty for a good 10-15 minutes before he checked back. We actually started ordering from the food runners because they seemed to care more than our server and checked back. The server dropped off the check and then proceeded to go to the host stand and chit-chat for 10 minutes. This is was when I finally, got up, tracked down a manager and complained. It takes a LOT for me to get up and complain out a server. The manager listened intently and apologized for the inconvenience. Cost: It's billed as a high end restaurant, it's not cheap. I didn't think it delivered an experience or food aligned to the prices. 12 oz bottles of beer run from $5 up to $20. The food was somewhat overpriced for the portion and quality. Other considerations: The one cool thing Publican has going for it is the concept behind the restaurant - communal beer house. Big communal tables can be fun if you're in the right mind set, as can the booths that have doors on them. Definitely not the spot for a quite date, but a unique experience none the less.",9/13/2010,u9BJRMW7pUD82EPiWjx2JA,AGbc5zb3DxU6gXFo5lKpbA,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg,N,4,1

23345,"I should've prepped for the heartburn. Best dish of the night was probably the artery clogging Tony's Chicken. That stuff is seriously like crack. It's heavily breaded but the chicken is super tender and it's spicy and sweet. As equally good was the garlic peasprouts--mostly stems (which my bf didn't prefer). The shui-zhu niu rou (""water boiled beef"")--beef was rather rough and the flavor wasn't up to snuff. The dandan noodles were completely soaked with soy sauce on the bottom so if you let it sit too long, you might as well be eating soy sauce flour. Value? Dude, Chinese in my book should never be more than 20/person! But we came here relatively early on a Fri evening and service was actually one of the better I've seen in Chinese places.

46956,"My friend Q and I decided to get some carryout from here because we both wanted to be ""healthy"" after having worked out earlier that day. I was especially excited that they try to use seasonal, local, and organic products. Unfortunately, I was pretty much drawn to everything but the healthy. I was especially smitten by the macaroni and cheese, but it cost $12! That's pretty pricey for macaroni and cheese with nothing else in it but cheese, so I sadly decided to pass on it. Q knew that it had already captured my heart, though, so she forced me to get it. Ha. I love her. When we got home and I opened up my box of mac and cheese, I was horribly disappointed by the most blah looking mac and cheese I have ever seen. I guess I expected something that didn't look like it was made from the contents of a store-bought box of mac and cheese--and a small box at that. I was so disappointed that I didn't even want to taste it. I almost wanted us to drive back to the place and say, ""Are you kidding me? Can't you add even a nice garnish or something? Maybe a few pieces of lobster?"" Needless to say, I had my first forkful with very low expectations. All that changed, though, after a couple more forkfuls. And, eventually, the plain white box of boring looking macaroni and cheese had completely won me over by the time I got to the bottom. If I had been given the option to buy another $12 box at that very moment . . . I probably would've. Ha. Believe me, the cheese they use in this is exceptional and the high price tag is completely worth it. I will come back, my friends. And I might even try something else.

Our waiter, Joey, however, was friendly and courteous, so he either did not care that we didn't fit the attire of the usual lunch crowd or was laughing his ass off inside his mind. My co-worker had the fish and chips, while I had the regular burger. My co-worker thought the fries were awesome, and I thought the burger was pretty darn good. The seasoned fries were a great complement to the meal. For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and the french toast. My co-worker thought the mousse was alright. I found The gage's interpretation of french toast for dessert quite interesting (they breaded the outside with something crunchy), while it reminded my co-worker of Cracker Jacks.

50558,"Went here for dinner with my folks. I have heard some good things about their brunch and breakfast. So, maybe I should have tried it at those times. I was pretty disappointed with my meal overall. I got the crab cake dinner with mac n' cheese and fries. The food arrived cold. Nothing is worse than a cold crab cake and mac n' cheese. Flavor wise the mac n' cheese would have been good if warm but the crab cake left me sour. It looked to have crab in it but no real crab flavor...in fact no flavor at all. The 'sauces' they provided with the cakes were flavorless too.  Thankfully the hot sauce they had on the table provided some help. What surprised me was the service was good, though the place was pretty empty... So I'm not sure why my food came to me cold, unless it was improperly reheated, which scares me a bit. Now one saving grace was the dessert. My Ma wanted pie so how could I say no. I ordered the bread pudding. Which was delicious. It came out in a pie slice form, which I had never seen before. It was rich, soft and chewy, and the caramel sauce that came with it was a knock out. So the dessert leads me to believe maybe this is a place best reserved for brunch and dessert. Two of my favorite meals!

33066,Hugh?? There's only one baby chair for the whole restaurant? Well we just happen to have a spare in the car so we were able to eat here but that's pretty lame for a family restaurant. Note to management: this is a stupid way to lose customers in a bad economy. The wine was just terrible. We started with some Romanian varieties and had to send them back. They tasted corked. Then we tried the Argentina Malbec (I think?) and it was very watery and sweet. Kind of tasted like grape juice. Finally the French Merlot was indistinguishable from the Romanian. I had to question the waiter to see if he didn't make a mistake. Do yourself a favor and stick to the wonderful eastern European beers on the menu.  The food and service were excellent. I had the veal paprikash which had the most tender veal I've ever had with a very nice paprika brown gravy and some tasty polenta. My wife had the sausage stuffed chicken and that was also excellent. I would definitely go back to try some more of their delicacies. I will just not bother with their awful wine choices next time.,10/26/2011,DER3YN8vO,bdlsVlZRFH7ZQ7cP8SFmvA,O6uWHgJzylSjWjPSJKGhnQ,N,5,1
6065,"I think it is funny for people to give 4-5 star rating for a place that labels itself a Steak, Chop, and Seafood place, and all they rave about is the salad??? We had a gift card to burn, and friends in town tonight - so I let myself get talked into Wildfire for the first time in two years... This place makes me think of a well decorated Sizzler or some other crap hole fake steakhouse where they sell you on a steak loaded with junk or ""crusted"" as they call it, to cover the poor quality of the meat.  The sides are sized ok, but the quality is not what you'd expect from a $30 dinner plate. And for $2 more, you can get a runny pile of noodles they list as ""Traditional Mac and Cheese"" which maybe means in the sense that it will remind of when you were 8 years old eating Kraft Mac and Cheese from a bowl. And concerning the seafood part, I could not have had more a more foul tasting portion of seafood if I had picked it out of a dumpster @ Lake and Halsted. If you insist on punishing yourself with an overpriced crappy meal here, do yourself a favor and avoid ALL shellfish - trust me on this... food poisoning sucks As it has been said by so many other reviewers, go to a real steakhouse downtown and enjoy the difference. Yeah it may cost more, but its because you are not eating at a place that serves school lunchroom quality meals ~",3/29/2010,Nqq,EA7CF4yQD-ODKcCvnL8xeQ,CQ75CQSyrsmb-S3UAwCHpw,N,1,1
59871,"Hands down best restaurant in town. Perfect follow-up to a Broadway show. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed. Not quite jeans and t-shirt, but otherwise quite relaxed. We are not traditionally beef eaters in our family. We had the Filet Mignon Medallions w/Shrimp. If we could eat at Kinzie everyday, we would be converts. The meet was so tender and delicious. The shrimp was fresh and succulent, and the red bell pepper risotto was excellent. We had cream puffs and butter rum cheesecake for dessert. We do not recommend the cream puffs (aka profiteroles), as they were made w/ice cream instead of sweet cream. However, the butter rum cheesecake was heavenly. Overall, the specialty martinis are fantastic, waitstaff is truly remarkable and attentive, and the food was so good that we could easily spend every weekend at Kinzie. The prices are also very reasonable for food of this caliber. If you are looking for a wonderful evening, in a relaxed yet cozy and romantic setting, and you want to experience fine dining at it's best----try Kinzie Chophouse.",8/3/2011,Q5x2ZSLpD12pYHp4c_kaCg,Rue5bHVCh-3-ntql1GDzdw,rnjz2KNgsQ2YaC_kjeuuAQ,Y,4,0

59416,"This place may have fallen victim to it's own success. I used to eat here whenever I hit Chicago in the late 90's and I'd rave about it wherever I went.I've been going back lately, and I considered another meal at Giordano's unfinished business.The pies are still first-rate; fantastic crust, thick as dessert pies and loaded with cheese and savory toppings. But the experience overall was really damaged by the service experience, which has devolved to that of a really busy roadside diner.Giordanos is crowded - people love the pies and if you go, count on a long wait. This bothered me not at all, but to be hustled from the front door and deposited in the to-go line and rushed into ordering in assembly-line fashion was pretty lame. The staff is harried and impatient, and they are so motivated to clear-the-table-turn-the-table that even when I got seated I felt like the kid in ""A Christmas Story"" going to see Santa.Let's not kid ourselves - I'm going to Giordanos again; It's a true-blue Chicago Pizza, and one you can't find outside of the city.

The insalata cippolina e pomodoro was good, but my entree was less than OK. I ordered the tenderloin brasciole, which is traditionally layers of stuff rolled up in beef and braised. This was to served over a pile of BOXED PASTA. I am not convinced that their pasta is homemade as claimed. This rigatoni looked just like a box of Prince brand dried box pasta. Also, the brasciole was a waste of tenderloin. It was a dried out thin layer of meat filled with grated parmesan(nearly undetectable, redolent of raw minced garlic (YUK!) and flat leaf parsley. The server seemed aloof, the bus boy seemed in a rush to clear my empty salad plate while my girlfriend was still eating, and the sponge-painted walls were atrocious. Also, the art displayed next to me was a painting of the bones around the pelvis and sacrum. This is where poop lives before you eject it.

54521,"This event occurred during the Holiday season this past year, but occurs every time we frequent this place. The foods great and I can't say enough about it, but every time we go it's a 30+ minute wait just to get in! You sit out in the cold and it's annoying, you think your entering some hot club but it's just a diner...they really need to expand or get a new building or something cause it's just a joke (anytime between 5pm and close, it's awful) just this alone makes me shutter at the idea of going back, but wait there's more! The space is always cramped. Once you get in (don't slip on the kitchen floor) you get sat at a table that is roughly 2ft by 2ft so never order a full course meal. The last time my date and I got an appetizer, tea, and a full meal (sandwich and salad).The tea arrived first, which was great with agave, but once we used our hot water jugs and both the glasses were filled, the hot water jugs just sat on the table the whole night and no one came to take them away until our check came, taking up much needed table space! Adding to this was no one came to take away our appetizer trays until half way after our full meals were gone and this again made for a hard eating experience. All I can say is seriously...wth?It just seems like this place is always understaffed and doesn't have a clue what to do next. I always see staff hanging out by the bar just chilling to when there are people up to their elbows in plates and other crap, it's ridiculous!Other atmospheric problems:-People kicking your chair every five seconds-Customers stepping on your coat every other minute-People next to you yelling to the people across from them (over the music; excuse me if I come to eat, not to club)-Not being able to hear or communicate with the person you're with what so ever.All and all, the experience was not one that I'm looking forward to returning too.

18570,"Drinks - 4.5 stars Food - 3 stars Drinks - Tonight was a cocktail kinda night...I had the In Your Dreamsicle, Kitchen KoolAid and Summatime Lemonade. They were all phenomenal, and I was buzzing at the bottom of the first! The In Your Dreamsicle tastes just like an orange cream soda... a must try. Kitchen KoolAid has sweet and sour mix in it, very sour taste but to my liking. Summatime Lemonade had big juicy strawberries floating around in it that were like dessert at the bottom of the drink. Yum. Food - The burgers were nothing special. I had the Red Dragon and my boyfriend had the Big Texan. My patty was cooked to order, but the overly salty brisket hash threw off the taste of the entire burger. I ordered truffle fries, but all I could taste was the salt. I was literally dusting the salt off of my fries. On the flip side, the onion rings on the Red Dragon were amazing and not at all salty and you could taste the freshness of the oil used to deep fry the batch. Yum. The creole fries were delicious too. I'm conflicted, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, very possible. Also, the house ketchup was great, I could actually tell it originated from a tomato. Service - Our waiter wasn't memorable, not very helpful when we asked for suggestions, and overall just didn't talk much. Maybe if he spoke up and told me to avoid the brisket hash, I would've had a better experience! =p I'd recommend this place if you're in the area but wouldn't take the trip to the city just to try the burgers.

54537,"I am shocked at the amount of great reviews this place gets. All that tells me is that people have no idea what real Middle Eastern food should taste like (yes, I know it varies from nation to nation, but America is not a Middle Eastern country). THIS PLACE IS NOT IT. The shawerma is bland. It doesn't have any of the flavor that real, succulent, tasty shawerma should have. The hummus also lacks flavor. The falafel isn't the best, but it is probably one of the menu items that is OK. I've been to this place a few times and the food has never been really good.The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because their catering is decent. I don't understand why, just because you are catering to an event with primarily Arab people, it is only then the food is good. It's a shame that restaurants assume that non-Arabs will like Arab food better when it's watered down and not authentic.

Pros: Most of the items we tried on the menu were very goodThe atmosphere - very cool and invitingCons:ServiceInability to take action and change the service experienceUnwillingness to accept responsibility for the service experienceLet me preface this by saying that I rarely complain at restaurants about the service (possibly two other times over the course of 20 years). In addition 90% of the review I post online are positive experiences. To better explain the service issue, this was a two+ hour dinner in which we were offered drinks upon arrival and once during the meal. Once the order was placed we only saw the waitress at other tables, she never came back. I flagged down a manager and explained the situation but nothing changed as another 45 minutes went by. Eventually I complained to the manager at the front to which they offered a free desert. They had three chances to change the attitude and level of attention. At that point the desert was not good enough so no thanks and I will never go back. The kicker - at first they would NOT remove the mandatory gratuity for a table of ten. After several discussions on this and reasonable explanation, they finally took it off.

56572,"Pros: Great atmosphere, friendly hostesses, lively bar scene (though tables too packed in so no standing space), live music, good drinks, black or white napkin option, follow up call the next day by the hostess. Cons: Had a terrible waiter (Eric). He was rude and seemed put-out by any questions we asked. I ordered a filet mignon cooked medium. It arrived medium well to well done. And this was immediate, as in as soon as I cut into it I saw that it was way overcooked. Eric did not stick around to ask us if our steaks were cooked ok, which to me, is basic serving skills at a steak restaurant. 25 minutes later he finally came to check on us and I told him my steak was overdone but since everybody else was done with their entree I didn't want a new one. He actually came over to me and instead of apologizing like any good waiter would do, he told me that I let it sit on the plate too long and it continued to cook. Um no, it was like that immediately but you wouldn't know because you waited 25 minutes to ask. And if the plates DO cook the steak more then you need to bring it out under-cooked. I don't know anybody who eats their 8 oz. steak in one bite. It's going to sit there as they enjoy their dinner. So I went to the restaurant for a good steak and didn't even get to eat an entree. I got the follow up call the next day, which is a nice gesture. I told them what happened and the girl on the phone was very apologetic and said she appreciated the feedback and would have a manager call me. If that had happened I absolutely would've given the place a 2nd chance. But never got a call.

Dirty dishes were never cleared so we ended up stacking dirty dishes on the table and playing dirty dish shuffle. While we were sitting down the hostess tossed the bendaroos on the table and walked away. Getting a seat is a little impersonal and confusing. The front door actually faces Ontario street (I think). Once you get in, you go to one counter and the guy tells you to go upstairs and tell the person at another counter what you just told him. Then the person upstairs at counter #2 takes your name and # in your party and says something like ""go down that hall and wait for your name to be called."" Kind of like cattle.

39987,"So last night I stopped back at L&E at the end of a night filled with margaritas & tequila flights. All I wanted was one thing. The sloppy joe! My neighbor and I scouted ourselves two stools at the bar. I still like the ambiance of this place, the staff and the crowd that comes in. The sloppy joe was good. It's def. different than most sloppy joe's since it's boars head. It's tasty and served on a yummy pretzel bun. I wouldn't say it was the BEST sloppy joe I've ever had, but definitely satisfying. The bartenders really know what they are doing and it was fun watching them make drinks- it's like a science experiement up there! And they are all super friendly. I'm still excited with glee that this place is in our hood. Go visit it. Have some whiskey or one of their signature drinks. Stay a while, enjoy something yummy to eat.

57613,"If there was a negative rating system, I would use that. The valet practically pushed me out of the car, and then squeeled my tires as they pulled away. When I mentioned this to the host, they didn't seem to care. The waitstaff was pushy and rude and seemed to be preoccupied with other stuff that must have been more important than his job. The food wasn't cut very well and the seafood smelled funny(I didn't eat it for that reason). The drinks were rediculously overpriced. If you were unfortunate enough not to get a booth, you got crammed in next to complete strangers. I know that the only reason they serve fondue is because of health code violations in the past and they weren't allowed to cook food there anymore. What a joke, I will NEVER reccomend this place to anyone unless they want to get ripped off.

52148,"5:15 pm. 5 minute wait standing in line outside, 5 minute wait sitting down inside. Signs proclaiming ""Anti-graffiti zone"" are hung outside the front entrance and the restrooms, yet the walls everywhere are festooned with words scrawled in white paint stick and black sharpie. Makes you wonder why so many patrons would bring white paint sticks to dinner, and then to seriously doubt that the words were written by actual customers. Gino's East seems to be teeming with waitstaff and hosts, but the service was still a little on the slow side. Three of us shared a medium deep dish Cheese & Spinach pizza, and ordered a pitcher of Pilsner Urquell to enjoy during the 45-minute wait. Let me just say right off the bat - the beer selection here is terrible. Bud Light, Miller Light, Budweiser, some other boring stuff, Pilsner Urquell. Our server told us this short list of beers when we asked for a drinks menu, and the Pilsner was the only thing halfway decent to order. The price? $17. For one pitcher. Unfortunately we ordered two by the end of dinner. And it wasn't even that good! (Bad batch?) The pizza was also expensive - over $20 for the medium deep dish - and it was a bit of a letdown. The cheese was a bit ""chalky"", in the words of my friend, and the sauce, spinach, and crust weren't particularly flavorful. It was substandard, especially considering the price. The three of us were definitely full by the end of it, though. In the end, after tip, the three of us each paid $25. That buys you two slices of deep dish and about 3 beers.

34128,"This rating has nothing to do with the food as I never got to try it. I (skeptically based on other reviews) made a reservation for 9:00 pm on Saturday night. We arrived at 9:05 pm and on the way in I heard a woman on her way out saying they were running a half hour behind on reservations. I went up to the front and gave my name and the hostess said it would be a couple of minutes. Had I not just heard this other woman, I would have taken that to mean, we will seat you in a couple of minutes. Since I had heard this other woman I asked what she meant by a couple of minutes. She proceeded to tell me, well, we still have to seat some 8:30 tables. So I said it'll be more than a couple of minutes then? We proceeded to stand in the ridiculously crowded ""bar area"" for about 5-10 minutes. We kept getting pushed by people walking by as there really is no where to stand and then decided to leave. I think it would have been well over half an hour before we would have been seated. I mean how long has this place been in business and they can't figure out how to keep reservations? We went to Socca a couple of doors down, got seated right away, had awesome service and the food was amazing. I will NOT be going back to Mia Francesca.

44407,"Let's express some thoughts about the current owner.... But beforehand, let me explain: I used to be a regular here, used to go here once, if not twice a day for years. The place has gone through different owners, and I always kept coming back because I loved the place. I refused to buy a coffee maker because I enjoyed starting the day here with my cup of Joe. I appreciated the down-to-earth, front-of-house employees, became best friends with two of them (who no longer work at the place). Sometimes the pastries were a little dry, but it didn't matter, because it always felt good to come here. For me, and for many others I knew, it was the bakery where everybody knew your name. And then the new owner. When he came on board, prices increased quite a bit, the coffee starting tasting not so good (What happened? Why does it taste burnt and bad, why?), the walls of the place were now hung with the owner's framed medals he'd received from pastry contests, framed articles about him, etc. All over the place. It's too much, really... I wish he'd check his ego at the door and take down some of those awards. And start improving the taste of the coffee. Because it doesn't taste good. It should be about the coffee, dude, not about you.   Oops, well, I was hoping to say that in a nicer way, in case he reads his Yelp reviews, because I still have hope for Alliance, but I guess I can't help but be sad and frustrated about the way Alliance is now, and the way it used to be. While it was never perfect, it did used to have good-tasting coffee, employees who were super nice to me, and ambiance that wasn't decked-out in a tribute to the owner's life's accomplishments. Anyway, needless to say, I went out and bought a coffee maker.",2/18/2006,2OEcjijddtc-9PzJsrl3gw,sv3vIr1g96TXzAmBzl96uQ,1QKqtC4vML3QhkrSzwR_tQ,N,2,1

31086,"I had no expectations about what Aaron S. and I's brunch here would be like, and yet I was still very disappointed. I kind of expected a wait, I know brunch places are insane on the weekends, so that was no big deal. What sucked is once we got inside everything just got slower and slower. It was also very cramped and chaotic inside, not my style at all when dining out. They were just not organized at all. We were seated and given a menu, and the person who seated us was gone in a blink of an eye. Then we sat. And sat some more. It really seemed like eons before the waitress came and asked what we were having. Aaron started off with an apple juice and I with coffee (of course). I saw in keeping with the organic theme here that they only offered sugar in the raw and ""Stevia Balance"" for coffee sweetening. I tried the Stevia because I usually put splenda in my coffee, YECH. It made my coffee taste horrid. Why are they torturing me with that crap? I ordered the Jeremy skillet. Aaron went with the farmers omelet. We waited, and waited. A bus boy who really was sorta creepy came by a couple of times to look at the table to see if things needed refilling, not one of the many staff that were in there asked if we needed anything, nor notice that my coffee was empty. I was getting peeved and I am sure that if you had looked close enough steam would be coming from my ears. Finally when our food was brought out, It wasn't the waitress. The guy just sat the food down and went to walk away. I snapped ""Can I have some more coffee?"" He should have asked if anything was needed before walking away. Tiny tiny portions. Aaron lipped to me ""And this is worth nine bucks?"" I just nodded. Also um toast? Where the hell is the toast? Skillets, omelets and most egg dishes, should come with toast. Sometimes pancakes. I noticed that the salsa that was on top of my skillet was a pink color. Pink? Did you not use ripe tomatoes? Also there was ONE count em ONE lonely egg on my skillet. Boo. Also nothing was seasoned. (Nor cooked in butter). Hell there was not even enough cheese in my skillet to taste it. Any cook that works at a restaurant SHOULD know that potatoes should be salted while being cooked so that they actually taste like potatoes (the reason why you taste food in the first place is salt). The only good things I do have the say is that it was well prepped and the bacon was super yummy. The potatoes while tasting bland, were cooked right. Nice and soft in the middle and crunchy outside. The ONE egg (grrrrrr I am a biker I need my fucking protein thank you very much) was also cooked to a perfect over easy. It is seriously sad that those three things are the only good things I can say. I'm really sad that there is a freaking brunch place in my own neighborhood that I really don't see returning to. Maybe in the future to see if they have gotten any better. I have never been big on organics, any experience I have had with anything with the organic label on it has been a huge let down, and this just is being added to that pile of let downs.

4823,"I've been hearing about The Purple Pig for some time, so when friends suggested it for brunch this past Sunday, I was eager to try it. Looking back, I should have waited. Of course it didn't help matters that I was very hungover and extremely hungry upon my arrival. It also didn't help that all I wanted was a big plate of eggs, bacon, toast and more eggs, bacon, and toast. Anecdotally, if you are looking for traditional brunch fair here, do NOT try The Purple Pig. That said, I tried my best to enjoy what was available, but at the end of the day, I was just underwhelmed. The fried Brussels sprouts were well seasoned, but not very satisfying. Also, I was not too impressed with the green cauliflower (just tasted like broccoli). In addition, I tried the ""JLT"" (jowl, lettuce, and tomato with a fried duck egg), the chicken thigh leg kebabs, the milk-braised pork shoulder, the Waygu sirloin steak, the bone marrow, and the mussels. Of all of these dishes, I was only really impressed with the mussels. They were prepared in a delicious cream broth that I couldn't help but sop up with the bread I was given. Yet, everything else was just... well... okay. I really liked my 2 bloody Marys and the service was good, but at the end of the day, I left The Purple Pig still hungry and with no burning desire to return.

BEER: I tried the cross of gold on this my first visit. When do first impressions end and second thoughts begin? The beer was served in an interesting glass, had four or so hemispheric longitudinal protrusions. A wheaty and hoppy enough picture. This was described as a golden ale I believe. The place was crowded-ish. most of the space felt very designed for something, in the sense that there really didn't seem to be any good just-kind-of-hanging-out-and-having-a-couple-beers-when-there-are-no-seats-at-the-bar kind of area. even though there was an area that looks like it might be intended for that exact purpose (or was that a waiting area for people waiting for a table). Which brings me to the thought that revolution seems very geared towards being more like a restaurant than a bar. which is what it is. With this comes a whole different place than places that are bars that serve food. On this trip I did not try any food. Saw seitan on the menu which is interesting, the only other bar kind of place with food I had seen that at was Chill WInston in Vancouver. That place was sweet if only for the outdoor seating.

60939,"This being my first Yelp review, I was hoping that it wouldn't have to be a negative one but sadly, after visiting Bin 36, it is. On a recent trip to Chicago for a conference, a colleague and I were referred to this place by the concierge at our hotel. I love wine (who doesn't) and one of my favorite things to do in a city is seek out a great vino-venue and soak it in. The place is a bit short on ambience - the open, strangely decorated space reminds me of the remodeled cafeteria at my alma matter. I was willing to overlook this, and my friend and I settled on a great glass of Spanish wine, which took 20 minutes to deliver to the table along with some water. Again, I was in no hurry so I shrugged it off. After the glasses were dropped off and we ordered a second round, the waiter suggested we order a bottle, which was cheaper than if we continued to order individual glasses. He also picked up on the fact that we were looking to camp out for a while and order and informed us that it was restaurant week in Chicago and, as a promotion, they were having $5 flights of cheese. My friend grew up in Paris and eagerly ordered two flights and a bottle. The cheeses were great, although they had very small portions, but for $5 we weren't complaining but the flights came out on chipped pieces of flooring tile (I didn't know Home Depot was getting into the restaurant supply business). The place was alright, the wine was good, the service spotty, but a new place in a different town is an adventure. The deal breaker came when we got the bill; in a brazen move, the waiter hadn't charged us for the two bottles, but instead had charged us by the glass for each bottle (in addition to the legitimately ordered glasses). The flights of cheese were far from $5 and there were a couple of entrees on the bill that we certainly didn't order. When the waiter came, we asked him about the strange discrepancy. He claimed we had ordered the entrees, there was no special for flights of cheese, and said that it was indeed cheaper to price a bottle out by the glass than order the whole bottle. We're reasonable and polite, but his manner quickly became combative and defensive. After brining us a menu to check the prices we found that not to be the case and called him on it; we also stated that we were far from drunk and clearly remember him promoting restaurant week and $5 flights of cheese and that we did not order any entrees. Something smelled fishy, and after working as a waiter I know some of the shenanigans waiters can pull to pad their tips; there are ways to inflate a ticket and help a waiter's take home pay. One of the oldest tricks is to present a bill to a patron, they pay it, and before it is closed, the waiter modifies the bill and pockets the difference. For example, a patron orders a $5 dollar sandwich and a $2 dollar drink and is presented with the bill. The patron pays with a card or cash and tips the waiter; afterwards, when the patron has long left, the waiter removes the drink from the bill. At the end of the night when servers settle their pockets and pay out what's due to the restaurant and staff, they keep the difference, which is their tips. In the above case, the waiter helped his bottom line by $2. I explained that I understood what was happening and that our ticket had been inflated (by about $60 worth, mind you) and that if it wasn't modified I wanted to speak to the general manager. Our server then got a very sheepish look on his face, as if he'd been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and suddenly agreed to change our bill back and in the span of 20 seconds it had been miraculously altered to reflect what we really ordered and at the advertised price (the fast turnaround only confirmed my suspicisions - in most places it's like pulling teeth to get a manager to modify a ticket or comp something).  My colleague and I felt like we'd almost been mugged tableside; my hunch is he thought we were easy targets and we didn't know salt from pepper. Mind you I don't care what the server did to the bill when we'd left, but what took me by surprise was that he was so openly trying to steal directly from his guests. I am so disgusted with this place I felt compelled to tell others. I cannot recommend Bin 36 in any fashion and if anyone decides to visit the place, try to keep an eye out and your expectations low.",7/19/2010,FhES34vRIz-ROpGH8iiofg,Zk69wrKr8CcVDhqGL5Jszg,u_Ze5HkcNXgECvYvKS0HLA,Y,1,0
49435,"This place is great for a birthday celebration, but make sure you have reservations. We arrived a little before 5pm because we were told we couldn't save a spot around 6pm; however, we left close to 7pm and it wasn't anywhere near full yet. A number of people were in the front waiting to be seated, but I think letting us have a later reservation wouldn't have been a big deal. It's hard to tell. They boast ""Best Mojito in Chicago."" It wasn't my favorite as I prefer a little more sugar and a lot more mint. But I will say it definitely made my top 5. If it were less than $8, I'd have ordered a second, even a third to try the fresh fruit version. The strawberry one looked tasty. Megan G. and I both ordered the Combinaciones with Entrana Skirt Steak & Grilled Shrimp. We agreed that the Shrimp was cooked to perfection. I feared it would flavorless because it looked dry, but it was nicely grilled on the outside and incredibly juicy on the inside. Whatever seasoning they use complements it. The Entrana was the show stopper, though. Mine was ordered medium-rare and delivered that way. It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. You could have sliced it with a spoon, and the complimentary Chimichurri (the fresher, greener one was a group favorite) only enhanced it; however, you won't be disappointed if you eat it plain. I liked the side of Yuca Frita and Baked Potato, but it was almost too much of a good starchy thing. They were a little too similar to be served together. I could have eaten an entire platter of the Plantains. We were disappointed to find that their dessert menu was limited. It's possible it was only that evening, but they had two options on a Saturday night - Flan or Figs & Tres Leches Caramel. Most of us went with Flan and loved it. It's one of the better ones in the city. It sounded like the Figs were good too, but the Flan was best. They are BYOB Monday-Thursday, but you can only bring wine and it's an $8 corkage fee.",11/10/2008,uf0EVdbyDy-VqvM6uYz-lw,q-ZRqtBIqJBtupISPmKmfw,u_Ze5HkcNXgECvYvKS0HLA,N,4,1

35622,"Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.... This Chinese BBQ joint is the crme de la crme of Chinese BBQ. My padre has been bringing home Sun Wah since I can remember, but we finally dined in as a family, with some friends, for a birthday celebration. We had 10+ and the kind folks at Sun Wah were more than accommodating. The place is HUGE. At a Chinese place like this, similar to restaurants in Chinatown, you have to order family style. So that's exactly what we did. But being a special occasion, we had to call ahead for their two duck dinners. They use every part of the duck to make wraps, fried rice, soup, the works. When our party arrived, we looked over the menu for other entrees. We wound up ordering like seven other entrees, veggies to meats. We had all covered. Everything, and I mean everything, was awesome. Even our unadventurous family friends, with a picky teenager mind you, found everything delicious. Parking is a pain...but you may be lucky and skip out on the meters by finding residential parking if you're willing to walk a block.

13578,"I have eaten at Glenn""s more times than I can count and I am beyond pleased every time. Their arctic char is so astounding that you may actually question how such an amazing flavor can be purchased without making a deal with the devil, so the dish is aptly named ""Char Diablo"". The crab cakes are so good that Guy Fieri put this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives, and the smoked trout hash on the brunch menu is so perfect that it may bring you to tears. The service is always friendly, informed, and sometimes a little cheecky, and I may be a little biased in saying that Jules is my favorite server, but regardless of who your server is, you will always get the same amazingly delicious food. Their kitchen is so consistent in putting out the same incredible flavors day in and day out, that it is the one place I can recommend a dish and know that yours will taste the same as mine. I stopped there after work this evening to indulge in the all you can eat crab leg special (every Tuesday), and was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar since the tables are usually all reserved. While I was there I had a nice chat with some folks visiting from New York about places they should go to to eat while in Chicago, and that is why I came home to write this, my very first yelp. The all you can eat Alaskan King crab leg dinner( not that nasty little snow crab shit) is $34.99 and is of the exact same quality, if not better, than Shaw's Crab House, and gullet permitting, you get twice the crab for half the price . I have read another review that says they prefer that Shaw's cuts them open for you, but then they get cold if you are the sort that likes to eat slow and savor your meal. No matter how ya slice it, there""s no getting around the fact that if you live in the Ravenswood area, you need to be eating at Glenn's, and if you don't live in Ravenswood, Glenn's is definitely worth the making the trek to get there, just be sure to make reservations.",7/20/2010,FR9va3raejRQRw45lyqyfQ,TERZ6CjhT4iRn6ufk8gisQ,50gFzdVglOz88eFJ6v-26A,N,5,1

20095,"I felt like a tourist in my own town as I waited in line for lunch. The two groups ahead of me were taking pictures and asking questions about the ingredients on nearly every item prior to ordering. The wait on a Saturday wasn't too shabby, about 10 minutes to order and another 5 for food delivery. Split an order of chips/salsa, Cubana sandwich, and Cochonita Pibil. A very solid meal, in terms of quality and flavor, but not especially memorable. The bread on the cochonita pibil was rather dry and crusty. I think that the vibe at Frontera Grill is a lot more lively and the food is more vibrant and delicious.

4129,"I probably can't a add a whole lot of new insight to Schwa that hasn't already been touched upon by fellow yelpers, but I'd be remiss if I didn't stamp them with the 5 stars they most assuredly deserve, in my humble opinion.  There's a reason it took my fiance months to finally secure a reservation here...this place is just that good. I think she started calling back in May or something targeting a reso for my bday in August! Yes...she had to call again and again just to catch someone live...and leaving messages just didn't get it done. Nevertheless, it's well worth the pain. Call, beg, offer up any service of value you might have....if you love food, do what you need to do to get in this place. So...on to the experience.  The fiance ushered me into a cab, with me clueless to our intended destination. The address on Ashland she tells the cabby just doesn't connect for me....what the heck is on Ashland south of North Ave?....we gonna slam this wine amonst the palm trees and hub caps, right? We pull over, and I see it. The simple sign ""Schwa"".....oh yeah.....I'm in for a treat now. We've talked about this place...I've heard great things. We step inside and I'm immediately surprised....this isn't some shi-shi(sp?) place with some spruced up lassie standing behind an ornate podium ready to greet you upon your entrance. We just walked into someone's house, right? Tiny room.....simply decorated....nay.....not even really decorated....I mean the walls are painted, but that's about it. It's like taking a 1 bedroom loft, pulling all the furniture out, taking everthing off the walls, sprinkling some tables around and you're good to go. But, of course, there is that glass wall in the back giving you a view into the tiny little kitchen...and that's where the magic happens here. So I'm not even sure what to do after walking in....then this guy pops out of the kitchen and come up to us to show us where we will be spending the next 3 hours or so. Seriously, I think? The guys that are making this food are you host, your server, and everything in between? Now that's a cool concept. There is no ""telephone"" game here between the front of the house and the back....it's all the same.  The chefs aren't relegated to slaving in the depths of some back kitchen with no direct insight to the customers they are serving. They make it, and then they bring it to you and they can see your reaction live and in real time. And I've got to believe in the case of Schwa , that continuous feedback is gonna make these guys feel good.  We went with the the full 9 course run down and couldn't have been more pleased.  I won't walk through all the courses...justice simply can't be done via words. Yes...there are sauces and foams, and purees, and flavor combinations and textures that us mere mortals would never be able to imagine. ie...green curry and rootbeer maki??? WTF? Absolutely fantastic! And yes....I recall saying ""absolutely fantastic"" like 15 times throughout the night to the various guys that brought these delights to our table. I was really simply at a loss for words, and still am. These are unique, flavorful, fanciful, fun dishes that add up to a most special dining experience. I'll just specifically mention the pea soup, cause I hate peas. No...I mean I really hate peas....in that bring you back to your childhood, sitting at the table for an hour after everyone has left, your mom requiring you to finish your peas, your fists clenched so hard it hurts kind of hatred for peas. And I loved the pea soup. They bring the best out of every ingredient here they use and they do it with style, flavor, and flair. Nuff said....it's all about the food at Schwa and they deliver with the highest marks. And to experience this type of food at a BYOB...well that's just unheard of from me perspective. Keep doin' what you do, Schwa.....and people will ALWAYS come....they most definitely will come.",8/22/2009,EBxCFhBREI-LREDIzS,JJJqc_MS4ZujmRlDYh_grg,bNXpwTSavHBV9zBk2lUlGA,N,5,1

49386,"I went to Alliance Bakery today around 4:00 pm. The wonderful cakes in the window make you want to go in. There were two counters with one person ordering at each one. So we waited behind one of those people thinking that we would be next. While waiting a few other people came in. They waited on one other person at ""the other"" counter and TWO other people at the counter where we were standing waiting to order. There were at least three employees behind the counters waiting on people. They would have taken another customer before us as well if we hadn't finally said something. I know, we should have said something immediately but we try to be nice, it happens so fast and then you figure ok well no big deal we will be next...however, that did not happen in this case. (We were standing right up at the counter looking at the employees. In case you are thinking maybe we were off to the side or doing something else. We were right in front of them ready to order!) There was a strange feeling inside of Alliance Bakery. If they had taken our order right away we would have ordered more. So we ordered 4 cupcakes : 1 (unfilled) Red Velvet, 1 Carrot Cake, 1 German Chocolate, 1 Banana. Three out of four of these small cupcakes were dry and didn't taste like much. If your stock is old then you put it in a day old bin and sell it half price or you remove it from the case and do not serve it. They were so bad we could not believe it. The red velvet was not bad. It was fresher. It was not great though. What a waste of our money and time! We have been plenty of places where people act like they are the greatest thing ever. The difference is that they take a customer's order promptly....and they actually have a reason to act that way...they serve good tasting quality food. We have also been places that will not serve you something if it is not fresh. They do not want you to get a poor impression of the quality of their items. I respect that. We often give places a second or third chance. Alliance will not be getting a second or third chance to take our money. My recommendation - don't waste your time or money here. There are good places within walking distance.",9/16/2009,9BexdarCIPkxCgPhGnPLgQ,GV1M8xshHT4UDR_ePd8N5A,xjZ9eqYrzMrl2v6_1Kv6hA,N,5,1

I love the spinach with apples and currants--I could eat it every day and not get tired of it. They've elevated it from a simple-sounding dish to a work of art with their mastery of the cooking method. The incredibly high heat imparts the veggies with the taste of the pan (there's actually a term for it in Chinese) that is really hard to achieve at home. I also love the octopus in potatoes, the bacalao croquettes, patatas bravas, and pan con tomate.

52281,"A friend just moved here and never had deep dish pizza before and I had a GroupOn to Gino's so we decided to give it a try. I guess I didn't expect the long line outside but it seemed to move quickly so we decided to wait. I've been to this particular Gino's before and had deep dish pizza and the group I went with were particularly satisfied. This time when I went it was the total opposite. We waited about 30 min. to be seated which we were fine with. When we were seated we waited about 10 min for a waitress to even offer us water. We had decided not to go with the deep dish since we were starving and it would be a 45 min. wait. Instead, we went with pasta. Bad decision. I got the Lemon Chicken Angel Hair Pasta and my friend got the Pesto. Both were horrible. The pasta looked like it had been cooked in bulk, similar to lunch you'd get at a school cafeteria, but worse. Noodles were overcooked and were swimming in a lake of water or oil. I'd highly recommend NOT getting any of the pasta dishes. In fact, if you go to Gino's you should probably only order the deep dish since that's what they're known for. Our waitress was never around and we ended up getting up ourselves to get boxes. We decided to take our pasta home, drain it out, and make something better with it. I also had a GroupOn and when she said it she said she had to ask me some questions. It took her 10 min or so to come back and ask questions, we were about to just pay the bill and walk out. The staff at the counter weren't that helpful either. She came back just as we were ready to go and asked how often I go to Gino's and if that was the location I went to, I answered yes to both and then she was like, ""I forget the rest of the questions so oh well!"" So you made us wait 10 or so min for us to sit here so you could forget your questions? Overall, the experience was horrible. Food was bad and so was the service. If I go back the only thing I'd get is the deep dish, and even that, I might just go to the other location on Chicago hoping for a better experience.",10/31/2009,t6lL-aIzG38ww,3czR3J308DBNl29InROr3g,ibreTMGGaQSanZttUchjKg,N,2,1

I also like the fact that it is reasonably priced, you won't leave broke or hungry, and there are absolutely no airs. It's set up like an old fashioned supper club, and you can dress up or down.We have been to Wildfire quite a few times....admittedly we once went twice in a week. They have great wine tasting dinners. Hands down, I would recommend one to anyone who is interested in learning the art of wine pairings. It is really great fun. Our first time, my boyfriend I felt like were were on a couples blind date. You are paired with 2 or 3 other couples at your table, and the wine and courses are never-ending.I also like that they offer drink trios as well as their steak trios. It's a great way to taste and experience new foods and drinks. I love their chopped salad...it is by far different from any other chopped salad that I have ever had because it contains tortilla chips, corn, and a citrus lime vinaigerette. The only salad that I have had there that I did not enjoy was their tomato salad. It was way too mushy and flavorless. We've enjoyed all of their appetizers, and have tried steaks, pastas, and their duck. Their desserts are also very tasty and highly recommended. I highly recommend Wildfire for a unpretentious steak dinner.
