"I have never really been to Taylor Street, I know...I am so sheltered. It is so cute! Anyway, usually when people suggest going out for Italian, I am like, meh...but that is because it is usually like boring and store bought pasta. Not Davanti! It was straight out of Italy awesome. The resturant itself is super cute. We actually sat on the rooftop, a great spot in the summer. It was a chilly night, but they had the heaters going so it was comfortable. The wine list was pretty extensive with affordable options, which is always nice. Now to the food. Love love loved the Focaccia di Recco! Definite must get if you go! The Vasi Burrata, Sea Salt, and EVOO was amazing as well! I thought I would love the Truffle Egg Toast the best, but it was just good. I mean it was good, but nothing out of this world. The other 2 apps showed this one up! For dinner I had the giant ravioli. After having this in Napa at Bottega, I had to try it here. First off, I love when Italian restaurants actually make their own pasta. Hello! That is why I am coming! This was delish! Super light and totally differerent, but delicious as well from the last one I had. My hubby got the risotto, which I was eyeing, and it was awesome. I would probably get it next time. Everything was great, the prices are so reasonable and it is a nice change from the typical places that serve the generic Italian dishes. They put a lot of thought into this place. I will definitely be back! Wish they took reservations...","[0.0, 1.0]"

I don't mind waiting for a table if there is a little area, and you are not hovering over people or constantly having to move out of the way for people. But this is not the case here! They should just give servers sections like any other normal restaurant. But, on to the food... the huevos rancheros look good but are boring tasting. The panini's are good, but not amazing. The restaurant looks so cute and promising, but I don't think I'll be heading back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

And he said, sorry but the chef would like to have the full order! Wow, who is the customer here? At the end we eat, feeling a little uncomfortable, the food was OK but not great, and the final check was way too high for the quality of service and food. Definitively not coming back","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've decided that the cafe at Fox & Obel is going to be my Saturday morning brunch spot to be enjoyed with a friend or a fresh magazine. As a foodie, I love the atmosphere. The cafe has outdoor seating serviced by waitstaff and indoor seating consisting of counters with barstools (perfect for dining alone) as well as 4-tops. Almost everything on the breakfast menu (served until noon on the weekends) is under $10. Classic breakfasts with a gourmet twist.  Lunch is equally enjoyable and the perfect place to get something for a decent price, fairly quickly, and maybe even grab a glass of wine. Their breads are top notch (you have to like real crust) and they have daily specials including seasonal soups. There's no doubt that breakfast or lunch at the cafe will inspire you to pick up the ingredients to treat yourself to a gourmet home-cooked dinner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Just as Dorothy learned back in Kansas, some of the best things are in your own back yard. I learned this, too, on my first visit here on a Friday evening. Craving that Friday night burger and a beer I was. So I proceeded here undeterred by the memory of the former boite, Feed The Beast, and with many recent recommendations from friends and others. Well, this place is like the Oz of Brewskies. So many beers available on tap, and scores of others, domestic, craft, Half Acre from across the street. And many at prices like $4.00 or $4.50. I tried a variety myself: a darker ale, a ginger-tinged lighter ale, and the Half Acre IPA offering. I ordered the Evil or Devil burger with roasted Garlic, feta cheese, olives and roasted peppers. Sometimes, a burger is just a burger, but this one was one deliciously fresh flavor pairing. With the standard fries, which were delectable and a reasonable amount. So, a burger with fries and three beers for $24.00. This is less than I would pay at my even-more back yard burger spot, Rockwell's Neighborhood Grill. The staff and bartenders were great (I ate at the bar.) The other patrons were friendly and engaging, and I enjoyed the music, and the general din on a warm Friday evening. Even Mr. Muscled Loud Guy to my left with the his greying tee, and Radar from M.A.S.H cap, who by the way knew he was loud, and his buddies were at least talking food, steaks and Anthony Bourdain rather than, say, sports. Finished with great food and good conversation, I closed my eyes, clicked my heels twice, and was back home in a flash. With a very satisfied tummy, and some leftover cash in my wallet. Bad Apple is a good value, and fun experience, and a very successful gastro pub. Simple concept. Beer and burgers. But nicely and creatively executed.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We visited Piccolo Sogno my sister's law graduation and it was a great choice for a celebratory dinner! Space - I know this is redundant from other reviews, but the outdoor patio is absolutely great! I couldn't write a review without mentioning it, and I can't think of any in Chicago that compare. It is spacious but busy and perfect for the summer time.  Food - Call me crazy, but I don't really LOVE old school Italian that is big on heavy tomato or creamy sauces so Piccolo Sogno is perfect for me. Our table started with antipasto, pizza and salads, all which everyone liked. For my entree, I ordered the salmon, which I enjoyed very much. I don't love broccolini and they let me sub it for another veggie. Bonus points for easy substitution! The roasted fingerling potatoes were perfect -- not too greasy but still tasty. They inspired me to make my own potatoes at home! Service - Service was on par! I have no complaints. They were helpful and attentive. I will definitely be returning to Piccolo Sogno for a girl's night this summer!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Love love love love love love love Spacca Napoli. Spacca offers an enjoyable and unique experience that is well worth the wait! The pizza at Spacca never disappoints - you never run the risk of trying something new and thinking to yourself, Eh, I wish I'd ordered something else. Spacca is so delicious and offers such a warm, unpretentious atmosphere, I would go on a full stomach just to enjoy the company and order something to have for lunch the next day - and I have. If I could, I would give Spacca 10 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I think this place might have the cheapest meal you can buy in Chicago. Something like 3 bucks for fresh, yummy, falafel. You really can't go wrong. It's delicious. They aren't open very late, though, and that's a problem. Still 5 stars in my book.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food. Oh god the food. I know its typically hard to screw up a hot dog and fries. But for some reason when you combine and pack the two inside a small cardboard box, some magical process occurs inside that blends them in perfect harmony.  On a side note, why is it that every time I eat here it is raining and windy? Just once I would like to have my windows down, music blaring (not so loud as to disturb the other cars), and vanilla shake flowing. Instead I get wet napkins and condiments and me trying to consume my food as fast as possible so I can roll my window back up.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We had a great experience last night at this restaurant. The menu has a huge variety from pastas to fine cheeses done in a not so fussy way. It was refreshing to see the wine pricing and straight forward corkage fee. The only concern was slow dinner service with half of the table receiving their entrees and the other half waiting about 15 minutes. We were part of a larger group, so this may not be the case with smaller reservations. The food was definitely worth the wait. I would suggest ordering a bunch of starters and sides for the table to get the chance to taste everything!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"When my small-town family comes to the city they're always asking me to take them to some place they'd never find back home. Demera is a gray pick for that. The first time we came here together my mother (the most ""worldly"" of the bunch) stared, hopelessly, when our food came, going the lack of utensils was merely a cruel joke. She quickly got used to the idea of eating with your hands, though, and found she adored Ethiopian food. Since then she and I have been back a few times (even dragging her boyfriend alomg, once). I am always super satisfied by the food.Seriously... Ethiopian food rocks my world. A server did tell me, once, that the enjera that Ethiopian people usually eat is gluten free and not ""cut"" with wheat like the enjera you usually see at Ethiopian restaurants. She also mentioned if you call a day ahead and request the real stuff they'd be happy to make it for you. I have yet to do this but definitely want to try it sometime.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If I could give negitive stars I would give this place -5 stars. Ok so Americans tend to prefer heavy, greasy food. That is what you get here. Im fairly sure that is that is why this place gets good reviews from other people, it fits with with the overall American taste for huge servings of high carb, high saturated fat, blobs of grease. This place is not an accurate representation of middle eastern food AT ALL. On another note the place was dark and not aestetically appealing.In conclusion, if you are into Mcdonalds type immitations of ethnic cuisine, similar to the Chinese greasey spoons, this is your spot. I personally think the food was absoluty terrible, I sampled and ordered several different dishes and was unsatisfied with every on of them.Terrible!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ok, I'm going to be reviewing the Big Three"" Chicago deep dish style pizza places: Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's East. Gino's East, First Place. Of all the Chicago Deep Dish joints, this is my favorite version. It has a very unique crust that definately has some cornmeal in it, so that is the major differentiator compared to the ""original"" Uno's deep dish formulation. I like it a lot. I prefer the regular sausage than the ""slab-o-sausage"" (thin layer of sausage over the whole crust which is a Gino's specialty. The sauce is my favorite as well. Overall its really a pick em between this place and Uno's and Lou's. You should just go try em all at least once and choose. Depending on the crust you like, delivery vs. non delivery and the quality of the location you are going to, it can go any way. I do recommend eating any Chicago style pizza at the restaurant (not delivered). As they almost always lose some crispness when put in a box. They are best served out of those hot metal pans. Medium and small pizzas are almost always cooked a bit crisper and better through to the middle than the larger ones I find too.  I remember coming to this location when young, it closed but then reopened I think. What sticks out is they let you write on the walls. As a kid I loved this. I remember the super think clam chowder being very very good. This may have changed since then.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My boyfriend marveled at how much I ate, given my propensity to pretend I'm some sort of eating disorder afflicted supermodel while we dine out. Let me assure you there was no trips to the bathroom for cocaine and purging this night! But I digress...My ball and chain had spaghetti amatriciana which was simple yet flavorful, and I had the goat cheese ravioli in a light buttery sauce with orange zest and fennel pollen. Unusual and unbelievably delicious.We had to dash before desert, which was a little disappointing, but I left feeling giddy nonetheless.

"I never really liked deep dish pizza because the crust is waaaaayyy too thick and not much filling. Zachary's in the bay area made me like deep dish pizza, I figured I just had really bad ones (BJ's and the like). I was in Chicago not too long ago and we had to come here because it's voted one of the best deep dishes in town. And I concur, it was AMMMMAAAZIIINNNGGGG. I don't even know how to describe that taste, it definitely hit the umami level. You just have to try it for yourself, it's really hard to explain. They use very fresh ingredients and are not cheap with it. The sausage pieces are GINORM!!! The bread is actually thin and crispy, it's alllll filling!!! yey!

"I hadn't been to this location for Wildfire in years, we finally returned for an early dinner on a Sunday night. The only odd thing about our visit is that they wouldn't seat us until our reservation time even though they clearly had space to seat us both in the main dining room and one of the side rooms where they eventually seated us. Maybe because we had teenage kids with us? Or maybe they didn't have enough wait staff? Whatever the reason, I would have preferred to be sitting down instead of milling about the entryway. Otherwise the service was fine. This is a good place to go with any size group, they have separate rooms for large parties and do a very nice family style menu, you can also get it if your party is 6 or more and you can all agree on the same items from the menu, you select 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 salads and 2 desserts and share. I almost always get the same thing, the horseradish crusted filet mignon ($29.95) is always good and so is the french onion soup. And unlike other steak places in Chicago, the steak does not come totally ala carte, all steaks come with a choice of potatoes or vegetables, I like the au gratin potatoes that you can get with dinner. This time I tried the filet medalions ($28.95) that come with a variety of toppings, I tried parmesean and bearnaise and they were good but I think I'm sticking with the horseradish topping next time. They bring by a dessert tray with a wide variety of decadent looking desserts, they are usually big enough to share, the chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream is delicious. One thing I really like about Wildfire is that the price tag is affordable and they don't have portion sizes that are enough to feed a family of four. Steak is something that I don't really like taking home for leftovers and if you are traveling, you'll waste it anyway.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The place is pleasant enough and the staff IS very friendly and welcoming. But, the problem was not with the dining experience, but with the food. I wondered what the positive reviewers on Check Please meant by ""home made."" If they mean, they opened the can at home, then I guess that is accurate. I can buy canned food at the Jewel for a lot less. Most items on the salad bar were from cans, perhaps dressed up with some sliced onions or something. But, canned. My chicken ala Villa was 2 fried chicken breasts with cheese and canned mushrooms in a sauce that reminded me of Campbells soup. The dominant flavor was salt. Maybe the pizza is better, but this was not good food and Italian in name only.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ah, Wakamono. My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time Friday night. VERY hip place. Super trendy. It has a nice ambience, though - very minimalist-like. We sat down and decided to skip the appetizers - we wanted to move onto the big show. The main squeeze. Yes. The sushi. We ordered 3 orders of Nigiri: Sea Bass, Red Snapper and Yellowtail. Yellowtail was by far the best. Oh God, it made me swoon. It was melt in your mouth type of good. It was PERFECT. Everything nigiri should be. In terms of the rest of the order, then the Sea Bass, then the Red Snapper. The Red Snapper was a little too fatty and fishy for me. However, I've never had Red Snapper before so I have nothing to compare it to. In terms of maki, we ordered the Godzilla roll, a spicy tuna roll and the Oedipus roll. The Godzilla roll was effing awesome. The Oedipus roll was good, but not as good as the Godzilla. There was a little too much mayo on the Oedipus. I regret not ordering more 'plain' maki (spicy tuna, yellowtail) instead of the fancy stuff. If I did it over again, I would have ordered the Godzilla roll, the spicy tuna roll and a yellowtail/scallion roll. Only get 1 fancy roll: That is my advice. Otherwise, stick with the more simplistic stuff. Overall, it was a great dinner. We'll definitely be back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

It was quite crowded, and a friday night, so I think my experience would have been better if we'd come at another time, or when it wasn't so busy. The food was good, but the portions were very small. It was also VERY loud. We couldn't hear each other speak across the table. They also informed us they had no booths available, so we were sitting at a tiny table, by a major thoroughfare, and everyone kept bumping into us. It also went from chilly to hot and back again a lot. Maybe I was sitting under a vent?Honestly, I'd rather do fondue at home, than deal with the stress of this place again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What can I say besides: STAY AWAYMy wife and I went out for a nice dinner last evening and by virtue of circumstance, ended up at Shaw's.We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived early at 9pm. This was a Saturday and the place was NOT busy. This should have been our que to leave. In fact, when we arrived we were the ONLY people waiting for a table. Several other couples arrived in the meantime, one of which announced that they had a 9:30 reservation too. Yes, they were seated a full 15 minutes ahead of us. Being a bi-racial couple, I would like to go ahead and play the RACISM card, but I won't go there. There's plenty of other negative things about our dining experience that will send my review of Shaw's into the dirt.We finally sat were waited on promptly and ordered the Calamari appetizer. Compared to the countless other steakhouses and fine dining Calamari orders I've had over the years, this portion was small and forgettable.As for the entrees: I ordered the Shaw's seafood platter and my wife the Alaskan King Crab Legs.  The seafood platter, at $30, had remarkably small portions and, again, bland flavors (is this a theme here, anyone?). The butterfly garlic shrimp were anemic at best, the scallops were tender but almost totally transparent in flavor and the crab cake was average at best. My wife's crab legs were the highlight of this all-time low for us. Joe's Stone Crab blows these out of the water. Again, unmemorable.The sides: Hash browns with onions... again: BLAND and creamed spinach: Poorly done.Our waiter was MIA after he took our order until desert. I can't stiff a waiter on sheer principle but you better believe I was tempted.It's a crying shame when you drop over $160 on a meal and feel that you're taste buds would have been better rewarded at Portillo's or the Billy Goat Tavern.To top the evening off, the valet deliberately coughed all over his hand before we asked for change. Would you like some Eastern European phlegm back with your $5.

"It's over.I remember just over a year ago when I eagerly checked RevBrew's blog, anticipating the progress of my neighborhood's very own brew pub. I've been to Revolution many times since then, and I think it's time I call it quits.Revolution has become too loud, too busy, and my dining experience last night did me in. My mussels were a bit too slimy for comfort and my veggie reuben was a seasoning disaster. I also tried the mushroom pizza - fresh crimini's and just a hint of truffle oil - not bad but not enough to warrant the price. To put it simply - the menu is all concept and no performance. It's no longer enough to throw a dash of black truffle oil onto an entree and pull inspired, chef-driven dining 'out of a hat.'Here's the thing - I'm willing to overlook mediocre food at a brew pub if the beer is stellar (I'm looking at you, three floyds). Revolution's beer, however, (and I've had almost everything on the current menu) simply falls flat. Regardless of style, everything has a muted, underdeveloped flavor. I'd like to think this is the result of growing pains (looking at you, founders + bells). I never thought I'd say this, but I may take goose island over Revolution when it comes to beer. The 'guest list' of beers features some real winners, but the prices are simply unreasonable. I just about ordered a Dogfish 90 min IPA just to get some real flavor, but at $6 a bottle, why bother?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Fantastic food, low prices, prompt service, super cheap takeout, new decor.The new place opened in October 2009, and it's now brighter, quieter, more fashionable and much bigger than before. If you want food that's incredibly tasty and so cheap you'll be sure someone made a mistake, get the takeout from the counter near the door. A seafood combo with rice (mention ""with rice"") is just $6.10 for a mountain of top-quality food. The barbecue combo with rice (again mention ""with rice"") is a bit less and gives you pork, chicken and duck. If you choose to eat inside, it's a bit less cheap, but still great value. The guys at the takeout counter speak English but not a lot. If you forget to say ""with rice"" they might give you a double order of meat for double the price, so be sure to use those magic two words.The specialties are barbecue, seafood, Sichuan pickle soup. This includes about 2 dozen excellent items. Go for these. The lo mein is of above average quality. Some of the Sichuan meat items aren't so good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Chicago is known for it's great live music scene, and one of the greatest venues around is the Green Mill. On weekends it's open late....I mean waaaaay late, 5am on Saturdays. The prices are pretty average and the clientele is a mixed bag of young and old hipsters, hepcats, yuppies, geeks, freaks, punks, jocks, anybody who digs a laid back atmosphere and the best live music in the city really.What's super hip is the circular booths towards the entrance, and the table/dance area right in front of the stage. So whether you're looking to converse with some great background sound, or get right in the mix, there's accomidations for you.The only downside is that it fills up pretty quickly on weekends, so get there before midnight if you want to catch a table, or else you'll be forced to stand at the super long, super curvy, fully stocked bar with attentive bartenders and waitstaff....really that's not so bad.Overall,People who dig jazz, dig the Green Mill.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I like the new space they've moved too. Much more spacious and cleaner, although who really knows sometimes? The food was just okay though, and I've had way better in various ""Chinatown"" communities like this all over the country.  I tried their BBQ pork, which I'll admit, I don't eat a lot of pork anymore, so I was really hoping it would be as good as the kind I remember eating at First Chinese BBQ in Dallas. It wasn't bad at all, just unremarkable. I got a side of veggie fried rice, and that was borderline bad (I should have re-read my previous review). It always amazes me how these really authentic places can't seem to make a killer fried rice, you know, fluffy, savory, etc. This version was brown and bland and I had to douse it with chili oil and soy sauce just to stomach it. If you've ever had the light, fluffy, savory kind of Chinese fried rice before, you know what I mean about how the kind here sucks. Finally, as much as I realize this place is kind of a chop shop, the service was a disaster. Basically once my order was taken, my waitress never came back to help me again. I needed new napkins, tried to catch her attention, but it was like she didn't want to look in my direction. So I used some kleenex I had in my pocket. Then I wanted another beer, and she never came back over to see if I wanted another, so I never ended up getting it. They weren't even busy either, it was 4pm. Oh well, I'm not mad about it, it was just a little weird and bad business since they lost some more money I was willing to spend. Supposedly the whole duck is amazing, but that's usually not my thing. Maybe one day when I need to satisfy some friend's craving for roast duck, I'll be back to try it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Always a solid place. It's fun, fresh, and friendly. The wait is about the only thing I don't like about it.

"Unfortunately for our holiday party, we were not even able to get to try the food. After making a reservation a week in advance for our holiday party, we received a call an HOUR before our reservation saying that there would be a staff training meeting during our reservation and we would be the only people in the restaurant eating while they were training the staff. All the while I was on the phone with Ryan, he kept trying to convince me that because he told me this, I should be ok with eating while they are conducting a training meeting. Thank you, Ryan. Why were we not informed when we made the reservation? Why were we not informed when we called to confirm the morning of the reservation? Why were we called ONE HOUR before we were to be seated???Susan doesn't run her restaurants like this. Poor taste in our mouths!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Geja's advertises itself as a perfect romantic restaurant. I will agree that it's dark and that probably contributes to the romanticism. But the food is really really subpar for the price and the atmosphere simply doesn't make up for it. When I went, we ordered the cheese fondue. The cheese itself was bland, the grapes were mushy, the bread was stale and tasteless, and the apples were mealy. Maybe they were having a bad night, but for $25+ a person, I expect some good, flavorful dipping items, not what we got. The same went for the chocolate fondue. It was also annoying because I felt that the waitress kept trying to upsell us on wine. I just don't believe this place is worth the price.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I was very disappointed when I ate here. Everything was overpriced! I don't mind paying a premium for food as long as the food justifies the price. - the pho broth was bland. You know pho is good when you don't need to add hot sauce and hoisin sauce. I added both sauces to my pho and still wasn't good. - Bo loc lac(beef squares): was not worth $11. They barely give you any meat and use so much lettuce to add as a filler. And the meat was so chewing and tough. Does not taste like real Bo loc lac. - smoothies were bland as well. Just because you use real fruit doesn't mean it is good. The only thing thats tanking is their food. I don't recommend this place. Please don't confuse this place with Tank Sushi.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I just took my father-in-law to the Chicago Diner since we both don't eat meat, and I thought it was fair. He had a polenta dish and loved it, and I had the mushroom caesar wrap and didn't care for it. I was hoping for LOTS of mushrooms, but instead got lots of seitan. Boring. I did, however, LOVE our waiter. In fact, all of the wait staff seemed like they really enjoyed their jobs! I guess I should give it another shot and try something that you all suggested in your reviews.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Insanely good. I had flashbacks sitting in little Guandong holes eating the best BBQ i've had outside of China. Seriously, their BBQ pork is no joke and doesn't pull punches.There is something to be said about a place that has a wait for a table for 2 close to 45 minutes, but instead you can choose to spend a cool sawbuck and walk out with Pork/Duck combo over rice in less than 5 min. This place is true to it's bones and easily the best in the area... I haven't had their Peking Duck (with all the accompaniments) but I have had some over rice and it's delicious.They take reservations so don't hesitate!

"A great experience overall. My one star off is for the music -- mostly standard issue salsa, etc., that you would expect to hear at any generic latin restaurant. It would be great if Xoco (a unique restaurant that really rocks) would expand its musical selection to include rock and hip-hop en espanol (I'm thinking of artists like Cafe Tacuba and Kinky). The staff really shines. They do a great job of shepherding the hungry masses and preventing Xoco from tipping into chaos.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If you come here you need to have the steak. We tried the empanadas and they weren't anything to write home about. I had an array of seafood which was quite fresh. The sides appear bland but the plantains are perfect and the yuca is well seasoned. The reason I gave a four star review is because our food took almost 40 minutes, we actually asked the waitress if our food was coming soon. Afterwards our check took awhile and after we gave her our cards it was another 15 minutes before we left. The entire meal was 2 hours. So go for the steak and stay awhile...because you might not have a choice.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"(I would like to give it 3.5 stars, but since I can't I think I should edge toward the lower side with 3.) I love beer and was really happy to see Revolution opening up real close to me. I've been twice now since it opened, once just for beer and once for beer + food. If you're a beer lover, the in house brews are nothing to rave about. The Golden Ale, for instance, starts out well, it's smooth and sweet, but it don't finish with any sort of complexity. When you breath the after taste, it isn't bad, it just isn't really there at all. The IPA isn't particularly hoppy (if you like that) and the hops it does have doesn't have much depth to it. It's not very bright or evoke any citrus flavors. I had dark beer too, which I haven't seen on the menu again, but it was pretty good until a friend pointed out that it tasted like a Band-Aid. He was absolutely right. I couldn't drink anymore. The only thing I've eaten there is the burger, which was solid. Good flavor, very juice (almost too juicy), crisp bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, and put on a substantial and durable bun that was tasty itself. I had the mashed potatoes with it, which were smooth and creamy with a touch of sour--good, but nothing to rave about--as the bar tender did. I would recommend Revolution as a good place to hang out and get a drink, BUT it's really too crowded at this point.  I think the reason for that is mainly that this area of Chicago is desperate for a brewery and even an OK one is something to flock to.  If it were better I would say it might be worth the wait (which was 30mins at 5:45pm on a Friday) for a table or a slot at the bar. But it's not. I say, wait until it has calmed down a bit and then head over to Revolution and try it out. No rush. Maybe in a couple months the brew master will have perfected a few beers.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I often have visited sultans but never taken advantage of there delivery service and i will never do it again. I ordered 2 sandwiches and a small rice. I waited about 45 minutes was excited for my delicious food then the delivery driver hits me up with a 34 dollar bill. I have often ordered this at the restaurant and it was only at most 15 dollars slap on a 3 dollar delivery fee and you got about 20 dollars.

"So I've been wanting to try Q for quite some time and finally had my opportunity. It was a very underwhelming and disappointing experience. We started with the hush puppies and for entrees one of us had the beef brisket sandwich and the other pulled chicken with a side of fries, cornbread, and mac and cheese. Cubed beef brisket on the sandwich?? Usually beef brisket is sliced and tender, a little odd and not very good and the chicken was nothing special.  I will say that the mac and cheese and cornbread were delicious but I don't spend $80 for good sides. Service was good. Very overpriced for the quality of the food served and we left very unsatisfied. Definitely won't be returning and wouldn't recommend to anyone.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I really liked this place on account of a number of factors: 1 - I like the decor. It offers a modern atmosphere with out being pretentious. Its pretty laid back. 2 - All of the menu items have an eclectic mix of ingredients that exceed expectations. 3 - When I struggled in deciding between two desserts, the waitress surprised us with our second choice for free while we were eating our first. And it was even better than what we decided on. I tried: - Cana de cabra (queso) - very good - next time I want to try something a bit more adventurous, but it was good! - Bacon-wrapped lamb and cherry tomatoes (can't remember name, but it was under the traditional tapas) - Patatas Bravas - Mussels from the traditional tapas portion of the menu - this way by far one of my favorites! It was served with charred toast which actually accentuated the flavoring of the mussels. They were fantastic. - Toci no con ci dra :Slow-Cooked Pork Belly, Cider Glaze, Green Apples & Truffle - definitely my other favorite!! The dessert I loved was the Croquetas de Xocolata! This featured milk Chocolate Croquettes, Banana marshmallow, ROSEMARY CARAMEL, and Arbequina Olive Oil. I am obsessed with this Rosemary Caramel. Brilliant! I will return soon!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Come early, Come often. That's what their slogan should say. The lady and I showed up at 6 on a Friday and it was already an hour and a half wait. There is literally no standing around room, so you might as well give them your cell and go to the wine bar (Eno) across the street in the Intercontinental Hotel. Hot damn, this place is good. Think mediterranean tapas and small plates. They also have a great selection of cured meats and cheeses. The lady and I had the sopressata, jamon, and one other type of meat. No cheese, we had that at Eno while waiting :). The other appetizer we had was the brussel sprouts, but was more like a dry cole slaw with cheese and a little olive oil. Surprisingly good. After the appetizer we had the braised pork shoulder, and it should be called Braised ""babe the pig"" shoulder because only Babe could produce a shoulder this tender. Wow, I'm lame. Seriously though, it literally falls apart with a slight breeze. To go along with that, we also had the mussels. Very solid, not much more to say. I heard this place had a great beer list, but was a little underwhelmed. They had some rare Belgians, but other than that... eh I can't wait to go back and get all the weird stuff on the menu that the lady didn't want to try on the first trip.

"I've been craving a good Cubano sandwich. Okay, I probably wouldn't know what a good Cubano is, since most of the ones I've had have been made by gringos. So when I heard about this place just across the river from me, I got excited. I drove today (into their somewhat tricky 5-car lot) but will probably walk and eat outside when the weather's nicer. I just enjoyed a take-out Cubano with Mariquitas (plaintain chips). The Cuban rocked my world. It was so good I would've tried to eat two if I'd bought two. Fortunately for my gut I only had one. The mariquitas were also tasty. They come with a garlic oil that got me excited at first glance. But, a little goes a long way and I only ate a third of the order. I'd like to be able to kiss a woman sometime this year. But garlic fanatics - check it out. There were a few regulars when I came in. I could see myself joining their ranks.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We went to this restaurant this past week and were pleased. Like many others, we had heard mixed reviews ranging from ""tries too hard"" to ""inventive."" After a lengthy dinner I'm some where in between, but would definitely recommend people go and see for themselves. The atmosphere was wonderful and the bartender extremely personal. We tried signature drinks and they were worth the price. The waiter bordered on slightly obnoxious, but we let that go. The starter popcorn with truffle oil was amazing. We had two appetizers. The beef tar tar was standard fare with little special about it. The kung pow sweet breads, however, were incredibly flavorful with a much appreciated playful addition of peanut brittle. For main courses we had the halibut, which was beautifully cooked and flavored and the pork loin, which was done well, but again standard fare. We had to try the famous foie gras lollipops, which were incredibly salty, but an interesting transition to dessert. The strawberry shortcake was deconstructed and the best plate of the night. Incredibly tasty and left me wanting to return just for that. Overall, the night was a mixed sampling of great and standard. Nothing was poorly done. The atmosphere helps. The price is a bit high not to have your socks knocked off, but if you do some research before going I think you can figure out what the really winning plates are.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have no idea where to start on this place, but here goes... First off, what an absolutely wonderful experience it was to dine at this establishment. I cannot say enough about Alberto and his wife for taking good care of my girlfriend and I. I was on vacation with my girlfriend in early September and we searched high and low for an authentic Cuban restaurant in Chicago. She is from Miami so pastelitos de guayaba, medianoche Cuban sandwichs, and croquetas were in order. We traveled all the way from our hotel on the Magnificent Mile to get to this place. We entered and liked what we saw. The decor was beautiful and very Cuba/Miami-esque because of the pictures, music, and smells. We order our food and decided to take it to the patio since it was a beautiful day. I will NEVER forget the first bite of my medianoche. Coooooo, que rico, meng! And the croquetas, don't even get me started! The food here is truly amazing, no lie. During our meal we ended up chatting with the owners of this place for almost 2 hours. Alberto and his wife Christine were awesome company. If it wasn't because we had to get to a White Sox game I think we would still be there ""comiendo mierda"" with them. At the end of our meal, Alberto was nice enough to give us a flan on the house. Man, even the desserts here are good! That flan was amazing. I could go on and on and on about our wonderful experiences here, but I say just go and you'll see for yourself.

"Compared to other Korean Restaurants, just average at best. On the plus side, they use real wood charcoal for BBQing the meats, and lots of panchans. On the negative, the panchans were not particularly spicy or interesting.

They paid no attention to us whatsoever, no refill of water until we flagged someone down, no offer to replentish the panchans, no offer of assistance with the BBQ (not that we needed it, but novices would have) -- and, all this even after we displayed our affinity for Korean by ordering Soju (and, even by name -- Jinro SoJu).

"LMAO....Ok, so here's the deal. I've read some of the reviews about Spacca Napoli, and they make me fall out of my chair.What people complain about is exactly what is authentic and special about this place. I grew up in Naples, Italy (authentic pizza capital of the world) and this place offers the closest thing I have ever tasted in the States. That, along with offering very high quality products and the use of very high end ingredients, ranks this place among my absolute favorites. I cannot compare this to other Chicago pizzerias, simply because you walk out of here spending way more then you would if you were to go to regular place. Think of it as a place where you would go for a special occasion, not your weekly trip to satisfy your pizza craving.Spacca Napoli offers a pizza novelty, and the owner (gentleman with curly black hair) is so passionate and so involved in his operation that I do not mind paying what I do for their pizza. He earns every penny, you can see him in the thick of things on a Saturday night, when there's a line out the door and thirty people cramped in there little waiting area. Having said all of that, it is people that have been to Italy that will appreciate and love this place. If you grew up on Chicago style, or any other American style pizza, it might not be for you. Pizza was created to be a simple and fresh treat, not a meal, and that is exactly what they provide. And everything, from their wine glasses to the atmosphere truly resembles an authentic neopalitan pizzeria. I'm truly happy that we now have this place in Chicago, and that it is doing so well. And to everyone who loves the place but hates waiting (no reservation policy) or hates waiting while you stand shoulder to shoulder with 30 stranger, I hear they are expanding the restaurant.BRAVO!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was excited to visit Big Jones as I had heard great things about the place. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the aesthetic and atmosphere. We were immediately seated at a table by the kitchen. Not a great a table as the staff seems to congregate by the kitchens' window. The lighting is horrible. We had a spotlight glaring down at our table. It was quite distracting. Our waiter was less then friendly but not rude. My friend inquired about the vegetarian selection and to his dismay, the waiter explained he was vegan and never tried anything on the menu. My suggestion to the waiter is to just fake it and make a suggestion based on advice from the kitchen and previous guest. My friend ended up eating a dinner salad as his entre. We were kind of surprised by the poor selection of vegetarian items on the menu, after all it is Andersonville. My shrimp burger was ok, not memorable. The owner was eager to hear about our experience. Hopefully, he will continue to seek out comments and concerns, as the restaurant needs some fine tuning.Big Jones, you get two stars.

"Does ""Davanti"" mean delicious? It not, it should. Plan to take a lovely rustic Italian journey at this new University Village Enoteca with exposed brick, artsy lighting and a contemporary flare leading a modern, though charming, culinary charge. Though the menu is certainly family dining centric, the spot itself is very dateworthy. Loved the vibe of this bustling wine shop/bar/restaurant and found its lively crowd, personable staff and delightful bites absolutely appealing. Granted, the no reservations policy here isn't my favorite and causes a bit of a hitch... with a more intimate seating area, wait times can be long and I get awfully unruly when left unfed for more than a modicum of time. Fortunately, Davanti has ample bar space and snacks can be ordered while you uncomplainingly (or not) await to be seated. A compromise if ever I've heard one! Most dining seating is found in an open back area beside the exposed brick archways that house the walls upon walls of retail wine selection that is, yes, available for your purchase! What seemed like such a perfect concept to marry the wine you fall in love with drinking, with what you can actually take home on the spot was quickly soured for me, however, when I spotted one of my favorite wines and - get this - its price tag labeled at over 50% above what I normally purchase it for at Binny's or specialty wine boutiques. For shame! My perception now, sadly, is that they drastically and unreasonably overcharge in the retail wine arena. Now whether that is true for all bottles remains to be seen, but the vino writing was on the wall for me: I'll take my formaggi without a fleecing, thanks. Luckily, the cuisine consumables were far more in line with economies of scale and - huzzah! - totally tasty to boot. Fell madly in love with several of the starters, especially the ultra fresh roasted cherry tomato, burrata and basil pesto salad and the rich and decadent truffle egg toast with velvety egg yolk, melty fontina and grilled asparagus. Mama Mia, Mangia! Even our entree of roasted strip steak with peppery arugula, sea salt and a hit of extra virgin olive oil was light, bright and as with all other dishes, had its own distinguishing trademark that made it unique and special. Now, every once in awhile a clunker exists on a menu... my trio was unfortunate enough, I think, to have unearthed Davanti's. The Pizza con Salsiccia e Rapini (with Italian mild sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic, chili oil, fresh mozzarella and tomato) was an overloaded, muddled and really bitter disaster. From one who subscribes to the ""pizza is like sex; even when it's bad it's still pretty good"" philosophy, this pizza was seriously like the worst sex ever. A book and warm blankie would have been better. A gorgeous dessert called Torta Bacio, a fluffy chocolate-hazelnut mousse with a crunchy, candy bottom nestled up to vanilla and hazelnut housemade gelato, quickly redeemed any bitterness I was holding on to from that ill-fated pizza pie. Hey-O! This is the sweet life I was looking for. Overall a nice experience and one unquestionably worth returning for. Ciao, Baby, Ciao!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went here for the first time on friday and boy was I suprised. I had heard a lot of things about this place but when i get there I was more than satisfied. The food was excellent; i had the wild boar sloppy joe and the oxtail and scallops. I skipped the dessert because i was too full by that point. Also, the drinks were fantastic. I had one of their Yuzu Hot Toddy's. Yum Yum. I highly recommend checking it out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First the waitress (Debbie) forgot my order so the 7 people I was with got theirs well before me, then the waitress had to ask me what I ordered, then she brought it out wrong. I also paid $2.50 for a coke and finished it before eating, and she never came back to refill it. We saw her only two times.  Secondly they do no split checks, so you have to write down how much your total is and the amount of tax you are paying on yours. If you have a card then you have to pay the tax and tip on your card because they don't take it out of the cash. Which can be complicated when you go with 8 people.  Then when you call the dark haired manager with the big glasses over after waiting for LITERALLY 45 minutes after you finished eating and complain about the way things are set up, he will rudely say ""it really isn't that hard, it is just simple math"". Among with some other very rude remarks. Even the 2 tables next to us came up and told us we should report him for the way he talked to us. When he was done insulting us he rudely walked off.  I have never in my life been so insulted by a manager. I would never in my life return to this place and I would warn people before walking in the door if I am by there.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Piccolo Sogno with a large group, four couples, eight people. My fiancee had heard good things about it, so we were looking forward to it. We were sorely disappointed. The main problem was the waiter hard selling us on a pasta dish with white truffles. What he didn't tell us was that the white truffles were a $45 upcharge. Two of us bit on it (literally and figuratively), and didn't find out about the upcharge until we received out check and saw an additional $90 on it for the white truffles. When I asked the manager about it, he went back into the kitchen, came back out, and essentially called me a liar because I had told him earlier in the evening that I had been to Siena, Italy the previous summer, had bought some truffles there, and now didn't believe me that a whole jar only cost 20 euros. He told me that I knew or should have known how much they were. No, they should have told before we ordered them. It was incredibly embarrassing because we then had to split up the bill evenly when two of us had the lopsided upcharge for the truffles. On top of all this, the service was awful. They gave the wrong dishes to the wrong people, and had an incredibly brusque, contemptuous attitude, brushing by our backs harshly and rudely. It was incrediby crowded, I guess owing to its undeserved popularity, but I would never eat here again. The decent-tasting pasta dish was not worth an undisclosed $45 upcharge for the truffles.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Demera was awesome! We went last night after waiting entirely too long. We've been in Uptown for almost a year and I've wanted to go since the first time walking by the place.  We did the meat and vegetarian messob for two.  We knew we HAD to have the ye-misir wot because I love Ethiopian red lentils. We also had ye-shimbra assa, and shiro as our vegetarian dishes. For our meat, we had doro wot, doro alicha wot, and spicy michetabish. It comes with a house salad in the middle. Everything was yummy. The reason I'm not giving the place five stars is that everything was essentially the same texture. I've had Ethiopian food elsewhere and the lentils still had bite-- they weren't mush. Aside from the little chickpea dumplings and the drumstick, everything was almost.. blended.  Also, I hate that, even when you order for two, you only get one drumstick with the doro alicha wot. Fortunately, I was with my husband and it's not awkward to split a chicken drumstick. Had I been with a person I didn't know so well, one of us probably wouldn't have had any. Overall, the food was pretty freakin' fantastic. We could have consumed the entire meal, but did leave a little bit (a few square inches of injera and a bit of one of the meat entrees) on the platter. The server seemed to be surprised by how much food we consumed. Pretty much all of the other diners had quite a bit left on the plate. The portions of each dish aren't particularly huge, but with all of the injera one consumes in the process of eating the actual veggies and meat, it's a ton of food.  My husband ordered the hot tea, which was delightful. It was quite like chai, spicy and fragrant. We loved it.  The food is super flavorful and delicious. Make sure if you go, you take people with whom you're fairly comfortable. It's kind of intimate, for lack of a better word, to eat everything with your fingers. I'll certainly return, and I hope it's soon!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been here four times and have had some mixed results. I love the atmosphere, the location, the beer list and - when everything goes well - Bad Apple serves one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. All of that being said, the food has been a bit inconsistent. I always order burger medium rare and my burger was clearly overcooked here on two of my visits. Also, I love their options for french fries, but, my fries were a bit burnt when I went last night. Lastly, be sure to always order your burger on a pretzel roll. The pretzel rolls are great even though for one reason or another not all burgers are served on them. On a good night, Bad Apple is absolutely, unequivocally a 5-star review in my book. On an off night, they're still a solid 3-star.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If you are vegetarian and want good food for a special occasion, go to Green Zebra instead. I did the 7 course tasting (vegetarian) and it didn't blow me away, but I think the meat eaters thought theirs was pretty great so I guess they just don't have the vegetarian down. The dessert was the best part of the meal, but for veggies it isn't worth the 85 bucks.  Our waiter was annoying and it definitely downgraded our experience there.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was playing with some quotes about revolution for this review, including: Give me beer, or give me death. They may take our lives, but they will never take our burgers. Get up, stand up. Stand up for your ale. The revolution will not be televised. So drink some more beer. But as you can see, they all ended up being really, really dumb. So I'll just say this: If there ever was a revolution I could get down with, it would be one with burgers and beer. Rev is open until 2am every night, so it has become a late night fave for me and the manfriend. First: order beer. They have something for all tastes, and it's all good. All the servers are knowledgeable about their selection, and they're all super cool. I'm not gonna lie, I wish they were all my besties. Don't tell them though, they might think I'm a creepy lurker and avoid me the next time I go in. Watching the bartenders yank down on the fist-shaped tap handles is just fun. Second: order food. Preferably burgers. Haven't had a bad one here yet. The Hombre Burger with poblano pepper, chihuahua cheese, avocado, and tortilla strips is my fave. The apps are the shiz too. Bacon fat popcorn? You had me at bacon. Polenta fries? Gimme. The building is huge and awesome, so take a moment to look around while you eat. Exposed brick, crazy artwork, a fireplace, and a cool upstairs dining area all add to the experience. So what are you waiting for? Grab a glass and a plate, and join the revolution.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This may be a nice place, but we never really had a chance to experience it. They have a policy that if everyone in your party is not eating food, you can't be seated. Since half of us (party of eight) had already eaten, we were not welcome there. They wanted the eaters to sit at a table and the others to sit at the bar! We had some munchies in the waiting area and then left. I had the Workingman ESB which was pedestrian, as it should be. Very noisy place, accentuated by the pressed tin ceiling, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation.My opinion - the beer people need to take control their establishment from the restaurant management (maybe a revolution?).

"I can understand the appeal of this place, but I will always choose good food over big portions. This place is about big portions and not much else. We shared a skillet and their strawberry and banana french toast. He got coffee. I got an earl grey tea. Let's start with the tea - it was the most bland, un-fragrant earl grey I've ever had. Really disappointing given how good earl grey tea should taste. But I won't give them too much crap for their tea. It's tea, after all. Their skillet was about the size of my head, which was amusing at first. First bite: there's something funny about this egg. Second bite: this egg tastes like it's laced with metal. Didn't have much more of that. The french toast: they used challah bread and provided real maple syrup, which should have made just about anything delicious. It was boring. My taste buds were so excited, but upon the first bite, disappointment swept over me. How could something so beautiful taste so bland? So, if you like beautiful food that could feed a small African nation, you'll love this place. If you want your taste buds to have as much fun as your eyes, you'll be pretty disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love Big Jones. It might not be the very best food in the city, but it's always delicious. On top of that they have amazing service, great decor, a strong menu (with lots of vegetarian options) and a focus on fresh, organic and local. Big Jones is a total package. I had one server there who should have been at a 3 diamond restaurant, he knew his stuff. I'd say brunch is their forte, but I've had a number of great dinners too. Came for Valentine's Day and was blown away. The fried green tomatoes are fantastic. Brunch is great, though, because the menu is so unique. They have eggs, bacon, potatoes, pancakes- all your 'usuals' - but the combination and the extra touches make it unique. The Creole cream cheese omelet is incredible, so is the Sally Lune French Toast. Last weekend I had the eggs benedict with fried green tomatoes instead of ham... delicious! Brunch is also much more affordable. At dinner it's so tempting to get a drink, an appetizer, a meal and dessert. It's just all so good. I had one experience at Big Jones that started off bad and ended up making me like them even more. They were understaffed and no one came by after we were seated for a good 20-30 minutes. So what did they do? They apologized profusely (both our waiter and the other one) for the misunderstanding. They we were given 2 free cocktails which were incredible! Then we received amazing service AND a free dessert. As always, the food was amazing. Where else takes services that seriously while still being affordable?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"dearest hopleaf, we have such blessed memories don't we? i was deeply committed to your deep fried smelt, a buttery and crunchy midwestern entree that went so well with any beverage/beer that you provided. shortly, after the smelt had disappeared, i regretfully moved on to your mussels and pomme frites. i learned that this was my only alternative, that this was as pleasurable and succulent mussels could be without going to the east coast. your broths were clean, rich, and used delicious ingredients. i understand your charm, your magnetism--- despite your stupid-ass long lines. yes your ambiance has a warm comfy wooden atmosphere, but not all of your food is as on-point as the mussels. your crowd can get frustrating as it is a bit bourgeois and white for my taste. now, i could forgo that blemish (as per usual, being in northside chicago) if your service was consistently polite, attentive, and accessible. however, in that department you are hit or miss. either i have had the most diligent service in my life or someone rude and frigidly inhuman. i would suggest that you work on this. in closing, 3.5 stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The tables were insanely close together and there was a weird server-guy who kept walking by our table every couple of minutes asking if he could take things away. We clearly were still eating. Finally I told him he could take my plate and he kept walking by waiting for my boyfriend to finish. We paid the bill, and wanted to finish our drinks before we left and the guy STILL kept coming by to take A napkin--one at a time. This place was just weird.

And we also ordered a cheeseburger which was not a good choice at all. The condiments they added were just not right. Was it relish? I am not sure but it definitely did not belong there. Also, the fries are advertised as amazing and they were pretty average. Overall, it was good and I'll definitely come back. It was good and that's it.. not expectacular.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place used to be a favorite of mine and a couple of coworkers for after-work dessert and drinks. Never again. The last two times that I went were enough for me to refuse to ever go back again.

After awhile, we got up, paid for what we ate, and left. The next visit, we had a different waiter who was incredibly rude and actually swore at me. The salad, desserts, and coffee are all great, but not enough to make up for the horrible service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This was a very disappointing experience. We ordered the tasting menu with pairings. When we left we were still somewhat hungry and were disappointed that there was only about 1/4 of a drink poured (at most) with each pairing. This wouldn't have been so bad if the food and drinks came out together. On most courses the drinks came out significantly before the food which wouldn't have been a problem if there was enough of the drink to take a few sips before the food came and then still have some left to taste with the food. There were a lot people working, but rarely did the same person bring anything to the table which may explain the poor timing. The table next to ours received 3 courses while we waited for our dessert to arrive. And consistent with the prior courses--the drinks were out for 2 of our neighbors' courses. There were some highlights. The atmosphere is great. The halibut, chicken, and steak that were served were excellent. Each bite was a new experience. Overall for the price of the ""experience"" was far too costly for the gaps in service and to leave feeling unsatiated.  Fine dining in a casual atmosphere is a great concept, but the casual atmosphere still demands spot on service and execution.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First off, if you are not a meat-enthusiast, don't go. From what I hear the salad-bar is outstanding, but who in their right mind pays $50 to eat a salad-bar? It's all about the meat! The wait-staff is very attentive, and if you haven't seen your favorite meat in a while, the friendly staff will more than gladly flag down your carniverous desire. Side dishes like polenta are replenished before ever running out, the service is great. The meat is a high quality, and seems to be cured well. I highly suggest the less expensive lunch, same food, less cost. Of all the brazilian steakhouses that are springing up all over, this is the cream of the crop.","[1.0, 0.0]"

As far as the service, let me just say that if I had servers as friendly as the guy who took care of us everywhere the world would be a better place. Not only did he encourage us to take our time and relax, but when my chorizo cheeseburger came out sans cheese and overcooked, he didn't hesitate to get me a new order done right & fast.

"I don't know much, but I know a good steak. And I can tell you you'll find one at the Kinzie Chop House. At least I did. I went with an associate a few nights ago and had a wonderful evening. The sommelier was fantastic and recommended a wonderful pinot noir that went great with the calamari app we had. The calamari was probably the best I've ever had - it was cooked perfectly. I mean PERFECTLY. The spicy aoli and marinara served along side it didn't disappoint either. The staff at Kinzie knows their stuff - our waiter patientely answered all of our questions and gave his best recommendations on cut, temparture, flavor, etc. I got the bone-in Delmonico (rib eye) cooked medium and it was quite tasty. I think next time I'd select medium-rare, but the flavor was still really great and the meat was tender. My associate said nothing but wonderful things about her filet and the sauteed spinach and mushroom side we split was tasty and enough for 3-4 people.

"I was in town last weekend and needed to find a place to eat in their area. After seeing positive review after positive review, I decided to force my friend to go here. She trusts me and I trust Yelp so...it works. I think the look and feel of the place is great. It's small. Limited inside seating. The outdoor patio area had more seating and given the weather and the awkwardness that is sitting/eating/having to constantly look left or right to talk to your company it was a must do. I've only had Cuban a couple times in the Detroit area so by no means do I consider myself an aficionado. I will say, however, that I've heard hundreds of people talk about how the Cuban sandwich is a Godsend and yet I have not had one good experience ordering it. I ordered one at 90 Miles hoping for redemption and much to my surprise...it delivered. Great sandwich. The side (fried plantains) were nice because they are an interesting upgrade to fries (or any variation of fries) but the 3-5 small pieces seemed inadequate in comparison to the sandwich price. I also thought the sandwich creation process seemed pretty slow as a hole but everyone was nice so it wasn't a major dilemma.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My wife and I happened to be at Zed451 the night of 8/5, the same time as 4 other reviewers who were part of a party of 30+, so I wanted to chime in. We had made reservations a week before our trip, and when we got there, they didn't have our table ready. After about a 10 minute wait, they noticed my impatience, and bought us a round of drinks at the bar for our trouble. Within about 5 more minutes we were sat, at which point they explained that they had been slammed by several large parties, including the aforementioned 30 top (as it turns out were right behind us once we got our table) and another that was 100 plus, and the parties were dragging on longer than expected.At any rate, the manager was very apologetic, and once we sat, we were given great and almost non-stop attention, and despite it being in the last hour of business, and with the prior overwhelming demand of the evening, they had all the meat dishes still available (it's a buffet of sorts as one can tell by prior reviews). Both the harvest bar (calling it a salad doesn't really do it justice) and the rounds of meat were incredible, the only weaknesses being the slightly overcooked chicken and somewhat bland salmon. The tuna was great, as was the prime rib, rump roast and all the other red meats.I can't judge the poor experience of the 30 person party, as we arrived towards the end of their dinner, but I would highly recommend this restaurant for both the food and service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"OK, I am a big fan of RIck Bayless, as I think he is a great chef. However, he needs to figure the service aspect of this place out and QUICK. The couple times I have been so far, the whole 'number' and cafeteria style 'line' thing just doesn't seem to be working very well? Especially given the amount of people waiting and how long they are waiting for! The 'authentic Mexican street food' is OK, but doesn't really remind me of any street food I have had on the streets of Mexico City. But, the Tortas from the griddle are really delicious and remind me of many of my Cuban favorites from Miami (where I moved here from). I don't think that is what he intended, but still very delicious! MUCH more expensive than the Cuban variety, but very delicious! I will go back, when I have several hours to wait in the ridiculous, convoluted, line.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came here on a Thursday night on a first date. We came at 7ish and the restaurant was pretty empty. I liked the setup though, the bar was small but nice with a lot of floor space around it. The food was good, pretty solid, nothing earth shattering. I was underwhelmed by the wine list, but was able to find a decent Barolo to try. I will definitely be back here, just not anytime soon. I suggest you try it for yourself to make your own assessment, I've definitely been to worse fine dining in Chicago.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is the story : I love steak. There is nothing like a great slab of steak to cheer me up. My birthday fell on a busy Thursday night and I did not feel like going out. My best friend planned this whole dinner party at Ruth's Chris Steak House. We went there and we had trouble finding a parking slot. I always order my steak to be cooked medium rare. To my surprise, it was sooo goodddddd! The meat was tender and it made me want more. All my friends had a great time too. Everything was good. The fries were done just right so I was sure that everything was cooked perfectly. We are definitely going back for more steaks and fries.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with some co workers, I gotta give it an A for service and an A for ease of making a reservation. We sat on the top floor. The place is nice and great for happy hour and lounge food in the cool area upstairs. the price is ok but the food is NOT all that. We had this fried stuffed prawn appetizer and spareribs, it was NOT all that. It was OK. The prawns were big and all but nothing impressive. The ribs, barely any meat and it was cold. We ordered the shrimp and broccoli fried rice, so bland. The good thing was that they did put a lot of shrimp pieces, so I have to give it up for that. We got the fried trout..pretty good, great sauce, but nothing so WOW about it to be $22. We also got the yam and chicken curry..bland and nothing spectacular. We also got the duck and that was just not impressive at all..dry and bland..had to ask for hot sauce and in the end, it was like just some plain dry duck with lots of siracha..bleh! The only yummy thing was the mango and vanilla dessert. We also got the mousse cake but that was ook.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I do not understand why this place is so popular. Their food is not very original, or exciting...or authentic. It's not even very well prepared. The steak lollipops are more fat on a stick than anything else! Don't get me wrong, I'm the kind of girl who wants fat on her meat, but a line has to be drawn somewhere. While the design of the place is somewhat interesting, it's ridiculously uncomfortable. When I go out to eat I'd like to think about the food, not a hard piece of wood pressing into my sit-bones. The lounge couches are even worse. The back of the couch is way too far away from the front of the couch, so if you'd like to lean back you can either do so at a 160 degree angle, or you have to scoot all the way to the back so that your legs are sticking straight out over the edge.All in all, this place is totally overrated, and overpriced. There are so many great restaurants in the area...why would you choose this one?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"4-1/2 stars. I took my hubby here for his birthday today - we both agreed it was a great choice! Thanks to advice from Yelpers, we got here by 4:30 p.m. and were 1st in line. Very excited as we had a Rick Bayless sighting - he was working with his staff at his new place XOCO (check out menu online - can't wait to try it!). After a pleasant wait enjoying the fab weather and chatting with other Bayless fans, we were invited in promptly at 5:00, given a pager and scored 2 seats at the bar. Wasn't sure how long the wit would be, so we ordered the pork empanadas to go along with our beers. We were happily surprised when our pager when off after 15 mins and we were shown to a lovely table for 2.  We were very impressed with the service throughout - our waiter (tall fellow) was exremely pleasant and helpful with descriptions of the menu (which just changed) and paced the meal very well. The busboy was also very efficient and friendly. We never felt rushed even though the place was pretty full and lots of people were waiting in the bar area. For the most part, the food was awesome. Do not go here expecting typical Mexican restaurant portions - this is all about quality not quantity. The food is sophisticated and high quality. We started with the pork empanadas which featured a smoky pork filling and crispy exterior that contrasted nicely with the avocado sauce and tangy watercress salad. We also had the ceviche trio. Loved the presentation in little martini style glasses. While they were all good, the Ceviche de Atun ""Chamoy"": sashimi-quality Hawaiian ahi tuna tossed with crunchy jicama and tangy, fruity, spicy red chile-apricot chamoy salsa. was a standout. We'll definitely get a larger portion of this on a return visit. For entrees, I had the seafood of the day - a grilled swordfish with veracruz sauce. The fish was moist, flavorful, with a nice grilled taste. It was accompanied by disappointing mash (very watery not creamy) and pickled green beans and carrots that were al dente but spicy. Hubby had the special - very tender shredded suckling pig served with tasty black beans and fresh tortillas on the side. Beware the hot sauce served with this dish - it was super hot - but we were warned! We were determined to try dessert - even tho we wer pretty full. Wish we had followed the waiter's advice and ordered the choc/raspberry tart but went for the caramel custards which were a bit weak. I have had better flan in run of the mill Mexican joints. Coffee was very good though so I was not unduly disappointed. Overall an excellent experience that we will repeat. If you go, plan ahead and go early to avoid the frustration of long lines. No food is worth a 2 hour wait imo.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Service was just ok. I got it to go and it took a little while for it to be prepared, esp. since I just ordered Pho. The flavor was pretty good, portions were big.

"After living in Uptown for almost 2.5 years, I am embarrassed to say I never visited Tank Noodle until 2 months ago! I am rather picky when it comes to my meals, so I honestly believed I would not find anything on the menu to suit my tastes. I could not have been MORE wrong!! Their menu is huge.....they probably have about 300 dishes!! I ordered a spicy chicken and rice dish and let's just say I almost fainted from both the spiciness and deliciousness!! Not only was the food really good, but the dish itself was HUGE! I had to go back home and lay down because I stuffed myself....thank goodness I only live a block away.

We finished our meal with a... get this... pretzel pancake with caramel & white chocolate drizzled all over it.

I will be craving that damn sandwich (& trying to recreate it at home) until I can make it back to Chicago to eat it once again!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Shaw's is my favorite restaurant in the city. Not only does the ambiance bring you back to the era of the untouchables, but the quality of food you will eat is second to none. Bit on the pricey side, but the seafood you are getting is worth the extra $$$. Ever seen Deadliest Catch? The crabs you will enjoy at this Chicago landmark are caught by Captain Sig Hansen on the boat, The Northwestern. The crabs are absolutely perfect and huge! Sick of having crabby smelling hands all night? Shaw's serves a tea and lemon dish that you dip your fingers in to deodorize your digits. Thank you for the tip by the way, I use this every time I de-vein shrimp at home. If you make it to Shaw's during lunch, check out the oyster bar. I have eaten oysters there about 25 times and never had a single bad oyster. Match that up with a huge Bloody Mary (complete with shrimp and all the trimmings) and you have a lunch you will never forget!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"$110 will buy you two ZED Dinners. Mixed drinks average $12 a pop. This is how it works: The entire night you are served by different (student)chefs? who visit your table each serving something different. They will explain to you what you are eating and what preparation and care has been taken to whatever dish they serve you-- in my experience this is some sort of meat/polutry/fish dish all of which were delicious. Your meal will include two side dishes (ours was ratatoulli & mash potatoes), cornbread, water and as many trips to the 'harvest table' as you'd like. Harvest table: food here is visually enticing but taste doesn't always match expectations. Chic trendy crowd, huge warm and romantic space, tasty drinks (though hardly strong), friendly and super attentive staff, very expensive.... overrated perhaps? You will most likely leave stuffed. I would love to give it a second chance but once might have been enough for me .....ouchy on the pocketbook.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I would be totally enthusiastic about Garcia's if it were the only Mexican restaurant within walking distance. However, it's one of a crowd, and between cheap taquerias and more upscale places, Garcia's doesn't stand out at all. It's also a big barn of a room on the inside.

"All right. This is Yelp Review numero uno for me. And yes, I registered just so I could review Fogo and give them 5 stars.This place has everything I need to sustain myself: Pizza, chicken, salads, and more. And everything is incredible.The Pizza: Here's the thing. Between my roommate and I, at least one of us eats here on any given day. We started out joking like, ""all we ever eat is Fogo."" Then that joke became the reality. Neither one of us has been grocery shopping in a couple of weeks.I have had about 25 varieties of pizza from their slices alone! Did you think I was joking about the every day thing? This is what keeps me coming back, again and again. Thin crust, delicious sauce, and fresh, high quality ingredients. I generally get two just because I want to experience two flavor explosions (plus you get a free drink), but they are big enough for one to be satisfying. Some of my favorites are BBQ chicken, buffalo chicken, margherita, hawaiian, veggie slices... well they're all pretty great actually. Even the ""standards"" are way above expectation (i.e. sliced grilled sausage, three varieties of pepperoni, multiple cheese...) The ingredients are clearly much higher quality than you usually get from most pizza places around. They know what they're doing.The Chicken: In the words of one of the cooks there - ""You like Chicken Hut? I'm not gonna say nothin bad about Chicken Hut. All I'm gonna say is we got more Flavor."" After my initial pizza marathon, I had to try it. More flavor indeed! I hold their chicken in the same high regard as their pizza - my favorite in the city. You get an expertly seasoned quarter chicken, two sides, pita and a drink for about 6 bucks total. My favorite sides would be the potato salad and the black beans, but again... they're all good. I would get the chicken every time but am usually seduced by one of the slices they have ready...The Salad: Huge. Fresh. I've only tried two of these, but they definitely stand up to my voracious appetite. Very nice juicy grape tomatoes and top quality cheeses. Both times I got it in a fresh baked bread bowl. My technique: eat half the salad with a fork. Eat the other half wrapped in the bread bowl like some kind of giant taco. Probably enough food for two people, or one really hungry guy.The Staff: Very good people. Family owned so you know they care about what they're doing. Everyone there is very friendly.Extras: Brazilian music, Brazilian TV (sometimes sports/winter Olympics lately), and they have a charity event every Tuesday.So in conclusion... High quality fresh ingredients, family owned, a great value, and a good vibe. That's why I don't go grocery shopping anymore.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If I'd written this review after my first visit to The Violet Hour I would have given it five stars, but after this past weekend I'm so irked that I have to put it in writing. We showed up at 6:30pm on a Friday night with a group of about ten. They didn't have room and took my cell number, saying they'd call when something was ready, so we went somewhere else. Around 8pm we got a call saying a table would be open at 8:30. Another call at 8:25 inviting us to come back. Very nice. That made me happy. My smile quickly faded when we got there. The doorman immediately informs all of us that YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE CELL PHONES INSIDE and you'll be kicked out if you do. Are you joking me? What is this, high school? I thought that was completely absurd, and planned on using my cell phone all I damn well pleased. Then he tells me that if the rest of my party isn't there in ten minutes they won't be admitted. I felt like hitting him square in the mouth. It was my freaking birthday and my friends wouldn't be able to come because they didn't know to show up at exactly 8:30? A couple people arrived a half hour later and called me to let me know that I had to come up front to get them (and I answered my phone, so THERE!). Then they sent a girl back to our table to ""make sure there was room"" for them. Christ, how ridiculously pretentious can you get? Forget this place. I can make Moscow Mules at home and they won't cost me $12 a pop or come with a heaping side of attitude. Anyone who stands outside waiting to get into this place is an idiot. I was absolutely enchanted the first time I went here. The decor is a beautiful, eclectic mix between Victorian England and Alice in Wonderland.

She was extremly rude and I had to almost fight to get a meal without a hair. Finally they gave me a new meal and it was not what I had the first time. I gave up and ate it anyways.

"Great. This deep dish has the best crust, in my opinion of ""the big three"" (Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's) - it is flaky in a good way, and adds just a bit of crunch to the otherwise gooey and squishy pizza. The sauce is sauce, not puree (like Gino's East) or stewed chunks (like Lou's), but has good flavor and just a bit of acidic bite. The famous upper-crust is there if you look, but honestly, I don't taste or feel it when I eat it, and if I didn't look for it, I'd never know it was there. The cheese, of course, is excellent as well. This is perhaps the thickest slice of the big three deep dish pies. On a negative note, this location is stingy with toppings. My recent visit included both Italian sausage on one pie and pepperoni on another. There were, sadly, perhaps two or three sausage chunks per slice. Pretty sad, in that most bites were just cheese pizza. The pepperoni was flat layered at the bottom, and sparse as well. I could see it in cross-section, but could not even taste it - just not enough of it there... This location gets pretty crowded, so expect a wait for a table. But their lobby/hostess stand area is tiny, so no way can all the waiting parties wait there, so you wait outside with everybody else. PLEASE GET AN INTERCOM!!! They have none, so if you wait outside, even 10 feet from the door, you'll never hear them call your name. So what do you do? Well, you wait outside, then 10 minutes before you expect to be seated, you have to bust into the hot and crowded hostess/lobby just to listen for your name. It's packed, hot, and uncomfortable.

"The baked good in this store are OUTSTANDING. The bakery itself, meaning the staff, leaves MUCH to be desired. Every time I go there (and I live two blocks away, so I go often), it is like pulling teeth to get anyone in the bakery to even look at me, even when I am the only customer in sight. When I do get their attention, they are CLEARLY irritated at having to wait on me. It's a store, right? I mean, the items are behind glass. I cannot simply serve myself. Similarly, the bakery staff are also tasked with serving coffee. My experience tells me that you MUST go out of your way, no matter how obvious your presence, to beg them for coffee. You could stand there with a hatchet sticking out of your head and I doubt the employees would notice or care.Fox & Obel carries a number of specialty food items I enjoy and purchase there often.

"This place is like Cheesecake Factory on steroids! I think they were owned/started by the same people. It has become an iconic place to send out-of-towners to for any meal. It is sure to dazzle and mesmerize anyone who is not used to restaurants being that big, and laid out like a mall (multiple floors, elevators, separate dining areas and many spacious hallways). All that aside, you have a plethora of options to choose from, because although it is American cuisine, to Americans that means anything so it can be hard to choose your meal. I personally get tempted by the elaborate dessert case you pass before being seated, and some desserts require a full 30 minuets to prepare, so be prepared to know if you want to please your sweet tooth. The portions are pretty gargantuan, but the aim is to impress. If you are on a diet, BEWARE! This place is full of things that make you want to cheat, but if you do so, cheat wisely. Skip the sugary drink and get a dessert. Also, for the college student splurging, the meals are usually big enough to eat half and take the other half home for a second meal so you feel like you're budgeting after all. Valet parking available, and street parking, but its downtown Chicago so...Enjoy! Grade: A","[0.0, 1.0]"
Great food. No complaints. Loved the atmosphere. Knowledgeable and helpful servers. Fried green tomato BLT. Best split pea soup (Even if you don't like split pea soup--TRY THIS!). My boyfriend had the fried chicken. I just don't think you can go wrong here!,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I recently went to Geja's for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic and the service was friendly. We each got the Prince Geja's Combination which was the perfect choice, because it came with a salad, cheese fondue, chocolate dessert fondue and the assortment of meats to cook. Geja's really felt like a complete dining experience and everything was extremely delicious. I highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Casual, unique, fun - and de.lic.ious. I've had takeout from here once, and dined here once (in the winter/enclosed patio). Both experiences were great, reasonably priced large portions, and Mmm Mmm Goood. Delivery - came reasonably fast, and I was surprised by the amount of food. The chicken entree came with rice, a huge flattened chicken breast, lots of grilled onions, a few pieces of plantains, and a sep. container of black beans. That sounds like a lot of food. It was, and I ate it all, happily and quickly. Dining in - I really liked the vibe here. It was laid back and fun and something different. Waitstaff was quick and attentive, and again, the food was simple, quick and darn good. Ordered the same entree, and loved it just as much! We also got an appetizer of fried plantains in addition to what already comes with their entrees, because they are just that good.  This seems like the perfect spot for leisurely summer dinners in their back patio space, will def. be back when the warmer weather is here! It is BYOB, fyi...","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great Pizza!!! This place has the best selection of slices at all times!!! Every single time that I have ever been there they had 12 choices of hot fresh slices ready for you to enjoy. Usually it consist of 4 Thin Crust, 4 Stuffed (Chicago Style), and 4 Pan. Not many places can you go and always count on hot fresh slices of any style combination and ingredient that you'd want. I usually go with one thin and one stuffed. Their pan style, still tasty, is my third option. I find it to have way too much bread and not enough sauce. Good thing the guys at Art of Pizza keep the big selection hot and fresh at all times!! I subtracted one star because the place is always seems dirty, when you walk into the restaurant you typically see garbage on the tables that looks like it has been there for quite a while....its actually kind of strange, but who the cares the pizza is great.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Why? Because it kicks ass. Let me elaborate:They don't try to do a lot of things. They focus on encased meats and then get wildly creative within that area. They serve a veritable Noah's Ark of animals throughout the year. I have eaten delicious animals from all over the world, wonderfully seasoned and served with surprisingly perfect appropriate toppings. I would never have thought to combine cherries, elk, and blue cheese but I am damn glad that Hot Doug's did.Other things to consider: 1) they have an inexpensive, amazing dog that used to be named the Shawon Dunston (now the Dave Kingman). Solid good eating for under $5. 2) Best corn dogs ever.3) Best fries in town. And I'm not even talking about the duck-fat fries (which are incendiary and inspiring like the true form of Zeus which burned poor Semele).4) The ginger beer they have in the cooler is also kick-ass and a perfect compliment.5) They sometimes have the Gyros-dog. It is everything you dream it could be.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It is a very controversial topic but I believe Giordano's has the best deep dish. They have an awesome crust and the best tomato sauce. I actually crave the deep dish often.

Celiac's beware!!! Meli's lists several items which are gluten free - I was very excited about this because I have celiac disease. When I talked to my waitress this past Friday at lunch about gluten she didn't seem to know what I was talking about - so I went the safe route and ordered a basic salad. The salad arrived with a piece of bread on it - so I explained that I can not have wheat (at this point it wasn't worth describing what gluten is) and asked to have another salad made. In half an hours time I found I had been glutened! I'm still sick (usually getting sick from gluten takes about two weeks to get over). I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened. A gentleman named Chris implied that I had called to try to get a free meal as well as implying that Meli's didn't get me sick. I told him that I had gotten sick and even a free meal wouldn't be enough to get me to come back to his restaurant. I thought I was doing the responsible thing to alert him to the problem.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wanted to try the avena shake, which I've heard raves about. I loved it. Sweet and cold and refreshing. I enjoyed it and so did the hubs. But he soon got sick of it. As he kept drinking it he thought it got too ""fragrant"". Too much cinnamon. I thought it tasted like horchata. We ordered dinner to go. I ordered the pepito sandwich. A ribeye sandwich with cheese, beans, grilled onions and avocado (extra). It was very good. He bread was chewy. They steak was tender. The hubs ordered the casado with rib eye. It was a stew like dish with carmelized onions. It was very tender. Served over rice with an over easy egg. Ahhhh. That's the way to my husband's heart. Especially with a take out order to have an egg that had its yolk still runny was a winner. You had him at hello. He broke it over his rice and it complemented his rich casado well. The cabbage slaw was nice and refreshing I break up all the richness. The Lizano sauce is their green spicy salsa verde. Nice and cool and a bite of spiciness. Delicious with the sandwich. I'd go back and try some other costa rican dishes. And other combinations of shakes they have. My only criticism? Cash only. Come on. Are you paying your staff under the table?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Very classy place with wonderful service and excellent food. My party arrived early and was seated right away. Our server Brandon was one of the best. Very attentive and very educated about the menu and the wines offered. We took up the table for three hours on a busy Friday night but never felt rushed. We ordered mussels for an app and they were very tasty. Not rubbery at all. Dinner included prime rib, kc steak and a variety of sides. The prime rib was some of the best I have ever had. Many options on the well thought out menu, the service and the overall ambience is why I list kinzie chop house as a five star. I also love gibsons but this place gives them a run for their money.

"My aunt and cousins asked where I would like to go for a post birthday lunch this past Saturday. I knew I would be downtown so I thought this popular Rick Bayless joint would be a nice selection. The long line in front can be very deceiving as it is for Frontera....the entrance for XOCO is actually on the side of the building. While waitng on my family members to show up, I actually had a chance to briefly say hello to Mr Bayless outside. He seemed to be in a hurry, but was polite enough to say hello back to me as he walked back inside the building. The hostess (whom I was told was his daughter) informed us if we were dining in then we would have a 10 minute wait for a table of 5. There seemed to be a separate line for takeout as well. No one really stopped to tell us about the whole dining process. We had to look at the menu on the wall and pay before we ate so we looked pretty lost while in line with others behind us. I consulted with a buddy of mine (Dylan D) via text message to ask him about the delicious sandwich he had here months ago and he told me the Pork Belly sandwich was the one that blew his mind. He also said the Cubana was tasty as well. I found out they only serve the pork belly joint on Wednesdays. I went with the Cubana which was decent. It came with a very tasty salsa which made the sandwich much better. To drink, I went with the Lemonade which was sweeter that sweet (pretty good though). We ordered the churro as well...I hear everyone raving about them, but they taste the same as the ones from most carnivals. I guess most people have never had a decent churro before or maybe because it is associated with Mr Bayless it tastes much better to them, lol!!!! Pretty decent spot. Would not mind going again, but I don't know if it is worth standing in the long lines I keep hearing about everyone standing in. I guess I was lucky enough to show up on a late Saturday afternoon to avoid their long lines. Place is pretty small so I can understand it being a wait at times. They have outside dining as well which I would have taken advantage of, but it looked like it wanted to rain. The people that work here seem pretty nice and got me everything I needed (to go boxes/ water/ churros).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"THE CAST OF CHARACTERS: One father, one mother, one 3-year-old, one newbornTHE VENUE: Very classy marblemania Vegas style. Beats out the Tropicana Atlantic City buffet hands down. Parents take head--the place has enough ambient noise to drown out your kids, ensuring enough of a buffer for other diners. There's outdoor seating too, with heat lamps. A plus.THE WAIT SERVICE: Friendly, efficient and not overly solicitous. I give our waiter -1 for not presenting the option of a kids menu unsolicited.THE FOOD: I'm a pig so most food tastes good to me, but I give this joint a solid B+ for taste. We ordered:-Edamame for appetizer: perfectly cooked and not soggy like at most places; seasoned with some kind of soy sauce mix that gave it an interesting and yummy twist; pretty addictive, and even the 3-year-old was digging it-Pasta Carbonara for entree: soooo good and bad for you at the same time; not too creamy and quite buttery; perfectly seasoned; worth shaving off a couple of years off your life-Chili for entree: hearty with lots of meat, including luscious ribs; just a tad too salty, but it did come with a crumbly and sweet corn muffin that balanced it out a bit-Chicken fingers off kids menu: well-prepared if a bit bland, but it's for kids so the low-sodium is appreciated; the 3-year-old liked it well enough; but the star of the show are the shoestring fries, which we enjoyed on behalf of the 3-year old--wowsers!!THE PRICE: I think most of the entrees are in the teens so this place is a great great value for the calibre of food and nice-ness of the placeTHE VERDICT: We're gonna be regulars!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Let me put it simple I always get whatever ravioli they are serving because it is always sweet and savory. The menu frequently changes and the ravioli is always something different BUT never ceases to be A-mazing! The onion tart they give you is a good little treat & the bread and olive oil go nice with one of their Italian wines. I have tried a lot of their apps and have picked off my guys dinner plate a number of times and can honestly say I have not had one bad thing here to eat. And I don't know what some people are talking about the server for .. He's just doing his job in a small, crowded restuarants. I always get the guy people are talking about with the glasses and he means nothing but well. He always had suggestions on great wine to go with a meal. He also reccommended apps and entrees to my friend and I. Maybe people caught him on a bad day? But I have had him 5 times in a row and he has been nothing but helpful. So maybe give him another try - he's busy as well as everyone else and ask questions ( coming from a former waitress) ! Otherwise, you will be helplessly lost because I was - I could not read the menu. :( waaah","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My sister had been going on and on about this place. So when I arrived in Chicago we made a point of swinging by and grabbing a couple of dogs and some fries. I only eat hot dogs in Chicago and these were as good as any I have had. I love the different combinations. However the highlight was the duck fat fries. They were almost good enough to tempt me into moving back to Chicago (almost). If in town or just in the neighborhood, swing by. You can't beat the price and they won't disappoint.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ok, Ok, so I've worked at a pizzeria claiming to have really good Chicago Style Pizza and Gino's blows it right out of the water... The sauce is not too acidic and not too sweet resulting in the best combination of sauce ratio ever. Even if it takes 45 minutes for the pizza to get to the table, it's well worth it. Sip on one of their draft beers. They have a great list of em, and perfectly priced. I probably want to try their thin crust, as I love thin crust, but I dunno, I guess we will see. I havent read many reviews for it. The mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce is pretty awesome too. I mean, way better than most Italian/Pizza places. We had a great server, but the only thing I'll minus a star for, is because we weren't planning a trip to Gino's, we kinda just passed it and decided to dine in, we didn't have anything to mark the place up with our names. The server didn't have anything for us. Boo. But all in all, Great trip.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I wasn't impressed with it: it came in a packet and was fairly bland, but I'm not an avid tea drinker.Our server was very nice: not the fake nice, and not rude. I'm always weird about fine dining, it makes me feel awkward and out of place, like I'm trashy or something. It's swanky, but not too fancy. It was a little small.We just got the basic maki rolls: tuna, salmon, and, california rolls. I must say, the taste was great! It was flavorful and very fresh, probably the best sushi I've tasted yet.

"This one will be quick as this is my third review of Piece. I returned yet again last night with my boyfriend. He had never heard of the place, let alone come in for the pizza. So, being the good girlfriend that I am, I took him here to share one of Chicago's best pizza experiences wtih him. And really, this place is more of a food experience than just a greasy pizza. We waited about 45 minutes for a table and the entire time we were there, even when we were walking out the door at the end of our meal, people were still streaming in. They do a good business. We ordered 2 small pizzas. It was def more food than two normal sized people could finish, but I insisted we have one ""exotic"" pie and one ""fall back"" pie with easy ingredients we both knew we'd like. The fall back pizza was red sauce with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. And it was fantastic! It really was. My boyfriend LOVED it!  The exotic pizza was the white sauce with the clams and bacon. Yes- I've done the clams and white sauce before. But last time I didn't get the bacon on the thing. And the bacon was fantastic! Additionally, they put a TON of clams on the pizza which was wonderful! Nothing worse than being jipped on something like that. The clam pizza was almost more of a gourmet garlic bread than a pizza. But it was magical I tell you!  All in all, boyfriend LOVED his pizza, I LOVED my pizza and our waitress (I can't remember her name but she was a tiny little redhead) was great- especially considering the giant crowd of people she had to contend with.

"My wife and I drove from Louisville, Kentucky to Chicago for a New Year's celebration, and we made reservations at Sprout. Its a long way to go for an evening, but the food, service, and fun would have justified a drive to Alaska. It was our most fantastic dining experience, ever.Front-of-the-house was incredible. Although the restaurant was sold out, we greeted very warmly, led to a wonderful table in the main dining room, and given an excellent preview of the night's menu. A great way to start the night - we felt honored and valued, and from the looks of everyone around the restaurant, everyone was having a similar experience. Then Ginny, our server, stopped by to greet us, and the evening started.Each of the 10 courses was presented with a brief discussion of the ingredients, technique, and flavors we would be experiencing. Throughout the mean, Ginny and her co-workers stopped by often to ensure that everything was fine, and that our needs were being met. Service and front of house far exceeded any other fine-dining restaurant we had ever visited, from LA to NY to Dallas or beyond.And the food? Incredible. A very deft hand obviously prepared the curried prawn, which was a perfect mixture of heat and sweet. My wife especially enjoyed the citrus sauce, which Chef Dale took time to explain to us, and the venison, which was adorned with an equally rich sauce. For me, the best bite fo the evening was the pistachio cake with fois gras icing - a wacky combination, sure, but a perfect blend of savory and sweet that was easily the best bite I've had, anywhere, any time. I'm a sucker for anything with fois gras, but this was a unique take and a stellar preparation.We were surprised by the consistency of excellence throughout the evening. The chef and staff obviously put a lot of thought and care into the evening's menu and preparation, and it showed. With a greeting and table service that was unparalleled in its excellence, we enjoyed a perfect evening and a great startto our new year.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm ashamed to admit that I used to think Reza's was the best Persian in the city. My husband heard this place was good and we just moved to the area, so we went a couple nights ago. Wow! Their menu is almost the same as Reza's. But Noon tastes better, and is a little cheaper. And, you know that if you go to a Persian restaurant around sunset during Ramadan, and the place is packed with Muslims, it must be good.When you first sit and they bring the water, they also bring warm fresh pita bread with a plate of onion and feta. We ordered the hummus, which was some of the best hummus we've had. My husband is not really big on hummus but he ate a lot of it. I had the chicken and lamb kebab combo with dill rice, and my husband had the lamb kebab and shrimp combo with dill rice. The rice and the meat were perfectly cooked. They seemed to be pretty busy (Sunday night) but we had no reservations and were seated quickly and service was good. I'm eating my leftovers as I type this but I still can't wait to go back.I kind of wish they had a buffet like Reza's, so I can get a little of all the best dishes, but logistically it wouldn't work as the space inside Noon is smaller. But if it means keeping the food to a high standard, I'll pay a little more to get a large entree and appetizer that taste AWESOME.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Just tried Chicago q for the first time last night.I would definitely come here again. Standouts include the bbq chips and sweet pickles that others have mentioned. Delicious. The bourbon flight was also an outstanding deal if you're a bourbon fan.My wife got the pulled pork shoulder which was outstanding. I got the Kobe beef ribs which were just so-so. Although they had great flavor, they were not falling off the bone as advertised. Pretty tough actually, but still quite tasty.I have to say I was underwhelmed by all four sauces. My favorite was probably the mustard-based sauce, which is a tough one to find at most BBQ joints, so if you're a fan of that type of sauce, Chicago q may be your mustard mecca.My only other point of contention is that when I asked them to package up my leftovers, they failed to include a whole Kobe beef rib which was untouched on my plate. At over $35 for this entree, this felt like a pretty big rip off for them to not include a third of my entree in the doggy bag. (Of course I didn't discover this until the next morning when I unpacked the bag.)As I said I would go again. But next time I think I'd stick to a more traditional pork rib, and double check that all leftovers are actually in the bag before I leave!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am NOT a complainer, and I know that ""things are just different in Chicago,"" which I have heard quite a few times since I've been here - but as a girl who likes to drink, I've already hit quite a few bars in the city, and I have to say... the people who work here aren't ""just being Chicagoans"" (as a gentleman I talked to last night dismissed it) but are actively SUPER RUDE. When I first bought my ticket to Chicago, one of the things I was most excited about was visiting the Green Mill slam. I'd heard from many in the community that it was kind of a joke slam, but nonetheless, having been to many slams nationwide, I was still curious to see the way Marc Smith ran his. I called beforehand to find out if there was a time to show up to sign up for the poetry slam - the guy who answered the phone said it started at seven... when I asked if he knew whether or not the sign ups happened at a specific time beforehand (which is very common), he actually scoffed at me and told me he didn't know. THEN HE HUNG UP ON ME. You hang up on customers? When I showed up, the doorman said, ""$7 and your ID."" I live in a bar city. I am used to doormen, and I respect them wholeheartedly - this was not a problem. I asked if he knew where I should sign up; he grunted, ""open mic?"" and when I said slam, he pointed to a board with a lot of different papers on it. I assumed I should write my name on one of the pieces of paper, but there was no pen. When I asked for one, he actually rolled his eyes at me before pulling a sharpie out of his pocket. When I went to give it back? He acted like I was retarded and just POINTED to the window sill. Didn't say a damn word, just pointed. Dude, I'm sure your job sucks, but save it for the bitches. I've met plenty of bouncers and doormen who were capable of being intimidating and serious without being catty little wenches. The waitress brought me a glass of water (no waterbottles allowed inside, which is weird - even the OLCC isn't *that* crazy), and flew away before I could tip her for just having good service. She smiled once or twice, but when I finished the glass of water, she whisked away the empty glass, and once again fucking FLEW away from my table before I could ask for another or, again, tip her. I guess, since I'm complaining, I should also say, the glasses were very pretty... Since the waitress was fucking GONE after that, I tried to flag down the bartender to order a glass of merlot for my friend (who arrived late), and he seriously made eye contact with me twice and served every other person before me - even people who had JUST walked up (how do you not notice that after like 10-15 minutes?) And the slam? The slam's a fucking joke. I can deal with hardasses, I think Marc Smith's grumpy attitude is kinda funny, but actively making fun of the poets is tip-toeing the line for me. How do you encourage a scene of new voices if you mock and show clear contempt for people after they perform? What about, say, giving the feature's last name so that people who are unfamiliar with the poet can FIND THEM later? The pianist is awesome, and rolled with all the punches. I'm glad to have been, the lounge is really beautifully and elegantly set up, and there were moments of charm, but this place has SUCH BAD SERVICE and is so pretentious and up it's own ass, I thought for a second we might be in New York. Oh, wait, the Nuyorican slam has some of the nicest, most supportive, and brilliant poets - and the service is spectacular. What, then, is the problem with the staff at Green Mill?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Recently, we had catering from Simply It for a company party. Half of our attendees were vegetarian, the other half being ravenous meat-eaters. I called about a week in advance to work out everything with the owner to make sure that it worked out smoothly for both groups. Thankfully, it worked out splendidly!For a group of 30, we got 5 different appetizers: avocado wontons, chicken puff pastry, shrimp spring rolls, seafood egg rolls, and the chicken avocado. Within the first hour of mingling and eating, all of the appetizers were gone. With the help of a couple employees from Simply It, we were able to change out the appetizers quickly with the entrees. They were extremely helpful and made sure that I was left with as little to do as possible regarding all of the food.Our entrees included the Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles, Lemongrass Chicken, Grilled Salmon Noodles, Lemongrass Chicken, Beef Ribs, Vegetable Fried Rice, and Seafood Noodles. Although we ordered an incredible amount, I had everyone take home a bit, while saving some for myself as well. The food tastes delicious as leftovers as well; that must say something!But I'd like to thank Simply It for making the evening go swimmingly well. I'll be sure to call again when I need to plan another party!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Whole chicken dinner (with two sides, 1 - garlic rice with black beans and bacon, 2 - corn) was about 13 bucks. I added a small order of the Bocci Balls (wellington meatballs that are breaded, along with marinara sauce) because they are DELICIOUS and two coxinhas, which is a ball of pulled chicken fried up in a cornmeal breading. 22 bucks, dinner for two, excellent.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to Sunda last Thursday for one of the ""tastings"" before the restaurant opened to the public and I was really impressed with the restaurant on its opening night. Usually it takes a few weeks to work out the kinks, but the servers were pretty knowledgeable. They only had a limited menu when we were there but we got to sample tons of dishes. It's a really good place if you like Asian food but not necessarily sushi - they have tons of other options if you don't like raw fish.I think this place is going to be the new ""Japonais"" and the trendy vibe/menu is on par with places like Koi, Nobu or Tao. I will definitely be returning!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went there for a late lunch (about 2 PM) today. There were still quite a lot of people dining there at that hour. The service was fast and attentive. We were done and out within 35 minutes. The lunch was about $30 for both of us without any drink. I ordered Vermicelli bowl topped with BBQ pork and the husband ordered the stir fried wide noodle with seafood. The flavor for my noodle was slightly above average, but I won't say that it is so great that I would want to go back again.  Also, I suspect that they use MSG to add sweetness to the dish. I am slightly allergic to MSG (slight headache afterward). The pork is well grilled and flavored but a little bit on the salty side. They do give you plenty meat, however, I feel the noodles and veggie are a little less in proportion to the meat. Overall, I think the dish is okay, but for $9, I guess I would assume a slightly larger serving for the dish, especially for lunch price. My husband was happy with the noodle, but feeling the seafood has not much flavor to them at all by themselves (some sort of frozen mix seafood pack?). I had a few bites of his, I didn't think it worth $14 for it. I think our conclusion is : this is a restaurant that it is okay to try it out if you happen to be in the neighborhood and do not have a better plan for any special restaurant, but will not want to go back as a special meal (like what we did today.)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here with friends on a Monday night- the place was packed! It's a very laid back, beer, pizza and sports place, fun to visit. It was very loud, so not the best to catch up with friends though. They check your ID as soon as you enter, so I'm guessing not a family place. Now I am always a deep-dish girl, but I really enjoyed their thin crust. You have three options for thin crust- regular with sauce and mozzarella, red with sauce and Parmesan shavings, and white, with no sauce, olive oil, garlic, and mozzarella. Get the white- it's amazing! We got a large white with pepperoni, half olives and peppers. It came fairly quickly, and out on one of the largest asking sheets I've ever seen. Besides pizza, they are known for their beer. I'm not a beer person, but had their framboise which was good. Not too expensive, and our server was good too. It's a long way from home for me, but I'd go back again if I was in the area.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The pizza was phenomenal!I came in here on a Thursday night for a late dinner (dine in) and ordered a large, red pizza (crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) with fresh tomatoes, Italian sausage, and basil. I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, so I don't care for mashed potatoes and broccoli. It came our relatively quick, which makes sense for a thin-crust pizza. The pizza had a very good balance of sauce, cheese, and crust; and the toppings were adequately distributed over the entire pizza (not clumped together, but also not overpowering the pizza experience). It was delicious to say the least.But the big winner here was the crust. It was plain amazing. Crust and sauce is really what makes a pizza since those ingredients are usually made in-house (I hope), while Italian sausage, fresh tomatoes, basil, etc. are purchased from restaurant supply distributors. Technically anyone can get great toppings if they know the right people. Therefore, in my mind, what sets one pizza place apart from another is the quality of the sauce and the crust. Piece had one of the, if not the, best I've ever tasted. I would be totally fine withjust getting a large tray or bread and sauce. Yeah, it was just that good.If you're into singing, Thursday night is Karaoke night, so the place will be really loud. Unfortunately, when I was there most people didn't sing very well and their song choices were questionable. But the pizza was delicious, and I'm definitely going back.Try to eat in if you can as I'm sure it's better hot out of the oven than after it spends 30 mins in a cardboard box.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This was about my 5th time here and I finally feel compelled to write because I've had the same experience all five times. Yes, the pork belly is great but it's just not worth the hassles of going to this place.  Forget a leisurely dinner - we were terribly rushed even though the place was half empty and not full even by the time we left at 8:30. Maybe we were too old or not hip enough and they wanted us out quickly. Five of us dined last night (Wed. night) and at 7 it was about half full. We were told the booths were reserved (even though some booths remained empty at least up until we left) and given seats at the communal table. As always, it was really, really loud - we couldn't hear across the table (that's why we like the booths). We were hugely rushed throughout the entire meal from the minute we sat down - we requested that they slow it down to no avail. As soon as we were seated the waiter did his spiel (before we had a chance to look at the menu) and he returned twice in the next 5 minutes to ask if we were ready to order - no time to even read the menu or discuss choices. We asked for suggestions and he read off just about the entire menu - not helpful. The wine was aggressively poured (we were quickly asked if we wanted another round as soon as the little carafes were empty even though our glasses were full - we had to ask them to stop pouring for us). Feeling badgered, we hastily ordered (all dishes together at Publican's request even though it's small plates to share), and most of the dishes came all together in less than 15 minutes from when we walked in - we again told them it was coming too fast and to slow it down - they apologized and paid no attention.  On the food, the veal brains and sweetbreads were greasy and tasted only of ""fried"" - I think the oil temp was too low. Overall opinion on pork rinds - they tasted like cheetos and the ones you buy in packages at corner liquor stores are better - more crunchy. The smelts were good, the salads were good (squash and a tomato salad), the potee was great, the blood sausage was good...pork belly and bread pudding to die for.  Hint: when they ask for your credit card on reservation and tell you they'll charge $25 per person if you cancel or if someone doesn't show, just tell them forget it - you'll go elsewhere. They relent and take your reservation. At a price point of about $70/person with 2 glasses of wine each and about 2-3 small plates per person, this is a steep price to pay for a loud, rushed, only partly good dinner. I will stick to Maud's or Girl and the Goat from now on - they seem much more happy to have my business, and without an attitude.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Been here twice. and I shouldn't have because the second time was just like the first. Not good in any way. I guess the service was not so bad, but it could have been a little better knowing that there were not many diners at the restaurant. The food was nothing special. I don't remember what appetizers, maybe because it wasn't good. I had the braised short ribs and they were not moist and if they pretended to be, it was only because of the salty over reduced sauce they glazed on top. The vegetables that were served were the only thing i guess worth eating.The second time was the same, if not worse. I can't even remember what I tried that time around, except for a coffee.

"Basically we were celebrating our first yr wedding anniversary and I am the biggest crab fan and my husband will take me to the best places to eat crab. since we were staying at the Dana hotel downtown, 'SHAWS' was pretty close to it and since its featured item were crabs I could'nt resist. so we got there, and there was valet parking for 12 dollars which we thought was pretty reasonable. so we were made to sit at the bar while waiting on our table. the bar had a pretty interesting menu and the dish that caught my eye was steamed Alaskan crabs with new England clam chowder and 12 oz key lime pie for 34.99dollars which I thought was a good catch. so the bartender asked us if we wanted to order at the bar or at the table. so we told him we wanted to eat at the table...so after 10 mins, we got our table which was a pretty small and not cosy. it had high bar seats, and a small table. not impressed there..I am so happy that I did'nt dress up too much for that place , coz honestly it looks like a diner. does'nt look anything sophisticated. so I knew what I wanted to order. but the waiter gave us a different menu with the same dish but without the clam chowder and the key lime pie and this time it was 46.99 dollars. so when he came to take the order, i asked him if it came with any sides. he said this is a A La Carte menu. so My husband said, these places here are just this way. I was a bit disappointed but my husband made it up to me by ordering lobster bisque which was fairly fine and the quantity was ridiculous. it was the size of those ready made puddings you get in the super market. the waiter got my dish and trust me , it looked just like 1/2 a pound instead of a pound. I generally take an hour to eat crabs cause I enjoy it so much..this time it took me only 15 mins to complete it. the taste was so plain, and aweful. the waiter did'nt come to check on us if we liked the dish. I rather pay 17 dollars and eat unlimited crabs at raintree restaurant. when it came to the end, my husband asked the waiter if they had anything special for people celebrating their anniversaries. he gave us some recommendations and we passed on everything. so he gave us a complimentary key lime pie which was good. ( but if you would sit on the bar, that was an included item) The time we spent together was awesome, but the food is not even worth 1 star. our bill in the end for something we did'nt like was 89 dollars. ps: my husband had fish and chipswhich he thought was pretty ok and the fries were yuck.so we went to pick up our car, and it was on the opposite side of the street which also had meter parking for 1.75 dollars. and they charged us 12 dollars for that..I would rate this place a ZERO.just the time we spent together was priceless.The bread they offer is so sour and horrible.ambience - 2/10decor 4/10service 4/10location 6/10value for money 0/10taste 1/10This is my personal experience..I usually don't like writing negative reviews but this one forced me too.before i conclude, My husband almost threw up on the way and had indigestion the whole way and I had a horrible time with my stomach. won't get into more details, you can imagine. so even the food they serve is not fresh.I have eaten crab at several places and the best would be, rain tree, red lobster and joe;s crab shack.I would never visit this place again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I don't know how to feel about this place. On the one side, it reminds me a little too much of Hollywood. I appreciate the hand-made concoctions (even though at $12, they are a bit steep), and I appreciate the silly tall chairs and tiny tables, but.. who cares? On the other side, I am glad a places like this exist for when you really have something to celebrate, or a super special occasion and you need a $12 cocktail or two to commemorate. Its nicely done, and I'm glad I've experienced it, it just seems soooo not what Chicago is about. I feel like this place takes itself too seriously. Although the sign in the bathrooms with the ""House Rules"" def. should add a half a star. It needs more humor like that. Also, Jesus Christ, its difficult to read that gigantic menu with a tiny candle light. The waitress luckily was able to recommend something that I enjoyed (although she was a little spacey.). They put this gigantic block of solid ice in your drink and when you pull it out to examine (because you're 3 years old like me) and realize that you're paying $12 for about 4 oz of liquid, you feel a little dopey. Ha! For me, its a place like Kuma's or Giordano's. I'm not going to hang out there but its nice to know about in case you have to take someone there for a change of pace. Or a client.

"This place sounds different and very intriguing but it's missing a huge part of what is mandatory for a great dining and drinking establishment. This is about the customer. I visited the Violet Hour last night and experienced several different reactions. At first, the place was difficult to find and obviously designed to be that way with the speak easy concept. The boarded up entry is I'm guessing the way to stand out so I was curious. As we entered the place it had a very nice feel. Nice dcor, nice music, and a bit dark. So far, so good. We met up with the rest of the party for a total of nine and all was good. Cocktails were order and despite claiming a full bar, the selection of liquors was somewhat limited. I have read other opinions about the prices but not too bad for the concept they were trying to achieve. The bartender took pride in the fact that they were different and not aware that he was annoying. He actually told a lady at the bar that they didn't have her type of vodka and but she could get it across the street and some other place. The space provided for the party was not large enough and so six of us sat at the booth and the others stood near the bar. Because we were sat at the last booth and near the end of the bar, this didn't appear to be a problem. Apparently they have a no standing rule there. I'm just glad I didn't have to line up to use the washroom with the other kids in my class.Food was ordered and received. The menu was a version of a chef driven home economics class. Deviled eggs, waffle fries, deep fried green beans, etc. It was comfort food but at the lowest level. Very County Fair comfort.As the first hour progress, the service got worse, the music went from classy Rat Pack 1960's to Waylon Jennings, and the attitude got nasty. For a place in Bucktown that wants to have the atmosphere of the Four Seasons or the Park Hyatt, it's really missing the mark. The part that is missing is at those other places, the customer is the main focus. I've never received a bad attitude or poor service at the five star venues this place is desperately trying to mimic. We left before we should and spent another $1000.00 a block down the street.In summery, the Violet Hour has a great concept but would avoid this place at all cost until:The servers realize that they are servers and just because they were special to there parents do not mean that the rest of the world will automatically assume this.The Chef makes a menu that is better than Waffle House.They hire people that have managed a bar/restaurant before. This part of town is great and if you want intended pretentious, you can find it all over but with good service and food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Duck was as stellar as always, and each other dish was a pleasure - well made, generous portions. I'm surprised to see negative comments about service since I've always found the service warm and helpful. Our water glasses were never empty, the wait staff made sure we were always happy and had everything we might possibly need - and the manager Kelly went out of her way to make sure we had a great experience. Final treat of the night was the peach sorbet - house made - with lovely herbal tones as well. Can't wait to go back ... again and again. We came home with leftovers enough for another full meal for the 8 of us and the check was only $30 each including a very good tip for the great time the Sun Wah team made sure we had.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Another visit and maybe this will be a 5-star restaurant for us. I love black cod, and they did a great job with it: Not overcooked, with potato, cucumber, mint, sambal, and five spices. Delicious. Foie gras appetizers - delightful, although I would have preferred less distractions in the dish.  Terrific setting and great service. Only its location will keep us from being regulars.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The line is long, but it is totally worth it! With prices so low on such high quality food, it is no wonder people will stand in line. Three of us shared three courses and all got our own hot cocos for $15 a person. Not only do they have great chocolate everything, but it is the only chocolate without perspectives in Chicago.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Probably one of my favorite places in Chicago. Food is consistently great and at really good pricepoint. Standouts are: -Salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio -Pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg -Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatos -Pork liver pate -Pork neck bone gravy with calabro ricotta Lots of people rave about the bone marrow... i've had it, its not bad but i've had better. I prefer the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta. Word of caution, the wait times can be long and they don't take reservations. Don't come here with more than 4 people during peak hours.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's a very popular place and if you go on a nice day, especially a Saturday, you should expect a long (~2 hr) wait. Stop your whining. The website is extremely up-to-date and accurately reflects the day's menu. The duck fat fries are good to try once, but they're really nothing to write home about. I don't feel compelled to try them again after the first time. Obviously, you can go there to get a regular hot dog or brat, but that's really a waste of a trip. If you're going to wait in line for over an hour, at least get something you really can't get anywhere else. They're great at incorporating really unusual meats into their sausages. I've had rattlesnake, kangaroo, ostrich, bear, alligator, etc. Some of the aiolis/mustards/mayos are kinda weird (strawberry mustard is definitely a no-no), but overall the food is solid and Doug is awesome.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been coming to Longman and Eagle since they opened, but after my last two experiences, I feel compelled to write a review. First of all, the positives: the drinks are still good, and the wine selections and specials are good. The food has taken a dive. The first meal I had here was one of my best in Chicago just after they opened. Recently, we came here for dinner. After waiting over an hour and a half on an early Thursday night (which was fine), we got a waiter who didn't treat us well all night. His lack of listening skills were even more apparent when something never showed up, and he later tried to blame it on someone else. His upselling was also over the top, after which he would then disappear for extended periods of time. And we would have been ok with the waiter, if the food hadn't been so blah. We were a group of 4, sharing dishes, so we ordered a LOT of dishes, and besides the fact that they all needed seasoning desperately, they also shared the common trait of having nothing that made them special. We did like the desserts, but mostly we ordered them because we were still starving and hadn't seen the waiter at the right time to get more food. We also were given a look of disdain when we asked for salt, as though we couldn't possibly think there was anything wrong with the food. So then, I decided to give it another try, for brunch, because I live in the area, and want to support local business. I had the crab benedict. Not only was the egg white on the poached egg so uncooked and unappetizing that I could barely swallow it, the crab seemed like it was a lower grade product (super fishy), and again, we had to steal a bottle of salt (didn't feel like getting judged this time) to try to make the food edible. I would like to note that the Yukon potatoes that came with my dish were excellent and well seasoned, but it just annoys me that they did a good job on the side dish when the main course was so poor. I'm not sure I'll be coming back here, save for drinks, after this last round. Lula's across the square is serving killer brunch, and we're lucky in Chicago that we have plenty of places to go to that serve adventurous food, and most of them know how to season it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I haven't been here for about 3 years, but Geja's remains one of my faves. I have been eating at Geja's for more than 10 years. My mom used to take me every year for my birthday. I don't think I've ever been there with a guy, so yeah, it's romantic and all, but I don't date guys romantic enough to take me (even after many, many, dropped hints). I love the atmosphere, the wine, the food, and the service. They have valet service, which is awesome. It looks like a cute little french restaurant from the outside - you walk down the steps from the street and enter a dark, beautifully lit restaurant. There are a number of table/booths. The walls are lined with wine bottles and candlelight dances around the room. It is cozy, but friendly. I have had to wait at the bar for the rest of my party many times and the bartender is always nice and able to recommend a nice wine. I love that you can split the course dinners because I usually go with meat-eaters so we can all share the cheese fondue and then everyone gets their own entree to cook themselves. Mine = a plate loaded with fresh vegetables like mushrooms, small potatoes, onions, etc. And the dipping sauces are awesome! Then comes the pice de rsistance: the chocolate fondue with liquor on top that they light on fire! The fire goes out when everyone dips their marshmallows in. Then you can dip small pieces of pound cake, strawberries, and other fabulous fruits. Mmmm. I'm gonna have some food dreams tonight!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Alliance is pretty awesome. I mean, everything I've had has been quite good, but I'll admit that I've only had the macarons (proper French and the American style w/ coconut and an extra ""o"" German chocolate version). My girlfriend tries the Milette once, but I didn't since I suspected it might have gelatin and gelatin and I are enemies. Oh, and we've both had perfectly tasty but disturbingly similar veggie sandwiches here (both w/ pesto and tomato but one with mozzarella and one with goat cheese and red peppers). I really enjoy the food here. Good macarons are not easy to find and Alliance has some tasty and interesting flavors (raspberry-rose is one of my favorites). But the service here is always a little aloof, the people up front aren't aware what ingredients are in which pastries (I asked today which things contained gelatin so that I could avoid is and the girl at the counter didn't know and made no attempt to find out, only stating that, ""Probably just the things with mousse in them,"" which doesn't clarify much since that's 50% of the display). I think the fact that the people working in back don't really talk much to the people working the counter makes this a big problem for them. What about people with food allergies? They always treat you as if you've no idea what things are, explaining that they are fragile, best at -blank- temperature, etc. and it gets a little annoying hearing that every time you buy something. Also, I have to agree that the Alliance Lounge next door is a little unwelcoming. There appear to be regulars and they don't like their peace and quiet interrupted. I went there once, and only once, with two friends and we felt eyes on us every time we talked. Not the best atmosphere for a lunch with friends. So, in conclusion, the food is lovely, but the service is less than thrilling and the seating options are a little intimidating.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I've been to and tasted much better... The restaurant is sooo small and cramped. The bread was kinda hard and not Italian at all. The food was really just o.k. unfortunately. I would rather go to Sapori Trattoria any day of the week than this place.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is a stretch to 4 stars, but I've been to Carnivale twice and the bottom line is it's a good restaurant experience and a fun night out. So what if the food and service are not selling points? The real selling point is the decor -- you have to see it for yourself. Food is tasty but nothing I've had was inspiring. Generous portions, and high prices, are the norm. There is plenty of live music, dancing, and special events if you care to check them out. And the girls always rave about the drinks.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It's not spicy or anything-- they seem to be going for a natural flavor. (I'm not really sure that I'd go any other way with eggs, per-say...) The atmosphere... it's CROWDED. In the summer, the line wraps around outside and you have to push your way through to get your name on the list. I have no intentions of doing this in the winter. I feel bad having people meet me at this location because parking is hard to come by and expensive if they park in the building garage.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Learned a valuable lesson. If you experience poor service, complain to the managers immediately! You might get your dessert comp'd at best. Don't bother using their website, nobody checks it. Was there with my son a week ago and didn't want to ruin the dining experience for him and thought I could communicate with the restaurant through their website. A week later no response. I followed up with a call and basically was told since I didn't address it that night, too bad and all they could do was refund the gratuity. How's that for customer service? No apology for not responding to my online correspondence or for the bad service. I escalated it to the owner and he was even worse.

"I've been to Wishbone twice and I think it is a great joint for breakfast or brunch--plus the space is massive for Lincoln Ave. and if you have a big crowd in town, that can be the most important thing. Both times I've been I've only had to wait less than 15 minutes. The servers were attentive and quick.  The food is good. Went to NOLA this year and it reminded me of that (which is obvious as this place is southern inspired cooking, right?).  One of my party ordered the fruit bowl and I was like ""Why did you get that? It'll be like two grapes, an apple slice, and three pieces of banana""...I was in for a surprise as when it arrived, it was an actual huge bowl of fruit (all types). I guess I just judge a place by its fruit bowl.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I just had a very delicious experience at Chicago q. The dcor of q has a modern country feel. The walls and ceiling are white detailed wood. The floors are wide planked with a medium stain and the tables are dark which serve to create a nice contrast in a very inviting way.The service is wonderful. The wait staff is very attentive and easy going in this gourmet BBQ restaurant. Instead of the automatic boring basket of bread before the meal that most restaurants serve, we were served intriguing sweet pickles and seasoned potato chips. That was a pleasant surprise. The artful presentation of the food goes against the traditional sloppy style expectations of a BBQ experience. Though each member of my dining group ordered his/her own items off the menu, we all tasted everything. So here is my take on the food: The hush puppies appetizer appealed to my eye in its display on the plate and to my taste buds. For my main course, I had a very generous portion of the tender and flavorful pulled chicken sandwich that also included three different sauces in which to dip the sandwich for the full BBQ experience. My sides were pickled onions and cole slaw. Both had a unique flavor twist to a common food item which made the lunch even more special. One of my dining partners had sliced kobe brisket, which was very tender, with a side of the most delicious honey corn bread. The other, had a chopped kobe brisket sandwich, also very tender and flavorful. The only disappointment was the side of french fries that came with the last mentioned sandwich. They were unexpectedly dry, heavy and flavorless. I am thinking sweet potato fries would have complimented this dish much better. The dessert was a large piece of carrot cake which was a big hit all around.Overall, this is lovely place to grab a delicious meal with reasonable prices.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First, I should say that I hate deep dish.  This thin-crust Neapolitan style pizza is like a spiritual experience for me. Best in the world. Try the arugula pizza. I would never think to put it on a pizza, but it combines with their ultra-fresh buffalo mozzarella for a nutty, creamy, perfected flavor. I would eat it every day if I could.Also get the bianco nero if it's on the specials list when you're there. This is a white pizza, with truffle-infused pecorino cheese and porcini mushrooms. I can't talk with my table mates when I order it, because it's like I need to be alone with the bianco nero. It gets into my soul.Their crust is exquisite. Slightly crispy on the outside, but chewy inside. It's so thin you could read through it.The tomato sauce is simple, and brings out the flavors of the pizza so well. It's the perfect blend of sweet and tangy. Just what a pizza sauce should be. At the same time, the white pizzas lack nothing.The insalata mista appetizer has a great balsamic dressing, and the best olives I've ever eaten. They are so fresh, and not overly brined.

"I've lived down the street for two years now, passed this place many times and went in for the first time yesterday with friends thinking it would be slow on a Monday night, wrong! We arrived put our name on a list and told we'd be waiting about 10 min. to sit.  Well, we finally took our seats after waiting ravenously hungry aprox 30 min for our table. For starters, killer beer menu and our waiter was great, he pretty much picked out our meals for us from the beer on up to our dinners. The food was pie in the sky phenomenal- it just takes a long time to get it, a really long time. Fortunatelly our waiter was around plenty to bring us drinks, which were the only thing during our visit that arrived quickly and consistantly.For two salads a soup and a calamari we waited 25 minutes, our dinners arrived another 30 min after the appetizers, The food was delicious the Baramundi and the Arctic Char were both out of this world.

"Solid 4 stars for The Gage. Great location along Michigan and across from the park, there is a lot of chances for people watching if you sit outside. Luckily there are some mid-range height bushes to give you some sense of privacy as you stuff your face with the deliciousness that is served to you. Our server was a bit quirky, she would lean in and really tell you about the food and dishes... It got funny after a while, but at least she was pretty attentive and alert. The other servers kept our waters refilled and crumbs swept off after every course! Tried the fish special of the day, which was pretty tasty. Big fan of the bread fondue appetizer... I could probably just order the cheese as my drink next time. We even stayed for dessert, even though we didn't have that much room. I hit the Irish coffee pretty hard (paid the price later) and we tried the gelatto and cream cheese dessert.... YUM. Get ready to spend some money here, but if you would like a nice dinner/lunch... this is definitely the spot.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife and I came to brunch at Frontera Grill the day after Thanksigiving. We arrived at 10:30am to find a line at the door. Limited reservations mean that most seating is first-come, first served. We were promptly seated upon arriving and the fun began. Service was great throughout with prompt check-ins, water glass refills, thorough explanations of items and specials, and overall good attentiveness. Now, let's get onto the food. The fresh-squeezed OJ and spiced coffee (with brown sugar) was a great way to start the day. We then tried the appeitizer sampler platter which included the cheese quesadilla, chicken taquitos, ceviche, and jicama salad. Everything on the platter was wonderful down to the gaucamole. The quesadillas were not your norm, with wonderful corn shells turned over great cheese. Taquitos were great and the ceviche was prefectly marinated marlin on small corn chips. A great start. For entrees, the hot corn cakes with agave syrup were terrific and the sapitos offered three little cakes,each topped with different things. One offered great scrambled eggs, one was chorizo, and one was grilled chicken with tomatillo sauce. The only downfall to one was that the tomatillo sauce was ice cold when drizzled over the chicken which cooled things down a bit. Overall wonderful food. The mezcal margarita was great and the service through the mexican hot chocolate at the end was wonderful. Highly recommend Frontera for bruch for something a bit off of the beaten path!","[0.0, 1.0]"

The broth that it was served in was strangely flat with very little developed depth of flavor, just really not what you would expect from a Bayless enterprise.

"A Cautionary Tale:The food was fine, and the bartender (Pepe) was fine. We were there on Cinco de Mayo. It was busy, but that wasn't bad either. My wife went to the bathroom. She was washing her hands & someone else flushed the toilet. All the cold water shut off, and she scalded her hand. She was shaking in pain. Her hand was burned when she got back to the bar. The bartender gave her a napkin with ice, which helped ease the pain. When we went to leave, I told the THREE people behind the counter what happened. TWO of them LITERALLY TURNED AWAY FROM ME WHILE I WAS TALKING. The other guy leaned back, folded his arms, and asked, do you want to talk to someone about that? I thought that was what I was doing. I reiterated that I was telling them this to prevent others from getting hurt, and suggested that they put up a sign or better yet-- GET THE PLUMBING FIXED. The guy could care less. I sarcastically remarked that his heartfelt compassion was so overwhelming that we had to leave. TOTAL A$$holes. I emailed the company about it. They haven't responded AT ALL.

My wife had a pretty good hamburger, my short ribs were very tender but not especially tasty and my step son's cod was good but nothing was out of this world.

My tuna was so good - I love seared ahi tuna, and it was delicious with the soba noodles. I also tried his steak and his was cooked perfectly too.

"The service at this bar was so bad I can say with certainty that I will never return. Three of us walked in one Friday evening around 7:00 p.m. and immediately found a table (well, a tree stump accompanied by three logs we were apparently supposed to sit on) near the fireplace. There we sat for 20 minutes without so much as a drink menu. One of the girls I was with went to the bar counter and asked if someone could come over to serve us. We were told it would be just a moment. Ten minutes later, we still hadn't seen any sign of a drink menu so we walked out, but not before mentioning the reason to the hostess. No apology, just a shrug and some comment about it being a busy night. How busy can it be if you were able to seat us immediately?

"A thoroughly disappointing dining experience throughout. The service was immaculately orchestrated and beyond reproach in its timing and willingness to accommodate, but it could not pull this off without making us painfully aware of itself as such. All gestures were grandiose and the atmosphere became overbearing because the staff was so conspicuous in all its activities. Descriptions of dishes were given with the gravity of a military report and yet, still left us wondering about the exact preparation and ingredients used for each dish. Worst of all, we were constantly made aware of the corporate nature of TRU and this slick feeling of propriety and normalcy permeated every activity. Smiling, socializing, or any other deviation from the staff's beautifully choreographed routine is not permitted. But all this would have been gladly forgiven if the food would have been commensurate with our expectations (not to mention the prices). Long story short, it did not. Far and away the best part of our dinner was the wine, a hauntingly beautiful 2003 Grace Family cab that my friend picked out from the vast, well-chosen, reasonably priced, and overwhelmingly Francocentric wine list. We ordered the Market menu; a brief rundown of our courses follows: Amuse Bouche Thin slice of pear layered with a touch of olive oil and a shaving of aged Parmesan. Quite unspectacular, although the serving was very whimsical - the ingredients were layered in an oversized silver spoon (insert joke of choice here). The pear was under-ripe and unseasoned. Neither the ingredients nor the preparation were up to par. Sashimi Knife skills were flawless but once again, the ingredients were pedestrian at best. The fish was incredibly fresh but poorly sourced. The flounder had a pleasant mouth feel and an alluring richness but the tuna and yellowtail were lean and flavorless. The tuna especially felt like a blank canvass for the duo of sauces, both of which thoroughly overpowered the fish. The Uni sauce itself was quite pleasant but it had nothing on the authenticity and complexity of the Uni sauce we had in Mirai the next night. Oyster and Uni Tempura A definite upturn. The oyster was pristine and this was the only execution of Uni tempura I have ever had that really worked. The sorrel puree at the bottom was also very fresh and flavorful. Good. Rabbit Consomm The broth was deliciously complex and concentrated, if a bit overly salted. The rabbit torchon, however, was completely bland, as if the over-salted consomm was supposed to compensate for this. The puree was quite tasty but it and the nearly flavorless lavender foam were completely extraneous. Mediocre. Ricotta Tagliolini Turning ricotta cheese into extruded noodles was a neat trick but the resulting noodle had an unpleasantly slimy texture, a lukewarm temperature, and not an ounce of flavor. It made a suitable sponge for the basil and acacia foam but this dish didn't come together well. The charred cherry tomato was exceptional. Mediocre. Whipped Salt Cod The unquestioned star of the evening. This dish was absolutely perfect in conception and execution, the whipped brandade was intoxicatingly rich and creamy and the smoked, gelatinized potato noodles added greatly to the flavor and texture of the dish. Great Hawaiian Mong Chong The fish was expertly trimmed and quite generous for a tasting menu portion but the fish was over-poached to the point of being dried out and flaky and the Thai spices overwhelmed any nuance the dish may have had. Bad. Roasted Squab The squab was severely overcooked and just not good; the elaborate presentation (the bird was cooked whole, with the breast then being removed, boned, and served) meant that the dish was barely room temperature. The accompanying faro was delicious and toothsome but was also lukewarm. The pepper sauce did an admirable job of masking the taste of the squab, however. Terrible. Selection of Cheeses Solid choices, headed by Humboldt Fog, possibly my favorite cheese. No complaints here and the accompaniments were tasty and appropriate. Good. Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse, Lime, Milk Chocolate, Thyme Gale Gand is a master of her craft and the dessert course was absolutely sensational; several layers of chocolate, each with a markedly different flavor, barely accentuated by fragrant herb and citrus. Great. Sweets from the dessert cart. Great confections from the pastry chef. Nothing as rousing as the dessert course but very good nonetheless. Good. Out of the seven savory courses, one was great, one was very good, and the rest ranged between mediocre and inedible. The meal was marked by lackluster ingredients and strongly flavored sauces and accompaniments. Surprisingly, with all the intricate machinations of the wait staff, not once were we asked if we enjoyed the food, as if a question such as this would be beneath a well-oiled machine such as TRU.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"There was only one thing I didn't like about my visit to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe - due to my wife's hair appointment, we didn't really have time to enjoy our food as much as we would have liked. Other than that, which was no fault of the restaurant's, I loved everything about this place. We actually ended up here by accident for a late lunch, since the place we were planning to go to was closed for lunch on Saturdays. We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat before my wife's hair appointment and stumbled on 90 Miles. Being that we were a bit cramped for time, we didn't order more than a couple sandwiches, and some fries, but the food and service was terrific. I had the Cubano sandwich. I am a huge fan of Cuban sandwiches, when they are not jazzed up in any way. This was exactly what I crave about a Cuban sandwich - just the roast pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickle and mustard (plain old yellow mustard; none of that high-brow dijon stuff). My wife had the Ropa Vieja sandwich. The one bite I had was terrific. I know she was really happy with the sandwich. We also ordered a side of fries, which were lightly battered and fried perfectly. Our server was great. She was extremely friendly and you could tell she was someone who enjoys her job. The man, who I am assuming was the manager, was very personable and, again, with him, you could tell he loved working there. Being a former server and bartender, I love eating at restaurants when you can tell the employees enjoy their job. You know the food must be good and you are very likely to get great service. I know we'll definitely be headed back to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe on Armitage soon, most likely with bottle(s) in hand.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Arrived with reservations and were seated right away. The beer menu is lame, but my wife's Sangria was tasty, and their specialty drinks were a little more extensive (and expensive). Tried a bunch of stuff, most of which were above average. The Bacon Wrapped Dates, Empanada con Espinaca, and Patatas Bravas really stood out, as well as the Chef's Cheese Mixto. Plenty of flavor in the dishes, and like anywhere else, you have to try as much as you can until you figure out what you like the best. Of course, this approach will allow you to ingest some less savory dished, but I've yet try something I absolutely disliked. Wasn't a huge fan of the Verdosa Salad. My wife's Gambas (Jumbo Prawns) were intimidating (staring back at her LOL) but she liked them. Definitely worth checking out if you have some cash to burn and want to try something new. Call ahead, make reservations, and leave the kids at home for this one.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Not much more to say than what others have said so I'll just write something brief to pad my numbers. I've been to both here and Brizazz (sp?) now. I thought the meat overall was better here, but the salad bar fell short. It was fresh and tasty but not nearly the variety as the place a few blocks down. Service was excellent - we had a party of 8, our waiter was very friendly, the meat guys were cool, and the manager came over a couple times to see how we were doing and genuinely seemed to care. I loved when we flipped our coins to green for the first time and the table was absolutely swarmed with meat. Overall a great experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"
We originally went for the beer...but no one told us they had world-class pizza!? I only lived in Wicker Park for 8 months but I probably went to Piece about 25 times. It got to the point where my friends stopped asking where I wanted to go to eat because they knew the answer was automatically 'Piece.'It's definitely a great place to take friends/family who are visiting and enjoy great beer...and it's also a great way to introduce/trick your frat-boy brother/cousin into trying REAL beer under the pretense that you can watch 'the game' there and eat pizza (the topping combinations are endless!).The only knock would be the sometimes inattentive staff...but who can blame them when they're constantly swamped. I've waited tables at places that didn't pack in as many people in a week as Piece does in a night so I can't imagine what these guys go through on a nightly basis. Try it for yourselves and thank all of us who gave it 4-5 stars later!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

This location (the largest of the three inexplicably close locations) has a bigger menu, although to be honest, there is never an occasion when you need a burrito bigger than a baby.

I want one.I've had great memories there - went one night with friends, it was some other guys birthday. Everyone in the restaurant ended up cheering and singing happy birthday to him. Also on my roommate's birthday. They obligingly held on to a cake I had brought in earlier, presented it with candles after dinner, and we cut them all pieces afterward.The food is so fresh and I always order too much and force myself to eat it all.

"Went to Fogo De Chao last night with 9 people total. We were the first to arrive....even though we planned on being fashionably late. Lost that game didn't we? Anyway, we get our little bar coupon and go in the bar and wait. The service is quite good. The waiter was pulling the only open chairs out for us and the restaurant was packed to the gills. We ordered drinks, but the only problem is you don't know how much they are without expressly asking, because you don't get a bill. Instead the waiter writes down a code and it is added into your bill later. Our friends were so late that we had 2 drinks each, so that was $30 added on to our bill.  Not a big deal, I just would rather have paid at the time b/c it would have made splitting the bill easier for others. But I do understand it helps the flow so waiters aren't waiting for people to close up the bar tabs. More of an observation. However next time, we'll show just for desert and we'll end up being on time! The food and meat are terrific. I have been here before like 3 years ago when it first opened, but I think they have all the kinks out. The salad bar is terrific, and huge. Listen to your waiter when he says don't fill up on salad! One drawback I have is how crowded it gets. I just don't like the crowds and the noise. But that's just me searching for something wrong. It's $48.95 for each meal, but you get well more than you pay for, so be prepared to eat. Not a good date place in my opinion because you might not look too refined pigging out. Nice place for groups. The staff is quick and smart.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've lived in Chicago for over a decade and pride myself on knowing good spots to eat out. Mastro's is by far the best steakhouse in town! From the drinks to the entrees, there isn't a single flaw on the menu. Seafood and meat eaters alike will be thrilled with their options, and no dish disappoints. I ordered the petit filet and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. (big fan of gibson's -this was WAY better!) my husband ordered the bone in filet and loved it - had plenty to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.) love that their salads are big enough to share we split the Spicy Mambo, Like a ceasar salad packing a punch,and were very pleased. Gorgonzola Mac & cheese and creamed spinach sides are noteworthy...and though no one had room for dessert, we just had to try the butter cake....mouth still watering, it was THAT good. Our server, Nathan,was fantastic, and the rest of the staff - impeccable. Even received a phone call the next day thanking us for dining with them. Simply put - this place is worth every penny for a special night out, celebration, date, business dinner, or if you're just craving a fabulous meal. You will not be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of the best known veg restaurants known to man yet I can't give it five stars. They have been ""Meat Free since 83'"" yet don't serve FRENCH FRIES!!! How can a 'diner' of all places not have fricking french fries? A diner is defined by its fried food selections. All of their food is seitan and is the bad for you kind of veg stuff so why not french fries? I know they have sweet potato fries, but they just don't cut the mustard in my book. All of their dishes though are scrumptious and they usually have even raw options so if you are veg or vegan this is your mecca. Also, having beers available is great, especially when they serve mojitos in the summer on their back patio; what bliss! Most dishes are takes from traditional American diner plates: Dagwoods, Philly Cheese Steak, Chicken Parmesan Sandwiches, Wing Dings, Rubens, etc... They also have the variety of mexican, fajitas, flautas, and also used to have a sushi plates but I think it is no more? I love this place dearly, but can't make a diner five stars when they lack the iconic french fries. Chicago Diner, get french fries and I'll give you five stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Tried to give it 4.5 stars. We never do 5, so this means awesome to us.This review is kind of a 4fer. Each of our 4 diners contributed to this review.Experience was awesome, like nothing any of us has experienced. All of us foodies, and actually one is a national, award winning hospitality consultant.This is not for the weak pocket book. Get over this concept before you arrive and you will have an exceptional dining experience.Initially we weren't too excited that the whole table had to subscribe to the same general order ( for instance, all must do one of the tasting courses or order ala carte. And if you order the tasting course, they all must be the same number ) The table had the attitude to go big or go home, ergo the 15 course tasting menu it was. Right choice......no question......for one's first visit anyway.So, here are the table's comments:Guest1. We heard that the courses were really meager. They were obviously small, but they are tastings for pete's sake. By the 7th course, I stopped eating the whole tasting to pace myself. I was feeling full!I didn't think I would enjoy each course because there were so many, but I was pleasantly surprised that I did.Guest2. We elected to forgo the wine pairing ( $100/ person ) and selected one bottle of red and one white instead. It worked, however not sure it was the right choice.For the 15 course tasting, PACE YOURSELF! Plan for 3 hours of dining plus. This meal was culinary entertainment with tremendous variety in flavors, texture, plating, and mouth feel.Guest3. I was surprised at how many ingredients could be choreographed into such small yet outstanding courses. Some new flavors for me, and some familiar ones just prepared/ presented in an unexpected way. Staff, all of them were attentive, and helpful and just damn nice!Ambiance was trendy upscale. Comfortable, warm and approachable. In fact, the sommelier was wearing tennis shoes! Loved it!Guest4. I loved it all. Service, food, ambiance. Not often you spend some real coin and feel the value. I am a sauce guy and especially loved the care and attention to the accoutrements for each course. Every course was just right, and the flavors combined brilliantly. We even got a handful of amuse bouches in addition to the 15 scheduled ones along with a few complimentary glasses of wine and a dessert drink.Do this.We all will never forget this meal..........memorable and fun........and great!","[1.0, 0.0]"

My husband left his sunglasses in the car. When we arrived back home he noticed his sunglasses disappeared. We called the restaurant right after getting home and their response was that their employees are honest and would never do that. Well, they did and probably will do it again.

"I tried Xoco today with a group of friends from work and I could not be happier! We had heard about long lines so, planning ahead, we arrived around 11:30. Even so, we had about a 15 minute wait. They will not take an order until they have a table available for you, so the wait is up front. The upside is that you are not wandering around a crowded room looking for a place to eat the yummy sandwich heading towards you. They really handled the lines extraordinarily well. We ordered several orders of chips and guacamole and chips and salsa for the table. The red sauce is smokey and nicely spiced. The green salsa is milder but still tasty. Loved the guac! Chips were quite good too. My sandwich was the Ahogado. Pork carnitas, black beans and pickled onions of an amazing crunchy bread soaking in a bowl of tomato broth. Amazing! I am definitely going back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is fantastic. From the second we walked in we felt at home. Even though the place was quite full, the friendly host rushed around trying to get us a table and apologized prefusly for the five minute wait. They have a full wine bar, but we brought a bottle of our own and paid the $8 corkage which is totally reasonable considering they have a full bar. We ordered Massob-- so you get to pick a variety of dishes and they come on a communal sharing plate that everyone digs into with this doughy pita called injera--- I've had Ethiopian before but every time I forget which of these confusing names is my favorite. The waitress was so helpful! but what is more the menu outlines the options really well so you can get a feel for what is coming. The food itself was an intermingling of flavors. We got 1 lamb, 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 tipalia, and 2 veggie dishes. I cannot even tell you which was my favorite because they were all delicious and tasted both sweet and savory. I am the kinda eater that loves variety. This is my heaven, Next to sushi i cannot think of a more fun place to go out to eat.

"Superdawg is SO MUCH FUN. The only thing that could make this place cuter is if the carhops wore rollerskates! I am a huge fan of 50s Americana and anything vintage, and you will be able to get me really excited about places and things I normally only would see in movies. This place is just simply adorable in its vintage glory. Put on your poofiest petticoat, drive on down, ignore the surrounding Shell gas station and ginormous billboard above the parkinglot and imagine you are back in the old days. The burger was quite alright, but this place is really all about the dawgz. They are amazing! Crisp, juicy, slightly garlicky and plain perfection served with neon relish, onions and picalilly and hot peppers, on a poppyseed bun. The pickle and pickled tomato were refreshing and craveworthy! Fries were pretty alright, not the best by far but still yummy. I like how everything is served in cardboard containers, eventhough your food gets super smushed. It kindof adds to the charm. The shakes are advertised as extra thick, but ours came out kindof runny? This was a bit of a fail, but his vanilla shake and my chocolate malt were still tasty. Not in my top ten of favorite milkshakes, but not completely terrible either. I would pass on the cheeseburger and shakes, but get a couple of dawgz straight up. Good stuff!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This review is from an August 2008 visit. Icosium was a Roman city on which the modern city of Algiers now stands, thus the name. Thus the cuisine! We had CREPES. Very Mediterranean-style food with a French ""impact"", in the form of said crepes. The crepes themselves were almost tortilla-like in texture, and it was what was held inside them that was amazing. After briefly considering recreating the Punic Wars, we each picked our crepes. I picked the Crepe Marrakesh: Raisins, cream cheese, caramelized onions, toasted almonds, sun-dried tomatoes, homemade olive tapanade, fresh mint, and baby spinach. Now, this might sound more like the results of a restaurant kitchen sink or garbage can than an actual crepe, but I have to tell you: those ingredients? Were AMAZING together. I mean, every bite was just unbelievably flavorful and coordinated. One of my dinner companions and I had cream of mushroom soup, to which she said ""I now know what it tastes like when it's not made in a can."" Hee.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Servers are knowledgeable on any questions you have on menu items. My last server on Saturday knew I had a list of things I wanted and even though he didn't like my personal choice, he said if I have a taste for it to get it, which I did, and I wasn't disappointed at all.

"Was looking forward to trying Bin 36 for the first time. Even though the place was practically empty on a Saturday afternoon, our waitress couldn't seem to find the time to check on us or even smile. Other staff were just standing around talking while one sourpuss waitress handled 3 tables and avoided making eye contact with anyone, like it was a major inconvenience to have customers there at all. The food was acceptable, though not outstanding. It took ages to arrive. (Maybe the waitress was also doing the cooking?) Mussels were good, but came without any bread or accompaniment, and we all know that half the joy of eating mussels is soaking up the garlicky broth with a hunk of crusty bread. Wings were a tiny portion, so hope you aren't too hungry. The wines were fine, but with so little attention to providing information or presentation, it wasn't much different from ordering at any hotel bar. The bill was over $40 per person for 2 glasses of wine and a ""snack"". Not a great value. Certainly didn't make me want to stay and purchase anything in the shop. Maybe Saturday afternoon is not the time to come here. While I'd still be interested in trying the cheese bar, based on the extremely poor service, we'll probably never go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So, since the last time I've been there and my last review... (not to mention boycott of this joint,) I went this past weekend late Friday night. We walked in and were not greeted or anything! Again, is it because they don't want the business, or they don't care, or all the servers are too old or what? So I got annoyed and walked out for a bit til they cleared some tables. About 5 minutes later, we walk back in and are still not greeted. So this time tables are cleared off and so I just sat down at the first table I saw. I told my boyfriend, no way I'm waiting until they greet me standing up. To much of my surprise, they bring us table settings and some waters right away. I was actually surprised they didn't make us move to a smaller table since it was just us two. We ordered one order of the non-marinated short rib meat and one order of ribeye. The ribeye, I don't recommend much, because the proportions were really not worth it for $20. I was very happy they gave so many banchan or side dishes. I didn't have to ask for any lettuce or my favorite green onion sides and meat sauces. I also ordered the nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodle,) it came with a lot of pickled daikon and half a boiled egg, and a slice of pear. Mmmmmm could have used more slices of cucumber though. I'm just picky like that. The broth wasn't bad but not anything special. This is a tricky dish because not many places have good broth.  If anyone is reading this entire post... I gotta give you propz. So, I give them two more stars this time since the last time I would have preferred to give zero stars. I was satisfied with the food and prompt re-filling of water...

"The prix-fixe dinner was very good - there is no ala carte option. Enough choices to satisfy a range of diners. We were promptly seated and attended to. The room is intimate and attractive and quiet enough for conversation. My Ono fish was too salty, but everything else was solid. The Mint salad was very clever and tasty. Our server could not have been more attentive or helpful. She guided me expertly through the menu and I was quite satisfied. I did not see any mention of a wine pairing on the menu, but I may have missed it - our server offered it to us verbally. My dining companion and I sampled some of the wines and sadly in this area we were not impressed. The white wine was served much too cold which muted its taste to blandness and the reds were simply not on par with the excellence of the food. I truly enjoyed my dinner, but the restaurant needs to take the reins of the wine program and ratchet it up several notches to make the pairings worthy companions to the dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"i came here for a birthday dinner on either a friday or saturday night. anyway, it was super busy. service sucked but food was SO GOOD. my bf and i shared picada colombiana (skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, grilled chicken breast, chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantain, fried sweet plantain, yuca and potatoes). there was SO MUCH FOOD on that plate! this entree is definitely enough for two people to share. i fell in love with the green sauce they give you with your entree. i must've asked for 3 cups of it. the restaurant itself is super dim which gives it a romantic feel. plenty of street parking. there's also a colombian coffee shop across the street. i forgot what this place is called but their colombian coffee is super bold. just how i like it! oh and the guy gave me a free cup of coffee in exchange of a shot of jameson. how nice of him. :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It was an eating event that will be a great memory. I am glad we went and it perfect for a special birthday dinner. Glad I went with friends that are willing to trying new things. Highly recommend this place only for the open minded foodie! I loved the ceasar. Classic flavirs done in a fun delicious way. But the foie gras pop rock lollipops..well, a little to much fun and no substance. But we ordered it ! But I found most dishes to be too salty. Too much focus on the presentation, I mean I still have to eat it. But the wait staff was amazing and helpful. Our waitress, Sarah, was sharp direct and we would of ordered the menu if we hadn't had some constraint. But not much! Graham needs to know he has a great ali in her! She believes in that menu and was fun to go on the food adventure with her. Worth going but may not ever go back. But that is only because I live in NY.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There is always a seasonal pancake and waffle, but their standards are an egg sandwich and juevos rancheros (casserole style).

"I've been to Sapori Trattoria about a dozen times and have never been disappointed. In fact, I think it's incredibly underrated and often unknown to friends or townies who are looking for a place to eat.  There are two dining areas, one in the front of the restaurant where the bar is, and one larger room in back. Try to get a table in front near the window, especially if you are on a date. In the summer there is a very large area for tables on the side of the restaurant. The wine list has plenty of reasonable bottles, the pasta is homemade, and the desserts fantastic. The decor is also very cool - think loft style, dark, and candle-lit.  I'm not sure why this place doesn't get more love, perhaps because of its location on a fairly busy corner near Diversey/Halsted but I would encourage anyone who has their parents in or just wants to enjoy a cozy long dinner to forego the bigger name places in the city and go here instead. Your dinner-mates will love you forever. I've been to plenty of Italian restaurants in the city and Sapori is among the best.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I would have liked it soooo much better if it had same flavor + 6 more bites. I don't give a crap how good things taste.

Each of them was really tasty. If I remember correctly, we had the pepperoni, meat lovers, and vegeterian. Loved each of them! The only problem I had with their pizza is that their crust had a little too much cornmeal in it. So, it had a very distinct corn flavor to it. But, depsite that...I still love Gino's!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Wow...I had a fabulous meal again. We started off with soup....vegan chikin rice Oh My God! Our server hyped it so we went with it...they need to bottle this stuff or keep it on the menu everyday....I closed my eyes with a mouthful and it took me back......oh to be a kid again. It was simply fabulous. After the soup we dove right in to the mushroom appetizer...it was lightly breaded and dipped in the magic sauce made my mouth melt. OOOH that SSSauce! The entree was also mighty tasty..some rolled tortilla thing with killer salsa. The name of that one escapes me now but was a bit over the top. I wonder who writes the descriptions on their daily menus....its kind of queer...in a bad way. If its the chef..they should stay in the kitchen making that soup! Ok back to the food. The tortilla thing was really good flavor BUT it looked like hell.......they shouldn't try to be fancy food arrangers...they obviously don't have the talent....So after stuffing our faces we moved onto desert....it was ...almost out of the park but then desert. They make such great food why can't they find a way to make a cake that tastes fresh? The cake is so inconsistent. This one was at least flavorful but it just tastes old.....Please go back to the drawing board and make us a cake that will send us out on the street screaming....MORE!I do love you Chicago Diner..don't forget who you are.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of the things I was looking forward to at Hot Doug's was meeting Doug himself. He's funny, witty, and makes me want to see him again and again. I don't know why but I'm a little disappointed to know that Doug doesn't make his own sausages. I feel it would add so much authenticity to a place that already has a loyal following. That being said, the standard Chicago dog was delicious. I love how you have the option of how the dog will be cooked. Charred was the obvious choice. The rib-eye sausage with chimichurri and fried onions was a bit tough. The flavor wasn't what I was expecting either. I hate to admit it but I actually liked my original better and it was 1/4 the price. The duck fat fries were outstanding as well. Not the best I've had but they were perfectly salted and pleasantly crunchy. Would I be back? Maybe. If there wasn't a line I would definitely be back. I just wish the sausages were made in house. It would lure me back much faster.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We made a reservation for the last time slot of the night at 9:30 pm on a Friday. We understand that the restaurant closes at 10:30, but reservations should not be taken that late if service will decline at that time. The server was great, but the meat service was not. We never once had anyone come around with lamb, beef ribs, or shrimp. We requested shrimp on multiple occasions and never received it. I would have no problem in this decrease in service, if we were not spending over $150 per couple. That is a lot of money to spend to sit there and have to consistently ask for specific items that never come. We have always been a fan of Brazzaz but to be honest, after this visit, I will highly consider their neighbors Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have not written a negative review about a restaurant until now. The first time my husband and I tried 90 Mile, it was when it opened its Clybourn location. Just coming back from an amazing trip from Puerto Vallarta, where we experienced wonderful Cuban food, we were ecstatic to try 90 Mile when it first opened. The owner was so nice and made sure we enjoyed everything, answering any questions we had. He even knew of the restaurant we ate at in PVR. So, when he opened the second location on Armitage, we had to check it out. Same thing - we enjoyed it, especially since it expanded its offerings to full dinners, with dishes such as braised oxtail and whole red snapper. The last time we were here was over a year ago and we came back last Friday (5/6/11). It was clear that business was booming, as they expanded seating into what used to be the parking lot. However, the quality of service was the first thing we noticed that declined. We ordered two teas, two appetizers and two entrees. We received our teas, but waited at least 30 minutes for the appetizers showed. The table next to us, who arrived after we got there, received both appetizers and entrees before we received our appetizers. The server rarely checked in, and only did to apologize after over 40 minutes. The hostess came over to apologize and said dessert was on the house, which we had no say in the selection. We felt that the quality of the meat was such low grade that there was gritty fat. At that point, we lost interest in finishing the meal and just wanted to leave. With many good restaurants such as Belly Shack nearby and XOCO in River North, the price we paid for this meal was not reflective of the product. Needless to say, we won't be returning. It is unfortunate because I really like this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago and every friend that I have recommended it to has agreed. My first time was 3 years ago when a couple college friends who came visited Chicago made reservations to meet up with my wife and me because they had heard Vince V. and Jennifer A. had recently dined there. I've gone 2 times since and each time is equally impressive. I recommend the spicy spaghetti dish with seafood. I've tried their other dishes and they're great too. They have a decent selection of wine and local beers and above average dessert. The decor is respectable and service has always been superb, even with a party of 12. Reservations are a highly recommended. Mia Francesca is a fun and consistent place whether on a date or a group of friends with great Italian cuisine. ***** FIVE STARS","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was in Chicago on business and found this restaurant on Yelp. The reviews led me to it and I can say that even the best of reviews did not do this olace justice. Never have I been to a restaurant where everything we tried was just as good if not better than the previous dish. My coworkers raved about how phenomenal their rabbit salad and venison dishes were. My mussels were amazing with a delightful yet not overpowering curry broth. Dessert was an absolute treat, the Greek yogurt custard melted in your mouth and the honey on the baklava was fantastic. And not only was the food amazing, but the service was absolutely grand. Our waiter was knowledgable and polite. The house manager was equally great.

"Pros: -BYOB, no corkage fee -Banana spring roll dessert was good -Chicken satay appetizer was good -Waitress was sweet Cons: -Host was a bit of a diva -Not much meat in the entrees -Not the most flavorful dish I've ever had (Sauteed veggies with chicken) -Having to stand close to diners' tables while waiting to be seated was a bit awkward What I liked - which may not be good news to some people - is that they really know how to spice things up. I ordered my entree MEDIUM thinking that I would just add chili paste to my liking. However, they packed on the heat. My mouth was burning. I liked that aspect, but other than that, the food didn't have much other flavor. The prices weren't over the top but not as good of a deal as Sticky Rice. I'm glad I tried a different place other than Sticky Rice, only because it confirmed just how much I like Sticky. I would recommend this place for the appetizers or dessert. I probably would not venture over there again. It was just mediocre.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cheesecake factory on a bigger scale. According to our server they are owned by the cheesecake factory, hence similarities in decor and menu items. Large servings which I actually wish wasn't the case especially with the desserts because I feel like you end up wasting so much food. We decided to go just for desserts and coffee as it was near our hotel and open later. We got the rustic apple pie and beignets. Be prepared to share with more than one other person as there is no way one could finish let alone after eating a meal on top of that. The beignets were yummy as others have said, thats actually why I decided to try them. The sauces were a nice option but not necessary. Those who tried the apple pie said it was delicious but again too much to finish between 2 people. We only finished about half the beignets as well (came with 6 or 7 I believe). I also had the honey vanilla latte (nonfat) which was nice but a little too sweet for me, I couldn't even finish it but I'm also not used to having that much sweets. Overall service was fine but it was rather noisy where we were seated (for some odd reason they thought it was a great idea to seat us near a large and very loud group even though it was late and the place was half empty). After requesting they did move us but that should be common sense to begin with. Desserts like the ones we ordered take 30min so be aware if you arent eating a full meal, we knew ahead of time so had no problem waiting. Overall was ok but not necessarily something I would do again as its a very generic place and I'm sure there are much better alternatives.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I first came to Zed 451 shortly after it had opened on a date. I loved the food then and I continue to love the food and service.What I particularly want to comment on is my experience of having my wedding and reception there. My husband and I were consistently impressed and happy to find that not only did Zed have wonderful food to serve our guests and a gorgeous event room for the wedding and reception to take place in, but also provided wonderful and thoughtful service. We felt like Sammy, the event coordinator, viewed our special day as being important to her and the staff. I can't say how much it meant to us to feel that the people we were working with cared that the event went off smoothly and nicely. Everyone at the wedding raved about the food, of course. The pricing for using the room for our event was more than fair and likely one of the best deals one can find in downtown Chicago for an event. We had a smaller wedding (about 50 people) and the space was perfect for this size, although it could fit more. I'm glad we can look back at our wedding and have such great memories about the people who helped us pull it off! I know a lot of people don't feel that way. Today was our one month anniversary and we went to Zed's for brunch. Imagine our surprise to have a couple of the staff recognize us and congratulate us. This further drove home our impression that the staff at Zed's cared about our special day and our business. Most people know the food is good at this restaurant, but to have amazing service on top of that, particularly around an event, is quite an accomplishment.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My husband and I have been here multiple times for dinner and have always been pleased. The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in romantic dinner etiquette (they keep an eye on us but never interrupt our conversation or rush us). In fact, the first time we ate here our waiter brought us our wine and then pointed out that a cozy booth had opened up and offered to re-seat us in the corner. For a restaurant to give up a 6 person booth to a table for 2 on a crowded Saturday night, that let me know that we were being treated like family even though it was our first visit. In fact, after having such good dining experiences, we recently held our wedding reception in their 2nd floor private banquet room. The decor may be a tad dated, but a month later our guests are not critiquing the room but rather they're still raving about the how good the food was (guests choose from an abbreviated menu) and how many courses we had (6, I think)! The staff was incredibly helpful. Enzo and Angelo both fielded with grace many frantic calls from this bride, and their laid back attitude about everything reminded me that the entire affair would be both personalized and problem-free. Our party lasted long into the night--probably even longer than they wanted us to stay :) (I was there with the groom for over 9 hours...and the bar was still open when we left)--but we had the best time and I would suggest their services and dining to anyone looking for fantastic Italian food and hospitality!

"Preppy, power-lunch and after-work location. I feel under-dressed in business casual. It gets loud after work. Food is expensive. But the food is very good and sometimes that's the atmosphere you want. It's on Michigan Ave across from the Art Institute.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm a steak snob. And to be honest, this is probably the worst steak I've had so far in Chicago- but I still give it 3 stars. I've had better at David Burke's and Gibson's, and honestly the best steak I've had here was at Keefer's. So you can see the scale I'm using for comparison. I went there last night which was a Monday. I tried to get a reservation, but they were booked so I called and got a table in the lounge area. I wasn't that pleased with that location as I wanted to do some work while I was eating but I took it. It was ok, there's a piano player who sings and the music can be quite loud at times. The ambiance is pretty typical of a true steakhouse- lack of light and packed full of people. I started with the lobster bisque which really surprised me, it was really good. I would have preferred it a bit thicker, but it was really nice. My steak was definitely the disappointment of the meal. I ordered the 12oz filet. It was big and it was cooked well but somehow it was just bland and lacking flavor. There really wasn't much of a sear on it and I prefer to taste a bit more of the grill and seasoning if you catch my drift. The lobster mash potatoes were ok. Apparently this is a signature dish there but it was a little too rich for me. I shared the berries plate (which is huge, definitely for 2-3 people to share) and it was fantastic. I'm not opposed to eating here again, but I would probably suggest another steakhouse first.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My second visit to Hopleaf was a difference experience than my first (although my wife isn't convinced enough to give it a second chance, calling it snobbish, pretentious, expensive and with a lackluster menu and quality to match.) Where on the first visit, the waitress was unhelpful and intimidating enough to allow me to screw up my beer order, the waitress on this visit was friendly and perfectly willing not to condescend when I asked her to describe the taste of mussels and very quick to offer suggestions on the pairing of a Belgian beer with them.As recent convert to a limited selection of seafood, eating mussels seemed like a long shot. But they were delicious, served in a white wine sauce with vegetables. And the Tripel (don't ask me what it was; I can't find it in the million-page beer list that I downloaded prior to the visit and studied assiduously) the server brought me was the perfect complement. And the mussels are served with fries with a nice garlic dip.For my entree, I had the brisket which had a wonderful smokiness to it (far better than the greasy yuck they serve at Smoque) with a great mustard sauce accompanying it. My friend had the duck reuben which he liked a lot. For dessert, we had the apple fritters, which were salty but tasty. My friend thought there could've been a couple of additional dipping sauces rather than the caramel one we had but having only one was okay by me.The kicker: for my second beer of the evening, I asked our waitress if they carried the Left Hand Milk Stout. (See my comments in DMK Burger Bar.) She said they did; but when she returned, she said they didn't carry it and had brought me a Falson's Lasko Milk Stout instead and since I hadn't ordered it she wasn't going to charge me for it. (It also wasn't as good as the Left Hand, but free's free.) That was something the waitress on my first visit would have cut her left hand off before doing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Read about Crisp on the Reader and tried it last night. Happy to say that it was delicious! Plus Korean chicken joint right in my neighborhood? Even better. Ordered Crsip BBQ chicken, and Seoul Sassy chicken, the spinach salad and one of the 'buds'. Their names of the dishes are kind of confusing, like... what the hell is 'buds'?! (They're dumplings). Not really sure where they got ideas to name their dishes, but non the less everything we ordered was good. Crisp BBQ chicken is spicy and sweet. Probably closest to a typical Korean flavor, the sauce has 'go-chu-jang' which is the korean spicy sauce. I think the sauce was made with go-chu-jang and honey. Seoul Sassy was very sweet. Think of any teriyaki flavored chicken wings you've had in the past. I wouldn't recommend ordering a whole chicken of one flavor. Go half and try a couple different flavors. The best part, however, is the skin! My god is it crispy. I was biting off every possible little piece of skin attached to the bone. None of the grease, and all of crispiness. The Buds are good as well, definitely one of the better dumplings out there. The sauce that comes with is slightly sweet and different. Salad was... eh. okay. they cook the mushroom a bit with sesame oil so that adds a nice aroma and flavor. Korean style fried chicken, when done right, is the best thing ever. It's never fatty, super crispy, and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, Crisp isn't it. For those who are familiar with Korean style chicken, you won't get it at Crisp. BUT Crisp is definitely good, so it's worth a try. Bottom line, their chicken reminded me of Harold's, if Harold's was sauced. That's a good thing.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Sadly I was not impressed. I had a single 14 inch pizza delivered to my apartment on a Saturday night. When I placed my order I was told it would take 45 minutes to arrive. I thought that was a bit ambitious, so I waited 90 minutes before calling to check the status of my order. I was told, rather rudely, that my pizza was still in route and would arrive ""soon."" Soon turned out to be two hours after I placed my order and COLD. Honestly, if I wanted to heat up a pizza in the oven I would have simply bought one at the grocery store. Decent pizza, but not worth the trouble.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Best Thai in the city. Okay... sure, there may be better but when you factor the very low prices into the mix, nothing beats this.  My 4 stars is based on the taste of the food. There are many things wrong with this place, but the food is awesome!  While I like Arun's, I think you can have a meal that approaches Arun's taste (though service and ambience at Opart isn't great) at a fraction of the cost. 1 person's cost at Arun's easily feeds 4 here. My only two gripes about this place are that the spice level is inconsistent. Hot on Tuesday may not the same as hot on another day.  The other gripe is that the kitchen doesn't know how to flow the food out to you. Your entree will come out minutes after the appetizers.  Still, this place is fantastic.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"At a friend's suggestion, and after reading the reviews here, I couldn't wait to try Meli Cafe. I can't recall the last time I regretted going to a dining establishment as much. Let me preface this review with saying the food was decent. However, the HORRIBLY RUDE service overshadowed anything that could have made this morning's experience worth a return visit. After waiting 30 minutes to be seated, my friend and I were immediately asked by our waitress if we were ready to order. We asked for coffee but neither of us had even had a chance to open our menus yet. We asked for a few minutes. Our waitress came back within a minute. We were still looking over the menu and we asked for another few minutes. Within another minute, maybe three minutes total since we were initially seated, the waitress returned for the third time. Annoyed, at this point, I politely told our waitress that we were in no hurry. I understand that business is busy on a Sunday morning at Meli, but that's no excuse to rush us to the point we can't appreciate the experience.My friend and I each ordered an omelette and asked for a third order of crepes. We asked that the crepes be brought out later. Everything came at once. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she said she misunderstood and just walked away. Unacceptable, but we let it go. One of the busboys came by to clear our plates as we were still eating. Again, unacceptable. After paying the bill, we stuck around to finish the coffee we already had in our cups. The waitress came by, and without saying anything, began clearing the table and removed our waters!That was it. I never complain about service at restaurants but this was strike 10. On the way out, I spoke with the manager about the service, within earshot of all those waiting in line. He had no problem telling us (and those in line) that on weekends they expect customers to get in and get out. He cared nothing about treating customers to a good experience. Surprised at his response, I said I'll go elsewhere for breakfast next time and he encouraged it. There are too many great places in Chicago that appreciate my business to give this place a second chance.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Shhh...don't tell, but my honey is a picky eater. And not a foodie. And unlike me, who ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" over food, my honey is real quiet and gives a simple ""it was fine"" to most food. Which is why when the honey raves about dinner, I pay attention. And the honey raved about the Chilean Sea Bass at Sapori Trattoria. Happy honey = happy me. As for me, this was my second trip. And I've been impressed both times. I had the pumpkin ravioli and it was amazing the first time, a little more doughy last night. But still pretty good. I'm not convinced I'd go back just for that again based on last night's dinner. The insalate stella (i think that's the name--the one with apples and pine nuts) was delicious and I could eat that all day long, and never grow tired of it. About the incidentals: The summer outdoor seating is lovely and it had all the trappings for a good date restaurant. Our waiter was charming and the support staff was helpful with the refills of water and bread. I was a little disappointed with the reservation system--I had made reservations and while we were seated quickly, other walk-ins who came in at the same time that we did were seated before us. And they seemed a little confused by their own seating system. Not enough to keep me away, but a bit annoying none the less. Overall, a very start to date night with the honey.

"Came here for brunch with 3 other ladies, reserving about 1 month ahead (just in case). We ordered the following drinks: Rumaki Fizz - pretty strong bacon flavor, a little too savory for a brunch drink for me, though my friend who ordered it really liked it Curious Jorge - the bruleed banana was fabulous, and the drink looked really tasty though I didn't try it Afternoon delight - also pretty strongly flavored, nice to try (I only had a sip) but definitely an acquired taste Bugeymosa - variation on a mimosa, very light and fizzy.. yumm! Now for the food: Sturgeon Lox Platter - I didn't try it, but it looked pretty good from where I was plus it was visually interesting. Lingonberry French Toast - yum! really tasty, pretty big portion Rhubarb Waffle - a bit soggy, but I liked the tartness of the rhubarb with the strawberry, goat cheese, and almond flavors.. a very nice combination Skirt Steak & Eggs - perfectly done steak, really nice crab batter, definitely a wonderful flavor combination with the greens on the plate. The addition of the egg was delightful. Recommend. We also ordered the Lithuanian bacon buns, brioche, and pork belly sides. The brioche came with chocolate butter and lemon curd (amazing). The pork belly portion was small but tasty. The bacon buns were reminiscent of BBQ buns you find at dim sum restaurants, but pretty good nonetheless. Our waitress was pretty sassy, which was kinda fun at first but got a little grating (like when I asked her to separate the alcohol, she was almost rolling her eyes..). So, definitely a miss on that point. But other than that, perfect foodie brunch!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Get in line at about 11:10 and watch as the oppressive sun flies over and precipitates beads of sweat formulating on my brow. Backed up by nearly 75 people, I am not even in the alley - the line is that long. The sidewalk is torn, shattered from the millions of people who have stood in my place and slowly shuffled along to get reach encased meat nirvana. An ice cream truck parked near the alley, no childrens' song blaring and no bells ringing. We go up and order ice cream to escape the oppression. Helping myself to a pre-Hot Doug's meat session, I hit up an Oreo ice cream bar and pay the man $2.00. In minutes, the ice cream was gone and I flipped open a locked garbage bin and chucked the remnants in. As we crawled through the line the anticipation for entering the Garden of Eden of encased meats heightened as I looked inside the window, saw people trying to slowly shuffle in and dominate some sausages! A foolish neophyte attempted to stroll in to grab himself a menu, but his application was denied! We crept past one door, and then were behind the air conditioned door, waiting for the gap in the line to form so we could bum rush it! And yes, it was to be - one hour of waiting had paid off! My friends all ordered before me, I then discovered that the Hotdougs on Twitter was not Doug, and he said that is how far his celebrity now went that there were impersonators on Twitter! Regardless of this fact, I ordered grilled Elk sausage with Honker's Ale mustard, with two cheeses, a Keira Knightley spicy dog, duck fat fries and a large drink. Yep, I really spent over $17 on this trip, but I do not care - for encased meat nirvana, I'd do anything! We hauled out one by one and headed to the river nearby to sit by the bank and watch barrels pass by on this blazing afternoon day. My friend had one bite of his veggie dog and was gagging. He declared and then I affirmed that Doug had messed up, Doug had ripped my friend off! Not so fast! I then took a bite out of his disputed veggie dog and declared that it was not meat, that the muscle fibers were not there to break down and that my friend himself had just bitten into the world's greatest veggie dog!!!!!!!!!!! I then unwrapped a white package that said ELK and started to go to town on encased elk meat. The flavors from the elk, the mustard, the two layers of cheese affirmed that Doug is the all-time master of bundling random game and making it a dog from the gods. Whatever so Doug shalt wrap, thou shalt be satisfied. The Knightley was spicy and the duck fries with cheese did not soggy up. That my friends, is an hour well spent.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Obviously this is a date place. Don't even think about coming here unless you're with someone special (and looking to impress). That said, however, some of their tables place you very far apart from your companion, which blunts the romantic edge a bit. I have no idea how some people can possibly get a cheese, meat/vegetable, and chocolate fondue in the same sitting. What I usually get is the cheese/chocolate fondue for two (which comes with a salad to start), and we split a cheese plate. This is a f*ckton of food, and I am always stuffed. The salad is not memorable. The cheese fondue, on the other hand, is delicious. Purists may note that the ingredient mix is a bit different from what they enjoyed in Neuchatel (Geja's has a garlicky-peppery baseline to the gruyere and kirsch waltz) though I highly enjoy it. You dip in it various types of bread and fruit. The pumpernickel works especially well here. Be sure to make up some sort of game to play when one of you loses your morsel in the cheese ocean. The cheese plate is a good bargain (I don't remember what it costs but it is a very large portion of cheese), though some of their cheeses are better than others. Ask your server for the best stuff (ie the raw milk stuff). The chocolate fondue, is of course, delicious. Dark and cocoa-ey, not too sweet, and with the perfect dipping ingredients. Yes, you get to roast your own marshmallows, but you also get bananas, strawberries, angel cake, pineapple, and much more. So a dinner for two like the above, with a bottle of wine, could be done for under $100 w/ tax and tip (I think the food, tax, and tip alone would be around 70, so enjoy the wine!) A good deal considering the quality and quantity of food you get, plus that atmosphere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"High-end and BBQ are not two things you normally put together, but q has brought it to Chicago and demonstrated how to do it well. The dark wood tables and off-white painted walls make you feel like you're almost in an old Southern mansion, except more updated with the enlarged photograph of a country road which brings contemporary flair. The staff wear plaid long sleeve shirts which balances the semi-formal ambiance to keep it relaxed. I don't think you can go wrong on the menu - all the meats are good. We had the St. Louis ribs which are prepared with a dry rub and then you have the option of slathering them at the table with one of three sauces: mild, vineagar-based, and spicy. Some may be a bit disappointed that the sauce is not basted on during the cooking, but to keep things simple and play to different palettes I assume q's approach is the best compromise. The mac n' cheese side is absolutely wonderful - fresh cheese, light breaded crust on top - one of the best I've ever had. They also make their own potato chips and cucumber pickles to get you started off. If you can, save room for the classic american desserts and pies which are so tasty you'll want to keep eating even if your full from your slab of ribs.

"Lucky me, my girl took me to a fancy place.  First of all the service was positively kind. The first time we showed up was on a busy Friday night, and we tried to weasel our way into an outdoor seat. They were really nice about it, and did their best to accommodate us. When we told them we couldn't wait 45 minutes, they they told us in a sincere manner that they hoped we'd come back another time. So we did, this time with a reservation. Service was immediate, friendly, and unobtrusive. When it started to rain, and we apologetically asked if we could move from our table for two to a table with an umbrella -- even though the umbrella-table seated four -- they cheerfully told us that we could do it, no problem. When it came time to explain the menu, the waitress was highly knowledgeable -- without a trace of condescension or pretension. This was important for me, as I know next to nothing about wine in general or Spanish food in particular. When the waitress asked what I would like to drink, I started with lemonade, which turned out to be a good choice as the light lemonade she brought out went really well with the food. I asked her to choose my wine, and told her that all I know about wine is that I like Sangiovese. She brought me a perfect Tempranillo. When I told her how much I liked it, she was genuinely overjoyed -- and wrote down the name of the bottle for me.  I also should point out that the food came out McDonald's-quick. (That's a compliment!) We started with escalivada, which is plate of different cooked vegetables. While all of it was good, the onion was scrumptious. I really would have liked a whole plate of onions like that.  Then came the rabbit ravioli, which I wasn't that excited about because I don't know about eating... foam. But my girlfriend really liked it. We then had the morel mushroom rice, which was like a mushroom-asparagus risotto. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. They used some kind of top-quality Spanish olive oil that created an extra layer of flavor between the vegetables. My girlfriend said it was so good that she could eat another plate of it -- more on that later. The next dish was the only one that neither of us liked -- the patatas bravas, which are non-greasy tater tots with some kind of aioli that coats your tongue. As our next dish came out, they brought us another plate of the delicious morel/asparagus rice. When we pointed out that we had already had ours, and that it probably belonged to someone else, the guy said ""Uh, okay,"" shrugged and said ""it's a compliment."" My sweetie got her wish - more of her favorite dish! The last two dishes were OFF THE CHAIN they were so good -- tender, sweet lobster in creamed corn and... A hearty, non-tapas-like bowl of fava beans, lima beans and serrano ham with some kind of Spanish cheese that made it pop! I could eat this ham-and-beans dish every day!

"I have to completely rewrite my earlier glowing review to revise how I feel about Grand Lux Cafe. After a few spotty experiences, I can't recommend this restaurant because attention to detail--having clean tableware, clean dishware and not finding food crumbs mixed in with the sugar/sweetener dispensers, etc.--is important to me. The food, which is fine for a tourist chain, is overshadowed by inconsistent service (almost every time I visit, there's a significant lag time between when we're seated and when a waiter actually visits the table. This is one of those places that wants you to look over the menu first for ten minutes, that way the server doesn't have to explain so much of it when they finally arrive. Another thing: I realize Grand Lux is maximizing their economics, but WHY is there a constant wait, even when the place isn't busy!? I mean, every time I walk into the restaurant, I am forced to wait 5 minutes or more. Part of the graciousness of dining in such a nice place SHOULD be the flow of ""hello, party of two?

I ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer with mashed plantains. Even with a healthy appetite, I found these two appetizers adequate as a meal.

Also surprised at the portion. Spicy Tako - Was ok.  Tasted more like imitation crab to me than octopus. Server recommended not using soy sauce but I needed it. Lobster and Wagyu Roll - FABULOUS!  My favorite roll of the evening. Server recommended not using soy sauce and was perfect without it. Scorpion Roll - Good. Had better soft shell crab rolls. Cocktail menu sounded great but tasted ok to me. Felt like the drinks could have been stronger.  Ordered the Go Go Berry and Mai Tai.  Nice presentation though. I would give 5 stars but the service was terrible.  I thought service would be great because we were approached by a server to welcome us and take our water preference before we got to take our coats off.  Turns out we had a different server and he took forever to come take our drink order, bring our drinks, take our dinner order and never once did he come to check on us.  He only came over to us because my friend would make eye contact with him when he was across the room.  I also asked for his recommendations for a cocktail and his response was pretty much that anything was good...at least tell me your favorite or what other people tend to get.  Our water glasses also were not filled up throughout our dinner, which is usually a sign of the quality of service. I am going again in a few weeks to try the entrees. Hope the entrees are just as delicious as the sushi and that the service will be better.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I LOVE LAVILLA! Everything about this place is to die for. The food is authentic Italian and if anyone doesn't like it then they must not know what real Italian food should taste like. I've been going here since I was baby and it is the only place I can actually think of that has the total package. The owners are sweethearts and are always there to satisfy everyone. No matter what I have ordered from the menu I have been pleased. Famous for their pizza (which is awesome) I like the baked mostoccioli. Whether I get it delivered, which is fast and prompt, or go there and eat in their dining room, I am always pleased. Also their banquet hall is very classy and can be used for any type of occasion. As good as it gets, best italian food!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Really love their thin crust pizza and the award winning beer. Staff was very nice and helpful. Atmosphere is a lot of fun as well. Made it in for lunch and my son and I were the only ones in there for 30 minutes. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Okay, first off, I do not know how this place doesn't have five stars. People saying the portions were too small.. it's TAPAS. Know your food. And the price was well worth it for the flavors.. okay, now to my review:Yesterday my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place because we needed something to eat while we waited for someone in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge to be done. We were trying to choose between tapas and sushi, and boy am I so glad we chose tapas. When we entered, after walking up the stairs, we were astounded with the interior of the restaurant. With it's high ceilings, unique lighting and modern decor, I was already happy with our choice.As for what we ordered, the only thing I wasn't 100% happy with was the Red Sangria, mainly because I figured it would be sweet like it usually is, but I've noticed that city drinks are just stronger. I later tried the (and yes, I'm just copy and pasting the names from the menu online) CHARRED PINEAPPLE MOJITO, which was fantastic. It was almost like a pineapple version of a Mike's Hard, haha. But it satisfied my sweet craving.For food, we ordered:TRUITA DE PATATA which was just what I had been craving. I would definitely order this again. The flavors were fantastic!PULPO CON PATATAS which was great! I had never had octopus before so I have nothing to compare it to, but flavor was very unique and the meat was very tender. GUATLA ANEC UVAS Y POLENTA which was quite delicious! The roasted grape glaze on the quail was to die for. But my favorite thing on this plate had to be the goat cheese polenta croquettes. That cheese was to die for! I definitely want to sample their cheeses next time. TOCINO CON CIDRA which was the best thing out of the entire meal. It was to die for! If you're looking for something fantastic, get this! Combining all the ingredients on the plate has got to be one of the best flavors I've ever experienced.For dessert we ordered:CREMACATALANA which has the be one of the best desserts I've ever had! That sweet potato ice cream is amazing! And the combination with the bavarois... YUM!PASTISSOSD'AVELLANA which I didn't care too much for, but that's because I didn't want it in the first place. My boyfriend really enjoyed it though if that's your cup of tea! c:And to top it off, our server was amazing. She was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu and she was of great help when it came to deciding on what we wanted and selling us more food/drinks. I wish I remembered her name though. Overall, this meal, service, and ambiance was fantastic! Never you mind the long walk to the bathroom, it's well worth it! I definitely would like to come back here again soon and try new things.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"YUMMY!!! The atmosphere is a little weird but cool. Our waitress was very nice. She greeted us and asked us which table we wanted to sit at. lol. We sat down and they brought us water with a piece of mint in it. I thought that was cool. I normally see lime in water but this was new. So the waitress didn't come to our table for a few minutes but I think she was the only waitress there at the moment. She finally came over and we ordered. I got the strawberry crepe with nutella and some coffee. The crepe apparently came with a scoop of ice cream. Mmm. The crepes came out pretty quick. Oh wow. It was so good. The strawberries were fresh and sweet. The cream was fresh too. It also had the perfect amount of chocolate. Not too much but enough. I totally finished that in like three minutes. LOL!!! SO GOOD!! I definitely recommend this place. If you want a giant serving thats going to fill you until you explode then this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for a nice, chill place with great tasting crepes then check this place out. It wasn't too pricey either. 15 bucks for two big crepes and two coffees. ::drools::","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A group of friends and I went here for my birthday dinner on a Sunday evening. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to get reservations just a few days ahead of time since I had heard how good Chicago q was. And it was GOOD. Those comp chips and pickles are no joke. We ate them all and and could have gone through another bowl of each. The chips had an awesome BBQ spice on them, and the pickles were spicy, sweet, and so delicious. I could sit at the bar with a drink and just munch on those and be a happy camper. We got the hush puppies for an appetizer, and they were awesome. Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, and the chipotle mayo dipping sauce had one hell of a kick, but it was really good when used in moderation. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich, which is crazy huge. You will NOT go home hungry, that's for sure. It was served on a giant pretzel roll and a huge chunk of delicious cornbread. And the pork is served plain so that you can sample all 4 of the awesome sauces they bring out. The honey mustard and traditional BBQ were my favorites. They were kind enough to bring a plate of cookies with a candle and cold glass of milk since it was my birthday too. The chocolate chunk cookie was really, really good :) Also, our waiter was great. Service is definitely a priority of this place. Overall, a really good meal! I'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

First off Kudos to Josh the host. We had made reservations for 7 but there was a possibility of it only being 5 maybe 6. Josh went ahead and gave us a 6 top which we ended up needing. The place was packed at 7 on a sautrday night so it was loud inside and I will have to go back to sit out in the patio area b/c it looked so nice out there. Bacon wrapped dates so tender and not overly salty like I have had before.The Ropa something or other was good but I should have gone with something a little more flavorful.Everyone at the table said there food was good and the baked goat cheese was very popular. Our server was a little lacking she didn't even introduce her self and the expo/ bus team was seen more than her.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I remember when Wilde opened in Lakeview close to 2 years ago with lots of pomp and fanfare. I recall the stories of people being excited about the place, but sorely disappointed about how Wilde just didn't know what it wanted to be. That probably prevented me from coming here even though it's in close proximity. I ended here on the eve of one of the last days of 2009 and I'm glad I finally graced their halls. I could see how people may be frustrated with Wilde's identity crisis, but it made me love the place more - 2 bars complete with barstools? Check. Booth seating? Check. Fireplace? Check! Little tables with easy chairs? Check! Wilde aims to be a jack of all trades, and who couldn't love that how it welcomes any and all. My party of three had the mac and cheese (yummy! Loved the crunchy topping), curry chips (Which were really fries, not chips and Omg! Best I've ever had, and I've had alot!), a beet salad (wonderful!), and the Arugula and grape tomato salad sans egg (Loved it!). We wanted to top off our dinner with the Oscar and Bosie's Blackberry Storm - it came with Honey Lavender Ice cream (so yummy!!!!!!!!), but they were out. (sad face). But we settled for the apple crumble, which really wasn't settling since it was great! I really like this place, it has a down home, relaxing feel. And I'm still thinking about those curry fries!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"WORST KOREAN RESTAURANT EVER. WORSE than Seoul garden and same level as jangchoongdong.Here are the foods i ordered today Food : 0 - half stars. Spicy chicken - has no flavor to it . Tagui gamjatang (beef/potato soup) - taste like some kid scooped one teaspood of chilli pepper sauce in to the water . Gulbi (fish) - so soooo big but has nothing to eat- seafood pancake : 3stars - it was crispy and had some seafoods but the sauce was too salty i ended up not eating them but not bad!Side dish: 1starsso many yelp reviewers were stunned by so many side dishes.i went there today at 11. Seaweeds were dried, looked like fries Yes, There are many but how many side dishes do you ask those ladies to bring more? none. I asked for pickled sliced radish because my chicken had no flavor and i had to eat with it. Service: 1-2 starsI went there with my korean friends and my brother.Maybe because they were korean, they tried to talk little more.When i went there all by myself (they were parking - parking lots are small and was crowded) They threw the menues on the table and said ""here""WTH? WHAT THE HELL . So rudebut when my friends walked in and spoke korean at least they showed little respect.people there seemed like they were used to the atmosphere. Atmosphere : 1starsSticky, foggy, smelly.. wow. tables were sticky... do they even clean the table?? wow.. - I felt bad for asians there. Hey people. Korean foods aren't like this.San soo gap san is just one of the kind. Other restaurants are clean, neat, full of nice korean ladies (can't really speak eng) but try to tell them whats good and what to skip. PLEASE don't be upset but try to understand ladies there working. They are working in a sucha bad environment where they might go thru a lot of stress and pain walking back and forth that they had to ""THROW"" the menu.I don't recommend this place.

"BEST. MEAL. EVER. We made reservations 3 months ago. I saw how much it was going to cost, and it was going to be more than any meal I had ever eaten in my life. And I had heard amazing things from everyone who had been here before me. My expectations could NOT have been higher, and I'm VERY happy to say that I walked out even more satisfied than I could have imagined. Every dish was imaginative and creative, all featuring different ingredients -- very few of the components of the 20 dishes were repeats -- and a wide variety of preparations. Many of the dishes had a whimsical feel to them, and the food runners all had a light sense of humor that kept the meal from being too stuffy, which you would expect from a place this fancy (JACKETS REQUIRED!!). Only our sommelier was a bit too serious, but I guess that was understandable. As an example of the whimsy, there was a big pumpkin sitting at our table when we got there. When we were ready to start our meal, it looked like the waiter was taking the pumpkin off the table to make room for food, but when he lifted the pumpkin, there were four little squares of the most delicious pumpkin cake that I had ever had, with a bit of Thai chili for kick -- great way to start off our meal. That was followed my more and more delicious dishes, and there wasn't a clunker in the whole menu of 20 dishes! My favorites were a razor clam appetizer with XO sauce, the mushrooms with red wine sauce (probably the best mushrooms I've ever had), a Sicilian ""swordfish wheel,"" and the famous ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato"" and black truffle explosion. Some dishes were small, some were larger, but the meal had so many of the best bites of food I've ever eaten before. The meal ended as uniquely as it started. The waiters came out and put a fancy, rubbery tablecloth on our wood table. Then, two chefs came out with two coconut-sized spheres (made of chocolate) and steaming, halloween-like steins (filled with liquid nitrogen). The two chefs poured the liquid nitrogen into the balls, and then followed that by covering the table with some mind-blowing fall-themed sauces -- a lingonberry sauce, a butternut squash syrup, and stout (or porter) reduction. The chefs then picked up the balls and dropped them on the table, chocolate bits and random stuff inside the balls flying everywhere on the table. It was like a frozen pinata, full of little treats like frozen french toast squares, nutmeg cotton candy, meringues, frozen cream cheese bits, and some other interesting, delicious bites that we dipped in all of the sauces. We ate it all right off the table, mostly with our hands.  The meal took four and a half hours, but felt perfectly paced with impeccable service. We got the menus at the end, but I've debated many times whether I liked seeing the menu at the end, or whether I would've liked to have known what was coming. We had heard that there were 24 courses so we kept counting them, and didn't really know how many more savory dishes were coming before desserts.  Only two drawbacks on the night: (1) they don't have a full bar, so you can't have a cocktail before or during your meal, especially considering all of the amazing cocktails I've heard are served at Aviary; and (2) the wine pairing was a ridiculous $260 per person, which was even more than the meal. While I love wine, I can't justify paying that much for a wine pairing, especially when the meal is already expensive. We did, however, enjoy two delicious bottles of red wine that the sommelier helped us pick out. I cannot recommend Alinea highly enough for a once-in-a-lifetime meal and overall experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is worth the wait. Where else would you want to be on a warm summer night than the patio of Irazu, sampling delicious Costa Rican food and drinking your BYOB wine!? We had 7 in our group, so the wait was just under an hour because the patio is so popular. But once we got seated, the service was excellent (Thank you, Chris!) and we never felt rushed. The entrees are generous, so our group shared several dishes. I'd recommend the steak Casada and the vegetarian burrito. The vegetables are grilled to perfection. And don't pass up the Costa Rican-style rice. It's to die for....

If they get better waitresses in the lounge area or if there's an open seat at the bar and actually put booze in their drinks I'd go back. Also, I hear their rooftop's pretty cool, in the summer. Maybe I'll just bring a flask with me and order pops while sipping out of my flask during the 20-min. it'll take for the waitress to bring me my drink.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let's see, where to begin...I made reservations a month in advance for some friends visiting from Boston - old friends. This place was recommended by two good friends, one who works at a restaurant and one who has even helped the chefs prep. Highest recommendations - allegedly a great time.I was contacted yesterday to confirm my reservation. Today I was contacted again to confirm my reservation (by the same person - Seth) which is kind of retarded considering I specifically confirmed my reservation the day before over the phone. At 5pm I received an obsequious call - we're sorry, the chef has been called away, we have to cancel for the night. Is there anything we can do so that you don't hate us? This was at 5pm for an 8pm reservation, after I had confirmed twice. I asked what that meant - the chef has been called away? The same phrase was repeated again to me over the phone. We can't run when the chef's not in. Um Duh. Is he in the CIA? Is he a raging non-functioning alcoholic? I don't know. Is he a poor businessman? Yes, unfortunately. Perhaps he's a childish artistic savant. Who knows?I ended up cooking in house and it was great. Probably the idea of what Schwa is going for anyways. Not at all a disappointment. However, if you care about your guests and don't want to be embarrassed by the poor manners and mercurial adolescent stylings of a spoiled savant.

"Been wanting to check out Purple PIg ever since I saw it on Check Please. The wait...was SO worth it! To spare the time & agony of parking, W & I took the L over there. We arrived around 9:30pm & the place was bumpin. Venue looked much smaller than I expected, and since it was a party of 2, we got seated by chef's table. Didn't mind seating per se, but we asked to be seated a bit farther in a booth. Servers were attentive and accommodating. The chef was working hard along with his father. We started off with a nice glass of Prosecco; light, dry w/a hint of sweetness. Perfect pair to go along with the fatty meals to be consumed. Small plates : * Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg      ---- My fav! I love the fried egg on top and the fried pig's ear...wow. The flavor was incredible. The whole dish had a slight asian feel to it. * Pork neck bone gravy w/Calabro ricotta     ---- Thick oven toasted bread w/creamy, buttery blend of gravy. We asked for more bread & licked the plate clean. Impressed. * Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/Mashed Potatoes    ------ This was the HIGHLIGHT of my night. Reminded me of korean braised short rib. The pork shoulder was so tender, and the gravy that came w/mashed potatoes was superb. Not too heavy, not too salty. We asked for a side of gravy and more bread..and they happily gave us both :) * Morcilla w/Apples, watercress, and apple saba    ----- Like Korean Soondae.      Blood pork sausages with thinly sliced apples w/sauteed watercress. It was ok. Meat wasn't as juicy, and the herbs were a bit overwhelming in this dish. All in all, the small plate concept was brilliant coz it allowed us to enjoy the different parts of pork in small, itty bitty morsels. We chatted w/Chef Jimmy Jr & praised him for delicious meal. Next time, I wanna try Roasted Bone Marrow w/herbs and Pork Saltimbocca w/Rainbow Swiss chard. This place lived up to its hype & I will be back soooner than later. Cheese, Swine, & Wine.

"How have I made it through almost 24 years of life without trying Saganaki? Why hadn't anyone even suggested to me that I'd love Saganaki? These are the kinds of questions I pondered as I visited Greek Islands for the first time on Sunday night. Greek Islands is beautiful....I've walked through Greektown before and stopped in some cafe/cookie places, but never any of the restaurants rich with history. This is one of the most unique and romantic restaurants I have ever visited in Chicago and I would suggest eating here to tourists, Chicago natives and non-Chicago natives like me. I am a very picky eater, but my date knows my taste and ordered food for me without even looking at the menu!! He said I'd love Saganaki and I replied, ""I don't like seafood."" When the plate of cheese came out, the waiter lit it on fire and said, ""Opa."" All I could think about as the fire rose into the air is, ""Don't bring that plate near my hairsprayed hair because I'm flammable!"" And then, to my surprise, my hair not only remained safe, but the plate contained cheese that smelled SOOO good and looked SOOO delicious that I almost just used my hands to eat it. Instead, my date cut me 3/4 of the block and poured lemon on top. All I can say is I WAS IN HEAVEN!! He then told me it was goat cheese, and guess what....I was only grossed out for 3 seconds! Then I ate the rest with such delight and I've been dreaming about Saganaki ever since. Greek food truly has my heart! I then tried their salad with these green things my date also promised wasn't seafood. I ate it and then he told me they were dandelion stems. WHO KNEW?! I wish I could tell you what my main course was called, but since we didn't look at menus, I can't. All I can say is that my chicken was extremely delicious and tender. The rice that came with it was also the TASTIEST rice I've ever eaten. Greek Islands, you get 100 stars!! Saganaki, you get 500 stars!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I LOVE this place!! It's not just because of the convience, the super pleasant staff, or the fact that they have a nice flat screen for me to watch the games while I wait for my pizza. Their pizza is amazing...the ingredients are fresh, the dough light but tasty, and they have so much variety that my biggest issue is chosing a favorite. Ok...that's a lie...my favs are the brocolli and the margherita. Oh, and this is so much more than just pizza joint. Their grilled chicken, rice, beans and other sides tastes like something I would eat at a home. So whether I want something fast and carb-loaded or just a big salad with a side of chicken...this place ALWAYS satisfies and exceeds my expectations! I'm so glad I stopped in...keep up the quality and you'll have me as a customer for life. By the way, try the ""cochina""...it's like a chicken fille, potato ball of goodness....","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I recently arranged a group dinner while visiting Chicago and wanted good Italian away from the hotel/Loop. I came across Sapori Trattoria (thanks Yelp) and had a WONDERFUL experience from start to finish! GROUP ARRANGEMENTS -- Anthony, the chef and owner, was very accommodating in pulling together a dininig package that was affordable and flexible enough for diners to make individual selections. He even arranged to process individual checks, which a welcome surprise for a 20+ group. Thanks to list of nearby attractions and shopping that Anthony provided, diners were able to explore the neighborhood more for pre- and post-dinner activities.SERVICE -- Upon arrival, we were greeted with our tables ready and customized menus.  The server (I forgot the gentleman's name) was very pleasant, accommodating and fast considering there were 20+ in our party.FOOD - The appetizers were great (best Calamari, I've eaten my share). My entre Cappellacci di Zucca (pumpkin pasta) was outstanding, as were the Cappellacci all'Aragosta (lobster pasta) and Spaghetti and Meatballs that I sampled. You know you've eaten good Italian, when even a simple (spaghetti) tasted special.Anthony arranged a dessert platter, which was a great idea because all the desserts were so delicious it would have been hard to pick just one.  RECOMMENDATION -- I highly recommend this restaurant. It's just a short cab or subway ride from the Loop and downtown hotels and worth the visit. It would be a great space for groups, particularly their lovely outdoor seating when it gets warm. Locals and tourists alike should not miss Sapori Trattoria.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"this is by far the most creative, original and elaborate meal that i have ever attended. the ingredients were pristinely perfect, the courses impossibly complex and overall highly impressive. the decor reminded me of a super trendy, high-class hotel when we walked in, setting the tone for the impeccable service that followed. so why didn't i give it a 4 and not a 5 with such high praise? simply because although everything was cleanly executed, i didn't feel a personal connection with the food. to me, they never became greater than a sum of its parts. i found the courses cold, sometimes austere, and never encountered anything that made me go yum, i could eat bowls of this stuff. so while i am glad i had the dining experience that was alinea, i'm not sure when or if i would return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been here twice now and can't get over how good the food is. I've had the linguine con vongole and the jumbo shrimp special pasta. Both times I was blown away by flavor and sheer quantity. Clam pasta in a white sauce may be one of my all-time favorite foods and I think this place might do it better than anyone else I know! Also, their pastas are all homemade and you can tell. I never thought I would be able to but there is something definitely special about their pastas. Their desserts are also out of this world. The waiter told us it was the best tiramisu in Chicago and I frankly would not be surprised if it were. I've also had the chocolate raspberry ganache cake - winner! I would absolutely have given this place 5 or 5+ stars if possible except that the second time I came here, the service was absolutely horrendous :( It was just me and a classmate late in the evening and the place wasn't terribly busy. We placed our orders and started chatting, only to realize over an hour later that our pasta hadn't come out yet and we were starving. No one came by to apologize or explain the wait! But when we listened around everyone else was getting explanations and free drinks while they waited. Our food finally came out and there were some sheepish mumblings about the kitchen having some trouble and an off-comment about how dessert would be on them if we wanted. Well, we took them up on that offer because it was kind of ridiculous that we didn't get an explanation before the food came out. But at least they offered.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Love this place! Great cocktails, great food, great place to come with friends, share some delicious small(ish) plates and relax. The waitstaff is a little snooty (or that might just be the remains of my hipster-hatred from having worked in Williamsburg for 2 years), but the food is way more memorable than the service. I've been here several times- it's super popular and busy now, but I went a few times in the summer and it was far less crowded before all the buzz. Last visit: The Shrubbery was awesome! Sweet, refreshing, and packed a fair kick. Also, my friend ordered a hot toddy and it was unexpectedly delicious. They have a decent beer list and a lot of fairly cheep whisky. My female friend and I shared: scallops with braised oxtail and truffle gnocchi, buffalo frog legs with aerated blue cheese, lobster parfait with bacon, and tete du cuchon with fried duck's egg and a parsley shallot salad. Our third dinner companion was a vegetarian and had: pretzel with cheese, and butternut squash risotto. Everyone left full and happy. The scallops, the frog legs and aerated blue cheese, and the tete were my favorite on this visit, as they were in the past. I think the other times I dined there the scallops had a different preparation, but were equally delicious. I also loved the marrow on another visit, but my friend and I didn't want to offend our vegetarian companion TOO much (our meat orgy already had 8 different animals represented, and I didn't want to add carving marrow out of actual bone). I wasn't super impressed with the lobster parfait- the lobster meat was a tad tough, and the other main component of the parfait was some sort of sweet root vegetable puree that was a little too sweet and mealy for my taste- something saltier or creamier would have been more pleasant. The only other dish I have ever been disappointed by was some sort of sashimi dish that fell flat both in presentation and in flavor complexity. Other than that, ""snacks,"" small plates, entrees, desserts and cocktails have all been very pleasing. A pleasant surprise from the last visit: an amuse bouche of a creamy soup with crab and smoked bacon. Very delicious,","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Fantastic! Make sure to make a reservation and request a booth - they have dividers between them that go up to the ceiling and pulled back curtains on the sides that afford the feeling of privacy that aids in the intimate feel of this place. My husband and I just got the cheese and chocolate and were a little concerned it wouldn't be enough for dinner. Wow, were we wrong! I felt feeling incredibly full and satisfied. It's true it's a little pricey if you want a meat plate, but I'd argue that the smaller options are even better (ok, so I'm biased as a vegetarian) and plenty of food. Definitely worth it for a nice night out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We were staying in the hotel and made reservations at Mercat on a Sunday night. All in all, it was a decent experience. The room had a bit of a clubby feel to it with the music, which isn't our scene...but surely appeals to some.The food is good. There are many different menu options ranging from lobster to more traditional tapas. My only complaints are that our service was a bit slow when the restaurant was definitely nowhere near capacity, and also the cost.Due to the small plate nature of the restaurant, you have to order a fair amount to fill up. We overdid to be safe and ordered 7 items and had a couple carafes of wine. We were full, but wound up dropping over $200 for two people. I have no problem spending $200 for a meal, but I would like for it to memorable. I would not put Mercat on that level, except that I will remember that I can go elsewhere for good tapas and pay a fraction of the cost.However, if you are stuck on going...some of the better options we had were the rice with morels, the flatbreads, the sea bass and the short rib/scallop combo.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Don't go out of your way, but not bad if you're in the neighborhood, want some pub food, and are willing to pay fine dining prices. We've eaten at the Gage twice now. Our first meal was probably closer to 3.5 stars. Great pork chop and pretty good burger. Our second meal was closer to a 2 star. Some significantly undercooked mussels that we couldn't finish was the bummer of the night. The flank steak appetizer with watermelon and goat cheese was an interesting mix of sweet and savory, and the rest of the meal was simply average. In terms of the food overall - this place is not going to knock your socks off by inspirational cuisine; after all it is a gastropub. But if you stick to items that sound like dressed up pub food you probably won't be disappointed. It will be a decent meal, but nothing that will be a future must-have that requires a return visit. Also consider the price - this is fine dining prices for upscale bar food. Service is attentive, and in some cases they seem to be almost trying TOO hard. But they mean well, are very attentive and friendly, and do their best to accommodate the patrons. For example, our bad batch of mussels were taken off the check without question or hesitation. And we didn't expect them to do it. We've only dined here on weekend nights, so can't attest to the power lunches. But there was a fair amount of tourist traffic. That said it doesn't feel like a tourist trap (e.g., Planet Hollywood, etc.) and you don't notice it unless you are looking for it. Overall - solid. If you have out of town guests and you're doing the Millennium/Grant Park tour, this would be a great spot for an impromptu visit, assuming you've indulged in the requisite Italian beef and/or deep dish. Not a value buy, but a good alternative if you happen to be in the neighborhood (in other words, don't go out of your way).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My husband and I ate at Graham Elliot's last evening for the first time. Decor is great, and love the idea that the menu is printed on one side of old record album covers. Speaking about the menu...if you are very hungry and going there for dinner(we were famished after shopping and walking around the city all day), this is NOT the place to dine. First off, the cocktails are small. There is no bread/crackers of any kind offered - just flavored POPCORN (a trendy idea, yes, but c'mon!) I was dying for some good bread - flat bread, anything...The menu is pretty trendy - and limited. The portions --appetizers and entrees -are small. My chicken breast entree was excellent, but way to small of a serving. Needless to say, the four of us were still hungry after our meal, and couldn't wait to go eat somewhere else.

"NUEVO LEON IS THE SHIT-and I mean that in a great way. Not sure how it doesn't have more than 5 stars overall on here.The prices are TERRIFIC-nothing is over $12! You get a complimentary appetizer-always amazing! You get free chips and salsa. All of the food there is great, plus you always get so much that even paying $12 for carne asada is a great deal. Most meals come with refried beans and rice. The carne asada also has tortillas. Drinks are all $1 and come in cans. Plus the place is BYOB-how great is that. Service is ALWAYS great and fast. While pretty much everything is amazing, here are the very, very few minor downfalls:Only take cash-however there is an ATM right next to the register.Free parking right down the street-usually there is room, but on some nights it does get busy so you have to park on the street.On busy night the line to get seated can take a little while, but as long as you remain patient and do your thing-the wait is never that terrible!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Piece last night for my friends birthday. When we got there we were told that the place is filled to capacity and that there is a three hour wait. So we could not even go into the place and chill at the bar while waiting to eat. Now I have been here before and know that there always is a wait but this was the longest yet. Because of the wait we decided we would put our name in and head to another bar and come back later and check on our wait. When we came back from the bar it was perfect timing and we were next on the list. The waiter was pretty cool and attentive to us. We ordered two different types of beer in pitchers. One was a light ale and the other a medium ale. The light ale was so so. I would suggest the medium ale over the light. We also ordered three medium thin crust pizzas. They came in a short amount of time. I couldn't stop eating the pizza that had the sausage and green pepper on it. It was delicious. Now I don't know if it was possibly because we had several drinks before hand at the other bar or if I was hungry, but that pizza was heaven in my stomach. The sauce on it is really good and it seems to have the right ingredients for my taste in pizza. They also served my friend for her birthday two huge pieces of chocolate cake and ice cream. I had a taste of that and it was pretty good as well. Also it was nice of them to do that for her. I would definitely suggest trying out this place if you don't mind the wait. I know in order to make reservations there you have to have ten or more people in your party. But keep in mind there are plenty of bars around the area to chill before hand and wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The beer is decent, but I haven't tried any that really blew me away. I do love the decor and the inventiveness of the menu, but with so many other awesome brewpubs popping up around the city, I might look elsewhere from now on. Revolution definitely attracts the hipster, hipper than thou crowd I'm learning to despise, so maybe that tainted my experiences. The bacon popcorn is okay, but mostly just tasted like bacon and soggy popcorn. The sweet potato cakes are good, not great, though they've been recommended to me by the staff as a favorite menu item. I'd stop by on a weeknight to avoid the crowds and have a beer or two, but the pricey food isn't high on my list to try again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went to this place for my 18th birthday and will be returning for my 21st because of the expansive, seasonal menu.

The crowd is very trendy, the bar is huge and the regular items on the menu feature great American/Anglo-Saxon flavors such as their creative use of brie and their legendary fish and chips.

"I walk by La Pasadita on a daily basis because we are neighbors. But it is a neighbor relationship that has left a bad taste in my mouth (pun completely intended). My first visit was filled with excitement and anticipation of what I surely thought would be a pleasurable palate journey. How could a restaurant that occupies three different buildings within visual distance be a negative experience? My honoree Mexican father recommended that I try a burrito--but he had not been there in ages so I totally excuse his ignorance to what its current state of affairs is in. So, I ordered a carne asada burrito. First off, I will wait for good food but the wait was kind of ridiculous for a burrito and a place that had more staff than customers at the time I went. I normally wouldn't nit pick a Mexican restaurant about their tortilla chips but I would have much rather picked up a bag of tortilla chips from the Mexican grocery store than continue to put the chips they had in my mouth. Then the burrito came out. It was beautiful to the eyes after what seemed to be too long of a wait. Chew... chew...chew... nothing but chewing. The carne was everything I hated about beef--specifically, cheap beef. It lacked the beautiful texture and flavor that traditional carne asada is known for. It almost became unbearable to eat because all I felt like I was eating was tendon-y leather masked with decent guacamole and cheese. The redeeming part of this trip (because I would have given the review a score less than 1) was that they made a mistake on my receipt and they charged me a couple dollars less than the menu price. I still felt like I was overpaying. Out of the goodness of my heart, I always give local businesses a second chance because I come from a family of small business owners. It was lunch hour and I was hungry. The intoxicating food smells from La Pasadita was drawing me in. But I knew now not to get the carne asada so I went for a Chicken burrito to go. I'm not going there for service so I didn't mind that the lady taking my order had a lazy attitude, but I perked up when she asked me if I wanted extra onions and cilantro in my burrito. ""Yes,"" I exclaimed! I paid 9 dollars for the burrito and walked back home which felt like a journey through the Sahara, incredibly hot, and willing to eat anything. I got home, took out a plate, peeled back the foil of my burrito, and began chomping down. The first few bites was only chicken and a bit o' onions. I thought that perhaps I had to get closer to the center to get more yummies. Sure enough I was passed the halfway mark and realized that my burrito was only filled with chicken and chunks of onions. I need not continue anymore because I can no longer spend my energy reminiscing about two horrible food experiences that I paid for with my hard-earned money. La Pasadita is officially on my DO NOT GO list and I would NEVER recommend any of my friends or their friends to go. A place that makes careless mistakes is a place with poor quality food and corner cutting methods. Their two microwaves all of sudden makes that much more sense. REAL Mexican food is cooked with passion, love, and a few good ingredients. My honoree Mexican family would shame me if I thought that a place like La Pasadita actually makes passable Mexican food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I have made this my go too as its blocks from my house but I am never ever going here again and I suggest a boycot. Asked for 2 cups of cheese and they bring us 2 big bowls and charge 5 bucks a pop ( for dipping a few fries?) ...combine that with the super bad attitude of the woman manager and her waitress made me sick....this place sucks.  The time before last they put me in a hi traffic area and after 20 min I had to ask to move cause it was the worst seat in the house.i tip very well and i refuse to give these horrable service a cent..I would rather have mcdonalds than deal with this horrable service...I highly highly recomend superosa over la villa any day of the week....your staff needs a major attitude adjustment and I will make sure to let everyone know it. Worst service I've ever experienced firgured it was a one time thing but after going again I realize that this place doesn't know how to hire respectable management or wait staff....if you want great food and awesome service search elsewhere.

Pretty cool and much appreciated.The food was stellar - I ordered the Cubano, although I expected it to be much bigger...they definitely hired some good photographers for their website, as the pics don't really accurately reflect what you get.With that said it was definitely solid, very tasty. I also ordered the goat cheese empanada, which I'd recommend in a heartbeat (I can't see how you could mess up a pastry filled with goat cheese...).Quick note though on the shakes that everyone raves about....I definitely saw this dude load up five HUGE spoonfulls of sugar into the shake...like massive scoops. So, if you're wondering why they are so good, I'd say just know that those things are really, really not good for you. You wouldn't normally consumer that much sugar in a week, I'd guess.

"Eating at Wildfire is more like an event than just a dinner. It's also an event for my checkbook, but well worth it.  If you're a fan of rare steak, Wildfire will not let you down.

The peppercorn crust is also very good, but a little too overboard on the pepper for my taste.  Their chopped salad is awesome - comparable to the one offered at Maggianos, and meant to serve at least two people. I've tried all of their potato sides and all have been perfectly cooked and delicious.  They have several good martinis, but I have to plug the Key Lime, which is the best I've had in this city. They also offer martini flights, nice if you can't pick just one. I'd recommend reservations, especially on weekends because the place does get packed. Also, some tables are in high traffic areas.

"I am the kind of girl that loves a big cheeseburger and good beer, so obviously I had to check out Bad Apple. I have been here several times since my first visit in late December and I know I will continue to visit in the future. Most important to me is their affordable beer selection. There are other bars that serve good beers, but as you are drinking it you can't help but to think about how much they are ripping you off. Not here! (I usually go for the Left Hand Milk Stout) Their burgers as well as service are always great as well. While I have never been here during dinner time on a Friday or Saturday night I am always surprised at how much open seating there is when I am there.

"Contemporary and modern twists on some classic Southern cuisine best describes the tasty treats to be found at this delightful Andersonville gem. A group of my friends went for Dinner Saturday night and all 7 of us were absolutely satisfied with our experience. The place was packed and they're were long waits for tables, but our reservation was immediately honored and we were sitting in a matter of minutes. Waits for drinks can be lengthy, but we were forewarned by our waiter (Danny) as many of the specialty cocktails are very ""labor intensive"". We did wait about a half an hour for our appetizers, but were treated to complimentary boiled peanuts to tide us over. An interesting texture and bean like flavor helped us forget the wait. For apps we had the pulled pork grit cakes, potato croquettes & crawfish cakes. All were amazing and to add to the enjoyment, they were served on the house with sincere apologies. Yippie! We also got a round of beers comped too. Big Kudos to Big Jones for quickly acknowledging their error and correcting it. For entrees we had the shrimp burger, beef burger, fried green tomato BLT, gumbo, eggplant fritter & fish special. The Fritter was a bit of a disappointment as were the FGTBLT. Good flavors but messy and difficult to eat. Burgers though were amazing and the special fish was equally delicious. Yumms on the mac n cheese and the fried okra. We had a blast at Big Jones.

The oatmeal shakes are to die for...also, try a chocolate corn meal shake if you are in the mood for chocolate. The Chifrijo (Black bean dip mixed with fried pork and sauteed veggies served with chips) is amazing!

"My family and I have been going here since I was little and it's probably my favorite place to go in Chicago to eat. It's where we take family if they haven't been to Chicago, it's where we go with a lot of people to celebrate. It is a lot of food for cheap, it tastes excellent and is filling.Their burritos are probably what they're most famous for and they're excellent. Dinners and Tortas are also very good but you should probably share with one other person because they are huge and maybe even more filling than the burritos. As far as I know the food is authentic (enough for me anyways) but whether or not it is it's delicious.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Pizza here is nothing special and mostly bread (yes, I understand that the crust is an essential part of the pizza). Food comes out incredibly quick, but it is still not worth the usual 30-45 minute wait. The host is usually rude (I think he thinks he's being to-the-point, but he's coming off as old and grumpy and uncultured). I've come here at least 4 times and every single time the crust was burnt and the toppings were cheaped out. I stopped coming here when wood-oven pizza became a new craze and more places started serving it with better quality and at a lower cost. This place is a hype and not worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Delicious food and huge portions. Many regular omlette or egg orders come with a huge side of 2 pancakes plus a side of toast! My favorite is the Santa Fe Fritatta! I recommend sharing with someone. The wait can be really long on the weekend during the prime time brunch hours.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

We had left a little earlier than planned, but only because my friend wanted to get up and dance (and as fun as this bar was otherwise, it wasn't the place for a dance floor).In planning the event for my friend, I called/emailed a bunch of different bars to see what their deals were, see what type of arrangement they could set up for us, etc etc. Lockdown was by far the best one I have ever worked with.

"Needed a place to go to in the bf's hood and since I don't know it as well as my own, I turned to Yelp. From reading the reviews, we were expecting a wait. Luckily, the 20 min wait we were given turned out to be only about ten. We had mussels to start which were really good. He ordered the funghi e salsiccia pizza and I ordered one of the specials which had prosciutto, salumi, mushrooms and black olives. We both studied in Italy in college and both said it reminded us of the pizza we had there. Overall it was very good, but at the end of the night, we were a little surprised by the bill ($70 including tip). I guess we did have an appetizer and each had two drinks, but $16 for my ""special"" pizza? Call me cheap, but had it been listed on the regular menu with prices, I would have gone with something else--it is only pizza after all.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The only drawback is that sometimes the crowd is lame. Guys/girls trying too hard. I was there one night around midnight and a couple had their infant with them AND they were sitting next to the speakers. Good job parenting. I had to leave, it was too weird.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"'Expensive' is fine if you're getting good value. I just don't feel like I got a good value at The Gage. Not often do I leave a restaurant feeling ripped off, but that's exactly how I left The Gage. $7 for a bowl of fries? $13 for a glass of the 'house' wine? $6 draft beer? Ok, the $6 beer isn't ridiculous, but it's more than I like to spend for a domestic draft. I wanted the hangar steak (well, I wanted a filet or ribeye, but I'm not paying $38 for a steak at a pub). Anyway, I wanted the hangar steak, but it turns out that's not a whole portion - just an appetizer portion. So you're supposed to pay $12 for a bowl of soup, then spend $15 for an appetizer before spending $30+ on an entree? Then pay too much for a beverage? I ended up with a $10 burger. It wasn't bad, but the bun was a bit stale. Actually, it must have been more than just a bit stale, as I was able to detect the stale-ness over all of the grease that was soaked up in the bottom half of the bun. Not me. For those prices, I expect a little more.  I'd also like a bit more of a 'formal' setting for those prices. I don't want to be seated right off the noisy bar, crammed in a table inches from the diners on both sides of me. We were so close, the servers bumped me every freakin' time they went to the table on either side of me.  No, sir, not for me. Save your money. Skip The Gage. I suspect this place will lose the local crowd as soon as the novelty wears off, then have to rely on tourist business to stay open.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If you go to Geja's and don't get laid afterward - you are doing something wrong! This place is uber romantic, complete with flamenco guitar players, walls made of empty wine bottles, and private little booths (which you should try t request if you do go, the tables are pretty small). Although the options on the menu are limited compared to other places (the Melting Pot), the two are really not comparable. The experience here is everything, and the ambiance only adds to the great food. Portions are huge, and each dinner includes salad, cheese fondue, and chocolate fondue. I love the beef, chicken, shrimp combo - but the magic is in the dipping sauces. Also, try the red wine sangria. I usually don't like the red version, but here it is just delicious and very fruity, goes well with the cheese course.

"Great food, terrible music. Am I the youngest person in the restaurant? I've ordered delivery from RJ Grunts on several occasions, and their food is very good. However, after deciding to check out the place in person, I have my reservations about ever going back. I will definitely still continue to order delivery from them though because their food itself is at least 4 stars! Likes: Food is great overall, and their creations are definitely unique. The menu is diverse and comically written. I very much like their chips, which are made in house, especially when they are well-salted. I'm also a fan of their tuna melt, which offers 3 small tuna sandwiches on English muffins, each with a different type of cheese melted over the top. Dislikes: By far the biggest issue that they have is their music. They play really bad 70s rock/pop NONSTOP, every waking second that they are open. I asked the bartender if they always do that, and she replied, ""Welcome to my world..."" I kept waiting for waiting for a song not recorded 35 years ago to play, but it was in vain. It's not disco at least, but it wasn't good 70s music either. Usually I don't care much what music is being played, but this was just so bad. On top of that, as I looked around the establishment, I realized that I was perhaps one of only a handful of people under the age of 35 (out of probably 70 people). As for the food, after reading about their shakes on Yelp, I was expecting a bit more, though they are not bad. The onion rings were generic, which is really the only item that I've not enjoyed there. If you love great food, this is a terrific place. Beware though that if you dine in, you'd better be over 35 if you wanna keep your sanity.","[0.0, 1.0]"

If you're feeling adventurous, two people can definitely finish a large pie. I'd go with roasted red pepper and onion on red, or spinach on white. Pick up a growler of the Worryin' Ale, and definitely grab a Dark n' Curvy when it's available.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If you like meat and seafood on a hot wooden slab, then this is the place for you! My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night and it was packed, but we only had to wait five minutes to be seated, which was nice because we were starving. We had ordered the empanada combination plate which was fantastic. The sauce was hot, but tolerable and the empanadas were great. However, the main course was my favorite. We both ordered the $20 skirt steak combination and the calamari. I loved the fact that the calamari was not cut, so you actually got to see the squid head! and it was extra tentacley which is my favorite. It was grilled to perfection. The steak was phenomenal, it was juicy, savory, and cooked to perfection, We were both too full to see what the dessert menu was, but I would definitely come back here again. The total bill ended up being about sixty bucks which included appetizer, two skirt steak dinners with calamari and a sangria...not bad at all.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great food with the best service. I just came here for my birthday party last Saturday. As usual, they really really busy on Saturday but they still keep the best thing of their restaurant a quaint - sized restaurant with a heart of gold and love. There were nine of us and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. But you know what ?! The little lovely owner gave us many any COMPLIMENTARY appetizers and hot ginger teas for all of us. When we were waiting for tables. We were really surprised and kind of full before we got tables - not kidding what a sweet little owner !!! :-) Did you see any restaurant owner run around the restaurant even though he has more than 8 waiters and waitresses ? That's so funny. He breathed like he got heart attack but he still tried to make anybody happy and always has a smile on his face. Then, they gave us the fancy COMPLIMENTARY fried banana and ice-cream just because we had to wait for tables. Also, it's BYOB. How nice it is !

The duck is SOOO good! You can get a whole one for about $16.

"Ok, I know it is hipster heaven, but I just love the Chicago Diner! It's in a cool neighborhood, has a hip atmosphere, and of course some the best vegan food around. It's a great place to take visiting vegan and veggie guests to give them a little taste of Chicago. I only wish the wait wasn't always so long, and that they didn't cram so many people into such a small space. The wait staff is often overwhelmed, and if you don't stay on top of the hostess, you may get overlooked. I've only sat on the patio once, but it was a lovely and fun experience. You do pay a little more, but that's to be expected from vegan dining in a trendy part of town. The menu does change seasonally, but I have almost always loved the food.

"Hot spicy food on a cold night. Perfect combination! It was a spicy themed night out for us and Lao Sze Chuan was perfect for this theme. They have a pretty huge extensive menu and a lot of the meals were noted as spicy. I did notice that they have options for mild, hot or super hot but most of the things we order were all between hot and super hot. We started with a couple of bowls of Hot & Sour soup and a bowl of Egg Drop soup and some pork potstickers. The Hot & Sour soup was SPICY!! It was a heartier soup than I expected and had great flavor and a tons of things in it (I couldn't tell you what was in it if I tried.) The potstickers were HUGE, way bigger than I am used to but they were a bit to much for me considering it was only meat inside. For entrees we decided to just stick to what we know this time around. We got Kung Pao Chicken (super spicy), Sze Chuan Beef (spicy) and Moo Shoo Shrimp (not spicy and super refreshing.) They were all super yummy and the portions were HUGE. I have to say that my favorite was the Moo Shoo shrimp but I think it was partly the overload of spiciness on the other two dishes. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and the food came out fast. The place is tiny but they let us enjoy our bottle wine and food coma long after the food was packed up. I would love to go back and try the Hot Pot -- it looked like so much fun. I would definitely recommend this spot!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went there for the first time and was impressed. They seated us very quickly (we got there before the lunch rush on Sunday). They place seems rather cramped (up front, the back not so much). They take cash only, but do have an ATM machine. They served us the chips and salsa as well as an appetizer. (The appetizer was excellent!) They replenished the chips after we ate our first basket which was a nice surprise. We were served rather quickly. We got tacos, a burrito, and sides of rice and beans. The menu wasn't really descriptive as to what was included with each item. The burrito came with side of rice, but didn't state that on the menu. The waitress didn't really pay us much attention at first, but proved to be a good waitress. She even brought cups with lids and straws for my daughters. She also split our sides up together so that both side plates had rice and beans (instead of a plate of each) The food was good, except the bean. By far the worst I've had in Chicago. They were definitely canned and tasted like they had been cooked in old, burned oil. Gross! The agua de horchata was good, but not as good (in my opinion) as El Chisme. (I love horchata) Also, we were seated in the middle in the front section which turned out to be rather uncomfortable. A big group came in right after us and had to wait to be seated. Unfortunately that meant that they were standing right behind me while I was eating. So close that I could hardly sit comfortably away from my table. There were a couple kids just staring at us while we ate. I suggest requesting the back or left side up front. Overall, I'll go back. But I definitely will not get the beans.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I cant believe Im just reviewing Xoco now...its funny b/c the first time I went there was earlier this year, right when I had just opened my Yelp account. Months later I have returned, and the quality of food has definitely not changed...if anything its gotten better! My first time there I had the pleasure of having not 1, but 2 tortas! I opted for the Ahogada and the Pepito. The Ahogada is definitely one of my favorites, if not THE favorite at Xoco. It is served in a bowl which the torta comes in, halved and stood upright. Consisting of pork carnitas, black beans, a tomato broth and spicy arbol chile sauce, you are in for a treat. Trust me when I say, you will be repeatedly dipping in this sauce! You have the option of getting it to taste (i.e. mild, spicy, super spicy), I got it very spicy =). The Pepito is easily my 2nd favorite here at Xoco, but then again I have yet to sample the rest of the special menu during the week. The Pepitos protein comes in the form of braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onions, artisan Jack, black beans and pickled jalapenos. If that following rundown of accoutrement didnt get your mouth salivating, I dont know what will! Im glad I tried the both of these tortas!On a side note, the Jamon torta is worth an honorable mention. Definitely get this w the fried egg! On this particular pilgrimage however, I was joined by both my brothers and our friend, as we were in anticipation for some good eats. Having been there before, I assured the bunch that they were in for a treat. Walking through the front door, you could smell the wave of aroma coming through this establishment. Did I mention I saw Rick Bayless on this visit!?This time, I chose the Cochinita Pibil (yes, only one torta this time). Which is suckling pig and achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero. The habanero comes on the side in the form or a sauce. **WARNING** if you like spicy, then you will LOVE the habanero sauce! Be warned! My only gripe my first trip here was that the accompanying sauces were not hot enough...the habanero is HOT! I made the mistake of dipping my first bite of cochinita completely in the sauce and taking a bite....Whoo! wow. very hot stuff.The house made chips and guac are definitely a must have as an accompanying side treat!The real delight though for all of us came at the end of the meal...yup...CHURROS! My youngest brother who I know personally LOVES churros was super stoked to try them. After finishing our meals, the churros came down with their soft serve. GET the side of soft serve to dip your churros in, you will not be sorry! There are a few other tortas I definitely want to try, but what really has my attention is their soups...they look massive and look equally as fulfilling as any of the tortas so Ill be sure to update my review after that. Also, they have a medley of hot chocolate drinks and sweet stuffs.Cash/card is accepted and there is the occasional line so be prepared to wait 30/45 mins. If the line isnt to your liking, cut straight to the register to order to go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I enjoy almost every cut of meat and a few times I've ventured around the salad bar (it's beautiful, but as we know it's about the mean).  I've also sampled the various starches on the table (bananas, polenta) and I love them, but again it's really about the delicious cuts of meat coming around every time your card is on green. If you go, go hungry and clear the rest of your schedule. Even if you don't stay too long, you'll be in a lovely meat-induced sleepy state for the rest of the evening. I was thrilled when a similar place opened in Scottsdale, AZ (closer to where I live) and I try to budget in a few visits a year.","[0.0, 1.0]"

2nd time I've eaten here - not coming back. Their guacamole was soupy - couldn't even taste the avocado (no seriously). Tacos Al Pastor were below average - didn't taste like Pork.

"Simply off the charts. My only regret is my first visit here was for weekend breakfast. Which at Glenn's means we could not order off the ""chalk board"", mostly seafood dishes that sounded fantastic like halibut with blue cheese horseradish sauce.  These items only available after 3pm on weekends. What we did have was still amazing. A shrimp po boy with homemade tarter, avocado, bacon, tomato, and onion. The french bread it came on was thin and allowed for all the sandwich flavor to come out. One of my favorite sandwiches ever. The crab cake benedict was also very good. Every thing homemade from the sauce to the crab cake. If that wasn't enough the potato pancake that accompanied each dish was the best i have every had. Quickly pan fried and bursting with fresh flavors. I cannot wait to go back. A must do in Chicago.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went here last night with my lady friend for her birthday. It was both of our first times at this sushi place. The ambiance was superb coming in from the chill, and a disappointing loud establishment prior to Coast. We were welcomed and seated promptly to a romantic nook. The wait staff were swift, and kind. We started of with the shumai, and miso soup (of course). We did not bring wine to this BYOB place, and were fine. (Yes there is a corking fee, a wine and beer limit, but we didn't needing a drink tonight.) We had a the large sashimi plate, the Maine maki, seaweed salad, and followed it up with a few more makis after. Then as a topper (I did say it was her birthday) we had desert; mango ice cream toped with minced mango with a single candle, chocolate covered strawberries, and a fried banana with dark chocolate. I am sure we'll be back for more.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Absolutely LOVEd this place! The food was amazing and in HUGE quantities. Plus, considering the area, the prices were pretty cheap. If you go with only one other person ask for a window seat. They overlook Michigan Avenue and it's a wonderful view while you're eating. The first time I was there I ordered the Bento Box lunch special. It was awesome! The next time I ordered some chicken but I can't remember what kind. Again, AWESOME! So much food I couldn't possibly finish it!

"Dined here last night and had an absolutely excellent time. I am a young diner (still in high school!), from Northwest Indiana. I come to Chicago every few weeks to get my food fix. This trip, I brought along three friends and headed to Graham Elliot. The restaurant was modern, as I expected, and definitely had a quirky and eccentric vibe to it. They even serve the wine in giant Erlenmeyer flasks! The music is great too, and definitely seems to cater to the younger crowd. From what I've read and from my experience, it seems like the staff at Graham Elliot is all very young and clever. Our server certainly was. She was absolutely excellent--perhaps one of the best servers I've ever had. Often, teenagers are treated condescendingly in upscale restaurants such as this one, but she was completely respectful and treated us as she would treat any adults. We obviously aren't of drinking age, which would probably have annoyed some servers, but she offered us ""mocktails,"" which we gladly accepted. Also, one of the diners in our party is sensitive to dairy products, and our waitress really tried to accommodate that to the best of her abilities; even pointing us to a drugstore down the street for Lactaid pills. I really like how they explain the dishes after they have arrived, as I have found great differences between looking at a menu and actually seeing the food in front of me. The restaurant had just rolled out its spring menu about a week prior to our visit, so the fare was lighter. Like I said, we started with mocktails. Between the four of us, we sampled Summertime, Rapper's Delight, and Blueberry Hill, our server's suggestion. While they obviously didn't contain alcohol, the cocktails were light and fresh, containing summery flavors. We really enjoyed them and I'm sure they would be even better with alcohol (not that I have ever tried it...) Oh my gosh, I forgot about the popcorn. Amazing. They definitely have something with this idea, because it was so much more addicting than the usual bread and butter. It was perfectly seasoned, and was refilled as soon as the bottom was visible. We ate about two and half baskets. I would come back for the popcorn alone.We ordered off the regular menu, with each of us selecting a small plate (cold/hot) and a large plate (sea/land). I was lucky to be able to try lots of menu items, because as a group we all tried to order different things. For appetizers, we had the duck satay, carpaccio of beef, caesar salad, and sweetbread hush puppies. I highly recommend the sweetbread hush puppies...great texture and served with a wonderful fennel slaw. I also loved the brioche twinkie--some genius thinking going on there. For our large plates, we sampled the lamb, chicken, salmon, and pork. I didn't get much of the chicken, but I did get to try a bite of the gnocchi that accompanied it, which was one of the best things I tasted all night. The salmon was light and fresh, just as it should be. The pork was served with rhubarb jam and a yam waffle. The combinations are so innovative and modern, and they work. Finally, we ordered all four desserts (chocolate, espresso, strawberry, and pineapple), and shared them. The chocolate, which happened to be our server's suggestion, was the standout. It was served with an apricot jam which complemented the salty chocolate nicely. If you're a fan of unique ice cream/gelato flavors, you'll love the desserts here. They contained lavender, cream cheese, and cardamom flavored ice cream, which were all absolutely creamy and delicious.Graham Elliot gets five stars for its young, quirky atmosphere, extremely kind and attentive waitstaff, and innovative, modern, and delicious dishes. We will be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We came in for dinner a couple nights ago and they were packed. I mean there was an actual line! The owner was nice, and we were pretty grateful. He had given everyone waiting on a table eggrolls and dumplings. By the time we got seated, the food was fast and the service was great. I do apologize because we did sit until they closed and the owner looked oh so tired but told us we may sit there until we want to leave. I decided to come back for lunch. I came in yesterday and they were quite busy. That's good to see. The food is still wonderful. And the prices during lunch is even better. Plus you get so much food. I love the fact that I could leave here always full.I'm figuring that this place is great to throw parties. I might just make a reservation for my sister's graduation.

"After hearing great things about The Art of Pizza, I was really excited to have some. Maybe that set me up for failure? We ordered some of the deep dish and it was not very good.

It is finished! Two things taken out in one day - my 100th review and a trip to Hot Dougs! The lines are insane and there is no denying that but when can the anticipation be justified by the end result ... when you dig into those encased delights of Hot Dougs. I did see the online menu for their specials of the day and immediately decided between two dogs - the Jalapeno Pork Sausage and the Mandarin Orange Teriyaki Chicken Sausage. I went for the Teriyaki one and an order of the duck fat fries. I manged to score a small table and ate to my hearts content. Perhaps I didn't need to eat all of the fries but it is not that often that I will get a chance to have duck fat fries ... and yes they are very good. I waited in line with a couple who drove from South Bend that day just to give this place a try. They sat close to me and I'm pretty sure they were happy to have made the trip ... except for driving back with a food coma!,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"After many years of wanting to go to wilde--- I finally did! it was for a friend's birthday. Um, first, the host had the coolest accent in the world. I guess it was irish, but it wasn't your typical irish that you hear in movies or that leprechauns have. It was like dodgy irish, well, what I'd imagine the people who live way out in the country have. When he seated us, I didn't understand a word he said. It was AWESOME. He was like ""billy on the slots yadda right there."" Or something. I made that up, but he might as well have said that. Did you understand that? Yeah, didn't think so. The interior of the restaurant was also fun... but a little too dark for my taste. Yes, I know it's a bar of sorts, but I hate it when 1. you can't see the person you're talking to and 2. you can't hear the person your'e talking to. Clearly, I just gave it away, I am not cool. So anyway, I ordered a shepard's pie, which was good, but nothing special. My friend got the mac and cheese which was super delicious! Despite her saying she didn't want chicken in her mac and cheese, they put it in. It was ok but I'd stick to no chicken. Anyway overall, a fun experience, nothing amazing, but I liked it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The second course was halibut that was paired with an orange soda (again utilized in the sauce as well). Quite possibly one of the most delicious taste sensations of all times. A pork dish followed, paired with Root Beer, and then dessert which was a popcorn gelato, and house made sweets that recalled reeces and milk duds. Unreal!

It's a lot of your typical mexican dishes, but made in a different way, with different flavors mixed in, and different meats/ingredients.

A lot of his products have become commercialized, so it's nice to see him in the restaurant still.

"O.M.G. What a delicious meal and great experience. We dined fairly late on a recent Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere, the service, and--most importantly--the food. We started with cocktails at the bar because our table was just a couple of minutes slow, for which we also got a compliments-of-the-kitchen amuse, so no complaints about that, and then moved on to a series of a la carte dishes. Everything we had from the new spring menu was faultlessly well prepared and delicious, with a great blend of flavors and nicely contrasting textures. Particularly memorable were the crab starter and the thyme dessert, although really every dish was one I would not hesitate to order again. Service was attentive without being annoying, and we, being mild misanthropes, really enjoyed sitting several feet rather than inches from the closest table. My husband, who once declared that he was into fine dining but not into tucking his shirt in, was particularly pleased with the overall lack of pretension. Yeah, it's expensive, and yeah, our entrees were maybe three or four ounces of meat instead of 12. So if you judge value by portion size, this is not the place for you. But for everyone else, highly recommended.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Great beer and and spirits menu too-- gotta love a place that has Sofie on draft. I should say that I automatically give at least 2 stars to any place that has roasted bone marrow on the menu. So luxuriously fattening and delicious... In addition to the bone marrow, we ordered the roasted cauliflower and frites for starters. Both were great appetizers. I had the mussels and my husband had the pork belly. The other couple ordered the hamachi crudo and the pork belly as well-- everyone was really happy with their meals.

"The Green Mill is place where people can come and social dance. Granted, the floor is a little small but it takes place, which is refreshing. The bands are great and don't disappoint. There are a few too many tourist but it's manageable. The bartenders are matter-of-fact, no nonsense types but they get the job done and I've not met an unfriendly one yet. The patrons could work on their courtesy skills but that's a rant for another day. The club can get shoulder to shoulder but that adds to the vibe. This is a place where young and old are welcome and seen cutting a rug or two. Seating can be sparse but I feel that invites the stander to dance; so go ask someone to dance.  The interior is a gem. Not updated since an era far gone by but it's still beautiful and I'm glad the smoke isn't touching it anymore.

"On my most recent trip to Chicago, and my first trip after my conversion to full blown veganism, I was pleased to find several vegan dining options. My boyfriend and I went through the list and picked a few places to try, and thank goodness one of the places we put on our list was the Chicago Diner, because it was fabulous!There was quite a wait to get in to a table, but luckily we stuck it out. The servers were incredibly helpful, making tons of suggestions when we were both so overwhelmed by the selection. I ended up settling on the Black Bean Burger, which was absolutely incredible, and a cup of the French Onion soup. My boyfriend, a self-professed meat and potatoes guy, decided to go with the huevos mexicanos, and was pleased as well. I was a little apprehensive about bringing him to a restaurant where he couldn't stuff himself with bacon and sausage, but he really ended up enjoying it as much as I did. A great place to go if you're a couple with such different food preferences.The Chicago Diner has a cookbook, which we also purchased, and it has been so wonderful here at home in Lansing to be able to recreate some of the dishes.

"So against my will i went to try them again (girlfriends idea), she said we should order ahead so when we walk the 5 mins it takes to cross the street it will be there, and we can enjoy lunch and not spend most of it starving. Ok, so at 11:55am i call them and tell them i want to place an order, extra cheese caramelized crust, simple. I ask how long will it take to make it, she says approx 25-30 mins, ok so i tell her i work right across the street and i will walk over there at 12:25. everything seems to be going good, I'm in high hopes. Arrive there, everyone was friendly, seated in a corner booth, for more than 2, not the one we wanted but ill take it. So after saying multiple times that i ordered ahead, they finally understand. so here comes 11:50 roughly 20 mins after we were seated, almost an hour from when i placed the order and no food. I give my gf a snared look and told her she better be the one to ask whats going on, so to put this shortly, my gf asked the hostess why it took so long for our pizza to get there even though we ordered ahead of time. She said they don't make it until people are seated that way if they don't arrive at the time they say the pizza wont be cold, we told her that whoever we talked to on the phone was told we are across the street and will walk over at that time. She then said she would talk to the girl who answers the phone, we both thought ok, makes sense they want to bring out a nice hot, fresh pizza. We bite into the pizza..... and its luke warm!!! REALLY?!?! And i know its not their fault, but there was a nat flying around us the whole time and it just didn't help the whole situation. Second thought, that is their fault!!!

"Simply It was absolutely wonderful! We were greeted with genuine enthusiasm and the promise of complimentary egg rolls! There was maaaybe a five minute wait and I think this is how we earned our treat. The food was great. Egg rolls were delivered seconds after we were seated. Two friends had different tofu appetizers that were both lovely. As for me, my meal was served in a coconut! The Coconut and Mango Beef (Bo Dua) had very tasty, very tender, very flavorful beef tenderloin with fresh mango, young coconut meat, snow peas, and red pepper and was perfectly sweet and savory at once. The waiter may have giggled at me when I ordered it, and I get that there's a bit of spectacle to this dish (and shamelessly admit, aside from the excellent ingredients, that it helped draw me in), but goofy or not, the order was a damn good one.THEN, more complimentary goods! We were given a plate of fried bananas for having waited so long. (again, I'll say 7 minutes max) We left feeling spoiled like mad and thanked the lovely man who welcomed us so warmly at the start (seems like the owner?). He thanked us right back with the excitement I now can only expect from him. A few storefronts away, we turned back to find that he had popped out of the restaurant to wave and thank some more!

But even when that's the case, staff and owners are friendly and the food comes out decently fast. Plus it's consistent - sandwiches are always good, as is the traditional meal plates. My favorites include the palm salad and the sweet plantains.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Almost everyday since owners posted sign ""Cafe 90 Miles Coming Soon"" I used drive by this place and drool in anticipation. The beautiful wall murals developed over few weeks, breathed- in festive color into this half gentrified hood. During one of my late evening strolls I spotted some lights and men inside. Being curious cat I am, I approached the window and tried to peep inside. The owner, (handsome) Latin guy noticed my silhouette lurking outside. He came out right away and greeted me. I, in the first place, totally taken aback by his cheerful invitation to my slight embarassment for my unsuccessful exploits and my overall appearance (no makeup, baggy attire), stood stuttering some obscure facts about my uncle who supposedly was raised and lived in Cuba. I entered. The interior walls were covered with Castro era newspaper and magazine clips. Couple of old men, perhaps Cuban, gave couple of sezing looks on my potentials of becoming their customer. The owner chatted lil bit about origins of his establishment and handed me their menu. I mumbled something again and bowed out. Veggie empanadas are the best, chicken sandwich rocks as well as the Cuban one. I am yet to try their dinner menu but I am sure they are as good as their sandwiches. They have nice backdoor patio. It is byob, good for group and inexpensice eat outs.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I woke up before 2pm on a Sunday (I know, right?) and drove here to knock it off my brunch list. The pancakes were orgasmic.

"Woahhhhhh AMAZING MEAL!!!! A++++++++++ (if this was an ebay review lol) This is def the up-and-coming trendy, scene place to get seriously the best steak and/or seafood meal of your life!!! The service is crazy, amazing, excellent. It's like having servants tend to your every need. The wine list is out-of-control. For all you wine-os out there, you will fall over dead with this list. We had the server-recomended Zinfandel, which was amazing and only $40!!! Oh did I mention our server was young, nice AND a SOMMELIER!!! He told us it was the best wine on the menu for the price point. I got the bone-in filet medium-rare and Masto's knows how to cook meat, it came out medium-rare, juicy and steamy. The plates are actually sizzling hot so you can cook your meat further if needed. All of the sides were awesome, we ordered 4 of them I think--just wanted to try stuff out. You can't go wrong with any of them in my opinion. They are known for their Lobster mashed potatoes and Gnochi. I couldn't have the Lobster b/c of allergies but the rest of my party was drooling over the food. THE DESSERT IS TO DIE FOR. Order it with a cappucino and complete your meal. You're worth it. Instead of getting FRATTY this weekend and buying an obscene amont of shots and booze at the bars for your brahs and some hos, save your $$$$, grab a few of your classier friends and HIT UP MASTROS. You'll thank me later... Wait, Mastro's will call to thank you.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Our initial visit went smoothly. Busy Sunday morning, great hostess who took our number down which then allowed us to go a couple stores down to drink coffee and read until they called us. What a great idea! Not only to promote neighborhood business (they should hook up with the coffee shop to offer a discount) but a nice way to make use of your time as you wait. We ordered the crab cake brunch dish (forgot the exact name) and the corned beef omelette. The crab cake was yummy, but what made that dish Fantastic was the Potato pancake! I don't know what they put in their but the flavors just melted in your mouth. Our second visit was what led me to give this place 3 stars. Same process of waiting for a table, but this time a different hostess. It was President's day, so I'm guessing this guy was not your normal hostess. He had a white apron on and a hat, so I'm assuming he was a cook in the kitchen, who was relocated to greet guests. I gave him my cell number to call when our table was ready. Considering that a long line started to form inside we offered to wait outside until I received his call. He told me I was the next 2 top. We waited and waited. Finally my friend suggested we check on the table considering a considerable amount of people have left. I walked in and he welcomed me as if he hadn't seen me the first time. Everyone behind us in line was already seated! I reminded him of our interaction earlier and pointed my name on his clipboard. I was glad that there were available tables at that time because between my hunger and my annoyance, I think I would have just left. Regardless we had the crab cake as an appetizer, this time it was ok. It really must have been that potato pancake. My friend had the Jambalaya and I had the house special lobster mac & cheese, which was also ok. I didn't realize that it was on DDD until after our initial visit, so it is a must try considering that Guy visited it. I'm not sure if I would suggest going back a 3rd time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"SuperDawg gets 5 stars from me. Here's why: 1. Just driving up to the place will make you smile, especially when you see the Tarzan Hot Dog on the roof winking at you. 2. Car Hop Service. Just like places like ""Dog-N-Suds"" used to do. 3. Everything about it is fun. The little box that your hot dog comes in, the funny names for all of the different menu choices. 4. The dog is a jumbo dog. Not like you get everywhere else. Crinkle cut fries. A strange pickled green tomato atop your SuperDawg. 5. Great milkshakes. They know how to make them here. Get Strawberry. 6. I loved going there as a kid, and now my 5 year old son loves it too. You can't get that just anywhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I am a big fan of Frontera. The food is very good, though it isn't cheap, and the margaritas are excellent. Although it is tough to get a table, I have managed to eat in the restaurant a number of times after arriving in the evening without a reservation, and it is usually possible to eat in the bar. The decor is a little over the top for my taste, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Love the outdoor seating except for the fact that my friend and I were sitting right under the music speaker. We asked them to turn the music down, and they did so w/ attitude. After about 10 min, the music was up to full volume. Sort of annoying....On the flip side, the food was great. We both got the shrimp platters. Food was fresh and very tasty. We got the guac for an app. It was just OK. It did not have that much flavor and the consistency was off, like I'm pretty sure the used mayo. Cheap Cheap Trick, Irazu!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What is not to like about Anteprima? A friendly neighborhood restaurant with decent food and service? One word from our recent visit on a Saturday night: LOUD. Unbearably LOUD. So loud we could not hear each other talk. So loud we could not hear our waitperson and she could not hear us order even when we were almost shouting at her. So LOUD we almost left, and we should have. The food, as usual, was good, but for the prices they charge, a little more concern about the dining atmosphere--the acoustics of the room and the amount of people they cram into what is a small restaurant--should be shown. It was an unpleasant experience for ourselves and visiting friends, and we will think twice before going back.  Food: three and a half stars. Atmosphere: no stars. Be warned. It was like trying to have a nice italian dinner at a frathouse party.","[1.0, 0.0]"

SLOW service! Server showed irritation that we had a large number of people in our party and showed no interest in getting anything to us in a timely manner. It seemed he wasn't concerned with making our table a priority since we would have automatic gratuity added to our bill. There were five tables that were sat after us that got their food long before we did. We had to ask twice for water and finally got water an hour and a half after we were sat. One person ordered a soda and it was not brought to the table until an hour later and that was after they were reminded. All in all we were in their establishment for almost three hours and only actually eating for about a half hour of that time. The staff was rude when we requested anything and as best was unable to attempt to assess any needs that we might have. We are in Chinatown often and will not be returning to Lao Sze Chaun.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a favorite lunch spot of mine. If you've never been, it's time to get off your fat ass and check this place out. I consider the food to be a Middle Eastern hybrid - it's definitely a tad different (much less garlic) from the stuff you get around Detroit, which I consider to be more authentic. Anyway, the food rocks and its pretty cheap. $5 gets you a lentil soup and a falafel sandwich. The shawarma sandwiches are tasty but the lamb can be a little dry sometimes - I usually go with chicken and get it made spicy (which basically means they put some Thai red hot sauce on it). Even my weak tongue can handle the heat. And be sure to get Jerusalem salad on top of whatever you get instead of tabbouleh (yuck!). Haven't tried the fish yet. The restaurant itself (seating/decorations/atmosphere) is nothing to write home about; could easily be described as cozy and/or not a dump.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love everything about this place. Awesome food, good serving sizes, and wonderful drunk inducing drinks. All the best you could ask for from a vegetarian restaurant. On top of all of this, the service, even when slow, is among the nicest and most genuine I have ever experienced. I find most of the other reviews here shocking, as all are completely contrary to anything I have ever experienced. The only downfall would be that they mopped the floor around my table the last time I was there and covered my coat in bleach mop water, thanks.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ended up here on Saturday night following a cancelled trip to another place, due to their running out of Great Lakes Christmas Ale. My friend called the Bad Apple and they had the ale, so we were off. I was pleasantly surprised. Atmosphere was a good mix of lively yet still able to hear your dinner companions. We started off in the bar waiting for a table. Huge beer selection, probably rivals Hopleaf, but plenty of valid options for the non-beer drinkers as well. As someone who drinks beer minimally I sometimes feel stupid ordering a cocktail at a ""beer"" place, but not here. Bartenders knew their stuff and helped out a friend who was looking for a beer she had once but couldn't remember the name of. Once we sat down our server was friendly and funny, even making jokes with my tipsy friend. Lots of interesting and off-beat options for burgers, maybe even more creative than the ones at Kuma's (which, admittedly, I think is overrated). I counted at least 3 or 4 veggie options, which is pretty good at a burger place, so vegetarians need not stay away. I got the Edmund Fitzgerald burger (goat cheese, bacon fig relish and grilled onions) and truffle fries, both of which were cooked perfectly. So many fry options our party decided to each get different ones so we could try a few. Yeah, their ketchup is a bit different, but I didn't want any ketchup to cover the taste of the truffle oil anyway. Cozy neighborhood place even if you don't live in the 'hood, and easily worth the trek. Next time Kuma's grumpily tells you there's a 2-hour wait, go here instead!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Beyond disappointing. When I think of southern comfort food, I think of relaxing, fun environment. It started with a surly, indifferent waiter and went downhill from there. They were out of the special by 7:45 on a Tuesday night. Waited at least 10 minutes for the first drink. 30 minutes between appetizer and entree. And when the main course did arrive -- the highly recommended chicken-fried steak -- the meat and accompanying mushrooms were ice cold.To top it off, the bathroom was flooded and no attempt had been made to clean up/clear up an over-flowing urinal. Disgusting.","[1.0, 0.0]"
The food was fantastic!!! We did have to wait which I of course expected since it was on a Friday night but the best thing was they have this secret hidden waiting lounge that they take you to with sofas and tables and chairs where you can uncork your BYOB wine or have a few beers while waiting.

I do have to say though, the roast duck is just okay. I've had better. Sometimes I wonder how they're able to make a profit.

"We stopped in here last nite for dinner, and there's not much that I didn't like. The restaurant was full, but we were able to sit immediately (granted it was a Monday evening). We shared the pear salad to start which was a simple light way to start our meal. I then had the scallops & oxtail (I agree with other reviews that the amount of oxtail was lacking) and the hubby ate the boar sloppy joe (Yum!).  So, yes...I agree that the portions for some of the dishes seemed scanty...but it also left room for dessert (creme brulee and chocolate lava cake) so I can't complain about that! Our service was attentive, and the thing I disliked the most was probably the couple sitting next to us that were talking way too loud for being so close. We'll be back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
I've ordered pizza from this place four times and every time the experience gets continually worse.

We did get the monkfish appetizer, which was really good. I love the taste of all the mix of spices with the fish. The entree. I'm not a huge fish fan, so I ordered the filet and shrimp. There is no way that piece of steak was a filet. I'm guessing it was a strip steak at best. The shrimp was waaaay overdone and chewy. Others at the table who did get fish dishes seemed to enjoy more than me.  Really enjoyed the sangria, I could've drank those all night.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The tapas, while excellent were not very large or even very sharable though multiple plates were ordered amongst our group. That is my only complaint about the restaurant as the staff was very accomodating and on top of things with a group of 14 and noisy background.

Have had other pastas there, and other than the enormous amount of food they serve - it's pretty blah... Salads seemed to have just come out of the freezer, as cucumbers were frozen and we waited for them to warm before diving in. Services was slow, usually not available, only bus service was quick.

"folks, let me offer a tip. DON'T go to revolution brewing co. on a saturday night. you will hunger, you will thirst, you will WAIT and WAIT and WAIT in hopes of getting a table.  you will show up, be quoted a TWO HOUR WAIT, be drawn in with the enticement of bacon popcorn and awesome food, and go across the street to cole's to drink cheap beers and wait it out. and because you will wait for TWO HOURS EXACTLY, you will drink a lot of cheap beers at cole's and be voraciously hungry once you get to rev brew co. when you are finally seated, it will be 10 PM yet the restaurant will still be packed. you will have a difficult time ordering since there are so many great options to choose from -- but you'll order more beer and appetizers and THE MUSSELS. get the mussels. steamed with beer and then wash it down with beer.  such a fantastic place for dinner. the only con is that the wait (and the subsequent 2 hour stint at cole's) doesn't always fit in my schedule for the evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've read so many great reviews of this restaurant that I chose it as the venue for an important dinner with my wife and another couple visiting from out of town. Leaving nothing to chance, I made a 9:00pm reservation and we dutifully checked in at the restaurant, everyone dressed up for our fun night out, at 8:45pm. Upon arrival, we were told by a host in a gray suit that, "" it might be a bit longer"".  No worries! I thought, we'll go to the bar and split a bottle of Prosecco. I should note that he could also have been a manager, but certainly in title only, as it became clear that he was managing nothing. I'll refer to him as ""The Cheap Gray Suit"" for the duration, as the word and title ""host"" allude to some level of hospitality, of which there was not a whiff. At 9:15 I politely inquired with The Cheap Gray Suit if he had any better indication of the time we might be seated (trust that I am not re-coloring this to my favor, we were truly courteous and very reasonable in all our encounters with The Cheap Gray Suit). We were told flatly, and now surprisingly, a bit rudely, that it would be longer. Back to the bar to try to keep everyone's spirits up... At 9:30, after watching a number of parties of four, who arrived after us, be seated my wife checked back with The Cheap Gray Suit. Again, nothing. No apologies and no updates, other than it would be a longer wait. This time, The Cheap Gray Suit added a dash of highbrowed aloofness for good measure. Is there anything more off-putting than being subject to unwarranted snobbery? Actually, there is! Unwarranted snobbery directed toward someone else in your company. That was the final interaction with The Cheap Gray Suit we were prepared to endure. There are too many other fine restaurants in the city. If any of the staff had made any effort to even acknowledge our wait, we still may have gritted our collective teeth and pressed on (not to let one spoiled Gray Suited apple ruin the bunch.) As it happened, we were ignored, the hour was late and the wives were fading. We informed The Cheap Gray Suit we were leaving on the way out the front door, and departed for a fine sushi dinner at Mirai Sushi. I eat out frequently, and completely understand a busy restaurant and the possible resulting delays, but it wasn't the wait, it was the pathetic attitude of The Cheap Gray Suit that spoiled our experience. The Cheap Grey Suit was unwaveringly unapologetic, smarmy and obviously could care less that we would be, and were, waiting so long (despite having a reservation). When we told him we were leaving he, remarkably, continued to maintain a perfect balance between unapologetic rudeness, smirking attitude and a dreamy vacancy. A fantastic example of somebody who has no business in that business. Pity, as this is obviously a fine restaurant, to have such an sad amateur as the first (and in our case, last and final) point of contact.","[0.0, 1.0]"
The food is great at Calo's. I do have a problem with their packaging. Every item of food is at least double wrapped. Not only in containers but aluminum foil and paper as well.

"This place is not too shabby. It's not that bad. If there was a 4.5, I'd give it to them, but there isn't. They can still make improvements.

The cakes are really good. Everything else I really haven't tried, and I can't say I recommend it, except for the cookies. The cookies are pretty good.Now, this is an independant business, so give them credit. Of course they can improve on a few things, but I think it's a decent place. The only thing they can use is some more space, maybe nicer staff, and to experiment on some of their ""goodies"" in order to get the best flavor and texture.

"I went to Carnivale for a pre bridal shower. I really didn't like the food it was just a little too spicy for me. However, the drinks and the service was great. I love to try new and different things, so we had a couple specialty drinks and our waiter was coolest guy. He wasn't hovering around us but at the same time he was attentive and sociable without being annoying. If you like Latin or spicy food this is the place for you.

"Wow, what can I say! I had been wanting to try this place for awhile now. I actually studied abroad for a bit researching Oscar Wilde, so it only seemed fitting I try the restaurant inspired by him in lakeview. I took my man here for a tasty dinner. The atmosphere was great, it was so cozy and warm feeling and the gay men who made up the serving staff were very friendly and helpful (even though they all looked like a clone of the last). We had the Potato Rissoles for an appetizer. YUM! They tasted like fried mashed potato bites! For my entree, I figured Shepherds Pie would be the fitting choice. It was great too, but definitely a heavy meal. Overall, everything was more than satisfactory right down to the ""I can resist anything but temptation"" Oscar Wilde Quote etched on the ceiling. The one thing that could improve could be the drinks, I probably had the most watered down vodka cranberry I've ever had in my life that night.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Try to hit Bongo on weekdays for lunch if your schedule allows. M-F there is never a wait for a table, yet the place stays busy, the energy level is still a good and having breakfast for lunch is always a good idea.People love the pancakes, but the omelets and sandwiches are also amazing!Wait staff is wonderful, many have been there for years, and they always remember you.

Perfect small-bite & antipasti accompaniments to the wine & beers they serve. Great after-work wine place.  The beet salad w/ whipped goat cheese is to-die-for, the fried pig's ear (YES, I SAID PIG'S EAR!) is sooo tasty w/ a beer or crisp white wine. The deviled egg is also interesting and inventive. Everything left me wanting MORE. GREAT wine-by-the-glass menu too. Or you can get a little carafe which is more like a glass and a half. I appreciate that!

"I'm an eggs benedict fiend. I drove all the way to Chicago from Ann Arbor to eat a decent plate of eggs benny and this place delivered! The Benedict deconstructed: About the meat to bread ratio: Perfectly balanced! Canadian bacon slice wasn't too skimpy or too thick, it was just right. About the hollandaise sauce: fully made from scratch and ever-so-slightly tart with a hint of tabasco. Eggs: poached to perfection. Whites are firm, but oh, how the yolk drizzles out! P.S. They could work on the home fries; they were kinda *meh.* And the fruit? That's an added bonus and guilt reliever when you're ingesting your week's worth of cholesterol, but seriously, put it in a bowl or something--I don't like hollandaise touching anything healthy on my plate.  P.S.S. Eggs Benedict is one of the best meals on earth. There's a reason why James Bond constantly orders it in the novels. Man's got taste!","[0.0, 1.0]"
The pizza at La Villa sets the bar! Perfect every time. I recommend ordering with fresh garlic and extra cheese for the best night-in-front-of-the-TV meal. Would you believe when moving earlier in the year staying in the delivery radius of La Villa was a real concern? We haven't ordered many other dishes off the menu. Most of our time spent in the restaurant has been with a drink at the bar while waiting for a pizza to-go (used to live within walking distance). It's a great neighborhood spot and we've never been disappointed.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Not disappointed in the least. Also, there is no line at 4:30 on a weekday, so if you want to eat right away, have an early dinner. I had the Pepito, and the meat on this sandwich was so flavorful, and so tender. The whole sandwich was perfectly balanced--great cheese, lovely onions, and deliciously spicy pickled jalapenos--and the bread itself was crunchy and soft in all the right ways. We also got chips and salsa--the green salsa is KILLER, btw. A cup of it comes with some of the sandwiches, and it's great. I also had a side salad, and it was nice. A little too much oil and not enough acid, but good nonetheless. Plain, but nice. Sam got a drinking chocolate, which was small, but more than adequate for his chocolate needs. He said it was delicious. We're going back, it's only a question of when. Just SO good. Prices are higher, if you're against paying for quality and want cheap and bountiful. Don't go here expecting to get a 12 inch sub for $5. It's not that kind of place. But if you're into quality, this is the real deal. YUM!","[0.0, 1.0]"

While it is rather small inside, they have great outdoor seating during the warmer months and their food is sure not to disappoint. I would highly recommend the Chicken & Rice. Order it extra spicy (if you like spicy things). It is beyond fantastic and not only will leave you full, but ensure that you have extra to take home. And while their portions are more than enough, don't overlook the oatmeal shake. Oatmeal Shake?? Yes, it may sound a bit strange, but try it!!

"I'm about to serve up a little more whine than cheese on this review. The name of this place should be The PRICEY Purple Pig! I am a HUGE wine connoisseur and I was incredibly unimpressed with this place. I finally went on a late Sunday afternoon in early March on a date after wanting to go to this place since I moved here. When my date and I walked in, we were seated with a large group of people we didn't know which was a little awkward, but I thought Oh well, it's a wine bar...it should be fine. Anyway, the waiter asked what we'd like to drink. I was in the mood for a red wine, and my date didn't have a preference, so we went for one of the more moderately priced wines. We were perplexed on what type of cheeses to get, so I asked the waiter for some suggestions on what to order that what compliment the wine. He gave us some suggestions, and naturally him being the expert, we took them. He brought us the plate and both my date and I did not like a single one of them!! It was obvious we didn't care for them because we pretty much left the entire cutting board of cheeses untouched. The waiter never asked any questions, or if everything was OK , nada! But he did ask if we wanted anything else? Well of course we do, we're still hungry!!! So, we chose the meats (ourselves this time!) and ordered a meat tray, olives and a few breads, They were OK, nothing to rave about,especially for the price. I'm not exaggerating, but there was hardly enough meat on the cutting board to make a small sandwich. By this time, we were both disgusted and unimpressed with everything, so we asked for the check and then left. I felt so bad for my date, and he felt awful too. Poor guy kept apologizing, when I chose the place! Thankfully, we went to and had a delicious meal, dessert and wine somewhere else for less than $85 dollars. I'm sorry, but I should never walk into a restaurant pay $105.00 tab and still be hungry...or tipsy for that matter. Tragic.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Welcome back Garcia's!!! The owners definitely did this restaurant justice by expanding the space and accommodating the crowds that come to this restaurant. Not only have I been here for those late night munchies, but finally a place to come enjoy a nice dinner or come in for some FANTASTIC margaritas. the burritos here put chipotle to shame (cheap and more bang for your buck!!) I highly recommend their guacamole, but it unfortunately has been lacking it's usual kick the past couple of times. their fajitas are amazing and you could never go wrong with their tacos. If your looking for great margaritas, this is the place. It's like they put the fantastic word of Willy wonka all in one drink..sweet and definitely gives you a zing.

"Popped in here on a Thursday night at 6:40ish. The place was already so packed that the wait for 2 was at least 45 minutes. But I don't count in my review, as you get this lots of places. That's informational only. My husband and I were actually able to snag two seats at the bar shortly thereafter because we're good vultures, though I did have to wrangle one away from a few portly ladies. We ordered the venison pate as a nibble to start, which was brought out pretty promptly. Except that when the waitress delivered it, she said it was duck and scurried away before I could clarify. Now, it looked like pate, but there was a duck rillette on the menu that night. It didn't look like rillette at all, but, she said duck, so I wanted to clarify. Ten minutes later (after not having been able to touch our nibble in case it was wrong), we finally get the bartenders attention who assure us it's the venison pate. Fine; but get on your servers a$$ to know what the heck is on the menu that day. Shared the gnuddi, foie gras and scallops. Scallops - perfectly cooked, but was waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy overshined by the large heaping of braised oxtail that came with 'em. If the oxtail is the star, nix the scallops and just have an oxtail dish, I might have appreciated it more. Gnuddi - AKA: naked ravioli. I would expect that there would be no shell, but it seemed these were deep fried to maintain the round shape? Who knows, they just didn't have much flavour. Foie Gras - this was actually pretty decent, especially the side of 'foie gras hot chocolate'. But decent does not a 5 star yelp review make. Just like a night spent with a sub par lover ,""I've had better"" was the only thing I could utter after this experience. It's not ""bad"" - there's just nothing special there. I won't be back, nor recommend.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Chocolate, peanuts and berry stuff....yummy...I was shocked, a little disappointed but yet mildly intrigued and satisfied by the fact this little pretty $5 thing tasted EXACTLY like peanut and butter jelly sandwich. Texture was pretty on point too. Their cakes looked awesome and they have a bunch of awards on the wall for them. The attitude of the place was pretty cool too so I will be back and will definitely keep them in mind for future cake orders.","[0.0, 1.0]"

No one liked the collard greens (gomen) or spinach (quosta). As this was all of our first experiences with Ethiopian food, it's hard to make a comparison to any other Ethiopian restaurant. Would definitely recommend it, particularly for vegetarians. Great experience which I look forward to repeating.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Superdawg Drive in is done in the style of the old 50s drive ins. You drive up to a station and park your car, order your food, and they bring it out to you on a tray that sits on your window. And not only is the food great, but the presentation is some of the most fun I have seen. The hot dogs come in great boxes with fun things to read. Each hot dog comes with fries and what ever condiments you desire, except ketchup. I would highly recommend the hot dogs, but the burgers and shakes are also excellent. I love the feeling of sitting in a car with the windows down waiting for food. It makes me feel as if I'm in a time warp and am sitting in a bit of the 50s. And the signs! Anyone who has been there will probably never forget the hot dog man and woman who stand on top of the place. Classic.

"After reading all the great reviews on yelp, I got a cake for my husband's 40th birthday party at Alliance. It was a 3D cake like they advertise on the website for a party of 60 people and I paid $450 in advance for it. I was happy to pay that much since the cake was a surprise and the design had sentimental meaning between us - and you only turn 40 once. The cake we got did not look at all like what I had ordered. It had icing running down and off the cake and the writing was smeared and unreadable. It looked terrible. I was so surprised and dissapointed for my husband that this was the cake wheeled out for him in front of all of his friends. This happened last summer and I still get bummed out thinking about that crappy cake we got.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Since I'm not a vegetarian this wouldn't be my first pick, but I went with a veggie friend for lunch who had been dying to try this place. And, honestly, I've been curious myself for years.  We went right after the tsunami/earthquake in Japan so they were donating a portion of the sales to help with disaster relief - nice touch!  We ordered: * Mozzarella Teese Sticks (breaded vegan cheese sticks by Chicago SoyDairy, served with zesty marinara) * Titanic BLT Burger (seitan patty stuffed with corn, peppers & onions, topped with Upton's Naturals veggie bacon, french fried onions, vegan BBQ mayo, lettuce & tomato, on a toasted multi-grain wheat bun) *Special Shamrock Shake The green shake was the best, by far. It tasted like a mint chocolate chip (my favorite) shake. Yum.... The burger and cheese sticks were alright, but I'd prefer real cheese in my sticks and real meat in my burger. :) My veggie friend LOVED everything. So, I recommend to vegetarians/vegans, but not to meat-eaters.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"In Rogers Park we've got a couple winners when it comes to Ethiopian, but when my friend who lives in Uptown mentioned she wanted to try Demera I was all for it. I'm always looking for the next great handful of mashed something-or-other. We went in on what is probably an off-time: Sunday night about 5:45. The place was nearly empty so we were seated right away. But the service...slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Over the course of a couple hours we had to continually ask to have water glasses refilled (and we weren't chugging them down). We ordered 2 different ""tasting entrees"" (you know, you get four different selections from the regular menu). She got one too so all in all, we shared 4 different types of veg entrees and 4 meat entrees. I can't say enough about the veg choices. Really really tasty. Not so crazy about the meats although the beef choices were generally better than the chicken choices (which I found different as usually I prefer the chicken at Ras Dashen and Ethiopian Diamond).  It was slightly more expensive than the two neighbors to the north (Ras and Diamond) and I couldn't really put my finger on why, so I say I'll probably not be back to Demera unless it's just more convenient to go there. Not bad. But also not worth a special trip.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Meh. Thoroughly mediocre. Milk and Honey has their system down to an art - you line up, look at a menu, place your order, and then loiter around with a number. The hostess seats you sometime between when you order and when your food arrives, and there's a posted sign asking patrons to kindly give up their tables as soon as they're done eating on the weekends because the small restaurant gets so busy. I get it, but I wasn't impressed by how unfriendly they were. The menu had a number of delicious-sounding things on it, though I wasn't particularly hungry and stuck with a bagel (mediocre), which still wasn't cheap. My friend's eggs looked good but not great and were also pretty expensive. I would consider coming back to Milk and Honey if I lived in the neighborhood, but I won't go out of my way.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"THE place for jazz. Everybody else posting here pretty much nailed the decor and ambiance. A total step back in time. Now mind you, this is traditional jazz--piano, brushes on the snare, upright bassist...Never got that into jazz in its purist form--try the underground wonder bar in gold coast for the contemporary form with alot of energy. Unfortunately, lots of jazz snobs telling you not to talk. I mean , I like to hear the music too, but I also don't want to just sit in a library either. Sometimes the whole room just sits in absolute silence--kinda weird especially if you want to talk with your date.Gets pretty crowded the later it gets--you might end up standing. Poetry slam on sundays--kinda like sitting in someone's living room and playing charades..it's fun though, really!Lots of parking on the streets, but don't park too far and just get to the venue as this is definitely not the kind of neighborhood you just want to sightsee in..be careful!

"Yum! Such a cozy little place that feels even cozier because of how packed it gets on weekends. It's kind of fast food style in the sense that you line up to order and pay for your food at the counter, grab your own utensils, when there is seating you'll get seated (my girl friend and I waited maybe 20 minutes at noon on a Saturday), and they bring your food out when it's ready. I tried the huevos rancheros (which is only offered on weekends) and pancakes du jour (blueberries on top).  The huevos rancheros seemed to be the most popular dish ordered. It is served casserole style: black beans, pico de gallo, scrambled eggs, all baked with a cheesy crust on top. Both entrees were delicous; fresh and healthy tasting. It doesn't seem food here is weighed down by sauces or fat. Portions are also just right for the prices ($6-8 for most). Sandwiches are served daily after 10 AM, and brunch on weekends goes until 2 PM. There are also a limited number of bakery items they sell. The only drawback is the lack of space for the herds of people who come in and have to wait for a seat. You'll get a lot of hungry people in line eyeing you jealously while you're stuffing your face.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I wish they would not take reservations within a half hour to their kitchen closing. We arrived for our 9:30pm reservation. The host did not look at us at all. Not once. Somehow he managed to keep looking at his monitor while he felt our presence in front of him. We told him we had a reservation and gave him our name. Then - while still having not lifted his head to look at us - looked over at the girl who showed up next to him and instructed her to sit us. We sat at our table for a good 15 minutes at least. The place was nowhere near packed and there were a handful of servers just kinda standing around, looking around. Turned out that none of them was our server. Our server finally arrived and we ordered drinks and food: - Mixto (Chef's Selectio of 3 Cheeses - $16) - Datiles Con Almendras (Bacon-Wrapped Dates Stuffed with Almonds - $7) - Verdosa (Mixed Baby Greens with Green Asparagus, Avocado, Confit Cherry Tomatoes and Shaved Mahon Cheese - $12) When the dates came out, it was two sticks, each one with two bacon-wrapped dates. Definitely not worth the $7. Then another server came and put the cheese down on the table, then quickly walked away. That's out it was with all our dishes. We weren't even informed what the cheeses were. The Verdosa was probably the best dish but still nothing to write home about. All the while, we were watching as servers came around and cleared the tables of their dinnerware and set out what looked like glasses and plates for breakfast. Even another diner a couple of tables away from us we could tell was having a terrible experience. He came in after us and left before us. When his server came to pick up the bill, he looked around to see if the diner was still around somewhere, then shook his head. Looked like he got not tip.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I can't remember the exact cheeses we ordered, but we were happy with our choices. The prices were a tad bit on the high side, but not outrageous. One thing that was disappointing was that when our waiter poured our wine, there was a little bit left in the bottle - just shy of one glass full. Instead of giving us each a little splash more, we watched the server pour the remaining wine down the drain. It was an opportunity to make us feel special as customers, but instead we got the message that the restaurant would rather throw something away than give us a little something extra.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Make sure to make a reservation because it is packed any day of the week. I recommend the Guacamole, Meat and Cheese of Spain, Halibut, and as side orders you must get the fried sweet plantains, fried yuca with garlic mojo, braised greens with smoked bacon and the mac and cheese which is to die for and the flavors of each dish can not be matched by any other restaurant. This restaurant has it all and more. It is impressive on so many levels and definitely entertains and wow's your guests!

"This is a wonderful restaurant which we come back to again and again and again. The staff is lovely and always pleasant. The food is outstanding - amongst the best Thai food I've found in Chicago. My standards are high having travelled extensively throughout Thailand and eaten the real stuff. Most American Thai food is watered down versions of the real stuff. Not at Opart. I asked for one dish to be served ""Thai Hot"" in response to the waiter's obligatory question - ""How spicy do you want it?"" I got the usual eye roll indicating ""you silly westerner, you can't handle it that way."" When I pushed him, he finally relented and boy, was I happy (though no one else in my party was). The dish was served painfully spicy - in the way that I've only found in Thailand. It was wonderful. The room is nice, the staff attentive, and the food is absolutely fantastic. It's BYOB and the staff quickly bring a bottle opener and cork screw as soon as you sit down. All of these elements add up to a fun evening with wonderful food and a modest tab. We bring our friends here now and always have a great time and leave having made a couple new converts to Opart.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Dinner was good and most of us ordered the entrana-- charbroiled skirt steak since it was highly recommended and I love a good steak! I ordered it medium and it was cooked just right... in fact I didn't have much of an appetite that night so I had 2/3 of my steak leftover... if it still tastes fantastic 4 days later, it certainly says something! I even thought it tasted better... wow- that just proves I really was not in the mood to eat that night. I'm not a fan of the sides though... plantains, pan-fried potatoes, and yuca. The potatoes and yuca were too dry. We shared a few pitchers of Sangria. It was average-- too sweet for my taste so I liked the mojitos better. I will definitely go back for the entrana! I choose this location over Portage Park because of the better ambiance. Wish they had BYOB everyday and not just weekdays... that would be nice!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Pho tai is no longer what I always get here! I've been on a ""let me try anything else but pho"" kick lately! Pho for me is now a cold-weather comfort dish!  I discovered the grilled marinated pork and grilled marinated beef sandwiches that are made on the freshest, crunchiest french bread! Veggies include cucumbers, cilantro, jalapeno, sour carrots and radishes, and green onion.  I also love the vermicelli combination which is eaten kind of cold with lots of raw veggies (I love veggies!!) and a homemade lemon fish sauce that you toss in and mix everything together. The combination plate comes with plenty of meat including marinated beef, shrimp, grilled pork patty, and an egg roll. Toss everything together and you're set to dig in! -------------------- All I ever get here is the Pho tai (with beef) and it's great every time! Occasionally if I'm truly starving, I'll order a Vietnamese sandwich to share as an appetizer... it's the one with pork! They are always busy and you might have to share a table if you want to be seated sooner. The food still comes out pretty quick and we're in and out of there.  Great food, quick service, and cheap!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We were visiting Chicago for several days from out of state. Eating out all the time can be really expensive but we wanted at least one great sit down meal. I highly recommend Wildfire. It is a moderately priced alternative to Gibson's or Morton's that will not disappoint. I'll start with the food. Our party split two appetizers. A small thin sausage pizza and a goat cheese dip of some sort. The goat cheese was so-so. The pizza was very good. Next was a greek salad. Very tasty with a nice mix of feta cheese and garbanzo beans. Highly recommend the filet trio for your main dish. You can try their different crusts that come with their steaks. I went with the horseradish, mushroom, and parmesan cheese. Terrific dish. We split a piece of key lime pie for desert. The service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and Chicago. Visiting here at the beginning of our vacation was very helpful. He made recommendations for pizza as well as directions for places we were visiting. I appreciated that he took his time to answer any questions we had. The prices. You can eat a very good meal with salad, appetizer, potato and steak and even desert for just under $100 for two. This is w/o drinks. We had came from a nearby bar just prior so we skipped drinks here. Great meal for a great price.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am really not a fan of waiting in lines. Not at movies, not on roller coasters, not for bars, and certainly not for pancakes. I have waited in the line just to say that I have and to see what the fuss is about. The breakfast was about as good as it can be but its just breakfast food. The decor is pretty typical Wicker Park decor. The staff is soso the good being friendliness and effort. The bad being they seem a little overwhelmed sometimes. (Forgetting stuff)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Green Mill on a Sunday to watch the poetry slam. The man who started all poetry slams was hosting it and the event was great. The Rutabaga Band was playing and did a stellar job. The atmosphere was excellent, the poetry was pretty good, the energy was pumping. The place was warm inside, definitely great for the freezing cold night. Several things not cool. 1. This place ONLY takes American Express. What. The. Hell. Luckily, there is an ATM across the street that dispenses tens. But seriously- what busy bar, tavern, whatever this place calls itself ONLY takes Amex? A million points lost for this. I heard a ton of other people's incredulity about this too so I know I'm not the only one. 2. I don't know if it's just the aura of the place, but something provokes women to hover in the bathrooms. TWICE I went in to do my business and both times the toilet seat was sprayed with piss. I'm not a germophobe in the slightest, okay. But that's just gross. I know that's not the club's fault, but it's a warning to those who want to go there. There were even notes written on the walls of the stalls commanding women to stop peeing on the seats. 3. Selection. All I can say is Feh. I stuck to wine. There was nothing there that tittilated me in the slightest. It's a good thing this place is such an old impressive space with good music and interesting clientele, because if they were average, then poor selection, pee on the seats, and limited credit card acceptance would have them bankrupt in a jif. I still plan on going for the slams- for the band mostly. It's a crowd of beautiful people, and I hear they change out the bands, so I hope the other bands are just as good. And this time I'll remember to bring cash.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A big thank u to my fellow yelpers, that torta ahogada is out of control delish. 3 days later I'm still drooling for a new one. I'm normally adverse to wet sandwiches but this was toasted to a lovely perfection. I was not terribly impressed with churros. Let's be clear tho, they were good, but nothing I haven't had in any street corner in Mexico. What was amazing was dipping it into the chocolate almendrado. The Bacon ice cream didn't have much Bacon flavor, but that crumble was absurdly delicious. Pork belly Caldo was good, but come on, it's pork belly. A Lot of flavor In that chicken Pozole, happy to see a mix of dark and light meat in that. Mr. Bayless, you are all that is promised, I will be back soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Problems: We waited over an hour for ONE pizza that we had pre-ordered in order to save time... yet, no time was saved. We got to Giordano's at 7:30, ""pre-ordered"" at 8:20, got seated at 8:50, and didn't' get our food till 9:30... surely something must be wrong. As we sat there we saw one family finish eating and paid, watched the table be bussed, watched a new family be seated, watched that new family order and then eat their food, while we continued to wait for ours. The waitress avoided us, not even making eye contact. The only time she was attentive was when she was trying to collect our paid bill. The pizza was NOT HOT, at best room temperature.

"First of all, I have to say that, in my opinion, Sushi X has the best sushi in the city. They have very unique rolls and you get a lot for your money - AND they are absolutely delicious. Tonight a friend of mine who used to live in Chicago and is visiting and I ordered sushi that we picked up and brought home. When we got home, we realized that even though our reciept had the correct order, they made a mistake and gave us the wrong order. We were so dissapointed - but it was late and we were so hungry, so we started to eat what they gave us. It was good, but just not what we had ordered and had wanted. I called and explained what had happened, and even though we were out of their delivery range, they appologized for the mix up and delivered the 3 rolls that we had orginally ordered. Now that's great customer service!!! We couldn't have been happier, and will be back soon for sure!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One word Chicago: Overrrrated. I know this isn't the best Chicago has to offer (even though it claims to be and has been voted such by several news groups). Please tell me its not Chicago's finest. I went to Lou Malnati's, but didn't feel like waiting 2 hours. That must be Chi town's best. So this is all I tried, and I was sorely disappointed. To add insult, it took them over an hour to get us our stuffed pie. Crust was dry and tasteless, sauce was mediocre, and overall the pizza was bland. I ended up boxing it up and giving it away on the street.  Sorry Chicago, but Zachary's in Oakland, CA does Chicago style better than Chicago.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We really enjoyed our experience here lats night. We have had many tasting menus in the past, all creative, all pushing the limits of our senses and understanding of food. Last night, we enjoyed ""the collection"" and were not let down. The team at Graham Elliott tested and tempted our tastebuds with creative combinations, perfectly cooked food and ""all"" enjoyed. There was not a single dish on the menu that didn't work for us. The service was excellent, the environment was casual, relaxing and unassuming. Why the 4 stars and not 5? Wine. We did the pairing and I was woefully disappointed. Nothing was bad, but nothing really stood out. I felt about halfway through that this pairing menu was the ""value"" menu, maybe their goal was to let us experience regions we may not have tried on our own, but they should have stated that. I still feel let down by it and while I will certainly be back, I most definitely will be skipping the wine pairing. Last comment - those of you who complained about portion size, I ask, did you leave hungry? There is no way. Try the 48oz Strip Steak at your local Outback and leave the seats at Graham for the rest of us.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Wow - I hardly give out 1-star ratings, but I'll gladly frame this up and hand deliver this to the owner. This is where you would go to eat garbage-grade fish in a dark loungy setting. About the only thing good about this place is the fact that I was dining with my beloved wife. For starter, the place is so dark that you can't even see what you are putting in your mouth. But that's not a capital offense. The food is the real culinary crime being committed against humanity here. The server has the audacity to tell us the fish is imported from Japan when we asked about where they buy their fish. If you have any standards in sushi at all, you wouldn't put the frozen, low-grade fish in your mouth.  I should point out that this is not an authentic Japanese place. One of the simplest tests you can use is to taste a Japanese restaurant's tempura. If the breading is not the light, authentic Japanese tempura breading, like this place, this should be a good sign that this place has no idea what real Japanese cooking is like. This places uses ""fried jalapeno"" type of breading...too thick and over-powering on the taste buds. I checked out their website and saw that they received the Best of Chicago from Chicago Magazine and the Zagat award for excellence in 2004. That may be the case, but those days are long gone. The website also claims that they use the freshest ingredients and top quality fish from around the world - I find this claim hard to believe. You don't have to take my word for this. Try this place out yourself and be prepared to be disappointed...that is unless you like eating in a lounge / club atmosphere, then I guess you could accept the low quality of the food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Service: God Awful! Food: Just okay I have been to a number of Indian Restaurants and found the buffet was decent but nothing special. The naan was subpar, dry and cold and I have had better just about anywhere on Devon. The buffet staples such as chicken tikka masala were a bit lacking in flavor. Now, on to the service which was, as I said, probably some of the worst service I've had anywhere. We had a reservation for 10 and expected that if we showed up on time ( to a substantially less-than-packed house no less) we would be accomodated. This was not the case. Our server then dumped half a martini on my coworker while unelegantly serving our drinks. An honest mistake, but he didn't bother to apologize, offer a replacement, take it off the bill, or even acknowledge. Just went right along yelling out drinks for us to claim (since he clearly had no recollection of who ordered what). Once the drinks were literally ""dumped off"" we never saw our server again until he brought the bill around. The general attitude amongst hosts, servers, etc. was that they were doing you a favor. Will never be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A lot has already been said about Alinea so I'll just add some highlights of the 5 star meal: * I had a lot of trouble getting a Friday night table for the weekend that my wife and I were going to be in Chicago but finally was able to secure a table the day before. My recommendation to get a table: get on the waiting list for your desired time and call 24 hours before to see if there have been any cancellations. Worked for me. * Food was fun, fantastic, and beautiful. There are only 2 menus, the 12 course Tasting ($125) and the 24 course Tour ($175). Very expensive, yes, but worth it (in my mind) for a truly unique dining experience.  If you're in from out of town like we were, I recommend springing for the Tour. If you get the Tasting, you may see some great looking dishes being brought to other tables that you won't get on the Tasting. * If you're on the Tour, don't eat any bread. You will barely be able to finish all the food in the Tour itself. Trust me on this. * The Sommelier poured us some great wine to drink with our meal but it was *extremely* expensive so be careful if you're trying to keep your meal cost out of the stratosphere. I'm talking $22 a glass! * Service is some of the best I've ever experienced. * As you can read in the other reviews, the food here comes in very novel and strange presentations with unusual combinations of tastes - but it's all great. Make sure to come with an open mind and you'll really be in for a treat. * Very cool entryway and door to the restaurant - but sort of unmarked so don't be confused. Cool interior. * They give you a printed menu to take home with you after the meal, which is helpful for remembering what you ate (24 courses is a lot). You can also take pictures with your camera or camera phone if you want to. In summary: I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is seriously overrated. Probably because Chicago's a meat packing town, so every vegetarian/vegan restaurant seems like an oasis of health and vitality. Chicago Diner gets two stars instead of one just for being brave enough to be hella close to Wrigleyville, which is a meat-eating, beer-swilling hive of nutritional (and cultural) insensitivity. Wrigleyville is like one big frat house in Alabama. But anyway. I was looking for a such a haven when I had the misfortune to be caught hungry in Wrigleyville. I decided to head to the Diner, as I hadn't tried it and it's gotten such mixed reviews. As I was heading into the restaurant, these two guys come out griping about how bad it was; that should have been an indication of something. The food's overpriced and not nearly as good as Soul Veg, and the service-yikes! They'll keep you waiting, man, they don't care.

"The beer selection is awesome but their food is sub par at best. We started with the croquettes and frites- ok, nothing special. The fries were a little soggy for my taste but I like a fried potato so I ate them. For my main I got the montreal style brisket sandwich. Montreal style at Hopleaf must mean dry, rubbery and flavorless because that's exactly what I got. It was so tough that I couldn't even manage to bite into it and keep it on the bread, the whole sandwich fell apart. My brother in law got the brisket plate and didn't fair any better with a knife and fork. My husband had the CB&J which was good- maybe a decent addition to a brunch menu but not what I would serve for dinner and we also had the stone fruit salad which was a joke. It didn't help that we had to wait forever to get our food- dinner took us over 2.5 hours- totally fine because we were with good company and everyone was enjoying their beers but I couldn't help looking over to see if our table was the lucky one when a waiter with dishes walked by. I know we weren't the only ones because the table next to us asked the waiter three times about their dishes and delay. I wanted to love this place because of the beer selection but that's not happening. Perhaps they should stick to what they are good at.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm really stoked on this place. I walked over here with my girl after dinner in the area. This place is pretty much perfect. Dim lighting, very old style Chicago vibe, fantastic bartenders (Joe is pretty much the man). We sat at the bar and perused the menu for a second and then, half joking, I asked Joe is he could make an Elk's Own. Challenge accepted. He not only knew the cocktail I spoke of, but he also made it fantastically. In all seriousness though, the bartenders are all great and this is, fur sure, a cocktail bar. Don't come in here and order a Stoli red bull, because they don't have Stoli and they surely don't have energy drinks. Do yourself a favor and get a sazerac or negroni or something.The food was also really good. I highly suggest that you try the cornbread. It's amazing.

"I just tried Wildfire out for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was a sunday evening and we were freezing from having spent an hour outside in the cold walking around at the zoo. We warmed up with a nice bottle of malbec and I had the peppercorn crusted filet (Medium). The filet was cooked to perfection and the redskin mashed potatoes were delicious. I was completely full from having eaten a smore and drank a large cocoa at the zoo in addition to my meal but I managed to split dessert with my girlfriend which were miniature keylime pie slices. Yes, I was glutunous and I paid for it later. Food wise, it was a great place to eat. As for atmosphere, it lacks any identity. There are large black & white photos of old movie stars and musicians which give it a somewhat generic feel. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch but with the River North location it tends to bring a very touristy crowd. The price is not exactly cheap so I expected the clientale to dress a little better. I'm not saying everyone needs to be decked out but I think people walking around in sweatpants and football jerseys steals a little class from the place. I can't fault Wildfire for having patrons who dress badly but I can at least be the voice of the fashion police and try to persuade a few people to have some class and dress it up a little. Jeans and a nice shirt will do. If you want to wear pajamas order delivery at home or go to McDonalds.","[0.0, 1.0]"
