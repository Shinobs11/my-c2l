"Great spot to grab food before a show at the Riviera theater. The food was really good and flavorful (note: we picked the spicy options). Service was slow, but understandable since it was so busy for a Monday night (and since the waitress was lovely and super nice). Wine and beer were reasonably priced, but not the best we've had (however, maybe we made bad selections). If you have two people, get the messob for ONE - plenty of food!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Working nearby this restaurant, we order frequently from here. The lunch special is such a good deal and includes a lot of food. Delivery is very prompt, and we usually put in a large order and it is correct. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I always get the Pad Thai and it is always satisfying and delicious. I enjoy giving them business.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The place is pretty cool, maybe just a little too trendy for me, but worth visiting on a special occasion. The food is fine and the staff are very friendly and nice, but I want to mention the do-it-yourself fruit sodas. What happens is you get a big glass beaker of seltzer water and a small beaker of flavoring/syrup of the fruit of your choice. Then you mix the two in your glass, making the drink as sweet as you'd like. It makes you feel like a kid playing with a chemistry set. Clever, fun and delicious.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Definitely not your average Irish pub. This is what I would call an upscale version of an Irish pub, but it's still unpretentious and approachable. It's a great place for after work/class on a weekday or for going out on the weekend. I met up with some friends here on a Saturday night, and we stayed in a cozy little booth the entire night. Drinks were reasonably priced, and the music was great. We were definitely feeling the DJ. Definitely would like to find a spot by the fireplace/library section next time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Quite possibly the most disappointing dinner experience ever. Understanding that this may have been because I went in with such high expectations I'm still giving it 2 stars. This is supposed to be the most romantic spot in Chicago. What's romantic about sitting less than three inches from the table next to you? Yes, its dimly lit and has nice decor...but my fiance and I seriously sat there and listened to the conversations of the people next to us because we couldn't talk to each other!Where are the choices? There is one cheese, one salad, one cooking style and one chocolate. WHAT? The cheese tasted like alfredo sauce gone wrong, the salad was drenched in dressing, the oil had no flavor (it was literally just oil in a pot and my piece of chicken came out looking like a chicken nugget) and the chocolate was runny. There is no presentation. Just a pot on a sterno.Service...was good. Not great, but good. He was very nice and didn't get anything wrong (although the only thing we actually ordered was wine and type of meat). The hostess was also very polite.My fiance and I have had fondue a number of times before this and it was by far our worst fondue experience. If you're in the mood for fondue, hit up The Melting Pot or pick up a fondue cook book and do it yourself. Both are better options.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food was Americanized. WE got Family Style---What a joke. Childsize portions and way overpriced. Rude waiter, and above all it was for my birthday.

"I have been to Yolk many times and have enjoyed coming to this restaurant repeatedly for the past year or so. if you plan on trying it out on a Saturday or Sunday arm yourself with patience, as the wait is long, sometimes up t 40+ minutes. That said, I think it is worth it. Portions are large, the variety of food offered would satisfy some of the pickiest eaters, and the waitstaff is nice. The only downside to it...looks a bit like a cafeteria, impersonal, and they don't serve mimosas (a must for many Lakeviewers). Don't mind the distance, or the wait, but have a mimosa ready for me when I get there!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was really excited to eat at Graham Elliot. Reading the menu, and listening to our waiter explain the dishes, my wife and I wanted to try everything. We decided to order ala carte and share, instead of the the tasting menu, probably a mistake. Our selections included: Beef Carpaccio, Potato Bisque, Bouillabaisse Risotto, Wild Sturgeon, Pork Carnitas. Everything was bland. The best thing I had was a beer. We decided to skip dessert. I have no problem paying for a nice dinner, but after this meal, I felt ripped off. I did like our waiter until I heard him discuss the menu to the table next to us. He offered them the option of ordering from both the tasting menu and the ala carte menu. He told us we had to from one or the other. Even more disappointing, I only heard about the foie gras pops when he told the other table. The restaurant presents it's self as an elite high end establishment, promoting a name chef. Everywhere you look, are his initials. They even sell GE belt buckles. However, when the food is that much of a let down, it's pretentious and cocky. I would much rather go to Sepia or Fontera Grill.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Sophisticated & saucy drinks in a semi-secret speakeasy scene. Wear violet on Monday and your 2nd drink is on the house.

"The pasta here is fantastic. Its all handmade, and you can tell. I've had the Chicken Tortellini and the Lobster Ravoli - both were cooked perfectly. The menu is always changing, but the ingredients stay constant. Service is great (all four times I have visited)  I would have given it five stars except for the weak wine menu by the glass (bottle menu is extensive). Also, its a bit of tight squeeze in there. All in all, this place is a great italian restaurant and I would highly recommend it...enjoy.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here on a Tuesday night for the cooking class. It was my favorite type of cooking class because it didnt require me to get up and do anything! It was basically more like a demonstration. The demonstration lasted from 6pm to 7:30pm. After the demonstration, we dug into a buffet dinner. The PHO was OUTSTANDING. We were only given one bowl of it though. I really wish that were unlimited. The buffet dinner consisted of a chicken and veggie dish, a veggie dish, and a salmon dish. The salmon dish was REALLY REALLY good. The other dishes were only okay. But the rating comes from the customer service they provide here. It was sooo exceptional. The servers were constantly refilling our drinks. They even gave us smoothies! I tried the watermelon and the mango smoothie. Definitely go for the watermelon one. Afterwards when we left, one of the owners asked us for our names and thanked us so much for coming. He was such a happy funny man! If I lived in this area I would definitely come here all the time. Food is authentic and made with passion, especially that PHO broth soup!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Husby and I kicked at old school at the Dawg a couple weekends ago. It was already packed around the time they opened on a Sunday, and we were just able to cruise on into one of the last available spots.  Are the dogs overpriced? You betcha. The service kinda slow? Uh huh. Still, I heart the retro vibe of ordering from a drive up and having someone bring a tray of goodies that attaches to the side of my car.

They now have a back room by the patio that is so quaint and cute it would be perfect for a small intimate party.

"Total experience: 2 stars Churros: 10 stars The line was long at 10:30am, and the whole process of ordering and getting seated was much less efficient and more confusing than necessary, but presumably they will work that out. Manager and cashier were friendly, which helped. Gunthoro chicken sandwich had a nice flavor, but way too many onions and the squishy ingredients slid right out of the hard crunchy bread every time I took a bite, making a big mess. But then came the churros. In case you don't love churros quite as much as me, let me give you a scale: 2 = churros at the fair or a street stand. Sad, frozen pastries that have been reheated and are overpriced, but that you occasionally buy anyway in a fit of delusional optimism or out of a desperate need for carbs in which anything made of dough and dusted in sugar will do. 4= costco churro. Fresher. But just a pleasant pastry, as opposed to the delectable delight that a churro could be. 8 = fresh churros in Mexico. You watch them get fished out of a vast pot of boiling oil. Sprinkled with sugar, and put into a brown paper bag that quickly turns translucent with grease. Your delight in the deliciousness is slightly tempered by the knowledge that this is really, really bad for you. 10 = xocos. These had all the freshness of Mexican churros, without the grease. And, bonus, in addition to granular sugar and cinnamon, they are crusted with little pieces of Mexican chocolate for extra flavor. Truly, truly amazing. Rick, open a churro window. Seriously, that huge line waiting for food and a place to sit, how many of them would happily fork over their cash for a quick churro? You could serve churros as fast as you could scoop them into a paper bag, and have so so many more happy customers every day. Churro window. Seriously.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Don't you hate when you order something called Mango Beef and there is hardly any mango or beef in it? Me too! Finding myself at Simply It for a group gathering, we had a broad selection of items brought to our table for tasting. The portions and variety were abundant. Everything tasted fresh and yummy too. I particularly liked the dumplings, pot stickers, Chicken Lemongrass, and the dessert, Fried Banana with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. But what really got me were two things: 1. The service was actually JOLLY! The staff were more than happy to pour our BYO wine, not cover their ears to shield from all of the ""lady chatter"", and did it all with a smile on their face. 2. One of the girls told me the story of the owner. Apparently he was abandoned by his two partners in the restaurant venture. Instead of giving up, he has pressed on to singularly insist that this business succeed. Now that is a vision I want to support! Thank you Simply It for the hospitality and phenomenal deals.

"If you are a vegetarian, do NOT go to this place. I asked the waiter if there was cheese in the marianara sauce (there was) so I decided just to have a baked potato. The waiter then proceeded to get into an argument with me, telling me he and his family had eaten meat their entire lives, and that vegetarians ""were what is wrong with the world today"". It took about 5 minutes of berating before he finally accepted that I wasn't going to order anything else. I've never experienced such bad service, ever. The place is also extremely overcrowded, with waiters bumping into one another and patrons of the restaurant, even while carrying food that's on fire. One even dropped a lit sparkler on the carpet. I definitely would not recommend going to this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"As often as I go to this place and as much as I love it, I've been too lazy to review it. I dine in and carry out on a fairly regular basis.

When I dine in I take advantage of their roasted 1/4 chunk of a chicken and 2 sides and drink for like 6 dollars. It's amazing. It's probably the best chicken I've had in Chicago. When we carry out it's always pizza, they do buy one get one half off, and my favorite is the Allexia. We order online from work and pick it up on the way home, it's always ready when we get there, and it goes great with Fat Tire or 1554. If you're going to have a pizza and beer night, do it with Fogo. Just a forewarning. This place is SMALL. They have maybe 3 or 4 tables for sitting so it's not a good place to dine in with a group.","[0.0, 1.0]"

And the potatoes are amazing!! I've also had Arni Fournou with rice and a tomato sauce - also really great. The Mousaka is good, but not as good as the Arni Fournou. Both times I've had it the Mousaka, it wasn't heated properly. Their service is hit or miss.

"Let me be clear, this is a 4 star place, but my experience I had a ZERO star waitress.From the second we arrived she literally argued with us on everything. In a society in which we tip based on cost of food, not effort, who does that?We requested a seat away from the sun. The waitress sits us right by one of the huge windows saying its not even sunny out. Lady, if your room is lit by the sun and you can read, the sun is out. As we asked her about the items we were interested in her answers turned out to be incorrect in both quantity and contents of what was in the order.When asked how many eggs were in each item she gave a RANGE!. What recipe doesnt use a specific amount?The food, while not what we asked for was very good, however not worth coming back for for someone who acts like this.

"Framing: Went there with 5 friends for a brunch on Saturday at 11 am. We had to wait until around 11:30 for our table. We each ended up paying around $20 including tip. Food: AWESOME!!! Everything we had was delicious and the menu was ridiculous. EVERYTHING is on there so expect intense debate and indecision. Tons of pancakes, waffles, eggs, french toast, fruits, etc. And everything was well prepared. I had the bacon lover's omelet and survived without being rushed to the hospital for coronary problems. Others with me had strawberries on greek yogurt, strawberry stuffed french toast, one of the skillets, and pancakes. Everyone cleaned their plates. Service: Good but not great, and in typical American style, they rush you when you are done eating. Same restaurant in Amsterdam would be awesome. Eat, talk, relax and enjoy time with friends without feeling you must run when done with the last bite. hostess and other servers are just not that friendly. Not nasty, per se, but certainly not exactly pleasant AT ALL. Decor: Who cares overall if decor is not that great, but in this case the restaurant is kind of cute but not kitsch. It is, however, WAY too crowded and we were crammed over near the window, barely able to move and definitely not able to get up. Not a pleasant experience unless you are REALLY comfortable with your table. I felt like I was sexually harassing my friend sitting next to me because I kept accidentally rubbing against his inner thigh. AWKWARD!! DRAWBACKS: 1) Wait was minimized for the group but only because I arrived 10 minutes earlier. Total wait was about 45 minutes. I could see this being a major pain for many people when there are options nearby with less of a wait. But I have waited for Original House of Pancakes on Bellvue and that was much longer. 2) Staff not friendly. 3) MOST NEGATIVE: There are no mimosas or bloody mary's. Who has brunch without those????????? And when I asked, the server gave me SERIOUS attitude. ""We are a breakfast place and have not even tried to get a license for alcohol"" I am not an alchie, but find brunch without mimosas just ... well, breakfast!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife and I travel to Chicago several times per year. About two months ago, we were walking through downtown. Around 10:00, we wanted a late dinner. We saw Ruth Chris and decided to give it a try. Even at this late hour, the place was packed. We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who seated us at the bar promptly. It is hard not to be impressed by the interior design and architecture of this place. It is truly stunning.Our Bartender was an extremely pleasant young man in his upper 30's with curly hair. We ordered a couple of drinks, a seafood appetizer and our entrees. I ate the seafood; and was excellent. The bartender and I talked about how it was prepared - similar to his family recipe... (Joe is his name) Joe kept us on our toes with funny stories and nice compliments- I almost forgot to try the seafood special I had ordered! It did not disappoint; nor did my wife's meal, but Joe was the highlight of our dining experience. Needless to say, this was an excellent experience. In a crowded, somewhat loud, steakhouse in the the heart of Chicago; I felt like I was having dinner at friend's home. My only regret is that I don't remember Joe's (I think his name was Joe) last name so I could publicly acknowledge his incredible service. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to speak to the manager before we left, and rave about this rare experience. My wife and I live in Cincinnati and we are both pretty high on the food chain where we work. If half of my or my Wife's employees/co-workers were as friendly, experience, or knowledgeable as Joe is our company would be better off!

"Having just landed in Chicago a few hours before, I was anxious to try some of the world-famous 'deep dish' pizza, particularly being born in New York and privy to their specialty pizza for a number of years. A coworker of mine had visited this restaurant before on good word and promised me I would be impressed. We sat down and ordered and received some unsolicited advice from a fellow patron at the next table. He said that although each pizza would take approximately 40 mins to make, it would be well worth it. A few mins later, this patron (having finished one slice of his pizza and half a beer) got up and left. The wait staff looked panicked for a few minutes and after asking about it, we discovered he had just boned out. Interesting that he would take the time to compliment the restaurant before ditching without paying the bill. Regardless, we were more than happy with our dinner, the pie was thick, had plenty of cheese and ingredients, and covered with a sauce that reminded me of my Italian grandmother's marinara. I was very impressed and will make it a point to revisit this restaurant the next time I'm in the windy city.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My advice start with 2-3 meats you want (plus the pineapples, my favorite), then flip the thing to black so you can enjoy eating in piece then flip it over again to get more. It's quite hard and almost disturbing to eat with a constant flow of dudes waving knives and skewers of meat in front of you!

The idea of the popcorn at the beginning was cutesy, but it was very tasty. The desconstructed Italian beef was tasty, but I didn't care for the bun. Luckily, this would be the only think the whole meal that I didn't like. My second app, a creamy (squash? sweet potato?) soup was awesome... ginger infused marshmallow that melted for the cream? Awesome! Spicy jam to mix in? Awesome! My only small complaint, which I realize at about this point of the meal, is that they are going to elaborate on every dish in a really monotone, bored manner. Either don't elaborate on every ingredient, or don't act like it pains you to do so. Easy enough! My pork belly entree was pretty good as well, but was quickly overshadowed by the best flourless chocolate cake ever. Damn, that was a tasty meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After the first bite of the warm potato/grilled octopus starter, my partner and I looked at each other and said, ""We don't have to travel to Italy anymore."" Seriously. Everything that chef Carlos Ysaguirre makes is as good as anything you'd eat in Italy. And for the same reasons -- he gets the best ingredients from the best local farmers, and then gets out of the way. The trofie al pesto was even better than what we had in Liguria (birthplace of the dish) a year ago -- restrained and elegant, rustic and hearty -- all at the same time. The food, the service, the ambience -- all are superb.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"$13 for a Caprese salad? $9 for garlic bread that is made on mushy bread that you would expect to find at Walmart? Spaghetti for $17 swimming in half an inch of olive oil with so much garlic that you stop after 3 bites?

"Dear Lord! like I needed another place to stuff my face while I am trying to get healthier. This place is awesome! I have been here twice and My boy friend ( big beer enthusiast) pretty much ordered the entire left side of the menu as well as several beers. BEERZ I have the Bottom up Belgian Wit , and as far as that style goes it was good but not special. The boy had several hoppier brews that i cannot re-call but he seemed pleased with them. Foodz We started with the Cheddar ale soup It was good( beer- good, Cheese - good, beer and cheese great!) Then we also decided that we wanted to try the mussels we chose the Hard Cider, blue cheese, leek, fuji apple variety and ended up very pleased, i think I t could have used more blue cheese to balance out the sweetness of the cider but it was good. I had the Smoked & Grilled Tofu sandwich with Baby spinach, beer onion, sun-dried tomato spread I loved it! smoking does a lot to add depth and flavor to tofu and I would not hesitate to get this again. My dining partner got the tempeh Reuben and he liked it just so so, we have both had better veggie Reuben's. We actually had room for desert which was a special of the day and it was a cake with Bourbon cherries! so very good. The second time we went we both got fish and chips and the were pretty good as far as that goes. We also had a very attentive server! so a plus all the way around.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"First brunch at Milk & Honey this Sunday, finally braved the line and was happy we did. Huevos Rancheros in a casserole was divine, oatmeal pancakes with blueberries and peaches sublime and delicious iced green tea. The thing that impressed was the consistency of the food coming out of a busy Sunday brunch kitchen; every dish looked the same. High quality is only as good as the consistency, and Milk and Honey must be taking good care of their kitchen staff because you need happy employees to put out high volume, high quality, consistent dishes that look beautiful and taste great.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We stumbled into Demera after our favorite, Queen of Sheba (with it's terribly erratic hours) was randomly closed (on a Friday night, no less!) Alas, I left my BYO booze in the back seat as we trekked through the snow to non-byo friendly Demera. Demera, from the moment we walked it, was obviously an upgrade, with more upscale decor and the appropriate track lighting. I'll ditto what people were saying on the wait- it was probably about 30 minutes before we were attended to and even longer before we got our food. Food-wise, we had a lentil samosa-like appetizer that was great. Entree-wise, the food was about twice as expensive as Sheba, although delicious. My only gripe was that the food lacked some of that spicy ""kick"" that I've had at other ethiopian joints. In sum, the food was solid and satified my craving for ethiopian, but slow service and above average prices might make you want to think about some of the other joints further north on Broadway.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Bacon Popcorn = Overrated. Came out cold & the cheese on top looked like a sheep's bellybutton lint. Chicago Style Tofu Dog = Tofu was good, but not in the shape of a hotdog, in fact it was 2 small rectangles that were perfect because the bun was the stalest thing I have eaten since I was a prostitute. The relish was insanely neon which I really liked. Sport peppers were big and tasted fresh. Baked Potato Pizza = It was actually quite good at first but the second piece tasted richer than the creator of the IPad. Who has been reported as richer than the federal government, so yeah. It was pretty rich. Mashed Potatoes with Cream Cheese and Garlic = tastiest thing here that I have had so far. I tasted a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good.

"I had a chance to visit the cold Windy City in October 2011. I asked what is to try out here, and everybody said Giordano's. I was told to try the pizza however I opted to have the Italian Beef sandwich instead with the Antipasto salad. Excellent. Very tasty food and the service was very good too. Met some other people there that was also their first time eating at Giordano's. Great vibe environment. I had planned to come back and try the pizza there the next day. Too bad I had to travel out of Chicago unexpectedly the next morning. Maybe next time. Now that I think of it more, the Italian Beef was so good that there is a big chance that I will choose it again before trying the pizza in the future :-P","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is my favorite Chicago Pizza place to get Pizza by the slice for their Pan and Stuffed. Their crust for each has a nice buttery softness that's a little easier to bite into than other pan or stuff places, like Giordano's (which I also love). Crust has just the right amount of flavor, not overdone. Cheese and ingredients are fresh and reasonably priced.  Their thin crust is generous on the cheese and, like their Pan/stuff crust, has plenty of flavor. Their thin Meaty Delight is my favorite chicago-styled thin crust pizza in the city. I am not a meat lovers fan either, but this is the exception to that. The inside is casual, BYOB, and plenty of seating. Though it's not a place that's really known as a dine-in restaurant, mainly because their service and quality is great on their delivery and carry-out. That said, a good amount of people bring in beer on weekends for dine-in. Definitely not your typically deserted take-out place. They also have great weekly deals on non-pizza menu items.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So, we were apartment hunting in the area and STARVING, so when we drove by I remembered this girl at work talking about how she loved this place and that's how we walked in. There were four of us and not one of us had ever experienced 'southern' cooking. the fried green beans were out of this world, and the Shrimp Fricassee (sp?) was amazing, i wanted to have it as my main course! the mac and cheese wasn't amazing as i had been lead to believe, but it was still good. our entrees were OK, and the only suck was our waiter must have taken 4 smoke breaks, bc he would disappear and then come talk to us and spew tobacco all over. gag. oh, and the lights above the table were really cool, except for the inch of dust covering them. you almost want to eat like a prisoner, hovering over your food so something doesn't fall on it when the AC kicks on. OK, so that makes the place sound bad, but the food was really good, maybe next time we'll take it to-go/?","[1.0, 0.0]"

The menu changes very frequently so don't expect to see the same thing twice. However if you do remember what you like they'll definitely make it again later. Food is OK, but this is not a place to go to eat. Just drink.  Bring a couple people from out of town, but don't go in groups larger than 4 or you'll never get a table.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I enjoy Yolk, have been many times. We went on a Friday about 10:30, the place was packed. Our server came to our table and asked if we wanted coffee. I noticed on one of the menus that they had pumpkin latte, so I ordered that, and our server poured coffee for my husband. I was a little surprised when the latte came & it was the same size coffee mug that my husband had. His coffee was $2.55 & the latte was $4.49, which I would not mind, if, the latte was finished in 2 sips. I had corned beef hash, eggs, potatoes and 2 pancakes. The potatoes were cold on both my meal & my husband's Pot Roast Benedict. I didn't say anything cause I knew I was going to take them home. On the Benedict, the fruit was kind of swimming in the hollandise sauce. I had to wash all of it to use it at home. Huge portions, always good to take home. Service was just ok, I know we will go back, if you are hungry this is the place to go. Food is good, service, well, I've have better and I've had worst.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My previous review was nothing, but glowing. However, after a recent visit to Icosium, I have decided to downgrade the rating. They still serve the same tasty food, but the portions have dwarfed in size, on top of hiking up the prices. The salad we used to frequently order, now costs about $15.00, after tax and has shrunk to about 3/4 of the size it was before. Sure, the menu states to create your own salad it is $10.00, but an additional $4.00 to add a meat. Really, for a few small pieces of chicken-- $4.00?! It's plain ridiculous. What we loved about coming to Icosium was that it was inexpensive for fresh, delicious food. This place isn't a high-end establishment by any means, so what's with the high-end prices for a salad? Oh, by the way, they only take cash now. No more credit cards. We won't be paying Icosium a visit any time again soon, which is quite sad.","[0.0, 1.0]"

If you're going to see a movie at the theater across the street, give yourself about two hours to come here and get a delicious dinner beforehand.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After a drunken night, I woke up very hungover and NEEDING some pizza. I called Domino's around 1pm. At 2pm they called me back to inform me they lost power and would make my pizza as soon as it came back. At 3pm they called to say the power wouldn't be on until 4 and I wouldn't see my pizza until after 5. So despite my craving for the delicious cheesy bready and doughy pizza crust of my trusty Domino's (not my favorite pizza normally, but I love it when I am hung over) I decided to take a chance and order from the Art of Pizza. By the time we found the menu, figured out what we wanted, and placed the order it was about 3:30. By the time the pizza came - it was 4:50. Perhaps had I not waited almost 4 hours from the start of my pizza quest to get it, I might have liked this more. But I just compared it to my Domino's and it fell short. The cheesey bread had no flavor - no herbs like D's, no marinara dipping sauce like D's. The pizza had the pepperoni under the cheese - sad becasue I like to pick mine off and eat it first. The crust was also too thick and hard at the top. I did like the fact that they had things other than pizza, so I could order a sandwich and fries for the fiance. But the fries were soggy and his sandwich only so-so. For $30 with delivery and tip, I would have rather had Domino's. I will say though, the pizza was actually better the day after which earns it a few points.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Graham Elliot is a cool restaurant. I took my foodie parents here and everyone enjoyed their meal. However, there was one minor disappointment We were given a truffle/parmesan popcorn appetizer that sounds great, but in reality the popcorn was stale or too wet. Other than that minor deviation we enjoyed the ""experience"". GE is one of those places where the meals are pretty challenging. We had a cuttlefish linguini that challenged our pallets and I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. The consensus amongst us was that it should taste good, therefore it does... This is the problem with a place like Graham Elliot, the food can be challenging and delicious. So, I wouldn't come here if I was just looking for a great meal.

"Um, how can I say, I love having a Hispanic boyfriend who knew about this place! Unbelievable!  I could sit in front of a bottomless bowl of their complimentary soup for hours!

La Choza was the best and so was the owner Sylvestor, and if anyone has fond memories they would like to share, let me know!  That being said, I think Nuevo Leon is the closest thing that I have found. The mole was rich, thick, and delicious. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed which is always a good sign. I loved the decor, I loved the families that were seated around us, and I loved the food.

"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here more times than I can count, and I have had maybe one or two ""OK"" meals. Everything else has been good to excellent. The servings are generous, but not overly huge. The quality of the food is very high, and everything is usually very tasty. The menu is hand-written and then photocopied. I am not sure if it changes daily or what, but the selection is always fresh. Despite not being very big, there are always multiple things on the menu that sound good to me and it's tough to make a decision! They do a standard brushcetta and a special one that is always changing. They always have several pizzas, pastas and entrees. They are accommodating of special requests; if there is a chicken dish that is not boneless, they'll gladly make it with boneless chicken breast if you ask. The prices are in line with what you get. The service is generally pretty good. The staff is friendly but professional, and they're not attitude-y or stuck up. Now, the downsides: There can be a long wait for a table sometimes, especially on the weekends. In fact, last time I tried to go they said 2.5 hours! Needless to say, I went somewhere else. But that was uncharacteristically long for them, so I don't penalize them for it. The upside of the waiting is that they have three bars (main dining room, coach house and upstairs). The other downside is that the main dining room is VERY loud and VERY crowded. I don't really like to eat down there. Insider tip: Ask to get seated upstairs. Same food and service, but more spacious and less noisy.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"As Portillo's is for the Hot Dog, I would argue that Gino's is the quintessential deep dish pizza experience. Sure, it has a lot of competition (Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Giordano's, etc.) and these competitors are almost equally as good and shouldn't be discounted. You can't go wrong with any of these places. But, I'd argue (and call it personal preference) something about the Gino's East experience pushes it over the top. I think I just like the facets of the Gino's pie slightly better... from the way the crust is made to the tomatoes on top. From the writing all over the walls to the quality of the food, Gino's is sure to provide an extremely memorable dining experience.  Also, side note: Make sure to check out all the celebrity autographs by the bathroom.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I freakin' love this place, so much so that I will break my own rule, and rate a place that has over 100 reviews already.  First, the menu is extensive. I bring everyone I know here. Someone visits from out of town - we HAVE to have brunch at Yolk, not only because I am a brunch whore, but because there is something for everyone (except the discerning organic nazi or the vegan). Every visitor I have taken has sung the praises of this place. For the meat eaters in the crowd, the country skillet is fabulous - my dad was sold with this concoction with multiple kinds of meat thrown together with the potatoes and eggs any way your picky egg eater wants. Oh, and they truly deal with their namesake well - no undercooked or overcooked eggs here. For the ovo-lacto vegetarian types, there are a bazillion options, including the delish pancakes and french toast, or the veggie skillet in which the asparagus is actually cooked well! The eggs florentine, the spin on the benedict without the pig, will also serve those veggies well. My roommate salivates for the Sante Fe Frittata bi-monthly, loving the way they throw in both jalepenos and avocados in this piece de resistance. Personally, I try something new everytime. The eggs benedict is fabulous. The hollandaise is homemade. The eggs are poached to perfection. The scramlers are really well done, especially the cajun one - delicious! I love their omelettes! And I am a girl who really doesn't like pancakes, but I actually split a side order with my Sante Fe Frittata loving roommate because these are deliciousely cake-y. The food selection and its preparation is what makes me come back time and again to Yolk. Yes, if you go during peak brunch hours on the weekend, there will be a wait, it is just that good - and popular. Duh. It happens. If it sucked there would be no one there. Because of this, service is quick moving, but not usually bad. Oh yolk, how I love thee. That is why I make the pilgrimage at least once a month to sample your delectable delights. I fully endorse others to do the same! (And take in the smoldering Greek fella calling on the line - mmm - he is Yolk eye candy, indeed!)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Worst Pizza in Chicago, but #1 for personal abuse!I saw the sign - ""Best Pan Pizza in Chicago."" I've been seeing that sign for a couple of years. I saw some good reviews online, and then I heard (2nd hand) that it was great. So I pack up my daughter, and off we go.What we find is no table service - just a cafeteria-type counter and a lot of slices we can order. There's a nice variety and we order a few different slices to try. We find a table, sit down, go find some silverware (there is no waitstaff here at all), and start to eat.We discover that all the pizza we are eating is undercooked - the dough is raw, and the meats are still pink inside - totally disgusting! We take them up to the counter, and the manager refuses to even look at the pizza slices we're complaining about. ""That's the way we serve our pizza, and if you don't like it, that's too bad."" He shouted it so loud, the whole restaurant heard it.They didn't even refund my money.

"I have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since I never really developed an appreciation for Chinese cuisine in general. Sadly, this restaurant didn't help. They were out of the pea shoot dish, so we ordered the Chinese broccoli and it was tasty. We also order chicken sizzling rice soup, which turned out to be inedible goop akin to pork and beans. Yes, we ordered soup and, instead of broth, a bowl of liquid with the consistency of pork and beans arrived at our table. GROSS. We also got the fried chicken that comes with szechuan peppers. I didn't really care for the dish as it wasn't discernibly spicy, the chicken meat was almost non-existent, and it was oilier than a little ceasar's pizza. There seemed to be a language barrier (even though I went with a person who spoke Chinese) and the total bill topped $60 for lunch for two people...in Chinatown.

"2 Hostesses were very rude and disrespectful. So disappointing! So i would have given this place five star right of the bat, because i love their burgers and beers, HOWEVER...Last night, the 2 hostesses managed to disrespect me and my friends in the two seconds that we were in there. As we were walking into the restaurant, the two women receiving the customers saw that we had left over beers from the Maifest. They both started waiving their hands on our faces saying ""hey, you can't bring those in here."" They immediately escorted us out of the entrance way to the street. I was appalled and taken aback!!! So this may sound like its not a big deal, right? WRONG! How hard is it to say, "" Im sorry, those are not allowed in here."" Wouldn't that have been more civilized to say? We felt like dogs being shooed away. These two women were staring at us from the window like we had done them wrong afterwards.

"I had never eaten at a fondue restaurant, I was ready for anything. Firstly, it's very dark inside with an orangey-red light. That was unexpected. They do cram a lot into a small space, making the dining area something of a maze. Room dividers are shelves of empty wine bottles, which is pretty cool. Our service was excellent, no complaints there! My girlfriend and I ordered the cheese & chocolate 3-course meal and split it. Having already eaten a pretty heavy lunch, this was more than enough food. The salad was good and the cheese fondue was excellent; the bread and veggies were too big to dip and eat so we had to cut them ourselves - food here is labor-intensive! I'd say, at least for this course, the work was worth it. We were expecting the chocolate fondue to be like melted Hersheys chocolate chips. What we got instead was more like Herseys chocolate syrup - good...but not as good as it could have been. If i wanted to dip stuff into chocolate syrup, I could do it at home for $5. The fresh fruit, berries and marshmallows were great and the pound cake was good, but I wish that the chocolate could have been melted rather than syrup. They have a fantastic gift certificate program and I'm looking forward to returning! The fruit alone would be a great dessert.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Churros- nice touch to end the meal.Come for the food, leave your complaining at home. One of the waitresses will warn you of the wait when you arrive so don't complain after you wait, it was your choice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is casual but alive with energy. Its menu is extensive and they are known for their quality junkfood and extensive burger menu. Vegetarians don't fret, they have a veggie burger option. They also have a quality bar that has a life of its own late at night. I recommend the cheese curds if you are looking for a great late night snack. Note that their bugers are HUGE, albeit delicious. Note the hilarious signs on the wall and on the bathroom door, they really give the place humor and personality. I will certainly be back to the fifty/50.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Another Rick Bayless Masterpiece :) BONUS: They serve Matilda (so automatically one of my favorite places :) We went shortly after Xoco opened last Fall, and also went during the week, so the wait wasn't as bad as it can be on the weekend. Nonetheless, you should expect at least a 30 minute wait! We had the guacamole, pepito and pork belly tortas-- all of which were amazing. We finished with churros and vanilla ice cream (to cut the heat).  Inexpensive, amazingly delicious food (and don't forget Matilda) made this one of my go to spots :) Highly recommended!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
I couldn't decide between 2 and 3. Sushi was yummy but not excellent. Ambiance and atmosphere was great. Service was awful. Our waiter came once to take our order and once to give us our bill (after being done eating for over 20 minutes). Nothing great. Probably will go there again just for convenience. Will give the downtown location a try.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been there couple times. I honestly think is very typical Chinatown restaurant but outside of Chinatown. I think the food is overpriced, but it seems that everyone else on the review didn't think so.

"We had a lot of expectations for this place, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. Not sure what happened, but when the whole table (7 people) ordered their burgers medium-rare, we all received well-done burgers, which was quite disappointing. The toppings were good, and since it was a holiday weekend, we relayed this to the waitress but offered to stick with out meals. She said she would talk to the kitchen and check what she wrote down, but never gave us any follow-up.Our experience aside, the burgers are well-thought out and the beer list is not bad (there's a lot of beer competition in the neighborhood, so adding some more exciting local taps like Three Floyds, Half Acre, Two Brothers, etc would really help).Though the Ukrainian Village has a lot of great places to eat, Lockdown is a welcome addition. I'd give it another chance - their heart is in the right place, hopefully we were just an off-night as far as the kitchen is concerned. The other positive experience on Yelp make it seem like my experience may have been an outlier.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It seems that the restaurant has come a long way in year. While I don't find the food quality to be 5-star, the service definitely isn't as bad as some reviewers have described a year ago. I'm actually even surprised it was as bad as some people say, because our waiter was a driving force behind my 3 stars. Being a Top Chef Masters fan, this was an obvious pick during my trip to Chicago. I went in with reasonably high expectations and GE hit close to the mark, but not quite. The cheddar risotto sounded SO GOOD, but was so average! The cheese-its were out of place and the bacon ""pancetta"" was all fat and no meat (for flavor, not eating I guess). As mentioned, the caesar salad was strange but tasty (the anchovies were good but the monster crouton wasn't worth the calories). For entrees, we all ordered seafood: Arctic char: Good, the brussel sprouts were great. Scallops: I still don't like scallops and even GE couldn't convince me that they're good. I didn't get to try the cod because my BF scarfed it down before I got the chance. So no review there. Which also leads me to my next point that the PORTIONS ARE TINY. Fill up on the delish popcorn, how can you go wrong with truffle oil and Parmesan? The bill was enormous considering we didn't order drinks, and definitely over priced for what we were served. I wouldn't go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"enjoyed a leisurely saturday lunch here with two of my best and most demanding girls: neither of them can eat gluten, one of them is a vegetarian and the other can't have dairy. tall orders for any restaurant, but 90 miles had something for all of us. the vegetarian platter, vegetarian sandwich and chicken sandwich (sans bread!) were all great. this place does simple food very well -- loved the ""avocado on the side,"" perfectly ripe and served just with salt, pepper and olive oil. but my mango shake stole the show -- everyone who saw it was jealous and wanted one for themselves. the set-up in the outdoor enclosure was cozy and cute with a nice little fireplace keeping customers warm. if i lived in chicago, i'd come back here for sure.","[0.0, 1.0]"

By the way the dishes are presented you can tell that someone has taken alot of time and care on presentation and on taste!The decor was gorgeous and the website pictures does not do this place any justice.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.

"In the land of sub sandwiches and greasy fast food, Xoco stands alone. And if you time it right (I'm talking a super early/late lunch or a bad weather day), you can enjoy Xoco without the typical long wait. After a few visits, I have realized that I am disappointed with ordering anything other than the Ahogada. That's not to say that the other tortas aren't spectacular, it's just in my mind- the Ahogada reigns supreme. The spicy tomato broth is amazing and the picked onions add a zesty touch. It's awesome in every way. My husband's favorite is the Pepito, also a flavorful masterpiece. Don't even hesitate when they ask you about a dessert. The churros are a must-get. So, if for some reason you haven't tried Xoco yet, wait for the next blizzard or tornado warning, tell your boss you are taking an earlier lunch - and go enjoy Rick Bayless's culinary genius.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Daily specials for takeout are very good - salad and sizable entree for $8-9. Baked lasagna is a personal fave - with use of italian sausage in the meat sauce....mmmmm:) It will take me a long time to make my way through the menu, but I am up for the challenge.

"I've now been here twice so feel qualified to review... once for a glass of wine and some cheese, and once for the burger since it was featured in Chicago magazine and one of our bosses decided this merited a team lunch - who am I to argue! First off we went for wine on a Thursday. It was meant to be a gap filler - i was en route to O'Hare and needed a drink to make it through the labyrinthian hellhole - ahem, sorry - but I ended up wishing i had a whole evening there. This might be because at the time, they were doing a ridiculous deal where some wines were $10 a bottle... so ridiculous, we felt bad, and ordered some cheese. The selection of cheese is phenomenal, the server was very good and informative while patiently ignoring my irrational cheese foibles (turns out 'i don't like anything stinky' is both untrue and not terribly helpful). We had some unbelievably good feta, and... i can't remember the others. I do remember not being a fan of the dried bread cracker stuff that came with - proper bread and crackers for me, please, not an attempt at both at the same time. But, that's a minor detail, and I did like the grissini being on the table anyway. Second trip for the burger at lunch: 9 of us show up, they seat us immedtaiely, they take 9 seperate burger orders, all with different cheese, cooking instructions and relishes. They are delivered speedily and without fuss to the right people. I'd say mine was a bit more than medium rare, verging on medium so a little dry to my taste, but dammit it was still goooood (3 extra O's good, remember that). Fries also very very good, crispy and salty. I am most excited to go back and try their 'best grilled cheese in Chicago' given the standard of this meal. Negative - not feeling a lot of ambience in the restaurant for lunch, and STOP FILLING UP MY WATER. Hovering near my head while I take a sip only to then splosh the stuff all over the table? Stop it stop it stop it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Talk about bringing a slice of home with you, this place definitely brings me back! I was reading through the other reviews and hereis my input on them. First of all, I can honestly say being a Cuban from Miami that lived there all my life, THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTIC. Those puddles of oil and garlic in the bottom of your trays, the crowded restaurants, guess what? That is what a Cuban restaurant is all about. Why are people complaining about there being too many people in the first place? Isn't that the sign of a good restaurant? When I went there, the place was as packed as could be, but guess what? It took no longer than 7 minutes to receive my dinner. I went there expecting this place to be just as small as the other one, but was I surprised! Great memorabilia on the walls to look at, beautiful artwork on the outside while you enjoy your cafe cubano and tabaco in the patio, and most importantly, the best authentic Cuban food this side of Chicago has ever seen! I was a little skeptical at first about having a Cuban Sandwich on french bread, but I gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised. By the way, go to any Cuban restaurant in Miami and you will get the Picnic Shoestring Potatoes on all your sandwiches! So for the person that wrote that they were dissapointed about that, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO MIAMI! When I went, I took up their offer on the Masas de Puerco with Congri and Platanitos, as well as a side of Yuca. It was wonderfully prepared!!! The large fried chunks of pork were cooked just right with a great crunch on the outside, and soft juicy meat in the center. Top them off with some fresh lime juice, and you're in for a 10 minute vacation! The Congri was perfectly cooked with those hidden bacon bits and fat that makes the dish come alive. The platanitos were just as sweet as they can ever be, not overcooked and had just the right texture to add an amazing complement to the dish. The yuca was steamed just right, with the hint of garlic sauce on top that was amazing. I would have liked to see a little more garlic sauce on mine with some onions, but that's a personal preference. All of this, in a packed restaurant, and it took less than ten minutes. I couldn't finish the whole meal, so I took part of it home with me. I wanted to save room for a coffee, pastelito, and a smoke. Perfect way to end a great Cuban meal in the Chi. My recommendation: Go to this place, ask the owner what he recommends, and TRY IT! Trust me when I say that this place is the real deal. I thought I was going to miss my food when I left Miami, but this place helped me not miss it as much.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Best Breakfast Ever!!!So, you will have to wait to get a table and the service will most likely feel a little rushed to those accustomed to sitting around and chatting after their meal. But for me and E it's total worth it. We go here as a regular treat on Sundays when we aren't trying out new places for breakfast. Me and E have become eggs benedict connoisseurs and their varieties are always a crowd pleaser with some interesting variations that include crab cakes, salmon, and avocado. Don't miss out on their smoothie and juice bar. They have smoothies that put Jamba juice and orange Julius to shame. Everything is super fresh and homemade even their cornbeef hash which is something you don't often see. I am a savory kind of guy myself but their banana and nutella crepe is remarkable. You want skillets? They have em and they're fan-frickin-tastic. The only bummer about this place is that they don't serve booze/ Blood Mary's.All and all the very best...

"My affinity for ""diner food"" has placed me on either end of the diner spectrum, from greasy spoon to silver spoon--Glenn's Diner is definitely a silver spoon. Their take on a staple (scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast) includes melted parmesan and chives in the eggs and the tastiest potato pancake I've ever had. Breakfast is served all day, in true diner fashion, and often incorporates fresh fish specials, which is not my taste, but I've literally seen people drool over the crab cakes benedict. Speaking of fish, their full-wall menu board is covered in specials (the pretzled walleye caught my eye--might try it myself one day). For lunch, I've often had their salad w/ grilled chicken (and no iceburg-yay!) and it usually yields enough for two. The decor is fun and the staff is fantastic. You may be in for a wait if you come on the weekends, but believe me, it will be well worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Delicious flat iron steak salad with just the right balance of dried cranberries' and browned onions' sweetness combined with saltiness from tender slices of flavorful steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare without much blood. Even though I am not a fan of Blue Cheese and forgot to tell the restaurant to hold the dressing, I enjoyed my salad greatly (after I tried to mask the light blue cheese dressing with Ranch dressing). The Shoe string fries (sans blue cheese for me of course) were lightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily.  The Hellman burger was ok (juicy and flavorful) but not as good as Islands or Red Robin burgers. It is slightly pricey but not unusual for downtown restaurants.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The chips on the side were, I think, fried plantains. They where a great change to the normal fries or potato chips.

"Did you know that the enormous umbrella on the back patio is custom made? I've actually never sat inside Hop Leaf, only under the biggest, custom made umbrella I've ever known. If you like beer, this is the place for you. I think the beer menu rivals The Fountainhead which recently opened a roof deck, so it would be interesting to have a showdown between the two. Anyway, food is decent but the beer is the reason to go. Servers are always busy, scrambling around and you know they're doing they're best to accommodate your requests.

The restaurant was bustling when I went, so I really have to commend the chef for being able to be so flexible and keep everything straight without a hitch. I barely reviewed the menu before deciding on going with the chef's selection. Unfortunately cannot recall the names of the dishes I ate, as they provided several small plates within several courses.

The servings are not huge but I do feel they are just the right size for you to leave satisfied.  I went with a few people so I also got to try a little bit of the crepes with mixed fruit and they were very good, I also tried the home fries....mmmm, they were cooked just right!  Their applewood-smoked bacon was cooked just how I asked...extra crispy, and It was just a perfect side to my delicious pancakes!Unfortunately, I didn't ask my waitress for her name but she made sure that I always had a full cup of that delicious Metropolis coffee along with the yummiest glass of fresh squeezed O.J.When I left that first day I knew I would be back and I did...the service was much better and I just couldn't wait to have another cup of that coffee....very good!This time I tried the chilaquiles and wow, I was pleasantly surprised with how good they were, not your typical breakfast or lunch item but I can't wait to go back and have them again...I think they are my new favorite!So, my first visit would have been 4 stars since I would have taken one away for the small wait but my second visit would have been 6 stars for their delicious coffee, great food, the great service and reasonable prices...so to even it out I give them 5 stars!   5 stars for Nana!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Not terribly impressed with the Wilde Bar. I went there for dinner on a Thursday evening at a reasonable dinner hour. The hostess sat us at a large round table near the front of the restaurant. I was surprised by how large and new everything looked, but annoyed by how cold and loud the place was. There was a mixed crowd eating there... a few people at the bar drinking, but most guests were at tables eating dinner. Therefore, I didn't understand why the music was so loud. It was difficult to hold a conversation with five people at my table.  I decided to split the Chicken Pot Pie and Mac and Cheese with my friend. The Mac and Cheese was better than my Chicken Pot Pie. The pie would have been great, but the carrots inside weren't even cooked throughout and I found one piece of fatty chicken in my half. I hate fatty chicken.  My other friends ordered the Fish and Chips, the Reuben, and the Meatloaf. It was my sister who ordered the Reuben and she didn't like it because she said they used a different dressing instead of the normal 1000 island.  Our server was friendly, but sparse during our meal.

"OK, so after reading reviews here and checking out the website we went to Geja's for a romantic date night. It was a total disaster. From the waiter who was ignoring and just trying to get this over with, to the super narrow space where tables are squeezed into one another...it was a real disappointment. We were seated next to a table of four, and we were so close that literally we could hear every word, even if they were to whisper... No romantic atmosphere whatsoever...The only nice impression I got was from the live guitar music being played and the bus boy, who was really attentive. The waiter took about 25 minutes to show up to check on us after getting the food and finally ask me if I want another glass of wine!!! I am sorry, but if you are paying $120 + for a dinner for two, you do expect some kind of proper service...We left shortly after finishing our meal, drenched in this smell of food..poor ventilation.

"The boyfriend and I were given a couple hundred dollars worth of Lettuce Entertain You Gift cards and didn't feel like going anywhere fancy, so we decided to try this place seeing as it was a couple blocks from our apartment. We went on a Sunday night (bad idea) and the place was jam-packed with entitled suburban yuppy types. A woman in a fur coat wanted to get through and because we were packed like sardines in the (tiny) waiting area started yelling at me to move. I told her that I was trying to- and she gave me a sarcastic 'oh, really?' Ugh. I wish I'd had a glass of red wine in hand to pour on her ratty dead-animal coat. The hostess told us it'd be an hour wait, which was fine, since the football game was on television at the bar. We waited maybe twenty-five minutes and were seated in a (small) booth near the back. Our waitress was nice enough (and pretty cute) but the service was slow (they were busy, so I understand). Boyfriend ordered nachos as an appetizer for himself (I can't eat dairy) and a barbecue bacon cheddar burger. I got a veggie burger (no cheese) with the salad bar. The nachos, according to the boyfriend, were good, and he enjoyed his burger (he's pretty picky about his burgers, so this is a good sign). My veggie burger had good flavor, but was crumbly and dry. I also wasn't fond of the potato chips that came with it- they were cold and somewhat soggy. The (2-tablespoon) side of coleslaw was more like a sample, but flavorless, anyway. The salad bar was nice enough, but being used to Whole Foods salad bar, definitely left something to be desired. A lot of the stuff on it was very basic and there were no crunchy things (like croutons, sunflower seeds, nuts, et cetera) so I felt like I was missing a key element in my salad. The French dressing also tasted watered down. I would not pay $11 for this salad bar- I felt lousy paying $6 for the salad bar as my 'side'. My drinks were refilled pretty promptly and the server was nice enough, but it wasn't the greatest dining experience. The tab came to around $50 with drinks, which isn't so bad, I suppose. I wouldn't return, it just wasn't exceptional enough to brave the obnoxious clientele, cramped space, and wait time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"WOW! great food at an unbelievable price. A dinner for 2 came out to under $15 with tip. Tacos were great and the guacamole was also very good. My only small complaint was the chips tasted a bit stale but as a free extra and considering that everything else was so good and so cheap not even a big concern. Fantastic food overall although thinking back on it, a little scary that all the food could be so cheap and still be approved for eating. Hiding that thought deep in the brain, the food was fantastic and will be going back many a time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hopleaf, where people go to feel sophisticated by drinking overpriced fancy beers and act like they are above the light beer drinkers. I mean come on this bar does have good food, a solid layout and such but the clientele can be quite pompous about the beer. I was given a suggested beer and it tasted like raw hamburger. Hopleaf in one word.......OVERRATED.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Violet Hour is your sheik, find me if you can, swanky, everything from scratch, wait your a** off in an, at times, imaginary line bar. Perhaps I should have thrown in a few more adjectives up there. People were certainly in all levels of attire but pants and a shirt feels more appropriate than jeans and a Smurf T-shirt. In my view Violet Hour will have you waiting on a list for at least an hour regardless of they have tables or not. I'm not mad at it because it's a good psychological approach to building demand and desire. What is important is that they'll let anyone in waiting so you don't have to feel cool enough or rejected. The staff once inside is also quite friendly and not at all stuffy like you might expect. Once inside it's really a cool dcor and set up. The high backed chairs give you the feel that each tiny table is its own private booth. These guys make every syrup, garnish, and otherwise that goes into a drink aside from the base alcohol. This kind of preparation has to be respected because it's time consuming. It is also art work. The drinks are tasty and certainly something to experience. I only had their hummus appetizer but it was very good. The hummus had a very nice texture with just a hint of garlic which gained strength has I took bite after bite. The bathrooms are really nice in that they are completely separate; meaning that there is one door per private bathroom. I suppose if you want a little boom boom time you could get away with it in private. You'll probably be to buzzed to care if your caught anyway but the place does have an energy that will have you thinking what I'm saying. All-in-all if you're out for something very different and really cool this is a great place. Good for dates or to show off Chicago to an out of town friend you can go wrong. Just don't come if you're looking for a quick drink; you will be waiting in line for some time no matter when you go....it's what they do! Prost, Cheers, Salud, Bon Appetit, and all those great wishes","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This pizza is a cheese lovers dream!! My friends and I ordered delivery which took about an hour but was well worth the wait. My guy friends, being the canavores they are, went with the meaty delight pan pizza and a thin crust canadien bacon. For me, the meaty was a little overboard when they add sliced beef in the mix w/ sausage, bacon, pepperoni, and God knows what else. But, like I said, the cheese was overabundant as well, which was well needed to compliment the meat. The thin crust was just okay. Over all, the meat, cheese, and sauce was excellent. The crust fell a bit short for me, as I thought it was a bit doughy. Perhaps it was just b/c of delivery that might have softened it up a bit, but I will definitely be eating here again sometime in the near future.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here with my wife last Sunday to celebrate my birthday. Needless to say, the restaurant itself was good enough to make my birthday one to remember (but don't tell my wife I said that!).Everything was extraordinary. The food was perfect; much better than anything I've tried in Argyle. Argyle has always been my go-to place to get quick pho or just about any Vietnamese dish since it's a bit closer to my place, but my wife decided to treat ourselves to something different, especially since it had such great reviews. I just never knew what we were missing out on!We started our meal with the Bon Vivant Platter, which has an assortment of their 'rolls' for a variety. We both thoroughly got through that quickly due to our appetites. I love their spring rolls! Then, for appetizers, I decided on the catfish in a claypot. The sauce it came in was not too sweet, but adequate enough to leave a good taste in my mouth. My wife opted with the beef and asparagus. She's really picky with her meat, but apparently, the meat was cooked just right for her. Amazing.We had a nice waitress who checked up on us on a few times, but did leave enough time in between so we can spend our dinner quietly and peacefully. We weren't surprised when it wasn't busy, but apparently, this isn't a good sign for restaurant owners...The owner of this restaurant is especially endearing. He's super nice and sent over a complimentary fried banana dessert because he heard it was my birthday. Help out this man and come to his restaurant! You won't be disappointed. I'm definitely coming out here more often, regardless if it's my birthday or not!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had food delivered from this place, so I don't know what it's like dining there, but I didn't like the food, or the service. When I placed the order, the person said it would be a half hour, and it took about an hour and 20 minutes. Also, I ordered and paid for spring rolls, that they forgot to bring. The food they did bring sucked in my opinion. I had shrimp fried rice, which was super greasy, with only a few mooshy shrimp. I had an order of the mongolian beef, which was skimpy with greesy sauce, making the vegetable super soggy. The few non-scrappy beef pieces were pretty good though. We had the garlic chicken which was also skimpy, greesy, and soggy. I won't have food delivered from here again. If dining in the restaurant is better, or if they were just having an off-day, I guess I can see giving them another chance. But if this quality of food and level of service is consistent, I wouldn't waste my appetite, time, or money.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I was late to work, while the server stared at me and didnt even ask what I was waiting for. finally after twenty minutes did I get my coffee and sausage. Thought I would try it again (since it was only a block from my place), same thing, except this time they were flat out rude.

"My friends and I were really excited to go to Frontera on the recommendations of friends and it being a Rick Bayless restaurant. We were told it could take as long as 3 hours to get table but we decided to make a night of it and pass some time in the lounge. The drinks were great, the atmosphere fun and lively. Our hostess was super attentive and we managed to get a seat near the kitchen in a record 75 minutes!The guacamole was delicious, but the ribs some folks who were eating at the bar recommended were bland and we left most of them on the plate. The steak was very good but overall we were disappointed in the food. To add to that lackluster discovery we were harrassed by two gestapo like floor managers who insisted we sit still in our seats... apparently they worried we would somehow injure ourselves or others in the 8 foot walkway- despite the fact that these women outweighed us by 50 lbs and were standing in the walkway themselves.Rick! Get a handle on your employees. Large Marge and her friend did not give off the warm and fuzzy vibe I think you would like your restaurant to have. Unfortunately, I will never be able to recommend the Frontera Grill to anyone visiting Chicago.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It simply amazes me that people can actually rave about this place as if it's the best thing since sliced bread. Having grown up in Pilsen, my family, friends and I have known of this place since the early 80's and we all agree that it is the most overrated (and politically connected) business in Pilsen. Everything from the tacky facade paint job, to the mediocre tasting food, to the indifferent almost rude servers, this place does not aim to please it's customers at all. Yet once a year for the last 12 years or so and mainly out of support for my old community, I give this place a visit hoping it's finally worth recommending. The decor still lacks warmth, the refried beans are still greasy and overcooked and the miserable waitresses are still indifferent to the customers needs. The last time we visited we ordered the carne asada dish and it took the waitress almost 10 minutes to finally inform us that they were out of carne asada. (On a wednesday afternoon?) When we finally ate our meal, we once again agreed hands down that there are so many better places to eat in Pilsen. Let me just put it this way, if Chef Ramsey ever got his hands on this place he would simply tear it apart from top to bottom.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to Sunda three times, and I should preface this review by saying I don't like Sushi and am not generally a fan of Asian food. Despite these preferences, I think Sunda is very very good. The menu is very diverse and offers many different options, so those who do not care for Sushi still have a considerable number of choices. I've tried several of the Sushi options here and have liked most of them. The lobster and waygu roll is amazing. The Chilean Sea Bass is some of the best fish I've had...moist and delicate, in an interesting preparation. The Crabcake Ahi Tuna is unique and also excellent. On each occassion the sevice had been friendly and fairly good. My only difficulty with this restaurant is the noise level. On a crowded night, it becomes almost impossible to carry on a conversation. Desipte that, I will be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Not the best of the best but I always find myself coming to this place anytime I go to Chicago because of the delicious Vietnamese dishes. The price is not bad either. The place is actually quite small but the glass wall around the restaurant make it look waaaay bigger than how it actually is. I love this feature because in Vietnam, we usually have Pho on the street, enjoying the scene of the city in a big crowd of other people who are also eating, and this restaurant does bring that nostalgic feeling to me. Pros: - Authenticity scores 8/10 - Food are fresh and delicious, - Quick service once you're seated, - Nice view of streets, helpful waiters, - Impressive name to recommend for friends. Cons: - If you go to peak dinner time, you might have to wait standing around for 30' - 1 hour to be seated, and there is no waiting area/chairs - The place looks big but actually quite small so you might have to share table with some strangers occasionally at a big long table. However we do this a lot in Vietnam so let's think about it as an authentic feature of Vietnamese cuisine. - Waiters are not the best, they're cool but might be rude sometimes during restaurant's mega-busy time.

"Don't get me wrong, I like meat, I love meat, but every once in a while you're just not feelin' like meat. Ya know? On the other hand, I'm not a fan of faux meat, but at the Chicago Diner you can hardly tell it's not meat. (I just like saying ""meat"") I've been here a couple times for breakfast or lunch and have enjoyed each visit. Most recently I had a day off work and was starving after a manicure near by. Their menu isn't that big, but everything looked so good that I couldn't decide, so I asked my server what he suggested and went with his favorite dish. Sometimes I just like being told what to do. I had the reuben, which had roasted peppers on it along with the regular suspects, and it was delicious. I had it with no dairy (trying to get back on the wagon) and it did not leaving me craving real cheese. The biscuits and gravy are really good too. The service is always friendly. Today I got a good dose of heavy eye contact and smiles, certainly made me feel welcome and not rushed to give up the table even though I was taking my time and reading while I enjoyed my meal.

"I first saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives but I didn't plan on stopping in until I Googled All-you-can-eat Crab Legs for my husband's birthday. This is not a normal diner, they serve cereal at the bar in the back and have their whole menu on chalkboards on both walls. I made reservations a week in advance just to be sure we could get in - I would suggest this because the line was pretty long when we got here and pretty long when we left. You start off getting a pretty decent portion of crab legs with parmesean corn and coleslaw, after that they bring you out one crag leg at a time and you can order more corn and slaw if you'd like. He also ordered a 40 of Miller Lite, yes I said a 40 oz.. The crab legs started off great (especially for what you would pay at Joe's or Shaw's) but as the night went on and they busier they got, the legs came out very salty and mushy from the overcrowded boiling water. After about an hour, we gave up another round because they were almost inedible. I'd suggest getting in early and getting out. We'll definitely be back since they have great seafood specials and overall the food was good.Checking out their website recently, it looks like they took off their Wednesday rib night special...bummer.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The vegetarian fajitas (full of actual vegetables, spinach, broccoli and potatoes (?)-- fantabulous) and broccoli and spinach burrito are super and gigantic-- If you can finish either in one sitting... well, you're an American. I usually love a burrito suiza, but the sauce on this puppy-sized puppy was kind of lacking and the cheeses kind of gummy.

"I was so excited to go to this place because I love both Cuban and Mexican food and I had heard such great things about it. Then along came a Groupon - how perfect! Although I thought the service was great and it would be a great place to go hang out and have a drink - I did not like the food. I thought the best thing was the bread and butter (sort of sweet and spicy). We had the taste of Cuba appetizer - I wasn't a big fan of but it was ok. For dinner, I had the honey jalepeno pork chops which is one of their specialties. I really did not like the pork chops - they were overwhelmingly sweet to me (though I know people that love them). I was hoping for some spice from the jalepeno to help with the sweetness but there was none. I tried some of my boyfriend's food (steak with black beans and rice) - it was just okay too but it was drenched in lime (which is crazy for me to say because I put lime all over everything).  I really wanted to like this place and appreciate the great service, but especially given the price, I would recommend going elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We are currently in Chicago where we are thinking about as a permanent move. Since we love Spanish food, we felt the hotel we are in would be perfect as Mercat is part of the place. Super stay, super food. I think not. We first went for lunch and were really hungry. The menu was good and had nice choices. He went with the ham and fig salad and I had another salad with cheese and veggies. Nice. Good sangria, too. Then it took forever to get the next dishes, like about 45 minutes. And we were hungry so it seemed longer and the other tables were being served and they were leaving. Finally, the manager came with the food, to apologize. Nice touch, good hanger steak and spinach for me. We thought we'd give it another try for dinner. That was the worst idea yet. The service was horrendous and we didn't even get served! We went to the bar at 6 and were told we couldn't get an actual table for dinner until 8:15. So we sit at the bar. They told us we could eat at a bar table then. We know what those are like, tiny with little doll-chairs that are so uncomfortable. We passed. We'd wait. We returned at 8:15, promptly. ""it''ll be a few minutes,"" we were told. At 8:30, we are offered the same bar table from 2 hours before. The exact same table!!! I told the woman this so she said we could have another tiny table but with a banquette for seating. Okay, a little better. Then she said she was sorry and would bring us a glass of wine to make it up. Next thing we have a hostess staring down at us telling us that we are lying about waiting two hours and it was ten minutes and we were relaxing in our rooms. I asked, ""are you lecturing me?' and she actually said, ""yes, sort of."" Wow! Then a male manager comes and gets in our faces and says that we are so lucky that they fit us in and we should have taken the first table at the bar because they take reservations for those tables too. I guess the bar stools are reserved here. I will never come here again, even if I move to Chicago and will tell everyone what horrid service this place has.

"Now I suppose this review could be biased. It's been several months since I actually ate here. And when I was there, I was on a date with a guy who gives me massive rose colored glasses. But still. I get so annoyed at people who go to a place like Graham Elliot and then complain about the food to cost ratio. We had the 10 course tasting with pairings...yes, the courses are small. But the tastes are amazing and you don't leave hungry. If you want big portions, there are some lovely steakhouses in Chicago. The pairings were very unusual - at least to me. There was one snafu with the dessert pairing, but the waiter and mixologist were so sweet and apologetic and quick to bring us an additional dessert and cocktail that it was almost a *positive* part of the experience. I don't think Graham Elliot takes itself too seriously at all. All our waitstaff was friendly and casual, but on the ball. My favorite part of the evening was when the busboy noticed that my date was coming across the table to sit next to me on the banquet between courses. He wordlessly, and with a cute twinkle in his eye flipped the table sideways so we could enjoy the rest of our meal without the back and forth.Also, I recommend asking them to take the crack laced popcorn off the table after a few handfuls or you won't have room for the delectableness to come.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow! I'm reading some of the reviews off to my right, and there are some angry people out there. Goodness. Anywho, I had breakfast here recently, and I'd heard that the food was good, if not a bit expensive. And I couldn't agree more! I had the Gunthorp Farm Chicken Enchilada Skillet, and it was sooooooo gooooooooood! And the iced tea with special herbal additions was also very tasty, and perfect for a brunchy drink. I love the decor, and having this place near my house is a plus. I really appreciate that they grow so much of their own food. That's really cool! The only thing is that the price, for my wallet at least, is a bit high. We didn't pay for breakfast (father-in-law in town) but had we, I would have been sweating a little bit.

"Now if you are in Chicago visiting or just moved there this is a good landing spot financially and socially because its a sports bar at its finest and celebrities pass through alot especially sports Celebs. The atmosphere is more lay back energetic than Technotronic/punk. Every time i have been there the bar seaters always strike good mature conversation and the staff is super responsive awesome and on it. It has a couple of levels so you can also book a level for a private party or something of the sort and it comes with a massive package list of options, which i think is pretty neat. It has the main bar on the ground level. A lounge in the basement and a seated dinning area on the second level over looking the ground floor. Its a good bar to spend a staturday night at if you want conversational clubbing + there is no dress code.Prices are reasonable $ - $$$ because they have bottle service for 350ml bottles and 750mls as well did i mention that they sell 40z Oh Yes!!!!! Their food is amazing and personaly i would give it 5stars for food found in bars because its Delish. Vallet parking is available as well in the single digits and there is always a good crowd ranging from 21 through 50 but a good mix they all come dressed to impress. If you enjoy sports bars then you will not regret spending your money here over a good game. I think its wicker parks finest for young professionals.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Nothing fantastic. Pretty bland. Considering it was organic, I expected something more (taste wise). We were the first ones there in the morning. Our waitress was not too bright (at 8:00am she's telling me the lunch special). Wha? Bussers were pushy. I can't understand why, we were the only ones there (they weren't busy). Ordered one of breakfast specials, biscuit's and gravy, more like gross and gravy. Easy over eggs on top of biscuits and gravy w/some sort of mushroom and peas sautd concoction. It tasted like Thanksgiving dinner rolling around in your mouth, ewe! No thank you. Would I ever go back? No way Jose! Clark's Diner is way better (taste wise)(and cheaper). Lot's more variety and flavor. Although, I still enjoy Maple Leaf Cafe on Taylor street.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A tad bit unorthodox when you first arrive... Coming into Artopolis, it is quite beautiful inside and out but when I first arrived, the place looked a lot like a dine-in restaurant. I was standing there for 5 minutes confused, wondering if anyone was going to seat us. I later realized it was more of a contemporary seat yourself- this is NOT the seat for you restaurant. OHHH, I understand now. Sorry, I got confused by the lovely decor and nice pastries. My bad!..... Recent selections were the lemon drop chicken soup and the house sandwich as well as the greek chicken. I thought the chicken needed a little more flavor because it was lacking seasoning but everything else seems really good. Furthermore, I like my lemon drop soup sour and zesty! Pastries/Desserts: There's so many to choose from. It was like dessert porn for my eyes. I've always gotten the tiramisu which I love but I need to break out of my mold and try something else. I had my eye on this cute little number, her name was mango mousse. But ssshhhh( don't tell my tiramisu, she'll be mad) ..........""Oh, no.... She heard us!""","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As part of my birthday celebration, my wife and I went to Carnivale this past Friday night. It was our first time eating here and we walked away with a high opinion and plans to revisit in the future. For starters, the staff and waiters were very nice and helpful. We were seated within minutes upon check-in (we had 7:30PM reservations for 2) and were given a table on the second floor overlooking the main dining area. The space is beautiful. Formerly a warehouse, the place has been renovated with outdoor seating, a bar area and an adjoining main dining room with vaulted ceilings, brightly colored lamps, a huge glass mosaic and cool decorations.The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Music was playing in the background during our meal but we didn't have any trouble hearing one another. In fact, it was just loud enough to drown out your neighbors and provide a little bit of conversational privacy.We had heard positiive reviews about their mixed drinks so my wife ordered the Coconut Mojito and I ordered the Mojito Millonario. Both were good; however, I was partial to my libation. It was a few dollars more than the regular Mojito but the 12 year estate rum they used was absolutely delicious and worth the extra expense. In addition to the rum upgrade, in the Millinario they add cava (spanish sparkling wine) and forego simple syrup, which is used in the regular mojito. This made for better flavor and kick in my opinion. The food we ordered really hit the spot as well and was prepared perfectly. To start, we had the Arepas and the Ropa Vieja. Both had great flavor. The pork belly and corn cheese cakes in the former were a nice pairing. If I had to choose between the two though I would go with the Ropa Vieja. The braised beef and spicy mayo together with the other ingredients made for an incredibly tasty combination. Plus, in the RV they give you 4 little portions per plate compared to 3 on the Arepas dish. Regardless, you won't go wrong with either.For entrees we chose the Churrasco and the Bistek Palomilla. There was no clear cut winner in my mind because both dishes had unique and satisfying flavor profiles. The meat for both was cooked just right; tender but not bloody and easy to cut. My wife made the comment that the Churrasco tasted more latin american'esque while the Bistek Palomilla was more amorphous, although still excellent. She may have had a point. Regardless, the roasted mushrooms, radish salad and brisket mofongo disappeared quickly from my plate. The sweet potato puree and corn on her dish did compliment each other and the beef tenderloin very well.Since it was my birthday they brought us a free dessert, flan with bits of caramel popcorn on the plate. I didn't even see that option on the menu but it hit the spot. Definitely not the best I've ever had but since it was free I wasn't complaining. Had they not surprised us with this I would have ordered the Banana Cream Pie, which sounded awesome. Next time!","[1.0, 0.0]"

We arrived just before breakfast was over and didn't have to wait in line which I heard was very lucky! We ordered the wood-oven Chilaqulles with both scrambled eggs and chicken.  The presentation was picture perfect and the flavor was good however I did add quite a bit of their two homemade salsas to it.  The locally roasted coffee was very tasty.  The empanada (egg and pablano) was a bit doughy and bland. I would recommend a visit to XOCO and wished we had been able to try the breakfast torta but they had stopped serving.

"I waited tables here for my first 4 years in Chicago...Yes, I work in advertising- ha! Even after working here for so long, its one of the places I miss about Chicago. Completely reasonable prices for a healthy portion of food. As a waitress here, I loved the people who came in- mostly regulars. Newbies- please remember to give the waitstaff a break if they are slammed. The Pasta Bowl has NO busboys. The waiters do everything from taking orders, refilling drinks, bringing food and busing tables. Sometimes an extra cook from the back will help out, but keep in mind the waiters are going it alone.  Things to keep in mind: -The salads are awesome! Spinach salad with goat cheese is my fave. They are HUGE though, keep in mind if you are ordering pasta too. -Farfalle pollo is most popular- its a heart attack on a plate. -Rigatone Bolognese is yummy. -Cooks will change/add anything. Everything is fresh so there is little that they can't do.  -Vegetarians- keep in mind that their marinara and most of their soups are beef based. Ask for the BV marinara. Its on the ""Lighter Side"" menu, no beef stock. -If your waitress is clueless, feel free to ask one of the cooks at the bar. Most of those guys have been there forever.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife and I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago. A big part of the trip was going to taste the various culinary treats that range from Al's Beef to Gino's East, Blackbird and Tru. My first impression was that there seemed to be a very up-tight vibe to the dining room that night. My wife semi-agreed, but not as much. I understand fine dining and the associated feel, but this still seemed stuffy to me. We chose the standard five-course tasting menu, which goes for $110. There was no pre-set wine pairings, which would have been a nice option, but oh well. The wine list was EXTENSIVE and very high-end. Almost so that I don't believe there was an option under $100. To me, that's just not providing options for your diners. I've been to the Napa region many times and there are quality wines to be had under $100. Whatever, it's wine and again, it's fine dining. Understandable. As for the food... overall it was great. Very refined and showed a great amount of skill in it's preperation. However, I felt that the meal lacked a true inspiration or soul. I did not feel like the chef was truly inspired by the menu or wowed me with much. Yes, it was one of the best gnocchi I have ever tasted and well executed. However, it was a gnocchi in broth. Ok... ? I mean, it was good, but thank you for the potato dumplings in broth with a parmesan twille? Have we not seen a twille for about 10 years now? Anyway, the meal had it's highlights. Specifically, the caviar with avocado puree was delightful. The main courses (Ribeye and Venison) were perfectly cooked and delicious. The pastry chef needs to be recognized nationally for his/her skill. Also, the service was absolutely impeccable and the front of the house was on-point. So, to wrap it up. If you want to taste the best version you've ever tasted of something... go to Tru. If you want to be inspired by interesting combinations and enlightened to new tecniques or styles, go elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The service was the worst I have seen in a long time. We barely sat down and the waitress wanted to take our entire order--not just drinks. We said we weren't ready but I don't think she understood since she pointed out what dishes she recommended. She finally left but literally came back a minute later. She did this several more times until we felt pressured to order right then.My two friends ordered the BBQ. I ordered a rice dish. My friends were half way through their meal and I still did not get my entree. I finally flagged down a waitress (don't expect to see them again until time for the check and don't count on being asked if you want anything else). She said it would be right out. Then 10 minutes later our soup arrived (at the end of my friends' meals) but still no entree for me. Then the waitress brought the check and I said they didn't bring my entree so she needed to remove the charge. She looked confused then said it was ready and walked away. She then came back w/o it but said it would be up soon. I told her I didn't want it anymore. She was not happy about that. To top it off, they tried to charge me for the soup that normally comes with the entree (which I did not eat since I don't like miso soup). She angrily came back with the check after we told her to remove the charge and said nothing to us--never any attempt at an apology.I'm shocked there are so many good reviews although I did see a pattern of poor service and problems communicating with the servers. The food was decent.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I guess this is what happens when you have high expectations. After reading some of the reviews on here, I thought my group and I would be in for a treat. 2.5 hours of poor service later, a treat was nowhere to be found. Oh, and did I mention everyone's dish came out cold? I booked this place for my brother's birthday and was excited because they seemed more than willing to accommodate our group of 11. Reservations were for 8pm and when we all arrived i went to tell the hosts that we were all here. After a lot of ""Let me just check on the table for you"", one of the hosts proceeds to tell me that ""they didn't know I was coming today"". That's funny...I received a phone call from Las Tablas that afternoon confirming my reservation for 8pm and when I saw my name very clearly written on the reservation sheet when I walked in. How did you not know we were coming? He then went on to explain they'd ""try really hard"" to get us a table....that I reserved...5 days prior. Anyway... FInally, about 30 minutes after our reserved time, we are seated. Everyone's excited to eat and partake in sangria. We all order and end up waiting until after 9:30pm to get our food. Now I know there was a lot ordered and lots of different meats to cook, but an hour after we sat down? I don't know think I have ever waited that long at any restaurant or with any size party. Thankfully the sangria was good, since we ended up ordering 3 extra pitchers to bide our time till the food arrived. So, we're all starving (and a little tipsy from all the sangria on empty stomachs) as the food is finally brought over to the table. My plate was missing the pork belly. Another plate was missing the plantain. And the best part, every single plate had cold food. What the heck? One person had his plate taken back to get reheated (which also turned his steak from medium rare to medium well). A couple of us also mentioned to the waiter that all the food was cold. He just shrugged his shoulders and stared at us. I think at that point, we were all too hungry to argue about it any further. The food didn't necessarily taste bad, but meat really isn't meant to be eaten cold. Regardless, we just ate because we were all so hungry at this point.  Not only was the service awful but the food (which I figured would its saving grace) was cold and nothing was done about it. The waitstaff missed out on getting a great tip from a table of 11 and instead got a mediocre tip from a very disappointed group. Maybe this place is better in smaller groups. but I am wary of going back now with the experience that I had.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The chips are warm and fresh-tasting and not too oily. BUT, the service is almost always AWFUL! I know this sounds terrible, but I always feel like I'm getting the ""gringo treatment"" here.

"My wife and I are big Chicago deep-dish fans. Our current favorite is Gino'a East, but we typically try a new deep-dish place each time we're in Chicago. This time it was Giordano's. Overall, we were not impressed. Like Gino's East, Giordano's does not take any reservations. So the wait to get to your table is anywhere from 1 - 2 hours on a weekend night. We waited for 90 minutes. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza, which was a nice feature that allowed the pizza to be served within minutes of our seating. Waiting aside, what we really care about is this pizza. The crust of this pizza has less of a corn flavor than Gino's, which some people prefer. However, the sauce and overall flavor of Giordano's was disappointing. The sauce tasted like something out of a can. We ordered a pepporoni and sausage pizza, and we had 2 slices that had almost no sausage on them. The service was lax at best, with our waiter checking in about once every 20 minutes or so. The provide a bottle of water on the table, but this seems to be a reason for them to not check back in for any other beverages. Summary, if we're going to put in this kind of wait-time for food, it better be a special experience. Giordano's did not deliver.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is one of those grossly overpriced restaurants that compensate for lackluster food with a trendy atmosphere. My boyfriend and I came for dinner and like most reviews state, it is VERY loud making it very hard to hold a conversation. We got the pork belly ban bao (buns), baked seafood dynamite roll (kani, scallop, ebi, roe, avocado, scallions, cucumber, dynamite sauce,tempura crumbs), crunchy pig hidden lobster roll (soy paper, lobster, avocado, jalapeno, sweet chili sauce, tempura crumbs, bacon) and the Sunda house specialty sushi spicy tuna with crispy rice and jalapeno.  The pork belly ban bao was smoothered with hoison sauce and pickled slaw. Unfortunately, it masked the taste of the pork belly. This is a common theme with some of the dishes we tried here. Same thing with the rolls, they add so many extra things to the rolls that you couldn't really decipher what you were eating (if that makes sense - see pics).  I must say the one saving grace of our meal were the Sunda specialty sushi. I never thought to have sushi with crispy rice before but whoever thought of this is a genius!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So the first time I went here I was so loaded (open 24 hours!) that all I remembered was how good it was, and I wound up going back the next morning at like 10 a.m. just to confirm it wasn't an ETOH induced false positive. Two giant steak burritos and about a gallon of black salsa later, yeah, good stuff. It's that good people - and not just after the taps are turned off for the night, but even in the light of day.  I'm partial to the black salsa (caliente!) but he green is delicious too (caliente!). I usually get the chicken super (burrito) but the steak is incredible too. Pork tends toward the fatty. The burritos are big. If you get the steak, go purist and just get onions and cilantro. Steak tacos have good proportions too. And often I just go there for the salsa, get a few large tubs to bring home just for me! Now, they've patched the bullet holes in the bathroom walls, got rid of the espanol-only fat guy with the sour face that used to work the register, got a new menu, and yes, I've seen the kiss of death for any city ""joint"" - the dreaded suburban blonde wife, minivan full of little blonde cookie cutter kids pulling up in front because they want a ""city"" experience (they've almost killed the 'Spoke dead). But for the most part they've kept the food the same (i.e., they haven't cleaned the grill in years).

"My girlfriend I ventured to this Lincoln Park establishment last night based on reviews from fellow yelpers. Upon arriving, I immediately knew I would enjoy sitting in this place and having a cold beer because of the lively atmosphere. However, I didn't know if I would enjoy eating their pie. I am always skeptical of pizza places that claim to be better than Gino's East or Lou's.We started off with the Combo appetizer which includes cheese sticks, fried mushroom caps, fried zucchini, and poppers. All of this for 9 bucks definitely worth the money. Then had the house salad which included carrots, olives, tomatoes, and chopped romaine. Also, a pretty good deal at 4 bucks a salad. Now for the main course, we ordered the large pizza in hopes we would enjoy it enough to last through the weekend. My half of the pizza was sausage, onions, and green pepper (this is what I normally order at Lou's or Gino's). The pizza arrived at our table with the patented black crust and the eating began. I believe the true test of Chicago deep dish pizza is actually the final bite of pizza where you get the crust and the toppings all in one. I immediately turned my pizza around and took this bite. It was great the crust was crunchy and airy at the same time. The toppings were plentiful and the sausage had good seasoning. When I saw the black crust I wondered how can that not taste burnt, but it didn't. It tasted like, well... caramelized cheese,brilliant! For 4 beers, appetizer, salad, pizza, and tip this experience cost us $74.00 and we still have three quarters of a pizza left to enjoy. Although I would not rank these guys above Lou's or Gino's I wont rank them below either.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Also, for anyone that likes squash curry - this is the only place in town that has it. It's a little light on the squash, but is uber tasty. The atmosphere is cozy and stylish.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love this place! There is just something so good about there food. The ambiance is good and the service is right there too. I love there burritos and the Oatmeal shake is always a winner.

"HIGHLY recommend!!I've been going here a lot lately and love it, for many reasons.First, the menu is extensive and has something for everyone. I am a vegan and appreciate that there are options for me. Veggie burger, black bean burger, edamame salad, vegan soup, etc.  And my carnivore friends like the burgers, chicken, salmon, etc. So many options!!! And good wine selection! Wonderful menu!!Second, the service and the staff are top notch, starting with the managers. A group of us went to Wilde on the show day recently. While the city was nearly completely shut down, Wilde was open and so enjoyable!! It was packed and they were way under staffed. But Chad, who is the manager, stepped in to be our server that day. He was so friendly, so fun, and offered fantastic service, despite the chaos and his ""dual jobs"" that day. There were a couple minor mistakes with our order due to all the chaos, and Chad was fantastic in how he dealt with it -- with humor and respect.All the staff is consistently wonderful. So friendly, hard working, etc.Third, the music selection. On a typical day/night, the variety of music is amazing! I will say the music on the Saturday before St Pattys day was ridiculously loud and probably should have been turned down a notch, but we certainly enjoyed the selection and dancing regardless. :)My friends and I now go to Wilde often b/c f the food, atmosphere, the staff and location and always feel welcome as if it were a tiny, friendly, quaint, neighborhood bar....even if its completely packed and nuts in there as it was on Sat before St Pattys day. I do think the kindness and great work by the wait staff should be a nod to the management, Chad and the others.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I came to this place a couple months ago with the gf when I decided I wanted something out of the norm. It was a lot pricier than what I'm used to but I wanted to splurge. I'd just made a good amount of money from a recent project and wanted something different and on the expensive side. The food itself was rather good. It was presented in a very good manner and the taste was exquisite. The servers were very well trained and knowledgeable when they brought us out our food. They would tell us what the dish was and what was the best way to eat it get the full flavor profile. Make sure you pay attention because the way you eat it actually has a lot of impact on how it tastes. Certain things are meant to be eaten together in the same bite to give it its maximum use of whichever ingredient. My only complaint about this place is that the portions were small but then again it's fine dining and that's the trend nowadays. Smaller portions.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Bongo Room offers amazing food, but it is my least favorite place to eat in the entire city.  They bring you the check half way through the meal and then harass you every five minutes about leaving. I think if you a throwing down $20-$30 for a meal you deserve to be left alone and enjoy the food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food is amazing, and the atmosphere is warm and cosy- even though it's a large restaurant! Everything I've had there is absolutely delicious and their Saturday and Sunday brunch is amazing. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service is a bit slow. We had to wait over 15 minutes for an omelette which I thought was a bit long, especially since our server never came back to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, etc. It took just as long to get our bill after our meal. If you aren't in a hurry then I would highly recommend Wilde.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We recently got takeout from XOCO. kind of interesting ordering process, but was worth it in the end. You cannot place phone orders, you need to go to the restaurant and place your order in line. i would say the highlight was the carnitas soup which was delicious!! one other reviewer raved about this soup so we felt like it was worth a try. it was definitely spicey-but not overpowering and the flavors were delicious! we also got one of the sandwiches which were good but not out of this world which is i gave it 4 stars. I'm anxious to try the breakfast here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"As others have said, this is not a diner-goer's diner. And as far as I'm concerned, that's fine. They do their food right, at a relatively reasonable price for its quality, and the staff is extremely friendly, too. The best part of Glenn's is that when the food here is really spot-on, it makes your knees shake and your body quiver. For me, all it takes is their Reuben Sandwich. Oh, all things holy, how I love this sandwich. It's like a taste explosion in your mouth where flavors ride like happy little surfers on waves, one after the other into your body. It's an experience. Also--don't neglect those potato pancakes. Before Glenn's, I'd never had them. Now I'm addicted. I'm knocking off one star for the time I had chocolate chip pancakes and found them pretty dry. 'Course, I'm a choc. chip pancake snob (you should try my family's recipe), so I'm riddled with high expectations.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"In short, the food is awful. The service was very friendly and accommodating, but the food is down right terrible. We had high hopes and ordered the calamari salad (tasted OLD and fishy), the bruschetta (very salty and not at all fresh tasting), the polenta (again not fresh and salty) and finally the zuppo di pesce...again, just bad. I ate about one bite of the main course and was done. We didn't finish anything because it was that terrible and we were starving!!! This place is one of the closest restaurants to our condo. We really wanted to like it, but no luck. Our first visit was about a year and a half ago and it didn't go well. We read the Yelp reviews last night and were shocked to see how highly it was rated. Thinking it was a fluke that our first visit was a bust, we gave it another whirl. MISTAKE!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"NOT WORTH THE PATIO! After returning for a second time to experience the ever talked about patio I was extremely disappointed. Not only was I seated one hour after my reservation time, multiple parties who arrived well after I did were seated before my table. This is clearly a place where if you don't know someone expect to be ignored. Our waiter was extremely rude, acting annoyed when he made the frustrating mistake of bringing a glass of wine instead of the bottle I clearly ordered. The cold, unfriendly service made me feel very unwelcome and contributed to the overall negative experience we had. The food is absolutely forgettable- the peaches in my antipasti were rock hard and tasteless (when there is so much great produce in the summer it shouldn't be so hard to create a good dish!). The pork was terrible as the prosciutto was so overcooked it was more like burnt jerky than anything else. Again, dessert was disappointing and not work staying for. And for all those that rave about the patio, yes it is nice to have an outdoor space with some trees, but the experience is ruined when you are crammed in so tight that you can't even move. I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this meal all summer. You are far better off going to 'A Tavola' nearby. Great patio and the food is infinitely better!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Good food and good drinks make a great birthday...unless you have too much of either one.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One word, WOW! Our dinner was fantastic before we even got in the door and I didn't know it. I hate eating in Chicago, not because of the food, but it's just such a pain parking even with a valet. The valet here asked us how long we plan to stay. I'd never been asked that before. I had no clue why that was important. He guessed about two hours and my wife agreed. It was only after that I found why that was important. Two hours and ten fantastic minutes later, we came out expecting to wait 20 minutes before we finally got our car. The valet came back from parking another car and gave us our keys. He already had the car parked around the corner. Now that is top notch service. Painless parking aside, the food was awesome. Oysters Rockefeller were some of the best I've had. My wife and I agreed, the French Onion soup, bar none was the best we've had in Chicago. If french onion soup is on the menu, we order it. So we have had a lot of them. I order one of the bone in steaks. Came exactly as I expected which is a nice surprise. Most cooks in US America seem to think medium rare is means blue or pink inside, this one was right in between as it should be,  point. My wife had her Chilean Sea Bass which was cook perfectly. She also instead on creamed Spinach as a side. Note: all portions are really meant for two or more. I really, really don't like cooked spinach, but I ate it and actually didn't hate it. I think that is a high compliment. My only knock against the place, it's dark. I mean really dark. When I walked in people were welcoming me on my way to the table. I couldn't make out anyone's face. It was a little better at the table. I could read my menu well enough, but the wait staff shouldn't have to carry flash lights. On my way out, if the waiter had said farewell, I would never have know I was passing right by him. My final thought on it, we will definitely go back. p.s. I can't believe I forgot about my dessert. I had the Cheese Cake. The Cheese Cake Factory needs change their name. Their $7 cheese cake isn't even close to this $10 of awesomeness. It was like biting into creamiest sweetest slice of perfection. I now have to stop there every time I pass by just for the cheese cake. I may have to take the 60 mile long way home tomorrow.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. We've been coming here since this place opened up. We celebrated the New Year in '99 with friends, and I still remember it.At about $75 for two people (not including alcohol), it's a pretty decent price for a good night out. My husband usually orders the filet sampler, which I still to the filet, cooked rare. We usually have the mashed potatoes as a side, and try to save room for dessert. I'm partial to their key lime pie.If you don't have a reservation, you can still eat at one of the bar tables, without a wait.I recommend this to friends looking for a place to celebrate an anniversary.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with a party of 3 on a Wednesday night. As we walked in, tons of different colors surrounded us and live music filled our ears. The hostess greeted us promptly and asked if we were interested in either the dining area or or the bar/lounge area. We decided to go to the dining area since the bar/lounge area was loud and we couldn't hear each other talk. We did not make reservations so we had to wait about 15-20 mins (not bad since it was already packed). We started off with the shrimp ceviche. All I can say is Y-U-M-M-Y!!! You can taste the different flavors of the lemon, chiles, avocado, and corn all coming together. The shrimp is fresh and succulent. It was also accompanied with some type of chips. People were not lying when they told me this is a must try. The entrees came shortly after. My friends ordered the chuleta (pork chops with squash and brussel sprouts) and the arrachera (skirt steak with rice). I can not comment on the taste of their dishes, but according to them it was good. On the other hand, I ordered the pollo (Peruvian style chicken with potatoes). It came with two good size chicken thighs on top of a bed of red potatoes garnished with red and yellow bell peppers and green beans. The chicken was soo tender and juicy on the very first bite to the very last. We finished off with the carnivale ice cream cake. And can I say YUMMY again. It was a three layer cake with passionfruit, pistachio with chocolate chips, and guava with cheesecake ice cream. It sat on top of basil, strawberry, and pineapple sauces. Oh and the best part, they drenched the cake with chocolate fudge. Overall, our waitress was very knowledgable and sold us on everything she named and described. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. Also down in the bathroom area, they offer a photo booth and a shoe (flats) dispenser for the tired working ladies. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is most certainly my crew's favorite place for a nice Italian dinner. Chef Tony is one of the coolest chefs/owners we've come across. He always comes around and makes sure we enjoyed ourselves. The best part is, he's flexible. There have been times when he's made the most amazing adjustment to dishes when someone has special food needs. The restaurant itself is uber cozy, with it's exposed brick and patron art all over the walls. In the warmer months, sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood. As for the food, que Bella! My personal recommendation, the gnocchi, I think it's the best in the city, with its pesto base, sun dried tomatoes, chicken and toasted pine nuts. This is definitely a place to grab dessert, the rice pudding is to die for! It's warm and gooey and just perfect. The wine list is incredible and you'll definitely have leftovers for the next day (not of the wine, of course). P.S. When you go, sign up for the mailers, only if you are interested in receiving coupons, though. Sometimes the coupons are really good. They also serve a Family style dinner on Mondays for $19.95. My girlfriends and I ate there last night and one of my girlfriends did it by herself (no judgment there... she had plenty of food to take home). The portions they bring out directly reflect the number of people who go in on it--from one person to the whole table. The choices are from the more popular dishes on the menu, which is awesome. It's a great way to sample the restaurant's menu..","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I wanted to like Chicago Q, mostly because this part of town needs some good BBQ. Based on a late lunch this afternoon, however, I doubt this spot will make it. The upsides - a pretty dining room and friendly staff (at least on this visit); great house-made pickles and chips served when you sit down; a very tasty array of sauces (two of them are actually BBQ sauce, one is ketchup, and the fourth I couldn't really identify); and a hot towel for cleanup after a meal that's mostly eaten with fingers. The downsides - for starters, lunch time prices. Even in the Gold Coast, you ought to be able to get a lunch entree for under $10, but there are no BBQ entrees at that price point. I tried the classic burger (9.75), which was served with the aforementioned sauces and some fries. The fries were piping hot, and looked freshly cut, but alas not very crisp on the outside. As for the burger: cooked precisely medium as requested, tender, but lacking in flavor. If there was any seasoning here, it escaped my attention. Adding BBQ sauce helped. Service was friendly but I still don't understand why (in a deserted restaurant) it took more than 5 minutes to get the requested mayo. I'd suggest a couple of strategies for this spot:  1) Address the shortcomings on the food mentioned by others. 2) At lunch offer a different sandwich each day on special at 9.95 including a nonalcoholic beverage; and a full entree (not a sandwich) for 11.95. 3) Try some signage out front so people know what they will find inside.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Ain't no Cali pho and mine's still better. The service was good because I went on a Sunday morning before I got my hair cut and it was like 10:30 AM so it was pretty empty except for maybe 2 other tables having the breakfast of champions, which is of course pho. I also got a cafe sua da (iced coffee with condensed milk) it was pretty good as well.

"I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day, and we both loved it. They had a fixed price menu that night, or one could just order from the regular menu, which we did. The cheese and herb croquettes are to die for. An absolute must! I had the catfish pecan, which was excellent, although too many pecans for me. No worries, it was still delish! My girlfriend had the mushroom pasta dish and loved it, too. We were too full for dessert, but got a piece of the red velvet cake to go. As everyone seems to note here, it was wonderful. The service was excellent, even on this very busy night. The atmosphere is casually classy, although nothing really special.When it comes to Southern cooking, I'm more of a New Orleans guy. I didn't have anything here that could compete with the sort of food you can (or used to be able to) get just about anywhere in New Orleans. But that's a pretty tall order.

But as it turns out they're pretty casual and their customers veries from old, young and the inbetween. Niceeeeee. It's truly a great place.

Before we did though we asked a passing by server if we could be served and she replied with, ""I can see what I can do for you""... exact words.

Although it had thick crust, it had no structural integrity; you couldn't eat a slice without a fork or knife.

"OMG!! If I was having Korean for the first time, this place would have totally ruin my first experience. SERVICE is HORRIBLE!!! We sat for a good 15-20 minutes until someone came to take our order and on top of that, I had to ask for water. Don't sit down resturants generally give you water right away before taking order??  When the lady brought the water, she had her head face toward the floor where you can litterally see the top of her head as she's approaching our table with the tray of water. My friend said maybe it's a culture thing and I didnt think so because I've ate at a lot of Korean places and the first thing you hear when you walk through any korean joint is... ""Anyeasayo!"" Didn't get that here! The pickled side dishes tasted OLD like they've been sitting out for days. The kimchi radishes are crunchy, these were chewy. Also, the place isn't the most cleanest place either. So that right there tells you what their expectations are.

If you go for lunch you can normally get a table right away but sometimes it gets rather busy for dinner so keep that in mind when planning your night. I love their salad bar and soup combo. If you are a fan of French Onion soup with a thick layer of bubbling cheese on top this is the place to go! Even when it is hot out, I will always love the soup/salad combination. I love being able to choose my own veggies to go on salads and all the fruit is always fresh and delicious (and of course healthy!) They also have great burgers and fries. Every time I have gone there the food has always amazed me and the atmosphere is always lively. I remember going there as a little kid with my parents and always having such a good time at R.J. Grunts. It is a very family friendly place to go.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"we had a great meal at piccolo sogno. we came with someone affiliated with the restaurant so service was fantastic, and we had a chance to try a lot of the dishes as the kitchen kept sending free food our way. the antipastos, risotto, pastas, and the veal special were fantastic - real standouts were the pasta bolognese, the lasagna, and the risotto special (w/rabbit ragu). the hazelnut chocolate cake was also delicious. the restaurant was busy and lively - a fun atmosphere for sure. so why 3 stars instead of 5? there were 7 of us at dinner and we all brought home leftovers. i ended up getting someone else's veal by mistake and when i opened the container i found a piece of VERY raw meat (it was veal milanese which is breaded - so either the person in our party who had it didn't see that it was raw because of the breading, or they saw and stopped eating it but didn't say anything). sort of put a damper on my excitement about piccolo sogno...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Been going here since the place opened when Opart was actually there. If you have to drive there, parking can be a bitch. The wait can be tough too but once seated, and I recommend not taking a table in the front room, you're in for some great Thai.Cheap and plentiful I think.A fave w/the lesbian crowd. They like it hot too!Tiger cry beef, Basil beef are quite nice.Afterward, hike over too Lincoln square proper & visit Cafe Selmarie.More Lizzies there too (lots) but the fresh pastries will soothe the Thai burn. Srawberry roulad or banana eclair ought to do it.Burp","[1.0, 0.0]"
This place started the entire lounge/hand-crafted cocktail experience and it STILL is the best!

"I am thoroughly addicted. The ribeye sausage with chimmi-churri is phenomenal. Ditto for the spicy pork hot link with the coca cola barbecue sauce. Any bacon sausage is well, bacon...how could it be bad, and the combinations of flavors Doug comes up with are really delectable. Yes, the lines are long...go early, but if you find yourself in a long line, don't fret...it moves fast, even my 2 year old can handle the wait.

"This is for delivery, as I have, of late, found it difficult to have a tasty pizza delivered (food poisoning from one place that I haven't reviewed recently has me off the Chicago deep dish for now). And with that... YAY! Piece is back! We've ordered a few pies from them recently and they have all been awesome. No more crust stuck to the middle of the box. Nice chew, not too much sauce or cheese - little heavy on onion, but I'm sure I could put in a request for them to go light and that would be remedied. And the chocolate pizza? Still about the best dessert/next day's breakfast if it lasts that long thing in the world. Oh!

"Let me start by saying its a nice place you can go get some beers and pizza. BUT this is not by any means Chicago or Deep Dish pizza, this is PAN pizza. Sorry guys Deep Dish pizza is not a bunch of dough, for all you who say this is Chicago's best deep dish you are sadly mistaken. For all you out of towners who thought you had deep dish in Chicago you were wrong and wronged by who ever told you that or took you there. I went there with a friend who told me I had to come and try this place as it was his favorite, it was a good pan pizza, but I was expecting deep dish.  deep dish can be found at giordanos, lous, ginos, ect... not saying those are my favorites but they are deep dish. In closing Do NOT go to pequods if you are looking for deep dish, but they do have pan pizza which is about 2 of dough with a little sauce and cheese.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Sausage with lady apples- 2 stars pork shoulder with potatoes- 4 stars brocolli- 2 stars beets- 4 stars The waiter was very nice and helpful in assisting us with the menu. I thought the food was mostly over priced but enjoyed the beets and pork shoulder. I probably wouldn't return here. I think this place is over rated.

"One among the many good bakeries in Chicago. I love going here for the treats as they truly are irresistible. And the cafe makes great coffee worth every penny. Also, studying there can be fun - if you can find a place to sit. Oh yeah, finding a place to sit during times that are busy - difficult, if not impossible.

"I really didn't know what to expect. I mean, I like to judge books on movies, so I definitely had an idea of what the Pasta Bowl was all about: pasta (duh!). I went in with high hopes, a hungry stomach, and my girlfriend. We were greeted by the staff and walked to a table near the ""kitchen"" (they cook everything in the bar area). We took a while to order because everything sounded delish. We wound up ordering the garlic cheese bread (meh, not too impressed), cappellini pomodoro (classically done), and the day's special: a chicken and ricotta tortellini dish served on a bed of pesto and topped with sun-dried tomatoes. Holy smokes! This was amazing. I mean it looked small, there were three tortellini, but it wound up being quite filling. (Tip: this tortellini dish was a special, but you can customize your own stuffed pasta dish on the menu!) The service was phenomenal. We waited like four minutes for our meal. It was super quick. Our server was very friendly and easy to talk to throughout our meal. He offered a sneak peak at desserts at the end of our meal. Normally we pass, but we said ""When in Rome..."" and ordered a cannoli. It was chocolate covered, and chilled. Very sweet and a perfect ending to a delightful meal. To round out the review, the prices were great. Super affordable, even for the guy asking for spare change off of Lake Shore Drive.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Sweet Jesus, there is no better place to eat in Chicago. As a former resident of Greece and a flaming enthusiast of Greek food, I stand by Greek Islands until the end over any other restaurant in Greektown. I always end up spending obscene amounts of money here because I order everything. I've learned over time that the best idea might be to share an entree with someone. Wait, scratch that. Just get two, you'll have left-overs and be overjoyed by them. As far as appetizers go, I recommend: octopus, saganaki, tzatziki, fried zucchini and horiatiki salad. If I were you, I would check and make sure you go on lamb Rosa Marina night because it is the most delicious thing you will ever eat in your life. The Mediterranean sea bass is also completely delicious. To top it off, get some Agioritiko wine and you will be well on your way to the most euphoric food coma of your life.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I tried the Ravioli and was really disappointed that I felt like I was tasting a stick of butter. The salad I had was a mix of chickpeas, tomatos, onions, cucumbers in a cabbage leaf...very cute and tasty, but not for 13 dollars. I won't rule this place out completely, it could be very cute for a date place and just wine, however dinner..probably not worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There was a squab course I wasn't the biggest fan of but if I only had one complaint out of 20+ courses, I'm okay with that. The price was high as is expected of any 3 Micheline star restaurant but I'd gladly do it again and look forward to the next visit!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Okay, I would've said ""Yay! I'm a fan"" (4 stars) only when I went to dip into my yummy leftovers - still yummy ice cold, btw - they had only packaged the meat and not the sides! I was more excited for the cheesy grits and greens this morning than the catfish (which was still plump and moist out of the fridge), but alas, the busboy made the executive decision that I wouldn't want it. My group and I were so full after sampling so many apps (I will get to those) that I barely touched the entree, so it was a HUGE disappointment to not get the grits and greens that had come w/ my meal.  ]o: The apps we tried ... fried green tomatoes, crawfish fritters, frog legs, cheddar croquettes, & house boucherie ... Fried Green Tomatoes: LOVED them! My friend Keren thought they were too hard, but a green tomato is unripe and hard by nature. I don't think I'd want a flavorful, crispy outside followed by a hot, mushy inside. The tomato being of a hearty consistency worked for me and my hubby. PS: The remolaude was FAN-TAS-TIC! Crawfish Fritters: Not a fan of these. Keren's & my hubby liked them, but K thought they tasted too fishy, and I thought they were more falafel than fritter. Froglegs: Tastes just like chicken! (Only chewier.) Seriously, it was a good experience having never tried them before. The bread-coating may've been a little too much though, it took away from the meat, but the legs were served with another KILLER sauce - sort of a marsala take that we all sopped up with the bread. Cheddar Croquettes: I really dug this one - crispy, flavorful outside, gooey, cheesy inside, & accompanied by another yummy sauce, like a mix b/w a green godess dressing and jalapeos. (This joint really should jar and sell their sauces!) K had a different idea of what a croqutte should be - something more along the lines of a puff pastry - but the deep-fried preparation rang true to me. House Boucherie: My hubby had asked for a small sample of the head cheese first which the waitress happily obliged. I tried head cheese for the first time in my life, folks, and it was scrumptious! There was a slight consistency issue at first (half lunchmeat, half jello-y), but when the taste expanded, I really enjoyed it! It was zesty like a good deli Genoa salami and the gents loved it equally. All the meats and pickled veggies on the platter are made in-house and you could really taste the quality.  Entrees we tried ... gumbo, pecan catfish, peach tea pork chop, shrimp & grits, benne chicken ... Gumbo: So I'm used to Zatarain's (what I use @ home) and I was initially put off by the deep brown color and hit-you-over-the-head bold flavor @ Big Jones, but after I got over the side-by-side comparison, I really enjoyed Big Jones' gumbo and there was definitely an authenticity about it. Pecan Catfish: My entree. The one that was sent home sans grits & greens. The catfish was plump and juicy and well seasoned and not at all fishy tasting. I thought there would be more pecan flavor infused into the pan-fried breaded sear, but there were plenty of crunchy, sauteed pecans embellishing the plate. The grits were a little stiffer than I had anticipated, but I attributed that to all the cheese. They were tasty on their own w/out me salt-and-peppering (which weren't even on the tables). The greens were sweet and sassy and simply delicious. Peach Tea Pork Chop: This chop could stand next to ANY steak and hold it's own. Served medium-rare-to-medium, it was a tender, savory, healthy portion adorned with cubed sweet potatoes in a thick, sweet gravy/sauce that spoke very southern to me. Shrimp & Grits: K's hubby ordered this one. He felt like it was a titch cold, but he acknowledged that it was probably prepared first and waiting on the others. He stirred it around and the creaminess was quickly restored and he said it was very good. If this was served with the same shrimp that adorned the green tomatoes app (I had forgot to mention that), I gotta believe it was excellent.  Benne Chicken: K ordered this dish and wasn't madly in love w/ it. Granted, we were full from the apps, but her reaction to it was pretty reserved. She said the chicken was good, but she didn't like the sauce. I went home with her leftover chicken, and honestly, it was just average. Decor ... fancier than I expected. I'd rather a grittier appearance, but it was nice. Service ... the waitress was great and accomodating. She forgot one cocktail round, but she laughed at her own ""oops"" in a way that was forgiving and endearing. The busser on the other hand was attentive to the point of being near annoying. The restaurant swaps out silverware/plates after every course and for me, it was too much. I love exemplary customer service, but in this case, the above and beyond was intrusive. We'd be in the middle of an antimated conversation, and he'd be up in us clearing the table ruining the moment, not to mention, leaving a crucial part of my entree out of the to-go package.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Interesting dining experience. We sat in the dining room on a high-top table abutting the fireplace (so it got a little warm). Very cheery and helful service, but the place was over 1/2 empty on this Wednesday before Thanksgiving. The many options on the expansive Salad/Pasta/Veggy Bar were for the most part good. A few did not agree with the five of us at the table, but that is to be expected. Not everyone can agree on all foods. The highlight of the Brazilian Style of service (where they bring the meats and fish to your table on a big skewer) was the Butter Beef. Tasted like Heaven. The Mahi Mahi also great. A lot of oohing and aahing at the table, but not everything was oh-my-gosh. You have to try each to see what you like, with some more memorable than others. I liked my Grape Martini. My wife thought her Lemon Drop Martini was a bit odd tasting. We shared the Butterscotch Bread Pudding which met the expectations of the waitress who described it. It was a birthday dinner, so one of the Puddings was served with candle on a plate with happy birthday spelled out in chocolate (nice touch). Given the focus on all-you-can-eat here, we may come here for a large group event (from time to time) but not on a regular basis if it's just the two of us. At least not for the full menu option (about $55, I think). The bar menu offers a scaled down, plated version of the meats for under $20 and I might opt for that next time. Beautiful and comfy decor in bar area.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is a pretty good Korean BBQ joint. The way this place really distinguishes itself is by giving you an oddly large number of side dishes--we counted 25 bowls. It's a little intimidating, but really, what other restaurant, of any kind, brings you 25 (yes, twenty-five!) of anything with your meal--at no extra charge?! And to boot, you can get any of them refilled, as many times as you want, at no extra charge. The BBQ is good, too. We got marinated beef and pork, and yes, it's fun to cook your own meat at your table. Good tasting, too--that beef marinate is phenomenal. Drawbacks? Well, we didn't know what we were eating with all 25 sides; in fact, less than half were easily identifiable. The waitstaff is super nice, but they only speak Korean, so when we asked what something was (it was one of the ones we didn't like), we got an extra serving instead. And really, if you're not into wasting food, you might not like this place: You're not going to like all 25 sides, so you're going to end up leaving a bunch of food on the table to be thrown out. Lastly, the place could use some remodeling, maybe a paint job, maybe something to brighten it up, as it's all dark brown wood inside. But a good place for Korean BBQ. I recommend you go if you like different things, want an eating experience, and want some good food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Fox & Obel is a difficult place to give a single rating to because it is made up of many different pieces. I'll review each separately, from the good to the bad to well, you know the rest.Grocery (5/5):We live across the street from Fox & Obel and love the convenience and selection. They have a great variety of different specialty options that you won't find elsewhere. They have a great cheese selection, a huge craft beer selection, more chocolate than you can imagine, coffees from around the world, meats, etc. If you're looking for something unique or high-end, this is the place for you. The prices aren't outrageous, but you're certainly going to pay more than you would at larger chain grocery stores.Desserts (5/5):Our usual stop is the dessert counter when we go to Fox & Obel. Their dolce de leche cheesecake, chocolate mousse, cookies fresh out of the oven, and pretty much anything else is amazing. If you ever need to bring a dessert to an outing, you can't go wrong here.Prepared Food (4/5):The kitchen does a great job with prepared foods. They must use the same ingredients that they sell in the store, and the portions are very large. The only reason I give if 4 stars is that the presentation isn't the best (a Luigi Bormioli water glass, breakfast served on a white porcelain plate, with a paper placemat and fruit in a paper cup? not terribly consistent...). The take out food is just as good as if you sit down, so a grab and go meal is great.Outdoor Patio (0/5):This is a recent addition to Fox & Obel. We saw them setting up a nice set of tables and lights on the sidewalk and decided to try it out for breakfast one morning. They weren't busy at all (1 table was taken) so we went in search of the hostess. She was inside at the top of the ramp and busy doing something. We asked if we could be seated, and she seemed surprised that we would want to. She then tried (convincingly) to turn us away. She said, ""You can only get bagels here"". Ok, can we get anything else? ""No, just cold sandwiches and some bagels"". Ok, can we grab take out from the Cafe and have coffee out on the patio? ""No, they don't allow that"". No wonder they're never busy.Cafe (2/5):Inside the store, you'll find another place to get food. This one is at the back of the store next to the milk. It's actually 2 places in one, and you need to be aware of the difference or you'll be turned away. There is a grab and go line that has a counter where some food can be ordered (but not all), a cash register, and some pastries in a case. Upon walking in, there are many tables for you to sit at and the way that the place is set up, you would think that you order your food, pay, and then sit down cafeteria style. But be careful, if you order your food at the counter and then try to sit in one the tables to the left you'll be turned away. In that section, you can only order your food at the table. You are only allowed to sit to the right if you order at the counter. They will not accomodate you if you make the mistake, as I saw a poor older couple in front of me learning the hard way.Market Bistro (1/5):When we got turned away from sitting on the patio we decided to try out the Market Bistro instead. It is full of potential and supposedly the nicer of the 3 places to eat within Fox & Obel. We walked in to find that there was no hostess, but only several stressed out waitstaff that were simultaneously training, seating, and taking orders. The long and short of the Market Bistro (for breakfast) is that the waitstaff is undertrained, confused, and the place is in chaos. It's as if the management grabbed a few employees from the grocery store floor and said ""you waited tables in college, great! Go work in the bistro!"" The food was good, the view was great, but the service was terrible.TL;DR:Fox & Obel is great as a grocery store and their kitchen is great. Their food service, though, is on par with a college diner on a Sunday morning. I would recommend coming here for groceries or to get take out (if you have time to wait in a confused line), but don't sit down to eat. It will ruin the experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is among about six Thai restaurants within a two block radius, so it doesn't necessarily stand out (especially due to the lack of friendly signage). However, when someone told me they pride themselves on BYOB Thai joints and that this is their favorite...it definitely peeked my interest. We went on a Saturday night and had zero problems getting a table. I was surprised by the decor and ambiance of the place. I was expecting somewhat of a dive, but it was really cute and kind of hip (as in I wanted to ask them what paint color was on the walls because I wanted to use it for my apartment).  The food was delicious, which is really what's going to keep me coming back. We started with the spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce (i.e. thinner/sweeter peanut butter) that was devoured in two minutes. We split two entrees: panang curry beef (it was great and not too spicy) and the chicken pad thai (yummy and not too greasy or sweet). I think the entire bill (including the beer we purchased at the corner shop) was $30...not bad for a Saturday night date.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hopleaf is ALWAYS crowded... and for a reason. Correction: Sometimes it's easy to get a table in the dining room, but the bar is ALWAYS crowded. The beer list is extensive, and the food is great.Everyone talks about the mussels - and with good reason. They always have 2 styles on the mussels. On my last visit, one of them was Spicy Thai Curry (sweet potato, jalepeno, cilantro & lime). Our waitress recommended those, and we loved 'em. They come with a mountain of frites... we loved them. Also... the CB&J (cashew butter & fig jam, with raclette cheese on grilled sourdough) has to be tasted to be believed. Served with their mac n cheese, these two dishes were enough to satisfy two hungry people (along with a couple choices off the beer list).","[1.0, 0.0]"
This is the best and most authentic chinese restaurant in chicago and maybe the best in the midwest. I've had sze chuan food from hundreds of different places all over the country and this food is phenomenal. I recomend the lunch special and anything with a pepper next to it. The dishes I had most recently were **TONY'S SPECIAL CHICKEN W/THREE CHILI** and **LAMB W/PURE CUMIN POWDER XING JANG STYLE** (They are all good though.) Don't be a typical american and order orange chicken (but even if you do it will be fantastic.) I try to eat at this place at LEAST once a month and this month I've already been twice.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I found this little place from the Chicago Scene magazine so I thought that I would give it a try. I must say that when you go you will feel as if you are in the hood, but the place is very nice. It is kind of small but the whole thing opens up to the side walk and if it is nice out there is a huge patio to enjoy. The food is excellent. It was a little busy when I was there so i did experience a little wait, but definitely worth it. On their website they have a virtual walk-Through you can walk through the whole establishment.

"This star rating has nothing to do with the food or the awesome selection of beers this fine establishment has. It has everything to do with Rob the bartender. Hey Rob, you are a BARTENDER at a BEER BAR, one with TONS OF GREAT BEERS. Maybe you should take some time and learn what you have on tap, or maybe which ones taste better than others, or even just the pretty pictures on the labels. Patron: What are some good IPAs you have on tap? Can you recommend a good lager? I'm looking for something local. Rob: What? Uh, here's a good one (points to nearest tap) Patron: Is it an IPA? Did you hear what I asked? It's kind of loud in here... Rob (annoyed): Theres a lot of beers, here's a list. Maybe Hopleaf should change thier name to 'High Fidelity', then they could hire Jack Black, then Rob the bartender would feel right at home. I'm not saying your a mean guy, just take some interest in your product, like every other great bartender there. I have given up asking you for recommendations, but can you try to remember what I am drinking when I come back up for another? I know, I know - its sort of hard in a crowded bar, but even the creepy guy at my bus stop remembers the hat I wore the day before. My heart sinks a little when I accidentally get your attention at the bar instead of that other cool guy with the beard that is pleasant and knows his shit. Lastly, all of this ignorance and forgetfulness wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so clearly bummed out that you have to get my drink in the first place. You could get your panties in a twist over this review and somehow become even more unpleasant next time I order a drink. Or you could just cowboy-up your awesome job as a bartender at one of the best bars in Chicago. Kisses, D","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I eat here at least once a week. I consider Wildfire to be a moderately priced steakhouse. When I was younger and made less money than i do now, I would consider Outback to be a good place to go have steak at a reasonable price. Wildfire is now that place for me. Average meal price with a half bottle of wine and 2 drinks comes out to about $120 for two people. Their fixed price steak option is always a good bet - you get a salad, 6oz filet, and dessert for under $40 pp. My steak always comes out done like I ask (medium) and I've never had any issues with service. They are always busy but you can usually walk in and wait for a table.Definite must haves: Wildfire Chopped Chicken Salad, Bacon Wrapped scallop skewers, double stuffed baked potato, Skinny Pineapple Martini, and if you go on sunday - their turkey dinner is delicious!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"By far one of the best restaurants in Chinatown.You will see a great variety of people dining here. It serves authentic Sze Chuan cuisine. It disgusts me when people go into this restaurant and order stuff like egg rolls and fried rice. Skip it. If you want that, go to Panda Express. If you don't know what to order, ask for recommendations. Every single time we have dined here, we have had great service and amazing food. Highly recommend the Three Chili Chicken (Chef Specialty), which is somewhat powdery(?), spicy chicken with just the right amount of oil. Pure heaven. Lao Sze Chuan also serves the REAL orange chicken and orange beef which is simply amazing. Nothing like the frozen crap served at places like Panda Express. They use real orange peels and it has just a hint of crispiness.Now if you can handle spiciness, you will enjoy this restaurant. Otherwise you will be missing out on the true gems of this place. One of my all-time favorites is the (Spicy Fish Stew?). Very spicy, very numbing, very delicious. I love it! Try the hot pot if you've never had it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

You can clearly see that 6:35 to 7:44 is not 39 minutes. When I called back to say that I do not appreciate being lied to the same man on the phone said that is what his Manager told him to tell me. Bad business practice. Will most likely not order from them again. Sad because they do have really good food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"San Soo Gab San has come a long way in the years it's been around. I live down the street, and as a result cannot award this place more than 3 stars simply for the parking headache all you raving yelpers have caused me... However, the food is pretty spectacular, and unlike when they first opened, the service is not too bad. I used to be afraid to come in here unless one of my Korean friends was in tow. I know that sounds bad, but back in the day, we used to honestly make a game out of rating the service in here with versus without a korean in the dinner party. The results were needless to say, a little lopsided. I guess they eventually realized what business the yuppie invasion could bring them and started being nice to everyone.I would certainly recommend them for Korean BBQ, and chances re, if you do not live on my block, your rating will probably be more in the 4 to 5 star range... just don't go and park like an asshole!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I can appreciate Xoco because after beginning culinary training in my youth, and hosting a 26-part PBS series called 'Cooking Mexican' in the seventies, I dedicated over six years to culinary research in Mexico, culminating with the publication of my 'Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico'.** Wait... I didn't do those things. Rick Bayless did. And thank goodness for that, because it allowed the confluence of events that yielded Xoco's opening last year. And that allowed me to experience the Ahogada sandwich. ""Ahogada"" literally means ""drowned."" Yes, my wood-grilled pulled pork sandwich was fantastically seasoned and fired to crunchy delicious perfection but it was also cut in half, with the middle ends ""drowned"" in a shallow bowl of a thick tomato-based spicy salsa. The sandwich halves pointed up like twin obelisks, and when the item was served to me, everybody nearby in the restaurant looked on with awe at how fantastic the sandwich looked and the presentation was. I have only had this sandwich once (so far) but it is rapidly contending to join the list of my top 10 favorite sandwiches ever. In addition, the guacamole at Xoco is fantastic, as well as liberally peppered with chiles. The cubano sandwich is solid, if not awe-inspiring. It is also worth noting that they've got about six different kinds of ""hot chocolate,"" including one I found to be an amazing novelty that was mixed with ancho chiles. Hot chocolate with a bite! Yes, it works. Xoco has quite clearly considered every aspect of its service and cuisine. The dining experience is full of individual flair and makes you feel intrigued at every step forward. I have rarely experienced this much of a ""wow factor"" at a place that was under $15 per person for a full meal. **synopsized from wikipedia","[0.0, 1.0]"

I really enjoyed their Tofu spring rolls and the Pho. My son loved the Lemongrass Chicken, and my daughter preferred the Fried Rice and the Pho. The Pho wasn't the largest bowl I've ever had for the price but the flavor was excellent and the noodles were perfect. The Lemongrass chicken wasn't quite spicy enough for my sons liking so he spiced it a bit with the spice for the Pho. Giving it 5 Stars on the recommendation of both the kids! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Favorite pub in the Chicagoland area. Amazing tap list - a great mix of American and Belgian micros as well as a ridiculous bottle list. A great thing about Hopleaf is they have a great mix of local, seasonal, and little known brews to rock your palate. As a proponent of beer nerdery, a solid 2 thumbs and a big toe up. The food is also incredible. As detailed below, a great mix of pub food, American comfort food, and sometimes charcuterie. I recommend the mussels as well as anything they have on special - I've never been disappointed. I take visitors from out of town here frequently - everyone loves it and wants to go when they're back in Chicago. I can't really talk about specific entrees since I've had most of them, but the food is truly delicious, simple and unpretentious. The service is great, but the bar gets PACKED. The kitchen opens 5:30 pm most days, so if you show up around then with your party you'll probably be seated quickly. After 5:30, godspeed. Definitely the best mix of delicious food and awesome beer in Chicago with the personality and atmosphere to match. However, I don't recommend it, as I don't want the place more packed than it already is.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The Gage holds a decent St. Patrick's Day party. We had some delicious Gage mini-sliders, mini fish and chips, and some other random hors d'oeurves that weren't too memorable. The bartenders were attentive and mellow, and overall, I had a great time despite the fact the space is in the basement of the building (i.e. no view). Since then I've made enough trips to warrant a real review. One of the classier joints to frequent south of Madison Avenue, the Gage keeps a good price range on their menu. You can pick a few small dishes to nibble or do a progression. Having the subtle delineation of first/second/third/fourth to indicate whether a plate is ""snack-sized"" or entre-sized is very helpful when going in a group, especially if the sight of some $40 entres is a bit intimidating. The Gage's wine list begins at a higher price point of around $40. And they have, on occasion, run out of the first wine my group's requested. They have mastered the $12 martini though, especially for a Michigan Ave/Millenium Park spot. There are some perks to being an upscale Elephant and Castle. For starters, they have classic fallbacks that are consistently great. The Gage Burger and Fish and Chips are always satisfying (and on the cheaper end of the entres!) The Elk Saddle with ricotta and rhubarb to contrast well as mild salt/sweet, is a superb dinner if you feel like shelling that much out. Unfortunately, saddle's not the only reflection of their elk preparation. Poutine: gravy, cheese curds and fries, with an elk ragout enticing me as a catalyst, disappointed as an oversalted ""snack"". Screwing up salt is always a no-no. As for sides, the brie potato is as rich as it sounds, and nice and crisp. On seconds: I was quickly disillusioned with their Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab. The breading was half salt, while the afterthought of lemon crme fraiche and caviar weren't the best. The mussels with vindaloo are savory and succulent though, and a better seafood pick. Rabbit was seasoned really well, as was the caramelized lobster. Both of these dishes rock this part of the menu. When it came to dessert, the peanut butter beignets immediately drew my eye. I love beignets, and the play on PB&J was charming and effective. French toast? Not so much. With the emergence of so many other gastropubs recently, the Gage has too much volatility in its menu for me to rate it well. It's not even about the unwarrantedly high price point. Their hits and misses are equally strong, and they really need to work on their salt issue; it's an elementary skill to master.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is a great place to come for a happy hour on Friday after work, say, 3ish! I had remarked to my friend, ""There shouldn't be much of a crowd at 3 on Friday"", but I was wrong! This place was bustling, with the outdoor patio open (it was chilly, but they have multiple outdoor heaters). We sat outside and had drinks and shared some small plates. My favorite thing, hands down, was the spring peas with red onions and feta. Also very tasty, and meaty, was the pork neck bone with ricotta. Don't be turned off by the whole pork neck bone thing....it is sorta served in this croque with fresh sliced bread to spread. If you are into olives, order the fried ones here. Reminiscent of fried pickles, the fatty/rich/bitter taste is delicious. We also tried the milk braised pork shoulder. It was good, not my favorite, but was very tender and served with mashed potatoes. The only thing I didn't like here was the hostess. When we came into the restaurant to be seated, she acted like it was quite a chore to help us.  There are a lot of things on the menu, I will be back to try some other items.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Sun Wah is only my favorite Chinese restaurant in town, but my favorite restaurant on Argyle and my standby ""I am stressed and need to have my way"" restaurant. If I go on my own, I am moderately stressed. If I ask my wife to go with then I am really stressed. I have a lot of stories about Sun Wah and most have less to do with the duck, Hong Kong pork, or garlic fried ribs than I care to admit. Sun Wah is great family run restaurant that offers one of the top special dinners in town in the Beijing Duck special. For $28, you share a 4 course meal with as many of your friends as you choose. You get first tableside cut duck in buns, then comes the duck soup, next is the remainder of the duck in duck fried rice, and finally comes house made sorbet. If you are lucky, you get a fifth course of radishes to start. We love the owner's daughters who have so much energy, knowledge, and willingness to chat. The Duck special is great, but if you want to go off menu, try the Hong Kong Pork or Garlic Fried Ribs.

"Please note that I'm commenting on the ""salad bar only"" option! As a vegan, I have no interest in the all-you-can-eat meat. However, I've had the opportunity to try the extensive salad bar a couple times while dining with meat-eating co-workers and friends. It is not your average salad bar. It is overflowing with fresh vegetables and ""fancy"" things like asparagus, artichoke hearts and hearts of palm. There are numerous types of olives and seeds to go on top. Fresh bread and olive oil help fill you up. However, I just can't justify paying about $30 for salad. Even if I absolutely stuff myself, I'm hungry an hour later. I can understand the meat option being as expensive as it is; however, they should really reconsider how much they charge for the ""salad bar only"" option.","[0.0, 1.0]"

NO (hence, service) Are the portions large? NO Is this place cramped? NO (Avec is my ""cramped"" standard) Is this place worth the money? NO I thought the food was actually quite overpriced for tapas-style dining. We ordered the spicy pork rinds (not spicy at all, more like sprinkled with cheese, not impressed). We also had charcuterie plate, steak tartare, and pork belly which were all excellent (4-star range). There were two of us gals sharing, and after this amount of food, we felt content and not overstuffed.

Two things that were note-worthy: Chef Shin was working the room. He had his quality control hat on and is very charming and nice. You can tell that the restaurant is his baby. Second, they sneaked in a 6 course that was awesome. It was a rabbit stew in a large spoon. Very unexpected and tasty.  Two notes: they should leave your wine on the table.

Well the eggs weren't scrambled, they were just broken into an omelet pan and cooked until rubbery; the hash browns were burnt.

The Beet Salad though was fantastic, with great colors and presentation along with the sweetness of beet and citrus. The hand roasted Brisket Sandwich is open faced and absolutely delicious! The Salmon Sandwich my girlfriend ordered was also equally great, both came with delicious fries. Overall if you focus on the sandwiches, you should really have a great meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love Yolk! This is the must visit breakfast place in Chicago! You going to have to wait for a table-but it is well worth it! I love the menu an the staff is great! It is never a dull moment because the place is always packed!I enjoy crowds, so the Yolk is my number one breakfast spot. I love the counter because I can see my food being prepared and you are always meeting people. So make sure you put the yolk on your list of spots to visit for a great bite to eat.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I attended Pequod's for the lunch special. I was disappointed to say the least. After a few sips of my Diet Coke I noticed something floating in it. I asked the waitress for a new drink about 10 minutes before we received our food. I did not receive a new one until about 10 minutes after we received our food. I did not receive an apology for the wait, or the fact that I received a drink with a mysterious object floating in it.The quality of the pizza was sub-par at best. The sauce is too sweet and there is way too much of it. There was also way too much crust which took away from the taste. I had heard raves about the caramelized crust, but I was not at all impressed. It' taste was a mixture of tasteless dough and burned dough.My experience was enough to convince me to not return.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Went there on my birthday and had a blast. They have half off margarita pitchers on Tuesdays which just hapen to be my birthday night. I got wasted and ended up partying with one of the waitresses after she got off work. It was a blast. Besides that though the atmosphere is wonderful with an authentic Mexican feel. This place also has a porch in the back which is nicely decorated as well.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
Went back. Wow. Much better. Portions seemed more filling thatn previous visits and not as hard-hitting on my wallet as I expected. Buffalo style sweetbreads are a must.

"This place is over-hyped. With over 600 raving Yelp reviews and over 2 hours wait on a Friday evening, I just didn't think it was worth it.  Meatballs over polenta - these were very tasty Scallops with oxtail and gnocchi - probably my favorite dish; the scallops were cooked to perfection Buffalo frog legs - meh, basically skinny chicken wings with a fluffy bleu cheese dipping sauce Venison- not particularly my kind of thing, but others at the table liked it; the sauce was tasty Pasta dish with butternut squash and smoked cauliflower - way way too salty and smokey; not very good Dessert- nothing sounded good, so we didn't order anything There are a lot of similar places in Chicago that I believe have better food at equal or lower prices with less waiting. The service was friendly, but it is so crowded in there that we kept getting bumped into by people standing at the bar and getting our jackets knocked off the backs of our chairs and onto the floor by servers walking by. The food was good enough, but I doubt I'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Never I my life have a been to such a pretentious restaurant with a wait staff to match. The waiter (who said he was the assistant manager) was rude and even though they took the reservation knowing that members of the party had food allergies, he refused to make the dishes according to those needs. In fact he told us quite obnoxiously ""he would be happy to make us a reservation at another restaurant"". To everyone who will listen....DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food's great and while the sandwiches can be considered pricey to some, the flavors are unique. You don't usually get the type of ingredients that they put into their sandwiches, so as long as you can appreciate it. On the other hand I'm sure there are plenty of people who would say I don't get the hype or I could just get a deli sandwich or $5 footlong - why bother for a sandwich. So, I'd say know what you're getting into. A tasty $9-$10 sandwich with unique flavors. The churros are also great, but again there will be some saying it's a churro. While I agree, it was probably the best churro I've had to date.For me, I really like the place, definitely think it's worth it (especially considering the premium you have to pay for either Frontera or Topolobampo) and will definitely be back. Be prepared for a wait if it's during meal times and you have to get a table before you can order your food, which is a little weird. Finally, if you don't care about sitting there, consider the to go option, where you can skip part of the line.All in all, Xoco's a winner, unique flavors, gourmet sandwiches, relatively reasonable prices.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Calo's has very solid Italian dishes. The food is not trendy or pretentious, just good, filling, classic Italian fare. As expected, they have really great pizza (and feature giardinera as a topping which is a HUGE plus in my opinion). That said, I must admit that I miss the OLD Calo's -- the one with the 60's neighborhood pseudo-supper-clubby atmosphere. It had great character! On the weekends there was always a band and cute neighborhood couples would trip the light fantastic on the dance floor. Now Calo's has been remodeled (actually it was a couple of years ago) and the remodel is nice. The problem is that it's just a little too generic-yuppie. Last time I was there, there was a ""light jazz"" combo (which is OK), but no one was dancing. The ""old school"" atmosphere is definitely missed (at least by this nostalgic ol' queen!). In short, for home-style classic Italian dishes, Calo's know exactly what they're doing (and have been doing it for a long time).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've heard so much about how authentic their tacos are and although they are good and really tiny, I sometimes find that the meat is rather tough/rubbery which is a turn off. The salsa is really good too. It seems a little pricey though, two really small tacos for almost $5?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants, especially when there's an atypical drink list involved.  We got to Rev. Brew around 7:30 on a Tuesday and the place was hopping! Not overly hopping where we waited an hour to get a table, but we did wait about 15-20 minutes. However, what I thought was very cool was they had a server in the lounge area-- we were able to get a drink (the Anti-Hero I.P.A) while we were waiting. We commented how we liked the vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant. Any restaurant that has eclectic groups of cliental is usually a sign that it's good. When we got to our table we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We ordered our food (my boyfriend got the Hombre Burger and I ordered the Tofu Chili Dog) and it wasn't long before it came out. Justin said his burger was a B+ (""about an 8.7, 8.8 out of 10) and I found my tofu chili dog to be pretty flavorful! Aside from the food, we were impressed with the beer menu. No Coor's Light, Miller Light, or Bud! They (for obvious reasons) highlighted their microbrews, but if you weren't interested in those, they also offered a plethora of other microbrewed beers. Like I said before, we tried their I.P.A (as I'm a huge fan of India Pale Ales) and it was pretty good. It wasn't as hoppy as an I.P.A usually is, but tasty none-the-less.  All in all, this place had delicious eats, good beers, and a hip vibe. We will be returning here!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Always great to dine in a Italian restaurant and Italian food is my favorite. Sabatino's deserves 5 stars. The steak is perfectly marbled and grilled and the amazing crispy French fries)are simply destined to go.They have excellent soups. On my last visit we had a lovely cold Tomato puree that was to die for. The flavors were perfect, and I am not normally a fan of cold soups with the steak on this plate.The pasta dishes here are always the measuring stick for me and Sabatino's has some very appealing choices. The meat and seafood courses have always been impressive. The chef has a light hand and one rarely sees anything overcooked. Last time I was here 3 months ago tried the Agnello Casalinga which is a grilled lamb chop done with shitake mushrooms and julienned bell peppers in a white wine reduction with balsamic vinegar. Oh my! What flavor. The lamb was amazingly tender but most importantly, it was very mellow tasting, just like I prefer it. If you like lamb, try this dish!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was really excited to try this place after reading all the reviews on Yelp and Metromix. We went on a Friday night around 8:30 pm. There was no problem finding parking and the line was only about 5 people tall. It was drizzling outside, and luckily, we all got to wait inside the hallway. Once the man with the gentle voice let us through the blue velvet curtain, we were seated in the third room (out of three rooms). There were two bars and the chairs had really high backs. It was very dim and perfect for a romantic night. My boyfriend said, ""It feels like Halloween!"" Ha, yes there were some freaks there. Unfortunately, we didn't get a table per say, but more like a bench with a cushion for our table. We ordered two Spanish Margaritas because the 43 Liquer brings back memories and I had to have it. When the waitress arrived with the tiny Margarita glasses I was concerned, especially since they are $11/each! But then I saw it came with a separate glass container to refill. After finishing the first drink in its entirety, we realized that the $11 drink was well worth the money! The drink was strong, but while you are drinking it you have no idea how strong it is! We also ordered the waffle fries with blue cheese/onion dip, which were very good. Later, I tried the Juliet and Romeo (backwards, I know), which had cucumber, mint, gin, etc....really good! The atmosphere was really relaxing and great for conversation and people-watching. The waitress was kind of a jerk, but we didn't go to see her, so no harm done. Overall, I will go back to try the other drinks on the menu and, hopefully, sit at a real table with a high-back chair.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I love Pequod's for a pre-movie (at the Webster theaters) dinner.  The thin crust is my personal favorite, partly because they leave the thicker crust around the edges so you have something to grab on to! They're also pretty generous with the toppings. We usually get pepperoni and green peppers and let me tell you, that thing is PACKED. The appetizers are standard, nothing especially outstanding, but my girlfriend seems to be a fan of the jalepeno poppers (I have no problem 'helping' her eat them).  Service is always pleasant and very helpful. I don't think I've ever had to ask anyone to refill any beverage, water, soda or beer or for anything else. That's the kind of service that makes me really want to go back. And we do (we also order a lot of delivery...go figure). The restaurant is a little on the small side, but the wait isn't too long usually because there's a pretty good turnover, especially on a weekend night. Two people can eat a nice dinner before a movie for less than $25 (which almost how much two movie tickets cost!!).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The ruse is on! Walked out feeling bamboozled, hoodwinked, scammed, screwed, fleeced, deceived and taken for a ride. I limped back to my car from the action I took in the rear. It is in all honesty that writing this review disappoints me greatly. I have read the numerous critical rantings about XOCO and chalked them up to people who either didn't get it, or of jealous wannabes who don't like seeing one Chef get all the attention. Dear Rick,  Why I ask are my lips burning from salt? Not just my dish, my girls dish as well. Why when I leaned up against a wall did I receive nearly a second degree burn? Is there a reason your glorified bus boy manager can't work the room and ask how your meal is? If someone takes an enormous dump, is there any guarantee I won't have to smell it while eating my salty broth?  I can answer one. In your greedy quest to squeeze two more people into your restaurant tube, you placed a piece of sheet metal around your wood fired oven. This results in a very hot wall with a chair next to it. Idiotic at best. I was lucky enough to find street parking right across the street, that was the end of my good fortunes. The line didn't seem very long and the menu was beautifully written, it yielded great promises of culinary excitement. As we clutched our menu, made our choices we watched a chef make one after another perfect empanadas. We stared at the wood burning oven relinquish its pleasures onto plates. Unfortunately this went on for quite some time, we waited for twenty minutes without the line moving. We were four people back in the line with no order being taken, no explanation.  Finally, we order, we get directed to our ominous table against the oven. My buddy Jack P. in his stirring review spoke of the Feng shui being of a ""bus station, I can't argue with that. While waiting for the bathroom I was useful in holding the walk in cooler door open for a chef, stepping back and forth out of peoples way and most of all just clogging up the isle. First our Polverones and hot chocolate arrive, fantastic. The best short bread cookie ever, even though I suspect it was a touch raw inside. The hot chocolate was rich, complex and exactly what I expect from Bayless. The Short Rib soup comes and my anticipation has got me giddy. A tremendous disappointment. The broth was so salty it stripped me of my abilities to taste anything. Chunks of zucchini and potato were added to the bowl rather than simmered in this briny bath. I think of a soup as an iconic representation of simplicity. This was more like four ingredients introduced to each other, and never having the time to get to know one another.  Even had the saltiness not ruined it for me, this would have been a major failure. At one desperate point I poured some of my water into my soup just to make it palatable, even this desperate venture was inadequate in diluting the oceanic vibe of my broth. The smoked pork torta was served plunged halfway into a broth of arbol chilies, we ordered spicy and it was, problem was it was so salty, again with the salt. I don't get it. I looked around at the table next to us, a six top that was struggling with the same issues. No one comes around to ask ""hows your soup."" Narry a manager to be seen except to explain to people how to stand in line for a half hour. The ingredients were all excellent, but the parts were greater than the whole. When this concept was announced I imagined a great place to get a cafe con leche, a real churro, maybe a tamal and a champurado. I guess Ricks bean counters thought that would not generate enough income. Soup, sandwich, cookie, and a hot chocolate=$36 if this food could have lived up to my previous Bayless experiences then that would have been a fine price to pay. I am sorry, but I will stick to my small taquerias para caldo y tortas. Gracias.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Okay, so this was my 1st experience with Korean BBQ. Let me start out by saying the BBQ part was REALLY good. As for the rest, I'm not sure what to think. I understand that no one there speaks any English and cannot communicate the menu, and that's fine. However, I would really appreciate there was an explanation of BBQ on the menu. If that's too tacky or non traditional, some written material should be available on request, or at the very least, when a confused ignorant customer comes in like myself.  The woman that seated us had a very angry look in her eye that made me think I had just crashed a party. She took me to our table and our waitress. I asked the waitress what she recommended. Without hesitation, she fingered another waitress and all she could say was ""rib"" and ""chicken"" and ""good."" That sounded fine I thought.  They proceeded to throw 20 plates of food, the BBQ, BBQ setup, the appetizers, water, and drinks all at once and then left, never to return until they cleared the table.  I tried to ask the latino bus boy in Spanish what was going on, but he was just as clueless as I was. Maybe it was his 1st day.  I've had Korean cuisine but never the BBQ. I would have Korean BBQ again, but i did not think I had to research Korean BBQ before I went in. Silly me.

"My experience at ZED was extremely mixed. I arrived at around 9:30 PM with a friend on Friday, July 3rd. We were meeting a group of other friends, who had arrived just 15 minutes earlier. We choose ZED because of the rooftop. Anyway, when we arrived, we were told the rooftop was full so we would have to put our names down and wait. It was weird because our friends, who were only 15 minutes ahead of us, were able to go right up. Because it became ""full"" so recently, I assumed we were on top of the wait-list and that we would be up shortly. Several groups of people left from upstairs during the time that we were waiting, but we were not allowed up. In fact, no one else that was waiting was either, so we got kind of suspicious. I almost felt as though it was trying to act ""exclusive"" and ""popular"" when it really wasn't. Anyway, after waiting for about 30-40 minutes, we were finally called to go upstairs. Once upstairs, our experience changed dramatically. We met some people who invited us to their table. We ordered bottles of champagne. The service was impeccable - the waiters were bringing us shots of Patron and various appetizers on the house. The food was great - I really liked the egg rolls and cheese fondue. The bread was amazing! The rooftop was also really nice, with a decent view of the surrounding buildings (it was not high enough for a great view of the city, but it was not bad). I recommend ZED, but have to say it was a bit pretentious. And be ready to spend $$.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Thanks guys ------- I was really excited to try Irazu, because I've heard so many great things. The food was good - really good actually, but not excellent - the service wrecked the experience, and unfortunately the meal. All but one of our meals were cold, as evidently they had been made at different times and brought them out together. That was approximately 45 minutes after we put in a simple order for 4 people. 2 people got the wrong order but were too exhausted and hungry to argue - not that we could get anyone's attention for service. We had to ask for water, ask for our both of our bottles of wine to be opened. Add to that, dirty cups and silverware. SO disappointing. I love casual dining, and the spirit of this place.

"This is only a review of their brunch.  First off, it's a bit pricey at $25 plus drink, plus tax and tip it'll easily hit around $35 per person, but this is one of the few places that is worth spending that much on brunch. Everything, and I mean everything was delicious. That is no small feat considering the number of dishes they bring to you and the vast array of choices available at the buffet area. Everything was obviously high quality, and they definitely take pride in their preparation.  The atmosphere for brunch is pretty laid back, and I really enjoyed it. It looks like a pretty hip place during the evenings, but I haven't been there for anything other than brunch. In fact, I'm not sure if I'd be hip enough to have dinner there. I whole-heartedly recommend Zed451 for brunch. Give it a try.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great Pizza and even better selection. This is the only place in town that you can get any slice, any style (stuffed, pan or thin) at any time of the day. If they don't have selection that you want ready and hot when you are up to order you must just not like pizza. I subtracted one star because the dining room is usually dirty and delivery time is slow. Maybe they are just understaffed and can't keep up with the Lakeview demand?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Food was average and the service was fine but the bar itself is nothing that a Chicago bar should be. Way over the top corny atmosphere with a weird prison theme. People who actually enjoy hard rock don't need a ""theme"". So many bars in this area. Choose one that's a little more authentic.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Mmmm! Yum yum yum! I would like to eat and drink every meal here for the rest of my life. Actually, I think I'll just move in. They allow that, right? Then I could probably skip that horrendous wait they always (deservedly) have and dig right in. Honestly, I don't know how the staff here stays so svelte. If I worked there -- or even lived in the immediate area -- I would be at least 100 lbs heavier. Brunch, dinner, it doesn't matter; all of the food is rich, comforting, deliciousness. I especially recommend the Mac and Cheese. I actually wanted to place an order of it to take home and eat for lunch tomorrow, but unfortunately, I missed the 3pm deadline. Ah, oh well, next time. The drink list is all kinds of whiskey amazingness. Just point and shoot at the menu, and you'll end up with liquid happiness in a glass.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I work in the neighborhood and noticed this place had just opened. For Ukrainian Village it is definitely different. Most of the bars close by are dives with low grade bar food. This place has a hard rock/prison theme to it, and it looks like they put a ton of time and effort to make it look the part.The beer list is huge. They have a great selection. I also tried one of their burgers (it had prosciutto and apple slices,very unusual). This thing was huge, juicy, messy, and great. They also have wall to wall plasma screens playing a live concert. There was a schedule with that shows are on what days so I think I'll be back to watch Peal Jam and try another burger.This is a great addition to the neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I don't think you can really go wrong with Wildfire. Its great food, great environment, and great service. I come here once every few months and they never disappoint. The last time I was here, we were celebrating a friends birthday. The food came out quick and everyone enjoyed their food. I think my favorites here would have to be the horseradish baked clams, their famous crusted filet medallions, their halibut, barbecue and rib combo, and last but certainly not least, their key lime pies. Those things are to die for. no, honestly, TO DIE FOR. I've been here a couple of times just to pick up a pie to go. Their salads are pretty good too. I love the Wildfire Cobb salad, not healthy but definitely satisfying. Also, their mashed potatoes are extremely tasty. I'm surprised that they're pretty packed 7 days a week so reservations are probably the smart way to go. We''ve been pretty lucky with parking whenever we come here so definitely drive around the block so you can save the money for a key lime pie to go!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been to Publican a couple of times now. It's always worth a visit because the menu is constantly changing. Yay for new things to try!

Also, do NOT miss the fries with the egg on top. Nothing better than breaking the yolk with the first fry and dipping it into the yummy goodness.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"4.5 stars Asking why you must come to Davanti Enoteca is like asking why you have to play that next level of Angry Birds....you just have to. Anyway the star of the night really was the marscapone polenta which had the best creamy texture and depth in flavor with the ragu of the night. (happened to be a mix of veal, beef, and sausage--slightly salty but forgiveable). The pizza with mushrooms/leeks/truffle oil was stellar and had real depth of flavor in the multiple cheeses! Yes of course I swoon at any mention of truffle oil.. but the combination of the braised leeks and mushrooms really was creative and well executed. The toast with egg/truffle oil/asparagus was a wonderful combination of texture crunchy toast, melty cheese, and runny egg.. but I'm not sure if I would order it again just b/c there are so many other things on the menu. Also the eggs come slightly undercooked/runny for those who are wary of such things. Also tried the cannoli sundae which was basically like a full sundae cup of the cannoli ricotta filling and chocolate chips with pieces of crushed fried cannoli shells. To be fair, I'm more of a marscapone cannoli type of girl. That said, I wasn't really very impressed with this dish at all and wouldn't order it again. Overall, the service was great.. Waiter was helpful and friendly. Although I hate when the service clears food before you are done and you are wistfully watching it gone gone gone away before you can stop them.  I find their wine list on that humongous wine bottle rather obnoxious...and heavy! Very reasonable priced paid about ~$25 per person without drinks. I think the pricing really adds to the rating of this place. Hate that they don't take reservations.. get there early! Haven't seen a creative menu like this in a long time!! love it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of the best bakeries in the neighborhood. I always get the chocolate croissants. They sell Intellegentsia coffee by the bag. They make excellent chocolate cake. The staff make this place cool and hip. The minus one star is for not stocking up on baked good and opening late on weekends. They do not open until 7 A.M. I understand the yuppies in wicker park do not get up early on the weekends because they are out all night but, there are people like me who get up early. Also, they run out of most pastries before 11:00 a.m. on a weekday or 10:00 a.m. on a weekend.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ok, From most of the reviews the People get this place. It's not your corner Dive bar. Don't order a rum & coke or a bud light ok ?! Don't go in trying to hook up. This is a real cocktail lounge. People who want to have well made cocktails come here. Foodies, people with pallets. I know, I know, maybe this isn't the place to come twice a week & have people yell ""Norm !!"" when you walk in. Your not going to watch ""The Game"" here. What you SHOULD do is 1) Come in with an open mind, willing to try something you've never had before 2) Sit at the bar if it's an option. 3) Trust your bartender, tell him what you like, IE, a rum drink, not to sweet, or a gin drink that's smooth. Let them do what they do. Do not come here and expect it to be like other Chicago bars. Don't come here ""Instead of"" somewhere else. Come because you want the best made, well balanced cocktail you can get, and judge it on that. You wont be disappointed","[0.0, 1.0]"
"OK I'm 95% sure I got the right La Pasadita for this review, which seems to be a constant source of confusion in these reviews. According to my detailed analysis, 37% of La Pasadita reviews are posted on the wrong location. Don't take that statistic too seriously though; also according to my analysis, Tina Fey and I are BFFs. Anyway, this is the biggest of the three Las Pasaditas (LPs from here on out) on the west side of the street, slightly to the south of the other one. You can get table service here if you decide to eat in. I got carry-out. The menu here is the most expansive of the three LPs. You can get tacos, tostadas, tortas, burritos, fajitas and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. This may also be the best location for us gringos. I haven't been to the one just north of here, but the one across the street can be a bit intimidating at times for someone as lily-white as me (even though I do speak a little Spanish). The service was OK. Not super friendly, but not mean...just a bit cool. It took awhile to get my food after I ordered, but not quite long enough to be too long. My order was completely accurate. I really enjoyed my chicken torta. It was messy and tough to eat, but there was a generous amount of flavorful chicken on it and they didn't skimp on the other toppings. My steak taco (with only onions and cilantro, the default taco toppings at all LPs) was also good. Finally, my horchata was delicious. I think the prices here are quite fair for what you get. The torta was 3-something, and it was very big. I got a torta, a taco and a regular horchata for under $8 and it was plenty to fill me up. If you're dining in, the place is nothing special. The seating is typical of what you'd see at a carryout-oriented taco joint. I'm not sure if you get free chips & salsa, as I haven't tried it. One little FYI, they take credit cards but there's a sign saying they require a $10 minimum purchase. Overall, I'd say this place is muy buena!

"I don't know if I'd call it a revolutionary realization, but people like good food paired with their pints. Craft beer brewed in house? Even better. And who doesn't love the quintessential neighborhood bar? Well, Revolution Brewing has all of the above elements. And even early evening on a Monday, people are flocking... not an empty table in the brewery, and only the sporadic, lone bar seat. The good news for us is that we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. I was prepared for bad acoustics as a few friends mentioned it was excessively loud. I say-- not so much at all! Our party of four was able to hold easy conversation without straining to talk or hear. We started with a few appetizers-- the bacon fat popcorn (tasty with TONS of thick bacon) and the steamed mussels. They offer two versions of the mussels: the classic style prepared with white ale, celery, shallot, and bay leaf; and the other prepared with hard cider, blue cheese, leeks and Fuji apple. Usually I'd go with v.1 as I order something similar at Hopleaf and admittedly, I get a bit skeeved out about cheese and seafood together. However, I really enjoyed their fresh take on this dish and if I was sitting closer, would've probably ate more than just a few. Boom! For my main, I ordered one of the evening's specials which was a pork belly sandwich. It was served on some type of soft multi-grain bread which I felt was an incorrect pairing. The pork belly is so rich and fatty and could have used more substantial armor. Though good, the threat of falling apart was always a possibility. Even better than the sandwich was the side I choose-- the cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes. So outrageously delicious that I could probably eat an entire wheelbarrow full of 'em. And after this meal, I could have been wheeled out in one, too! For dessert... they have a chocolate bread pudding that tempted but my beer had already filled the last of my stomach real estate. I ordered the Bottom Up Belgian Wit which was better than average but not mind-blowing. What I did covet was the Coup D'Etat (a dry and slightly spicy French-style saison). Next time, I'm all over this one. Cool, sparkling new space. Welcome to the 'hood, RBC!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After a night of drunken debauchery, it is recovery time. That means some hair of the dog and good food. The Fifty/50 delivers! Order a Bloody Mary with a huge piece of thick cut bacon, olives and celery in it, served in a glass rimmed in spices. Or, enjoy Mimosas, brought as a carafe of OJ and a bottle of bubbly in a wine bucket to your table. Follow that up with their thick-cut, maple soaked bacon. And it is maple-soaked. So if you don't like your bacon served slathered in a pool of maple syrup, then it may not be for you. Sugar is my hangover cure, though, so I love the stuff. The fried Wisconsin cheese curds are awesome. As are the nachos, served with guacamole, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, sour cream and an cheese bechamel. I like to add the skirt steak. Best nachos on Division. Hubby likes mac and cheese as his hangover cure, and they do it right here. You have your choice of what they will add to it. Hubby always gets his with chicken and bacon. The wings here are awesome, too. If you want to catch a Bulls game, this is the place to do it. The walls are covered in TVs. And, there have a great outdoor seating area. They have patio heaters blaring to ward of the spring chill, but it's in the summer that this patio really rocks. Service here is always fast and friendly.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Fair warning: you can't get it to go because of the soup component.I noticed someone wrote that the sandwiches aren't large... Uh, I'm not sure how much that guy needs to eat. The Ahoghada is WAY a lot of food.

I got jabbed in the ribs for moaning.The only problem here is that the tortas (okay these are really kinda like fancy, delicious versions of a toasted sub) are a bit pricey for what you get -- but there is the fact that you get free filtered sparkling water from a tap! How rad is that... I fucking love that shit!! I had the torta with suckling pig. Of course it was good, but was it $12 good... i guess relative to what/whom is the question. The habanero sauce it came with was addictive in it's mouth numbing properties, but it totally outmatched the sandwich and that fact surprised me since it's from flavor perfectionist Bayless.I'll be back for sure.

If there was one crumb on the table someone would come and clear it away. It's nice to have an attentive waitstaff but this was seriously obnoxious. If I was not actively chewing on something a busser would come over and ask if he could take my plate even if I had only gotten my food ten minutes earlier. At one point in time 3 different people came to the table within two minutes to try to take away my plate! Two asked me if they could clear my plate and the third person just took it when I was not done! It was hard to have a conversation with the people I came to the restaurant with because we were constantly interrupted. We were not taking a long time to eat.

"I travel extensively for work, and have had dinner at most of the better restaurants in Chicago. Shaw's has been on my to do list for a while, and my business partner and I finalyl made it there this week. I could not have been more underwhelmed. A restaurant can not hang its hat simply on having a particular product. King crab legs are good, but they are good if I go get them at a high end grocery store and cook them myself. The price-point on the crab-legs was simply insane...and I have had a lot of $200-$300 per person dinners in my life. At the end of the day though, it's their place and they can price how they want.The crab cake that they served me (and charged $30 for) was one of the worst crab cakes I've had. It's a $5-10 crab cake at best. Lump crabmeat? Not a single piece. I'm from DC, and grew up on good crab cakes, and this thing was a mess of shredded meat and too much filling.

"SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A STIFF DRINK THE HIDDEN DOOR Only steps away from a 7-11, a bank, and an Asian massage parlor stands a sign-less facade with a door handle and a yellow light bulb overhead. At first glance it's a bit gimmicky - manufactured exclusiveness. On second thought, it's pure genius. For this entrance is more than a door. It's a rabbit hole, the symbolic beginning of the Violet Hour experience, a portal meant to transport you away from the trains overhead and the text walkers below, a proscenium that separates two worlds...one where everything from cocktails to conversations are devoured quickly in Big Gulps and tweets...the other where time slows down, where the music is soft enough for people to talk and more importantly to LISTEN. Which is the stage and which is the audience? Which world is real and which is the farce? The calm within or the chaos outside? All things best pondered over... COCKTAILS A no cosmopolitan rule; I'm already in love. I had a fight with a bottle of Tanqueray nine years ago, and I figured if I was going to give gin another chance this was the place to do it. I go with the Indian Summer, a mix of Plymouth Gin, lime, lavender syrup, and house-made tonic. First sip... Hello hello... light bulbs flash, my eyes open wide...I pause. This is delicious. My first reflex is to drain my glass dry, but I stop. I pause. I savor. I reflect. I smile. And I notice my friends are doing the same. I end the night having had a wonderful conversation with old friends, expertly prepared cocktails, respectful and unhurried service, my world expanded to the wonders of gin, and perhaps a mandate to slow down and enjoy life more. I will indeed be back and I suggest you do the same. 5 perfect, gin-soaked stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Someone has to shop, buy stuff, and work in Banking and what have you to purchase art, music, etc., so, this is all I am going to say. So why go in? Well, a friend of mine suggested it and promised me that I would love the pizza, and love the beer, and have a good time, so I went on a packed pre-Thanksgiving Monday night and realized that the crowd was a true mix of what Wicker Park is now rather than what it was in say 1993 (I lived here then and remember it). So, it truly is a neighborhood spot - serving the whole neighborhood. The corporate Big 10 graduate set as well as the (also probably Big 10 graduate) hipster, artist, writer, and what have you set. The beer: great stuff. We sampled the ""camel toe"" which packed a 9% punch and was a great beer (not just for the kick it packed). The other beers were well prepared. They do beer well here - very well. The pizza: We went for a white pizza with spinach and goat cheese. It was freaking amazing. We asked for it ""well done"" which they did, and in fact the kitchen guy brought out the pizza to ask us if it was the way we wanted it. How freaking cool is that? The verdict: Super place! While I am also a graduate of, gasp, two Big 10 schools, I must say that I have been guilty of judging a book by its cover. Sure, there is a frat boy and sorority girl sweetheart clientele here, but it is a nice crowd and the servers are professional, nice, have lots of body ink, and serve some amazing pizza and beer. They have a Sunday night special too - large pizza and a growler full of beer for, I think, $20 --- take out only. I think I will finally break down and get myself a North Face jacket or dust off the blue blaser if there is some special deal for pizza here if I wear one-- is there? Seriously, is there? :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We headed into this restaurant on the 4th, and it was relatively empty. I have gotten use to San Francisco service, which is better than any city I have ever been, but I will say this restaurant had excellent service. The wine list was reasonably priced and the meal was great. I had the flounder special. My one complaint is the fish was a little underdone. I would have liked it to be cooked a little bit more. The flavors were spot on though. My husband had the shrimp grits were great. All and all this place was great.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I tried to snap pics of the food, but it looked so good that my fork wold get to it faster than this old I-phone - And that was pretty much the theme of the night. 20 minutes earlier, when I first walked in, I instantly felt the authenticity and charm, it's as if my cab dropped me off in Greece itself. The food was not to disappoint either To be honest it was the best Greek food I've ever had! I am in Chicago on business so I am dining alone, which makes me super attentive to nothing but the food, as there is no company to enjoy! In fact as I am writing this I am secretly trying to convince myself that I should come here one more time before I leave town :). I ordered cold lima beans, Greek salad which came with a fresh block of feta on top and a delicious virgin olive oil dressing and moussaka for the main course. The moussaka melts in your mouth and it had a nice thick yet buttery layer of potatoe on the bottom. It was also served with a piece of a piece of perfectly seasoned garlic potato baked in the oven. All were extremely delicious. I'll end this by saying that the food was soo good, I ordered dessert, Yes I did! and this after cleaning out the generous portions of the items I mentioned above (by the way I was shocked by my behavior as well). I figured if the food was this good then dessert is not to be missed. I was right and finished the entire Tiramisu. Sadly however I had to walk the few cold miles back to my hotel to make up for the splurge! Totally worth it, YUM!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Somehow we got lucky and a nice couple gave us there table as they were leaving at 6:30 on a Saturday night-and the place was packed. Otherwise we might have just turned around and found someplace that wasn't swarming with people- Beers were awesome- I'm not a huge beer gal but I loved the lef blonde and the triple carmelite(sp?) Both were quite tasty...and strong too! The mussels were delicious as were the frites-I'm a sucker for dipping frys in any kind of ""aoili""(basically anykind of mayo with garlic and you can call it that:) And OH yeah! The escargot was phenomonal! Buttery salty garlicky goodness! CB and J with mac n cheese? Quite a bit overated, it's a SANDWICH people- get over it! Boyfriends monkfish was really good though...

"I wanted to try Fondue for years now... so when groupon put on a deal for Geja's, I quickly bought it. Before booking my reservation, spent hours looking at the menu and reading the other reviews ...just so I can understand how everything works.The place is romantic, really cool spot, guitar playing....perfect atmosphere! You can read all other reviews for more details!Our server Leah was really cool and helpful!Me and my date we ordered the Seafood platter and the cheese and chocolate fondue...+ a bottle of wine.We received 2 small salads with just greens and Italian dressing (seems like the greens were sitting outside for a long time)Next we received the cheese fondue; the melted cheese was really tasty! With it we got a basket of apples, grapes, and small pieces of bread to dip into the cheese. These items were disappointing; I expected a lot better.Next we got the seafood platter which consist of 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 SMALL pieces of lobster and 2 SMALL pieces of scallops plus 8 sauces and veggies to cook! The quantity was very disappointing!Next we got the chocolate fondue which was the highlight of the night! We got marshmallows and various fruits to dip and small pieces of sweet bread!My bill was;1 seafood 51.95$1 chz & choc fondue 22.95$1 bottle of wine 26$Total including tax 111.75$My complains are the following; paying 51.95$ for 6 pieces of fish is unacceptable! Also the fruits used for the fondues tasted weird! It felt like there were shopped up hours/days ago and put in a container with salty water.. I'm guessing for not to get black and present them to the costumers as fresh...? hmm... now I know... the fruits are NOT fresh!Overall it was just ok! cool place to go once every other year....but not worth the money you spend... that's why if I ever come back I will make sure to have a coupon again!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The menu of variously prepared sausages was entertaining and alluring. I ended up ordering two gourmet dogs (Foi Gras and Alligator). Although they were tasty I expected better buns. Am i wrong but their buns were straight out of Jewel's. I think the gourmet dogs at Chicago's Dog House are just as good (maybe better).

"Oh Tank, how you've changed after being on Check Please. I'm happy that you've become successful. However, I'm very disappointed that you've raised your prices, decreased your portions and no longer serve flavorful, AUTHENTIC Vietnamese dishes. Upon our last visit, we were surprised by the new, hip square plates and the newly revised menus. You've lost a lot of your Vietnamese regulars, but as long as you can get Vietnamese food newbies through your doors who wouldn't be able to tell the difference between pho broth that had been simmering for hours and broth made with boullion cubes, then more power to you. It doesn't bother us that you've compromised on your dishes to accomodate the Western palate, as we have so many other choices up and down Argyle and along Broadway. It's OK, we'll forgive you. In the meantime, you keep serving up your sub-par Vietnamese food so that as we walk past your window after a great meal at Le's Pho, we'll just entertain ourselves with the sight of all those poor souls you've managed to sucker into trying your lackluster food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A Chicago-must. It takes a few minutes for your eyes to adjust down here as the romantic candles and fondue burners are the only thing lighting the basement-like restaurant. With the Melting Pot as it's only major fondue competition in the city, Geja's offers a considerably more unique experience for special occasions.For those unsavvy about fondue dining- Geja's starts each meal with a small salad, and then has three different types of fondue- cheese (with apples and bread to dip) to start, oil for the main course, and chocolate for dessert. Though Melting Pot offers a few more variables (particularly with the dessert options) you still cant go wrong with Geja's, it's less expensive without a drop in quality, and an infinitely better dining experience.Factor in more time (3 or more hours) for a meal that involves the patron in the cooking process. (Apparently, some people don't like the idea of having to cook your own food.) I think it's fun- part of the experience.Geja's has top-notch service, an extensive wine list, and usually a live guitarist playing (non-obtrusively) in the background. Look for nightly specials and local coupons that help bring down the cost, which for what you're getting, is still fairly reasonable.Make it a point to try Geja's if you haven't already. It's on a very short list of my favorite restaurants in the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was here Friday with a friend because of GE's reputation as a quality place at a reasonable price. I'd have to say it didn't exceed or underperform my expectations, but met them. The music was louder than I expected. I know GE billed itself as fine dining but without the haughtiness, but I thought the music was a bit too loud as I felt I needed to speak loudly so my table partner could hear me. However, I did enjoy the atmosphere and the lack of tablecloth was nice for such a place. The waiter tried to sell me way too hard on buying their specialty drinks, as I must have turned him down 3 or 4 times. Sometimes a man just wants a Coke, mmkay? Popcorn was brought out before the entree and I found it to be quite good. The popcorn flavor rotates and we were given the ranch style. Can't speak to the other styles of course. For the entree, I ordered the salmon which was presented very impressively on the plate. I would highly recommend the dish. I normally hate beets, but I even enjoyed these as they had just the right amount of flavor and taste to compliment the other food on the plate. Everything was paired intelligently.I had the Molten Chocolate cake for desert which was even better than the entree. Caramel was added to the side as well as a small ""glass"" filled with a milk shake. Better experienced firsthand than described. Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Graham Elliott but did not come away wowed or disappointed. If you're looking to find a quality establishment at a reasonable price, than GE is definitely for you. If price is not an issue, then the more expensive staples (such as Alinea or Moto) are a better option.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I see some complaints about the atmosphere and busyness as I scroll down, and having only been there once, I won't try to refute it all, but when I went it was sunday night after lollapalooza and the wait wasn't bad at all, especially considering there was another bar/burger joint that we couldn't get into at all.

"Yummy, yummy in my tummy! This place was so good! Not to mention they have the most delicious, crisp Sauvignon Blanc I have tasted to date. I love my white wine! I felt like I was in cape cod while sitting in the dining room, it doesnt really resemble a BBQ joint, but no complaints here I liked the decor. For the food, we started off with the hush puppies, obviously, and they were so stinkin good. I usually dont like hush puppies, but then again, I've never had them with Jalapenos and Cheddar and that delicious dipping sauce. I ate 2.5 of those puppies! Seriously good. For my main, I had the Smoked Salmon and beet salad. The salad was soo fresh tasting. They diced it up for you, so that was nice, and the beets were sliced very thinly. They had the nerve to ask if the maple dressing would be ok, are you kidding, of course it will be! I also tried, the pulled brisket and that was seriously out of this world...especially with that spicy BBQ dipping sauce. The pulled pork just might have pulled ahead of the brisket as it was just cooked so perfectly! It pretty much melted in my mouth. And, we obvi, couldnt pass up the Mac 'n Cheese, I just polished it off as my lunch and it was just as cheesy, crunchy and delicious as it was last night! How could I forget about the pickles until the end of my review!? Those pickles! I had them box them up for me, I dont care how cheap it looked, I couldnt stop eating them and I knew I would want more today! Good thinking on my part! If you havent been, definitely go! I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ, but this place definitely impressed. The service was top notch as well. The patio would be fun in the summer as well!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This used to be my favorite Pizza stop in Chicago. Working in the city, I recommend this Giordano's to everyone. Until now.The pizza is still fantastic, our server was nice. Not much personality, but nice. Management is horrible and an embarrassment to any organization. A friend from England had offered to buy lunch and after dinner he presented a traveller's check to the server. All seemed fine. She returned asking for identification. He gave it to her and she returned later saying that they were unable to take the check. We asked for the manager and we asked him why he would not take it. He smeared the reverse of the check which showed it to be valid and his answer was ""We can not take it because you are not from Illinois."" That was the only reason he would not take it. We tried to verify with him that Giordano's is not tourist friendly. He walked away. If I had not offered another form of payment, I wonder what he would have done.This is the shoddiest customer service I have come across is Chicago.

"I have only ever had the pleasure of enjoying Sunday brunch here and it is so delightful that my friends and I have made it an almost weekly ritual to haul ass here after church and cross our fingers that they aren't out of anything! First thing we order: Publican mimosa is amazing - I never would have thought beer and orange juice would be so much better than a champagne mimosa! I even tried a ""beer-mosa"" at Cafe Centraal in Milwaukee for comparison and it came nowhere close to the Publican mimosa. The German beer that they pair with the orange juice is perfect. Second thing we ALWAYS order - fries w/fried eggs on top and the maple syrup braised Publican bacon. Those dishes alone make for a perfect meal but when there are at least four people fighting over every last morsel, you really should order an entree! I have tried the red-wine poached eggs, la quercia prosciutto (that is sliced fresh in house), sourdough & bearnaise - best kind of ""benedict""! The fried french toast I had once but a bit over-fried and kinda hard, but the warm apple compote and housemade maple sausage that accompanied it made the dish really stand out. My sister once ordered the ham & eggs and when the plate came we felt like the Flintstones! The hunk of ""ham steak' seriously reminded me of the ""brontosaurus burgers"" made popular in the opening credits of the show (that caused the car to tip over in the drive-thru). Last but not least - if you are lucky enough to get there before they run out, the cashew sticky buns are TO DIE FOR!

"This is a super overdue review. That sentence is both assonant and truthful. I had been hoping to go back to Demera to confirm my initial impression from several months ago before reviewing but haven't gotten back. Life gets in the way of delicious foodstuffs sometimes.  Anyhoo, it was the Groupon for Demera that got me back on the Ethiopian wagon after an initial trial probably fifteen years ago. I was vegetarian at the time and my family went on what my dad would call ""an urban adventure"" down to Addis Abeba in Wrigleyville. For whatever reason, Ethiopian did not make a hugely positive impression on me. Fast forward to cashing in this Groupon. I found the glossary on the menu to be extremely helpful. Not only in terms of the dishes, but also the description of the injera. I think it might be the only man-made superfood: gluten-free iron and protein in a spongey pancake. Sign me up. Also, our waitress was helpful and put us all at ease in this brave new world of deliciousness.  Since the Groupon was for the whole shebang, we had an appetizer, vegetarian messob, dessert and a bottle of wine. They were out of the honey wine but the red we had was an excellent complement to the food. Our appetizer was the sambussa sampler, and wowsers, they were good. They definitely rock the boat if you're aiming for lower-fat eating (fried dumplings will do that) but sharing a couple is worth it. Three of us shared the messob for two (choosing everything but #27, 28, 31) and had plenty. Especially me. I ate a lot.  The prices without a Groupon are manageable and it's definitely possible to fill up without the appetizer/entree/dessert combination. It's also a shade more elegant than you might expect on the corner of Lawrence and Broadway (no offense to Green Mill or the ghost of Al Capone). I hope to visit and eat a lot again soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Meh, overated, I heard great things about their french toast so I had to try it. But it was just a normal piece of thin sourdough with too little custard soaked into the bread. I also tried their signature eggs benedict and that was good, nice creamy holandaise, poached egg was a little rough around the edges but the yolk was perfectly runny. The canadian bacon was cut weird thicker on one side making for uneven salty to creamy to bread ratio in some areas. The english muffin was fresh and moist, that was a real plus. I was also disappointed when there was no mimosa or other breakfast cocktails, can't call yourself a proper brunch place. Overall I was not impressed, and definitely would not want to wait 45 min+ in order to eat here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I only left off the last star because the place could use a few more vegetarian-friendly options. However, what they do have is pretty terrific. I've been there twice already, and I knew then that I would come back many times, even if it is just to have the same thing over and over. I can safely say I've never had a tastier pretzel than the one I tried that first night at Revolution. You know it's not something that was ready-made to pop into the microwave, and the mustard was just as tangy and piquant as I like a good dipping mustard to be. Warm, soft, filling...yuuuuummmm!!! I also had the sweet potato cakes. The sauce that covers them tastes as authentic as any Indian masala sauce found in a Devon St. Indian restaurant, which was a totally on-point red curry cream sauce. The veggie chili wasn't spectacular, but it was still good and got its point across. The second visit is what really sold me on the place. This time, I chose the tempeh reuben, something that I've been wanting to try ever since I saw this one chick chomping on one the last time I was at Earwax Cafe. Holy moly! I'm going to start with the salad. You wouldn't expect a brewery to come out and give you a kick-ass salad, but they did. It was a large one, there was no iceberg lettuce in it, it was chock full of a variety of veggies, and it was just good. Good, good, goody-good, good! Now onto the sandwich. The sauerkraut was crisp and tangy with just the right amount of vinegary goodness that you want in a sauerkraut without the sogginess of the cabbage that you can usually expect. The pumpernickel bread was lightly toasted and the perfect companion to the rich flavors of the tempeh. The sandwich was so filling that I had to force myself to finish the whole thing, actually, that's not totally accurate. It was so tasty that I didn't want to stop eating it in spite of being more stuffed than a Christmas goose. I'm not even that big of a drinker these days, but I was also a fan of the drink called the ""Stray Bulliet,"" a drink made with Bulliet Bourbon, which I happen to be a fan of. It was a mixed drink that didn't sacrifice the taste of either the liquor or sweet stuff it was mixed with, which I think was a ginger and lemon simple syrup. Needless to say, this is definitely a new go-to spot for me. My stomach was immensely pleased. Staff is friendly and service is pretty good, especially considering the popularity of the establishment. Oh, and for those who'd say it's not revolutionary, take the time to read about who's behind the place, what their philosophy is, and how local so much of what we consume there is. They are the first restaurant that I've seen that supports one of our local distilleries, Koval, in addition to the local microbreweries in the area (Goose Island is a no-brainer) in addition to their own beer. Good food by good people who care about what we eat. They're getting more of my money, guilt-free.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Though somebody could have cleared the plates off our table faster. We almost got full on the bread before our orders actually came so service was a little slow.Food:I had a little of everything.

"This place has real mexican food. The tacos are not ""white boy"" tacos as some places have. They make the tacos with meat, onions, and cilantro. I've never gotten past the tacos cause I always crave them. So I have yet to try anything else. However, I've been told that this is the only one of the three that has the black salsa, which I LOVE. So, if you like that salsa don't try the other ones, cause you can't get it there.  Also, if you eat in there is a waitress that will take your order. She'll also bring chips and salsa (and by request pico de gallo). There is a small private lot that is north of the first Pasadita that customers can park in.

"I really want to give 4 stars for the ambiance of this place alone, but taking in account the food I'd have to say its just ok. I had the flat iron steak with potatoes. When my dish came I wondered where the veggies were but remembered that the choice was either potatoes or veggies. So i cant get my bit of ""healthy"" on without paying extra for veggies or a potato?Huh?! Where do they do this?! At Grand Lux! At apple bees (which is what my meal reminded me of) you can get potatoes and veggies in a meal. You dont have to choose either/or. Why not here at such a nice place? My husband had BBQ chicken which was good but it really tasted no diff than what he does on the grill at home. On another note: I was celebrating my bday in Chicago this weekend so my husband snuck and told them. Heads up: if you let the staff know it's someone's bday in your group they will bring a VERY thin toffee tasting thingy (which was good) that flakes and cracks up in your hand. It's a mess! Then there's two small decorative icing swirly things on the plate with a candle in one. I was so confused on what to do with it that we had to ask the waiter ""what do you do with this?"" She had to guess. I'm used to a special (full) dessert or a mini cake for bdays at restaurants... This was very different. Unsatisfying to say the least. I won't count this place out completely for now. I'll try something else when I decide to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"On a whim, I made a food field trip to Chicago, and I knew that I had to see what the buzz was all about regarding this restaurant. With my reservation set for a month in advance, I eagerly anticipated the discoveries of a lifetime on my dinner plate. Now that I've been through the tour at Alinea, I can truly say that food is more than just nourishment. It's a way of life that evokes feeling and emotion; to be more specific, true happiness! The experience began as I walked thru the large unmarked wood doors. A long hallway awaited me and mysteriously directed me to the sliding doors of the restaurant. The decor was sleek and very clean. I was greeted by the host and brought up the stairs to a nice corner table where the food experience of a lifetime was to occur. 26 courses and 4 hours later, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Some favorites of mine included a cauliflower puree dish, pumpkin and gruyere cheese custard served a bed of smoke, trout roe with tropical flavors, and a wagyu beef and mushroom dish with a maple infused sherry vinegar. I could go on and on with the food, but to conclude, dinner at Alinea is the experience of a lifetime!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We were trying to find the best deep dish pizza in chicago to compare to Giordano's which we had been to before - Everyone said Gino's East. We went early because we heard about the lines - but walked right in (No reservations taken) - staff was friendly as they seated us upstairs - quite entertaining to read the writing on the walls - which they encourage. we ordered beer as the rest of their beverage menu is obviously not attractive and of course had an appetizer while waiting for our pizza - which didn't seem that long of a wait- Since there was two of us - the waiter was very helpful to us for portion sizes. We had the famous cheese and sausage (patties instead of crumbles) and a small. The pizza had a good sauce but the crust came away from the ingredients - as you put it on your plate - which didn't send the message that it was fresh.....the crust was okay - and not chewy (if you like that kind of crust) - the sausage was good and there was mozarella underneath it all.....We each ate only one piece - didn't want to waste the calories on a second. My friend and I definitely thought we had better. Guess next time we will have to try Uno's....but right now, for deep dish, Giordano is at the top of the list. PS the calamari was good and crunchy - served with two sauces - marinara and cocktail - when we left at 7:30 - still no lines......hmmmm - sounds like people are going somewhere else?","[0.0, 1.0]"

I was fortunate enough to taste their Mango moose cake, at a birthday party, which was light, not to sweet, but flavorful. .

"For almost one year my husband and I walked by the place before stepping inside. It didn't look too enticing from the outside with the busstop right outside the door. Then we walked in and have been back about 6 times since. With all the other choices in Andersonville, that is sayng something. We've taken others there, they all agree it's pretty good stuff. Our favorite soup is the complimentary vegetable puree, which one can heat up depending on how much additional mystery paste is added. Then there are the entrees. We usually eat mid afternoon, so we usually order the savory crepes. My all time favorite is the house Icosium crepe, but the Chicago crepe is a solid runner up. Their apricot iced tea is really good, but sometimes a little weaker than others. The cucumber water is a refreshing touch and their hot drinks are usually served in these great oversized glass mugs which I just love. Decor is interesting and we usually can find a seat, all except for one Saturday around 2 pm. Prices are really reasonable, too, but the food is what we come back for. The owner is sometimes there and goes from table to table chatting, like he really wants to know his guests. You'll become a regular once you try it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My buddies P and O took me to their fave restaurant downtown, Fogo de Chao (and can you believe I've had this place bookmarked for exactly 2 years?)!

Completely agree! ""Enjoy it!"" - what I was told on my way to the bathroom. And yes, it is a nice bathroom. ""Don't worry about it; I used to work at Disney World. I've seen way worse"" - the eagled eyed waiter, picking up the fallen meat that somehow escaped P's fork midmeal ""$10 isn't bad"" - O, in reference to the cost of valet, though we easily found street parking right across the street. ""You have to ask for it, and they'll bring it out"" - O, on the rice and beans side (the others being plantains, polenta, and mashed potatoes) ""I've never seen veggies so plump!"" - me, on the fattest, juiciest, most mutant-like-in-a-good-way asparagus, tomatoes, and mushrooms from the salad bar. I also enjoyed the basil sauce served by the dressings. ""We'll have one, and start the meal all over again"" - us, upon ordering FDC's signature dessert, papaya cream, which is fresh papaya blended with vanilla ice cream and finished with creme de cassis liqueur tableside. Papaya has enzymes in it that help you digest. I say it works because I was ready to bust out of my tights right after lunch, but within an hour, I was ready to devour me some Sprinkles cupcakes. :o) ""They don't miss anything, yet they're not overbearing"" - P, on the impeccable service ""So tendeeeeerrrrr"" - me, practically speechless, as I consumed the beef ribs, my favorite meat, along with the bottom sirloin (fraldinha) Impressive salad bar, delicious caipirinhas (traditional Brazilian cocktail), excellent meats, outstanding service, and worth every penny!

"We were a bit hesitant at first to book a reservation as the reviews seemed so flip-floppy, but we did anyways and boy were we impressed. I'm happy to say that while dining at GE while on a trip to Chicago, I experienced something so wonderful, incredible, and possibly life changing, that I'm quite sure it will remain unmatched.After taking a seat at the bar, because we arrived early, we proceeded to order a bottle of wine for myself and two girlfriends. Unfortunately the wine was not chilled so we were presented with glasses of champagne whilst the bottle was readied. Our bartender was fantastic, lively and set a great mood for the rest of the night by playing certain songs just for us.Once we were seated, Jeff did everything in his power to make our meal memorable. From working with the kitchen to modify some of the menu due to a food allergy at our table, to the wine pairing, to an extra course of foie lollipops, we were well taken care of. Not to mention the other servers...there's a great team at GE.Pro-Tips: 1. Go big or go home. 15 course tasting menu and the wine pairing...it's so spot on.2.

"Gilt Bar has all the major elements that make up an epic Girl's Night Out. Beautiful space. It's dark, very urban with wide wood tables, soft leather seating, vintage decor and gorgeous and elaborate chandeliers. On a date? The dim lighting will be sure to show off only your best assets. While we were upstairs in the dining room, we did take a peek into the lower level lounge. Dark, sultry and very sexy, this is the place to break out the Loubies and mingle with pretty people. Leave your puffy coats at home. Delicious cocktails. There is never a bad time for St. Germain cocktails! Sweet and bubbly, they go down a little too fast, which just adds to the fun! They also have an expansive wine list if you're in the mood for something a little more serious. Decadent, rich and sinful food. I'm somewhat relieved it took me this long to get to Gilt Bar. The menu features rustic bistro fare, all of which is very heavily loaded with butter. With six girls at our table, I was able to try a nice sampling of the menu. High points include: + Steak Tartare. This dish comes with super buttery toast, a garlic/mayonnaise butter spread, and tart gerkins. The portion size is quite large and is topped with a runny egg. + Garlic Toast. Warning. If you are on a date or planning on getting lucky, I would advise against this dish! A loaf of rustic bread sits in a pool of roasted garlic cloves in balsamic vinegar, olive oil and I'm sure... butter. Be careful, Vampires!! + Pear Salad. To be honest, I should have gotten the pear salad and stopped there!! The huge six once-ish portion of blue cheese was intense!! With delicate greens and sweet pears, it would have been just enough. Or maybe not... + Cod. Drowning in butter. Girls on a diet... you just can't win here. Just don't try!! + Bouchot mussels with white wine, shallots, herbs. While the mussels were very good, they weren't the best I've ever had. + Chocolate Pie. I'm not really in to super chocolatey desserts, but this dessert was like sex. It actually might be better. So there you go. If you love delicious food, got in a good workout and are looking to have a great evening, Gilt Bar is a good choice. Make a reservation!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife and I received the worst service we have ever experienced at any restaurant last night at Las Tablas. I seriously thought we were on candid camera and they were just trying to see how much we would take before we walked out or threw a glass at our waiter.We went to Las Tablas because we bought the groupon. We have been 3 or 4 times before and used to love this place at the old location and enjoyed the new location previously and had no issues and always loved the food.Last night started by a short wait, which was no surprise and just fine for a friday night. We sat at the bar. We sat there for 10-15 minutes and not once did the bartender ask if my wife or I would like a drink. I stared at the guy while he walked back and forth in front of us, washing glasses, serving a few other people, and never once making eye contact with me. There was not a large crowd at the bar, and at one point we were the ONLY TWO PEOPLE at the bar and still not a word or eye contact. My wife remarked how strange it was while we were still seated at the bar.We were then seated by the hostess in less than 15 minutes, which was great. but then we waited no less than 15 minutes before our waiter showed up at our table. At that point we had had plenty of time to choose drinks, appetizers, entrees, etc. We ordered everything including a glass of cab for myself. We again wait no less than 15 minutes before our waiter shows back up with my wife's drink but informs me that they have no cab, only merlot. At that point, I should have been 2 or 3 drinks into the evening so i said that would be fine.And I want to reiterate that though this was a friday night and we were using a groupom, the restaurant was not overly crowded and by the time we got our food the restaurant started clearing out and there were several empty tables, so this service was not a result of busy, just bad.Our appetizer and food comes out with no problem. The food was good as always. Then we wait....again. I had finished my first glass of wine between the appetizer and the entree and put my empty glass on the edge of the table so someone would get a hint. My glass sat there for the next HOUR until we left the restaurant. We did not see our waiter from the time he brought my drink to 30 minutes after we had finished our meal. After finishing our meal, with no sign of our waiter, we finally asked a bus boy for a take home bag. My wife got that back in a few minutes and it sat on the table in front of her for almost 30 minutes. I though that would be evidence enough, along with our cleared plates, empty water glasses, and still empty wine glass, that we were done and more than ready to get our check and get out of there. But no, we waited and waited until I finally spotted our waiter and flagged him down. With very little spoken if anything he brought the check to us. I put in the groupon along with my credit card into the bill fold. We again waited no less than 15 minutes before the check sitting half on, half off the edge of our table, with the credit card sticking out, was finally picked back up to be charged (I had to flag this guy down again). He takes the check and comes back 10-15 minutes later with a check for the entire meal, no discount for the groupon. Of course I have to flag this $@#% down again and tell him that he did not discount for the groupon. He says ""oh, you have a groupon?"" This just about blows my mind as the groupon printout is a letter sized page that sticks out a restaurant billfold. This is when I just started laughing because halfway through the experience it was already bad, and it just continued to get worse and worse. Anyway, the guy goes back to his register brings me back a receipt showing he refunded my card, but needs my card again to charge for the meak minus the groupon. done and done. We walked in at 8pm, and didn't walk out until after 10pm. We were ready to leave at 9pm. worst experience ever. ruined my friday night. It would have ruined my weekend, but I figured writing this lengthy review/story would give me closure. obviously, I'm done with Las Tablas.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The place is HUGE, so watch out if you are looking for a more intimate dining experience - they had over 400 reservations the night we dined, so it is definitely a mini restaurant -city. The food was high-end and appropriately priced -- dinner for two with dessert and 2 drinks each was in the $140 range.

"Crisp, when translated from Koren, means yay. At least, that's how I feel after each time I have a meal here.  I was so excited when I discovered Crisp since Koreans are known in Asia for their fried chicken but it's not common knowledge in this country yet. I have my brother to thank for introducing me. I started going to Crisp when it first opened and the owner was still working the counter. He truly listens to his customers because I asked him why he wasn't carrying Milkies (which happens to be one of my favourite Korean beverages). Soon after, it appeared in their beverage coolers. The others who have since joined the Crisp team are stellar and I've enjoyed getting to know them as well.I have taken a tour around their menu and I cannot get past the Seoul Sassy wings and the Buddha bowl aka bi bim bop. Every time I introduce a new friend to Crisp, they are delighted. One of my best friends from NYC came to visit me soon after I had moved here from the City and I brought him to Crisp. He said that he had tried a sauce similar when he was in Miami and has been searching for that same type of taste ever since. It was here in Chicago when he was able to do so again. This friend happens to be someone I have had hundreds of meals with and never a bad one; his high praise echoed my sentiments. I cannot say enough how much I love Crisp. Try this place.

Upon entering the restaurant we were approached in a way that was rather uncomfortable, however they thought the remark made was complimenting, but it wasn't. The server was not pleased with my pleasant rebuttal, so she continued to ignore me through out my entire time there. The cappuccino served was horrible, and the remake was even worse.

"My wife and I have been regulars for weekend dinners at the India House restaurant in Downtown Chicago over the last several months, but Saturday night (1/23) we had the best experience so far in terms of Ambience and Service. We have had the opportunity to visit India a couple of times and learn the Indian Culture, and last night at India House, it brought back memories as we felt we were being welcomed back to India by a very Elegant Young Lady in Traditional Indian clothes, who was very professional and seated us at the best table available, as the place was super busy like every night. My wife and I were very impressed by her hospitality, and her warm personality. The Food has always been excellent at India House, with the wide variety of choices they have - Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Gosht, Palak Paneer and many more. The Naans (Garlic Naan, Regular Naan) and the Tandoori Chicken are to die for. Like the New Budlight Commercial goes - Not too Light, Not too Heavy, I would summarize the India House Food as - Not too Spicy, Not too Greasy, - Just Perfect I never miss an opportunity to go here for the Lunch Buffet too, as this is the best Indian Buffet I have ever had.

"I still contend that this is a poor man's Burt's, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially since I am a pizza snob. The key differences between this location and the Morton Grove original are that the inside has been renovated in the last 20 years, the location is in a pretty happening part of town, and it is not located on block from Burt, who is the non Malnati godfather of Chicago Pizza. A combination of these three factors makes this location much more crowded than the original, and the burnt crust great pizza might have something to do with it as well.  It was Friday night and we had a party of 6, so it took about 40 mins to get a table, which is fine, since it gets super crowded. I think they do reservations but require a credit card or something, which makes sense. Dinner is always interesting eating with some people you don't know too well, especially when a couple of them want to order for the whole table. I was fine with it since my dietary needs were taken care of, but when one of them tried to order thin crust, we had to quietly explain what city we were in and things got back to normal. An added plus was one of the people does not eat crust, meaning I got double the burnt goodness!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Had an amazing dinner here last night. Have always been a fan of Rick Bayless and glad I was finally able to eat at one of his restaurants. I had the suckling pig torta, guacamole and a churro topped off with a nice Goose Island Matilda. The pork in the torta was amazing. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. I can easily say that it was not only the best torta I've ever had, but it may have been some of the best tasting pork I have ever eaten. The habenero salsa that came with it was fiery and delicous.The guacamole had great flavor and was seasoned perfectly. A lot of times I find guac to be bland, but not here. Very flavorful and delicous. The service was great and the people working there were very knowledgeable about the food and friendly. We waited about 25 min for a table on a wed night at about 8PM.

"I was so excited on my recent trip to Chicago to try a famous stuffed pizza. Giordano's didn't disappoint! The pizza is very different than what you may be used to. It is more like a pie than a pizza. We were told the wait would be 45 minutes......but, we could pre-order our pizza so it would be ready when we were seated.  We had cocktails and an appetizer of fried calamari (really good!) while we waited for a seat.   The pizza is very different than what you may be used to. It is more like a pie than a pizza. We got one with peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni. The cheese was really good and really plentiful. Be careful not to order too much,as the pies are really filling.   I would have given 4 stars, if it weren't for the service. Our server wasn't rude, but he was hardly friendly. The cashier where we pre-ordered wasn't any better. A place that is surely brimming with tourists need to be friendlier and more inviting. There are a hundred different pizza places in Chicago. Step up the service guys!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm not in the restaurant industry. I've never worked in a kitchen, never waited tables. I have no idea what it takes to work a lunch or dinner service. However, I do love to eat out, lots of different types of places, and I understand that fine dining can get pricey, and plates tend to be on the smaller end. As Americans we're so accustomed to seeing big heaping servings of slop on our plate, when we're presented with something creative, beautiful and artisic, we can't appreciate it for what it is.  Until I spent a day in Chef's Bowles kitchen, I didn't understand how much goes into each and every plate on his menu. It's not just white fish, or pork, or spongecake. These plates have five, maybe six components that are all prepared separately and have all the chefs and line cooks working from 10 am in the morning til closing. These men and women come in everyday and prepare several sauces, foams, reductions, sabayons... the list goes on and on. And, even with such a busy place, each dish that comes out of the kitchen is beautiful, delicious and consistent. It's not just remarkable, it's frankly, misunderstood by people like me, until I saw it for myself. And then I see why these menu items are priced the way they are. Anyone who feels like they didn't get their money's worth should spend an hour or 2 in the kitchen with these incredibly talented chefs. You'll end up wanting to pay a bit more for your food, just in sincere apprecaition for what these people do day in, day out.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I got the Icocium Crepe because it had a ton of things in it that I like: roasted peppers, fresh basil, goat cheese, caramelized onion, fresh roma tomatoes, pine nuts, roasted garlic and baby spinach. Good!  Service was just okay - but we were a large group, to be fair. Also - BYOB!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"the steaks are great but i'm giving this place two stars because of the lack of service. went a few weeks ago and boy are the bartenders S L O W. slow as molasses and don't listen very well. first it took them a half an hour to get to me while i was standing directly front and center of the bar. he had some guy's margaritas just sitting and getting watered down before actually pouring them. then another guy asks to keep his tab open, but then closes it. and an elderly couple was still waiting for their wine. it had been a very long time since i was there last, actually, when they first opened across the street from the current one  i recall their empanadas to be the best i had ever eaten but was disappointed to find they had completely changed them. oh well. i'll give it another go sometime just for that steak i had. but overall, meh.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I must say I was highly disappointed by this restaurant. After looking at the menu, I expectd a lot from my first experience there. The atmosphere, however, was not conducive for a pleasant dining atmosphere. It was extremely dark, so dark in fact that I could barely see the steps on the stairs and had to use my cell phone to read the menu. Furthermore, the place was noisy as heck like the New York Stock Exchange with less intelligent people. The woman was laughing hysterically and stomping on the floor at some lame joke. I attribute that perhaps to her drunkeness? Let's hope.The food was also disappointing. It was more vietnamese than French and I've eaten better food at a noodle shop in Chinatown. Everything was mediocre. My entre, the salmon with vermicelli was filled with too much lettuce and fillers without much actual noodles. The deserts were also mediocre. I've tasted better things at the local bakery. All in all, I wouldn't go back here. It was too overpriced and I believe only people who haven't experienced good vietnamese food would like this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Decided to go here after there were no seats available at Soupbox. And so there was Crisp, right across the street. From the good reviews I've read on yelp and from watching them on Metromix, I thought that it would be a good idea to try it out....and what a great idea that was. I ordered the Chi-town Chicken burrito while my bf ordered the Seoul Sensation burrito, which came with marinated bulgogi. Both were delicious, especially with the spicy sauce. They have some interesting dishes here and although I have not tried the fried chicken, it looked really good. Crisp does offer an interesting twist on Korean food, and I would love to come back again and try the other dishes.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was walking north on Michigan Ave. and feeling pretty peckish after a meeting last Sunday so I decided to settle for dinner at Bennigan's. Nothing against Bennigan's but it's generally not the first (or second or 30th) place that comes to mind when I think of fun and interesting places to eat. In other words, I was hungry and I was willing to settle for ""just okay"" food. I knew there was a Bennigan's nearby but I couldn't remember exactly where so out came the Google map app. on my phone. I searched ""Bennigan's"" and saw that I'd actually have to backtrack four blocks to get there. Forget THAT.  I passed Subway. Not in the mood. I passed some Chinese place. Meh. I passed Starbuck's. Bleah. And then I saw The Purple Pig. Here's the internal dialogue that took place in my mind: Me: Hm. Purple Pig? Me2: Meh. I *could* go there but it's probably ridiculously pretentious. Keep moving. Me: I'm really hungry. Oh! And other yelpers say it's a great place. I really should try it. Me2: *shrug* I guess. meh. So I walked in, saw that it was very busy and got a sinking feeling. I did NOT want to sit and wait an hour before I was served. I was immediately greeted by a host who informed me that they could find me a seat right away if I was comfortable trying out one of the ""communal"" tables. Now, I realise this won't be everyone's cup of tea but, after getting over the initial awkwardness of sitting next to people who aren't there to spend time with you, communal tables can actually be kind of cool. So I said ""sure!"" and was seated immediately. When I looked at the menu, my first reaction was, ""What was I thinking? Why did I come here? I'm in no mood for wine right now and I don't even like pork. This was a REALLY stupid idea."" I waffled for a while and seriously considered leaving. Everything on the menu has pork and/or (mostly ""and"") some sort of cheese. Their tag line is ""Cheese, Swine and Wine,"" so shame on me for not taking it literally. Here's the thing, though. I DIDN'T leave and, once my server, Katie The Rock Star showed up, everything got all better. Her name isn't Katie The Rock Star. At least, I don't think it is. But she was amazing so I've dubbed her accordingly. Anyway, after Katie The Rock Star explained the menu basics to me, I settled on the fried chorizo stuffed olives and the whipped feta with cucumbers.  I expected to wait a while for my food - the place was PACKED - but within moments, I had my stuffed olives.  At the risk of sounding like a walking foodie cliche, I have two words to describe my first dish: Flavour Explosion. Every bite was a ""wow"" moment. No kidding. It's not a huge dish but there's so much flavour, you don't *need* it to be huge. Just as I was finishing my olives, the whipped feta and cucumbers arrived with a plate of toasted bread. Holy shit, that feta was good. I'm kind of glad I was dining alone because, frankly, talking would have ruined the moment. I just wanted to close my eyes and enjoy the flavours. So I did. Amazing. After I'd finished savouring my foodgasm (yes, I said it. foodgasm), I started the people watching. It's a little tricky to do this without looking like some sort of freak when you're actually sharing a table with the strangers you're observing. However, the opportunity for a little conversation presented itself in a way that can really only happen when dining at a communal table. The party of three to my right were discussing European chocolate versus American chocolate. The female in the group gave me a subtle look when one of the men mentioned how much he loved a specific east coast chocolatier. It was subtle but it was enough of an invitation so, giving a sidelong glance of my own, I murmured just loudly enough, ""I really only enjoy European chocolate. Especially Belgian,"" and suddenly, I was a part of the conversation. Then, the couple to my left shyly asked me if I would please be willing to take their picture on their monstrously large freak-of-digital-nature camera. I happily obliged, though it took me three tries to get it right. See what I mean? Really, only communal dining can give you experiences like that. I get it. It's not for everyone. But I happen to love those little moments so it was a perfect dining experience for me. After the conversations wound down, Katie TRS returned to see how I felt about dessert. Oftentimes I'll take a pass on the dolci but I was in the mood so I chose a strawberry soft-serve ice cream in a brioche drizzled with balsamic. mmmmm.... delicious. And not so heavy that I thought I'd go into a food coma. It was the perfect ending to a lovely meal.

"While Gino's East is not MY favorite for Chicago deep dish, it is very good and is my boyfriend's favorite :) We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated at 7:30 PM on a Friday night.

Knew we would be waiting awhile for our Deep Dish but you can easily distract yourself by writing on the walls ;) The sauce is a sweeter sauce than most pizzas I have had.

"My husband and I went here for our wedding weekend. Very cute layout, but I don't like the fact that everyone needs to arrive at the same time...5PM. That's a little early for dinner. Food wise, not bad. But when they have the bread and fruit appetizer as the starter, they don't give you an option for anything but a swiss based cheese...which tasted like it was mixed with wine. Not very flavorable. Main course, they use an oil base rather than water (some people don't care, but just something you may want to know when you're soaking all your veggies and meats in oil!). The only reason I didn't give this place a higher rating is because they do not give you options for cheese or chocolate and all that. I'm still happier with Melting Pot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Food = 5 stars; Service = ""meh"" Ever since I was introduced to Agedashi Tofu, I can't help but order it everywhere I go now. And I must say, this is, hands down, the best one I've had so far. Outer thin layer of light and crisp golden flakes of bliss embracing the tofu and dipped in just the right amount of sauce? STOP IT. I couldn't help myself with that one. I almost forgot to share it with my date-for-the-evening. 1 for you...5 for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the New York City Maki as well like how Sound of Music's Maria enjoys ""raindrops on roses."" Like no joke. It was the combination of 3 of my favorite things: eel, avocado...and that's right, cream cheese. I liked the options between Maki, City Maki and their Special Makis. Tried the Shrimp Tempura as well but wasn't much of a fan... it was kind of bland for my taste. I shall return! Literally. Cheers to the freakin' weekend, I'll cheers to INDIE. P.S.

"Listen, I know everyone loves this place. I feel ok about it.  In order to see the menu, you have to more or less walk up to the counter. But when you walk up to the counter, the cashier gets all antsy like there is a pizza-pocalypse and you are going to ruin everything if you don't order now. This happens if there's no line behind you too.  So, despite the lack of people at the weird time we went, the pizza was going to take 40 minutes. Which is fine. I want you to take your time making me some kick-butt deep dish pizza. But when we each got a slice to hold us over before the pizza came? Not that impressive. I couldn't get the hype. And if your pizza's good, shouldn't it be good even if it wasn't cooked right that second?","[0.0, 1.0]"

I only had their dessert so I'll just give you the run-down of desserts: Strawberry shortcake: so good~ oh so good. Fresh strawberries (not the overdone marinated in syrup too long strawberries) in each bite. There aren't many places in Chicago where they serve strawberry shortcake- cuz I had a bad craving for months and I looked around! Chocolate Eclaire: rich custard filling... yummm I wanted to taste more of the puff pastry but I got more custard... it's okay the custard was really good. Tiramisu: perfectly rounded dusted with cocoa powder. Only downfall was that it wasn't very moist and I could not taste the rum-ness. But it was good nonetheless. The service was good. Some of their patrons however are annoying! They will bump into you and be loud then yell out loud about how loud they are. So brace yourselves and try to sit near the front if you're looking for more romantic atmosphere.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"*LOVE* My husband and I thought that heading over to Longman and Eagle at 6PM on a *Monday* would surely get us a table for 4. We got there, asked the maitre d' how long the wait would be, and she responded, ""just about 2.5 hours"". Unfortunately, because we had guests in town, we decided that it'd make most sense to find another place to dine. For the 30 seconds that I was there, I glanced at the dishes and the bumbling crowds and knew I had to go back. The following evening, we learned our lesson from the night before and left our home at 4:30PM to get there before the dinner rush. We found parking right away and got right to a table immediately - the last open table, in fact. Each plate we ordered was absolutely delicious - one of our highlights was the Roasted Marrow Bones. We literally discussed ordering them as if we were going to go sky diving. SO happy that we 'took the leap' - it was absolutely delicious. Together, my husband and I also ordered the Meatballs & Creamy Polenta, House Marinated Olives, Roasted Chicken and the Pork Belly. The service was also amazing. Highly recommended!

"I went here for Sunday brunch. Our friends really built it up as an amazing brunch experience, so I had lofty expectations going in. I had no idea what the restaurant was about and I wanted to keep it that way. Once I walked in and saw the giant pig-themed decor, I knew I was in for something special. The menu was small but intriguing. There were few interesting drink options. I went with the Publican ""Mimosa"", which uses a beer rather than champagne. It was a really nice change of pace and a great way to start off brunch. I ordered the sausage dish with a side of the honey-glazed bacon. I expected a giant portion, but was pleased to see that it was much more reasonable than expected. My biggest gripe about the experience would center around the service. Sitting at the cafeteria style communal table, we felt we were largely ignored by our waitress that focused more on the ""pen"" booths. We had to constantly flag her down to get some service and we also had issues when it was time for the bill. However, the coffee replenishing was top notch. Overall, the food was tasty and different enough from the standard brunch fare to warrant a visit. It's not TOO overpriced and the ambiance provides a unique experience.

This way you can try a bunch of different things. Usually my husband and I do eight little dishes and get to try a bunch of different things. Their lamb is amazing and I wish I could remember the name of the particular dish. But really most everything is very flavorful and yummy. And their Ethiopian coffee is beyond amazing. They bring out your own little clay pot and everything. My husband loves it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The salad bar itself could be an entire meal with the delicious shrimp salad and outstanding lobster bisque soup, s in addition to the wide array of cheeses. When the meat starts coming around, it is overwhelming. There were so many choices, I didn't know where to start. My favorite was the picanha, a traditional Brazilian meat. I also loved the filet wrapped in bacon. The service was outstanding. As soon as I flipped my card to green, more food started coming.

We sat near a table full of loud and annoying drunks, but it was late...and it's a bar, so I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. The service was adequate.

"This was a huge disappointment. I did not have any expectations because this a gathering to celebrate a special occasion and I was just along for the ride, but we had a party of 9 with a reservation. The place is extremely dark (what are they hiding?) and tight. They pack you in there and I seriously can't imagine they have not had any lawsuits with all the flames and oil flying around. The prices were outrageous. I find it amazing they charge $40 + for them to put the raw food in front of you so you can cook it yourself. They seem to pride themselves on the premium seafood and meat. It's too bad that it gets ruined by having to cook it in oil. And it's so damn dark that you can not see if your food is actually cooked or not! Nice effect. Beside the horrible seating (chairs look to have been taken from a bad banquet hall) and dingy setting, why overpriced food, we found the staff to be arrogant and nasty. We waited over 30 min. for half our party to be seated and they seemed to be fine with pushing us into the way too crowded bar where waitstaff seemed miffed to have to go around us. The bar - wine staff we dealt with was a real jerk to top it off. My brother dropped over $600 at this place and in the end we could have gone to so many other amazing places in Chicago at that price without having to cook our own food and come out smelling like we went to Bennihana! Couples -- this is not romantic. Save your money for Le Colonial, IL Mulino, Cafe Spaggio.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here for a birthday party on a Friday night and boy was it packed! I can't remember the last time I went out and had someone pretty much up against my back while I ate. That being said, we waited about five minutes for our reservation and then we were all seated. I also love craft beer so this was the place for me! We started out with the Red pizza which includes traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza. We also had the White pizza with plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese. For beer we had to try the Golden Arm and the Dysfunctionale. I never make it out to this area of Chicago often but I'm very glad that I was able to leave Lincoln Park behind for a little while and indulge! I will be back, hopefully sooner rather than later.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been twice. First was was a friend. The second time was with my girl friend and another couple. Everyone was pleased with the food here. My favorite is the bone marrow. Out of this world. I think I've sampled everything on the menu and I can't think of a single dish that I didn't like. Everything worked well. Savory person's (like my self) paradise. The place seemed to be more of a after work place than a weekend place. It was packed on my first visit after work on a week day. Lots and lots of hot women. I believe the girls in the table next to us were making out. My second visit was around 745 on a Saturday. It was a lot quieter, but started to pick up when we were leaving. I also noted a cool, cash only bar in the basement. Very dim lighting..I'll have to check it out next time I'm there.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So to start, how can you not like a restaurant that is open until 5am? Moving on.. if your not really sure what Korean BBQ is because you have never been before, it is exactly what the name says. It is Korean food, barbecued. Not just barbecued though, barbecued YOUR way. How is it your way? Well, when you sit down at your table, there is going to be a big empty spot in the middle of the table, and a ventilation duct over your head. As soon as you tell the waitress you want BBQ, a cart comes out with a flaming grill with charcoal bricks burning - or, if you are some place else, it could be a gas stove they have at your table. Once your food comes, you cook it yourself! You like your steak well done, then cook well done - yourself! You like it practically raw you can still give it a name - cook it (or warm it) yourself! On to the review: I have been to my fair share of Korean BBQ restaurants, and have had good experiences. However, this one is my standard go to. After a long night out, or a hard days work, a great way to treat yourself is by heading into San Soo. As with your traditional Korean restaurants, they bring you all the side dishes you could imagine. I mean, you have barely decided what you want to eat and already there are more little bowls on your table then you know what to do with. The only thing I have ever eaten here were the different varieties of BBQ meats from pork, chicken and steak. All very excellent and flavorful. The service here can vary. Sometimes they treat you like you are their best customer, other times they treat you like the red-headed step child. Either way, the food can usually make up for it. If have never tried Korean BBQ before, this would definitely be a great place to start. It would give you a pretty decent standard amongst other places. As well, if you plan on BBQing your own food, make sure you have someone with you, because you need to order at least 2 entrees to be able to BBQ at your table.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Our friend Lori LOVES Italian food - probably because she herself is part Italian and because she once lived in Italy, so I trust her instincts when it comes to taking us to Italian restaurants. I am happy to report that this one lives up to her - and our - expectations.  Pre-entree extravaganza: the bread basket was great and plentiful - and it is here that I will exclaim that this is hands down THE BEST focaccia that I have ever eaten. EVER. No tomatoes in or on it - just rosemary and perhaps some olive oil and garlic. It had a hint of sweetness to it which I had never experienced before. I am in love! Another thing I need to rave about right now is a side dish we ordered called caponata. OMG! I had no idea what this was and Lori explained that it is a Sicilian eggplant dish, a cooked vegetable salad made from chopped fried eggplant and celery seasoned with sweetened vinegar, and capers in a sweet sour sauce. This dish also had raisins in it and, while usually served cold, this version was served warm. TO DIE FOR! My friend ordered the insalata caprese which she loved. My partner devoured her insalata barbabietole comprised of local beets, shaved fennel, Imported buffalo ricotta, greens & citrus oil. I ordered the fried calamari served in a paper artichoke - perfectly prepared. Entrees: quattro formaggi ravioli (""Ravioli di ""Piccolo Sogno""); 2 orders of spaghetti nero ""frutti di mare"" (string cut black spaghetti, mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari with San Marzano tomatoes, green chilies); I ordered my favorite autumnal pasta - the exquisite cappellacci di zucca (spiced local pumpkin stuffed ravioli, brown butter, sage, walnuts), the leftovers of which I am looking forward to polishing off today for lunch. Oh joy! Desserts: I am a huge dessert fan but Italian desserts don't do a thing for me and nothing peaked my interest on their menu so I simply ordered the gelato which was very good (3 small scoops of choc chip, white choc, pistachio). My friends ordered the saffron panna cotta with caramel sauce and berries and pronounced it wonderful. Perfect cappuccinos. Ambiance: hip and happening environment with a beautiful antipasto table that screamed ""EAT ME."" The place was packed and thus really, really loud. Thank god we were in a side room in a corner with only a few other tables around us so we could attempt to hear each other. Service: good, although our nice waiter was swamped and didn't come to check on us with enough frequency. At least he had a number of busguy/table assts who checked on us. I do agree with a previous Yelp reviewer who mentioned a language barrier with the bus staff. This is true - when I passed a bus guy a plate to ask for some grated cheese for my partner, he immediately disappeared with the plate before I could ask him for the cheese. We laughed our butts off about it and simply got another plate when he returned a few moments later. Can't wait to go back! The caponata is calling my name....... Also - only $6 for valet parking.

"I think the difference between 'Mediterreanean' and 'Persian' is the price. There are some differences in the cuisine but for the most part I think it's the same but Persian restaurants have higher quality ingredients. Think filet kabob instead of beef and you get the picture. Obviously, since I am a fan of it it's not too bad. Noon O Kabab has some pretty good selections, and I give it an A for effort since it does try to set itself apart from the other Mediterranean/Persian restuarants in the city and on this strip. I went with a friend of mine and split the hummus which was pretty good. A smooth consistency and a pretty tasty standout. I had the Fesenjan which is a pomegranate stew with chicken. I ordered it because it was something different....well like I said, A for effort. My friend went with a more traditional approach and got the steak and chicken kabob combination. I was much more pleased with that flavor. If it was a little on the pricey side, again you pay for the higher quality and it does show. I will probably return but get something more along the normal route.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"this is a great neighborhood place. the burgers are great, the beer selection is fantastic and constantly changing. it does get pretty busy on friday and saturday nights, but stop by during the week and you will find a great, relaxing place to hang out and enjoy good food and good beer. also, the staff is really friendly and great to hang out with. btw, they serve what is literally the best hamburger i have ever had in my entire life. i'm not exaggerating here. it's not their regular burger (although their regular burger is one of the best in chicago. get the slow burn. you won't be disappointed). rather it's a $26 dry aged prime rib something or another. it's only served on wednesdays and thursdays if they have any left over. i'm not usually one to go for fancy expensive burgers, but this one is worth every penny. i definitely won't hesitate to order it again. there really is no way to explain it other than to say it is burger perfection. other than the burgers, the salads, appetizers and sandwiches are good too. the poutine is fantastic. the only thing i wish they did have was desert. but i guess beer counts for that. if you're not a beer drinker, they keep a selction of great wine and great spirits as well. bad apple is one of my favorite places in chicago. check it out!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"ROOF DECK IS INCREDIBLE! Yes, I do believe that statement deserved capital letters.... In my humble opinion, I think it is worth skipping the prix fixe dinner (because really, who needs to eat) and making your meal out of the delicious drinks. There are many fruity drinks on the menu. By ""fruity"" I mean that there is a juicer at the bar and they fresh squeeze orange juice into the drinks! The drinks are refreshing and expensive (seems to be a likely combination in this town). The roof deck is amazing...wood benches, green grass, a beautiful bar, ample seating, great views, the list goes on. Try Zed 451...you won't be disappointed!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I would give an A+ to the atmosphere and overall experience. The food was very good, but not good enough for the prices. I think presentation sometimes trumps flavor here. The quinotto tart with goat cheese and peanut sauce was interesting but lacked something. The ingredients were unexceptional, it seemed like something I could make at home. The potato pancake with quail egg appetizer was equally disappointing--it just tasted like mashed potatoes. And I've definitely had better churros. The highlight of the meal was actually a side of mac and cheese I ordered! It was creamy, more like fettucini alfredo, and coated with crispy breadcrumbs. Excellent sangria, too--not too sweet and with a hint of citrus. Probably the best sangria I've tasted. All in all, this place is worth a try, for certain menu items and the bright, cheery atmosphere--especially in the midst of a dreary Chicago winter. But I don't think I'd go back again, unless someone else was paying!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"BF thinks I give out too many 5-star ratings, and I think he's right, because now I wish there was a 6-star rating to give to Shaw's. I've been jonesing for a crab cake from Shaw's so we headed up on a Sunday afternoon at half-time and parked ourselves at the Oyster Bar. I just absolutely love this place, and actually prefer it to the more formal dining area (which is lovely, but a totally different experience...also 5-star). The bartender was so attentive (not to mention gorgeous), and I proceeded to slam a microbrew (I forget which one it was, but it was something I've never had before). I ordered my crabcake and BF got oysters. If a restaurant can be judged by the bread they serve (as some say) I am sticking with my ""6-star"" rating, as the bread and butter were so flipping good. My crab cake arrived and it was exactly as I remembered, and BF's oysters were apparently fresh and delicious or whatever a good oyster is (I do not partake). Then he ordered clam chowder, which I proceeded to dip bread into. OMG was it ever good! I don't particularly love clam chowder normally, but I would totally order this next time. The service was so great that it's as if the kitchen had a camera on us in preparation to bring out the next item...perfectly timed and piping hot. BF got fish tacos, also excellent. I got the blueberry and peach cobbler...which I really didn't share with the BF as I think he was afraid he would lose a hand if he tried sampling it. It was the perfect Sunday afternoon.

I live across the street and the grill smoke wafts into my window and smells delicious constantly. It's kinda funny that there are three locations. all right next to each other.

The Marty Allen (formerly the Don Rickles) beef, pork and garlic sausage ($3.25) - nothing special. pass on for next time. Duck Fries ($3.50) - The fries were all right.

I have only ever been to the melting pot, and I liked Geja's way better. The main difference is the oil. Geja's has hot oil instead of broth. Broth is for soup as fas as I am concerned and doesn't do much for the food. Also, Geja's has some great dipping sauces that take thier food to next level.

"I just realized that I've been coming here almost every week for 16 years. I don't know whether the chef is still the same, but their steak burrito is still affordable ($6), huge and very tasty as it's always been. My wife usually gets shrimp a la Veracruzana (about $12), which is great if you like them spicy.  This place has been renovated last year and has new, much better bathrooms. It's clean and has friendly staff, very fast service, and the waiters will never give you ""this is not my table"" crap, so if you ask any of them for anything you need, it will be there soon. Our favorite waitress is Astrid, very dedicated and polite, always smiling. You can often see cops eat there, which is a definite sign of tasty and affordable food.  The two hidden jewels: 1. Best flan in Chicago! It's not very cheap ($3.50 per piece), but it's real and it tastes just like my mother's used to, no instant junk, and no cheese cake. It gets that non-industrial consistency, being darker with some bubbles trapped close to the edges and on the bottom. This is real stuff, made of real eggs.2. Their frozen margarita is unsurpassed by any other I've ever tasted in Chicago, if you like them like me, which is strong and freezing cold.  My little secret is to go there during the off hours just before dinner when there's barely anybody there, because by then the margarita machine has cooled everything close to the freezing point. Only this way you can get a margarita that can cause frequent brain freezes if you're not careful, the one the sticks so you can almost eat it like an ice-cream with the straw. I don't see a reason to order any but their regular frozen margaritas with them being this good. Their house tequila (used in these) is supposedly made by the owner's brother in Mexico, so be careful, because these things are made strong and since they're so tasty, even one of them can fool you into a blissful dizziness if you consume it too quickly while your stomach is still empty. I usually drive there, so I limit myself to no more than one per visit and I sip it quite slowly.The free chips is good, but the quality varies, best being right after they fry a new batch. The home-made red salsa served with it is medium to quite spicy and very good.  Their horchata is too sweet for my and my wife's taste.Last, but not least, it's very affordable, so tip them well, because they work much harder for their money than the waiters at fancy places with less tables but much higher prices.","[1.0, 0.0]"

He didn't pick it up at first but once I pointed it out, it was all over for him.  While we were ordering our waiter, that jerk, coaxed us into a large. If you have ever been here you know the large pizzas are ridiculous. When our two-top of a pizza finally showed, it wasn't all that great, not bad, but not great.

"So, I live out in the 'burbs, but a couple times a month I try to head into the city to go out to eat with a foodie buddy of mine. This time though, we didn't even meet up til almost 10, so we knew our food choices would be limited to bars. After a short perusal of this site, we settled on Longman & Eagle - but we did not ""settle"" on quality of food. It was without a doubt the best food I've had in a hipster bar/pub ever. I think the experience would have been even better for me if my drink tastes didn't run (in the words of my friend) ""from the girly to the super girly"" since this place had a bourbon selection that made my friend swoon (85ish). The Great: What we ordered: 3 drinks, the welsh rarebit (that crispy soft pretzel was AMAZING) - bar snack, ricotta gnudi - small plate, tete du cuchon - small plate, pork shoulder - entree, and flank steak - entree. This perfectly rare specimen of steak was mine, and I cleaned my plate. Even with a morel jus (I'm not a mushroom fan) and creamed ramps (the closest I get to dark greens is spinach dip). The Good: All of the above for $125 (including tax and tip). The Less than Good: The one, singular complaint I have about the food is that my steak was a little over-salted - not to the point where it wasn't yummy, but the salt made it taste less steaky and probably not as delicious as it could have been.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My friend and I came here for brunch and we wanted outdoor seating and the wait was 20 min (this was Sunday around 11am) so it wasn't too bad. We just went across to Millenium Park and then by the time we came back, the table was ready.  I ordered the Apple Pancake Souffle and my friend got the eggs benedict. I really wanted to get the strawberry stuffed french toast but it had cream cheese and I don't like cream cheese.  The souffle was pretty disappointing. I was hoping it would taste like the dutch baby from Walker Bros but it wasn't as good.  Sad. However, it was good. My friend liked the eggs benedict and it looked good.  There were umbrellas covering the tables and there was a big gust of wind and one of the umbrellas fell and hit out table and almost my friend. It was scary. I mean don't they secure those things or what?!? So that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars. And the manager didn't even compensate us or anything. Ugh.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It's a for-sure deal whenever anyone comes into town because I know they won't be disappointed. As a Vegan, watch out for not-mentioned-on-menu fish eggs hiding in things that sound legit (like the seaweed salad), but they're always more than willing to take it off, just need to be told :)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I tried this place twice over the last three weeks. The first time, I really liked it. Our waitress was really sweet and crepes were flavorful. So, on our second visit there, we took a friend with us--wasn't impressed at all. The place was crowded and the seats were badly arranged-while the booths that sit 4 were all occupied by couples, they made us squeeze on a two top, which wasn't enjoyable. After a long wait, we got our food--though the ingredients were definitely flavorful, my crepe was cold, and the soup bowl that came with it was 1/3 empty! I also didn't like the fact that they charged $1.00 extra for the bread, and $1.50 for the olive oil to dip. Keeping the prices of the menu items reasonably affordable and then charging for those small things that should be complimentary is just not right. Our waitress was very sweet but wasn't really so helpful when it came to making up for the kitchen's mistakes, and I don't like being served by wait staff who wear sweaters with soup stains and salad dressing on them.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Italian cuisine, although delicious, normally strikes me as somewhat routine in comparison to the other great offerings in Chicago (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Lebanese, Swedish, etc.) BUT Sapori is marvelous. Not only is the food excellent, but the staff is attentive, helpful, and courteous. Anthony, the owner is lovely and warm, the epitome of the gracious host. Last night was my first (though definitely not my last) visit to Sapori and we opted for the family style servings. You can select 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 3 pastas/entrees, and 1 dessert from this menu. I loved everything I tried. The Risotto al Funghi was buttery and flavorful with delicious mushrooms. We also tried a Squash/Pumpkin dish that was seasoned perfectly. The Caprese salad - always a winner, and Brushetta for starters. Tiramisu for dessert - these three are pretty standard Italian fare and not really my cup of tea in a place other than Sapori. Bottom line: awesome dinner! Plus we have leftovers that will be enjoyed today for lunch and dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am an avid foodie and can say I have eaten at most of the cities steak houses and have yet to find a place that has it all, like Kinzie. From the minute you walk in the door until the minute you leave, you feel like you have hit all the reasons one goes out to eat. Service is exceptional, there is not a moment that you feel over attended nor unattended. The food is prepared exactly the way you like, whether it is the temperature of the steaks or asking for little to no oil in cooking your fish. The risotto is as good as you get in Italy. As for the desserts, they are to die for, especially the buttered rum cheesecake and the flour less chocolate cake. Definitely a place you want to go to time and again!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The thing I love about gastropubs, is the fact that you can dress as yourself and still get a chance to have a great selection of alcoholic beverages, delicious food, and great service. I've been hearing a lot about this place, so I was super hyped to go. The outside of the building doesn't have much for advertising, just a plain black and gray facade (which isn't very inviting). The interior was a little drab, until I started to realize the concept of what they were going for when my server, Cortland (what an adorable name and very fitting for a young Kurt Cobain look alike) approached the table in a blue, plaid, shirt and black jeans. As I looked around the room, I noticed that each server had on similar attire in their own unique way, kinda back of the woods, outdoorsy. Cortland was one of the best servers I have encountered in awhile. He was warm and incredibly knowledgeable in both food and drink. He knew every detailed description to each menu item and was able to pair it well with a suggested beverage. I ordered the Smoked Sweetbreads with piquillo peppers, olives, and fava beans and the Tete de Cochon with fried quail egg and Asian mustard-five spice sauce. My friend had the Pear Salad and the Roasted Cauliflower and Lentils. This chef knows his shit. He has a superb palate and knows how to pair his ingredients well in order to hit the perfect salt, sweet, sour, bitter, crunchy, soft, combination. It was the perfect balance and the preparation, seasonings, and execution were spot-on. Plate presentations were concise. I was very impressed. Unfortunately, the only downfall was dessert. We shared the Poached Apple with bacon ice cream, and langues de chat. The bacon ice cream was horrific. It tasted like they added liquid smoke to the anglaise and the smokiness took over, not a great way to end a memorable meal.  Lucky for them, the food prior was so good that they still get five stars in my book and I will definitely return!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Just returned from our second visit to Yoke at 355 E Ohio Street (corner of Grand & McClurg) and I must say that we're very happy with this find! Each of us had the Dublin Pot Roast sandwich which was rich, flavorful and grilled light and crispy. While enjoying the sandwich, I was thinking that a ramekin of the mushroom cabernet sauce for dipping might be nice, and then who should appear but our friendly server! It was almost spooky! Okay not really... Now, I was expecting the sauce to be gravy-esque tinged with red and bits of mushroom, but it turned out to be more like a French-dip au jus - still nice to have, though. Choice of fries, onion chips, fruit or slaw and for me when fried onion is available, nothing else has a chance! It's a good thing nobody is checking my cholesterol anytime soon! The dining area is airy and open but, acoustically ""live"", so it was a little loud. Overall the service was efficient and friendly and the menu is extensive. On our last visit, I had the Black and Blue Steak Caesar Salad which I remember as just great. So we'll have to return real soon! No Yoke!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After eating at The Art of Pizza and hating their deep dish, I was VERY skeptical. I wondered why people from Chicago subject themselves to these doughy monstrosities they call ""pizza."" Didn't they know that better exists? Oh but they do and its called Pequods. And it is AMAZING! It is light and crunchy and the caramelized crust is heaven. I ordered a small thin crust for myself because I was so afraid of the deep dish. But alas all I did was eat deep dish because it was like a drug. Eat here, love it. Tip: it takes about 40 mins to make the pizza, but you can call ahead for dine in or take out.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"At a fundraiser this Feb, I won a gift certificate for 'brunch for 4' at Big Jones, and after months of planning, we finally went today. I felt like a queen the whole time. The waiter and bartender took really good care of us, and as the gift certificate stipulated, we got a three course chef's brunch. The goat cheese and balck pepper biscuit was very tasty, the eggs benedict with popovers was great, and the dessert was amazing. The chef sent out one of each of four desserts, and we coulnd't decide which was our favorite, the bread pudding or the red velvet cake.My girlfriends kept thanking me for inviting them to this wonderful experience, esp each time the waiter brought us another drink. The Autumn 76 was great, and the Rose Mimosa was very tasty. Overall, it was a wonderful brunch out- I will totally buy a raffle ticket for it again if offered at this year's charity event.

"This is a pretty big step up for me. I'm pretty much satisfied with a draft pint of Fat Tire and watching a televised sporting event involving two teams I don't care about from a shaky bar stool. I'm not a sucker for ambiance at all, but when a place makes a modest effort to give itself a swanky 1960s look, I'll bite. It's the closet thing I can get to proper time travel since Home Depot doesn't carry the flux capacitor I need for the time machine I built out of spare telephone parts and my old Castle Grayskull. You're not just going to see a couple of Andy Warhol posters and listen to The Beatles here. Aside from the subtle hints of looking like a set on Mad Men, it's a very relaxing atmosphere. It's very dimly lit so nobody can notice your blemishes or any remnants of that facial tattoo you got after that ""anything but clothes"" party your freshman year. The chairs are probably the most comfortable things to sit on without having to pay a membership fee or overstay your welcome at The Sharper Image. Between the lighting, the seats and the potent cocktails, you might have to make a pretty good effort to not fall asleep. Drinks are $12 each unless otherwise noted. It sounds overpriced, but a lot of time and effort is put into them, and they follow their recipes to the last milliliter. Once you taste their Old Fashioned, you'll know where those extra few dollars went. The term ""half assed"" is not tossed around freely at Violet Hour. This is a great place to bring a date or a friend, but also not a bad place to drop in by yourself and sit at the bar. The bar men are very friendly and more than willing to talk to you while they mix your drink. One thing they won't take kindly to is phone talking. They have a pretty strict policy against them. Just turn your phone off and relax for an hour or two.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Thank you Steve M. for such a fantastic recommendation!!! We almost didn't go here. Considering we only had one night in Chicago and had already eaten a whole pizza and had our very first White Castle experience, we really didn't need to be eating dinner. But you only live once my fellow gluttons, so to Wildfire we went. I like it here. A lot. Our waiter Marcos was SUPERB. Super super nice. Didn't flinch when we decided to share a meal. Had a thick accent I couldn't understand. Most of his teeth were capped in shiny gold. Love that. My man started with wine flight #1 ($7.50!!! four glasses!!! I am so moving here.) and I went with the martini flight at an equally well priced $14.00. Ooooooooh, the martinis. This is how to do it, people. You get a standard Cosmo (crisp and perfect), a sour apple (yes, it's played out, but some things are cliche for a reason. like when they are deeee-licious), the ""wild raspberry"" (similar to a Cosmo, but sweeter, dangerous), and my favorite, ""The Stormy Night"". Right then and there, I decided this drink was going to be one of the signature cocktails at my wedding. Black Cherry vodka and watermelon Pucker are combined with a few other ingredients I can't remember, (I had just drank three martinis people, so sue me) which made for a lovely cloudy violet cocktail. Some might liken it to a Jolly Rancher, I'll just call it ""mommy juice"" even though I have no children he he. The drinks went great with a shrimp cocktail (shrimps a little overcooked but fine and a very good spicy cocktail sauce) and the filet sampler with parmesan, bleu cheese and horseradish crusts. I have to be honest, I'm not really feeling the ""crusts"". The only one you could really tell the flavor on was the horseradish and the whole thing just seemed unnecessary. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty but I think next time just a regular filet or sirloin for me. Got my man to eat creamed spinach, which is decadently evil. After his first bite he says, ""hmmm... it tastes like cheese"". Well duh honey! Any good steakhouse vegetable in no way shape or form resembles anything you'd find in your local produce section. Too good. The dessert trio put this meal over the top and completed the third trimester of my food baby gestation period. Love the ice cream sandwich, filled with Snickers-like cold creamy happiness. Chocolate peanut butter pie... no description necessary, this is an ""eye-closing"" dessert. As in, you have to close your eyes once you take a bite 'cause it's so amazing. The palate cleanser of the three was the key lime pie, oh your thick graham cracker crust I will long for you until we meet again my sweet. Hmmm, must fit in a wedding dress in six weeks. I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As a native New Jersey-an, I can honestly say that one of the things I miss most about the motherland is the Italian food.  Oh sure, you can get good Italian in Chicago. But there's just something about going to your neighborhood Italian joint.  The maitre'd is an old Italian guy in a tuxedo who will pinch your cheeks and give you a warm hug. Most of the recipes come from his wife, who has been cooking Italian food for her huge family for most of her life and can always be found in the kitchen. The servers and bartenders are their kids and grandkids. There's a guy playing Sinatra on the piano. It's loud and boisterous and fun.  I think Sabatino's is the closest thing I've found to this in Chicago. I took my folks there this past weekend for a belated father's day dinner. Now, my dad is a tough critic. He lived in Jersey for the first 37 years of his life, and we had to drag him to Chicago kicking and screaming. Every single place I've taken him that I think will remind him of home has been met with a big ol' meh from him. But not Sabatino's. It's about as authentic as you can get.  Onto the food. I was pretty surprised at how good everything was! You get lots of loaves of crusty bread on the table, and you also get a free order of delicious pizza bread. All of the entrees come with soup AND salad. The salad was nothing special, but the spinach egg drop soup I had was absolutely delicious. Between the 7 of us, we ran the gamut of entrees from pasta to fish to veal. And it was all really, really good.  (Side note: There's like 15 veal dishes on the menu. PETA would not like this place.)  Service was a bit slow, but all in all, we had a great time here. As we were walking out, there was even a guy on the piano playing some Sinatra. My dad actually had a little tear in his eye when we left - I think being in an environment like that reminded him of growing up with his dad in Jersey. I'm glad I could find something in Chicago that replicated that experience, and I'm sure we'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I recently had a chance to eat at The Pig, a new restaurant on the Mag Mile. Tucked off the street, the entrance found inside what looks like an office building, the sign boasts: Cheese, Swine, and Wine. The interior is small but well appointed, sporting large community tables and a marble bar overlooking the bustling open kitchen. I took a seat at the bar and proceeded to peruse the rather impressive menu. The menus sports categories for Antipasti, Fried Items, Entrees, Salads, Cheeses, Charcueterie, and an item they call Shmears. The wine list came in a small booklet, almost like a 3-ring binder, with pages that look like they could easily be replaced or updated, always a good sign in a place that professes to take wine seriously. I was quite hungry and ordered accordingly.Pork Liver Pate: served in a small dish with a nice serving of grilled bread. The flavor of the pate was amazing, rich and noticeably liver-y but without the often found over-irony quality of a lot of liver dishes. The texture was perfect, creamy, smooth, and actually melting a bit on the hot bread. Overall the best liver dish I have ever eaten.Pig's Tail: As soon as I saw this on the menu I had to try it, it isn't often I find a food at a restaurant that I have never tried in my life. The tails came in a cast-iron bowl and had shaved hard-boiled egg on top. They looked and smelled great and I was definitely curious to see how they tasted. I wasn't disappointed. Moist, falling off the bone, and wonderfully flavorful, they had a shard flavor of vinegar (probably from a marinade or braising) that cut the unctuous texture and flavor of the meat. A wonderfully surprising dish that I immediately wanted to tell friends about.Pig's Ear: I figured why not continue with parts of the pig I don't often get to sample! I had actually already heard about this dish from a friend who had eaten it, and was looking forward to it. It came out served in a medium bowl, the pigs ear was sliced thin and fried with peppers and fried sage was added as well. The whole thing was topped with a perfect fried egg. On the chef's recommendation I mixed the egg into the rest of the dish, spreading the yolk throughout. The first bite was pure delight, the textures were wonderful with the crispy bite of the ear and fried sage offset by the creamy yolk. The peppers in the dish added just the right amount of spice to the proceedings and it was seasoned so well that I quickly went to work devouring the whole dish. It was probably the single best dish I have eaten since moving to Chicago recently. For dessert I sampled some cheese and had a glass of sweet wine recommended by the bartender. The bill was shockingly small for the amount and quality of the food.I was wholly satisfied and actually started reading the menu again, planning what I might eat the next time I made it in to the restaurant. The dining room was abuzz with excited looking people and the overall vibe was very fun and friendly. Definitely a place I could see spending a lot of time, and a welcome oasis in the bleak winter culinary scene.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I once ate here every week. It wasn't by design or pre-meditated or anything. It was a natural inclination that wasn't meant to be suppressed, so for a month last summer, I hung out on the al fresco porch every Friday evening waiting for a patio seating. Each time I brought different friends for some real-life Yelping it forward. Because I love to chew, the Napolitan dough fit my masticulative habits perfectly. Thin yet with enough substance for slow oral savouring, the topping of fresh ingredients was a complement to the crust, rather than an American-style barrage of slathered meats and sloppy cheese. Any of the appetisers is a great way to start the meal and go ahead, get a pizza per person. It's completely possible to polish it off on your own, and if the Italians stay skinny doing just this, so will you. The tiramisu and tartufo are the two desserts we always get, as well as the Moretti La Rossa bierra. Because the pizzas take just 90 seconds to be baked in the oven shipped in from the shores of Naples, carryout is an extremely speedy process (just make sure you're steady enough to clear a glass of prosecco that proprietor Jonathan Goldsmith serves while you wait). But you better get home fast -- the intricacy of the pizza demands that it be eaten while freshly hot, or it will wilt, literally.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is a wonderful place to enjoy a leisurely meal after visiting the Art Institute down the street. The first museum visit, we all just had cocktails, and I am now addicted to the Capone. Great selection of beers too. The decor is warm, all dark wood, subway tiles, sleek but in a cosy way, and it was really comfy up at the bar. They're also very courteous to everyone regardless of whether they're in tourist-wear or business suit. I was so impressed I vowed to return soon. Fast forward one week and 3 other bars later, all serving a similar ""cucumber"" drink. NOT the same, cucumber juice is just not the same as mashed cucumber. Best at the Gage! So, dying for another Capone, I raced back today with my girlfriend in tow after another day at the museum. Picked outdoor seating, very pleasant, very friendly service. Very good food. We both started with the soup, a chilled bosc pear soup - heavenly. Just heavenly. I got the special - a corned beef sandwich on pumpernickel, which was excellent. My girlfriend got the brisket, which was a big open-faced sandwich piled with arugula. I didn't love it, but I think it was personal preference - I'm not hot on braised brisket to begin with. Girlfriend loved it, so there ya go. The clouds were starting to roll in, and a few drops were falling, so we skipped dessert, which I will absolutely remedy the next time I go. Very soon. One cocktail, soup, main and tip was $45 each. There's a great $13 value of cup of soup and half sandwich if cost is a factor. Highly recommended.","[0.0, 1.0]"

From the decor (mulling spices simmering at the hostess desk, tiny pumpkins in a cool mirrored display case along the wall, orange lights setting the autumn tone), to the service (friendly but not overbearing waiter, attentive bussers), to the drinks (London Calling cocktail with pimm's was awesome, brought me back to summers in London sipping pimm's at the pub) to the food (we had the buffalo chicken -- deliciously cooked, red wine risotto with braised beef-stuffed squid -- perfect consistency and the braised beef was AWESOME, duck -- I'm not a huge duck person, but it was very tasty, and the deconstructed lamb reuben sandwich -- SO yum and a huge portion!) to the dessert (apple fritters that reminded me of those apple cider donuts at the apple orchard, and deconstructed snickers -- so rich and chocolately!). Oh and the garlic popcorn was awesome, too! I will definitely be back. I must say I was nervous reading the mixed reviews, but really -- everything was great!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Brunch places are always crowded on the weekends, so I never expect to be seated right away. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait long for our table. The place was packed. The menu explained that Meli was Greek for honey, and that was definitely a theme in the food. Which is good -- i like honey! I had the French toast, and I was pretty happy with it. I didn't try any of the juices, but a brunchmate did, and it came out room temperature. I guess this is standard, but it seemed strange to me. This is a good breakfast place. Pretty standard selections, all done slightly uniquely. It probably wouldn't wow any out of town guests, but if you live in the neighborhood, you probably go here fairly often. I know I would.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place has a great beer menu and great bar food. The Anti-hero IPA is a standout . The diverse crowd is always fun and having been there over 10 times in the past year, I can say that the crowd is pretty consistently fun. A plus is the fact that even though it is in Logan Square, the hipster vibe has not taken over this place so it will survive all ironic movement currently sweeping other gastropubs. The service is really good for a bar/pub/restaurant and very friendly. I can't remember the name of our server during our most recent visit but he had a great vibe and knew his beers as well. Actually, he made the entire meal very fun and my out of town guest commented on how he wished more servers were like our server. Nice job!The food was really good for a pub and actually some of the items were really good for a restaurant! Yes, get the popcorn and you won't be disappointed except that the portion is a bit small so order 2 servings (trust me on this). You won't be disappointed as the menu has something for everyone. Love the burgers but I have had a lot of the menu and have loved it all. That is actually my favorite part of Revolution: every time I have gone there, I have tried a new beer or food item and have always been really pleased. That is not typical with many other places I have visited and that is why I keep going back here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This was my first time to dinner in Buck Town and I loved it. What a great area to explore. We went to Coast to celebrate some friends' birthday and everything ran very smoothly. We had reservations at 7 and were seated immediately. The restaurant is divided between two long rooms and the decor is an Asian urban and is very tastefully done. The crowd is hip and more on the younger side. We were celebrating 30 something birthdays and were definitely on the older end. The ambiance is great in this place however at some points it was hard to distinguish between the wasabi and ginger because the lights were so low. The seating was great, comfortable and enough room for 6 of us at a corner booth in the front. The tables are close together but it wasn't a problem.  Our waitress was awesome, very attentive and made some very good suggestions in terms of someone in our party having a food allergy.  It was hard to hear her at times, like everyone was saying it can get pretty loud, so be prepared to be talking at a yelling level.  We order the sesame crusted scallops as an appetizer. To die for, I would highly recommend them. So good it took 3-4 bites to finish. We decided to order Sushimi and maki rolls. My favorites were the wasabi, dragon, and fatty white tuna. Everything was nicely presented however the maki was on the smaller side. Great for woman but they could of gone a little bigger for the price.  We brought champagne and wine. Our waitress immediately greeted us with glasses and offered to uncork the champagne. I am really diggin the BYOB. It cuts down on the cost and you can bring what you want. I think the pinot grigio we brought went well with the meal. The staff was very nice however I would tell them they need to relax on clearing the table. It felt like there was an arm in front clearing something every other minute. It was a little distracting and somewhat disruptive to the conversation. They did light a candle and place it on the dessert we ordered while we sang happy birthday.  Overall, I thought it was a great place. You're definitely paying for the scene but the food was delisch. We were well taken care of by the staff and our waitress even made recommendations for someone that had a food allergy. Sweet!  Pros: SCALLOPS, SCALLOPS, SCALLOPS  educated and helpful waitress, hip environment, reservations taken, BYOB no corkage fee is spent more than 15 a person (not hard to do), great presentation and ambiance Cons: The noise level, the one bathroom (??? so always a line)(that really surprised me they definitely skimped), the constant clearing of the table, no parking, no valet, must cab it or walk.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was really excited to eat here this past Saturday night. My good friend is a teacher at Lasalle 2 Elementary school just down Division so we strolled down there later in the evening. At some point during the day my friend was given a coupon from Fifty50 saying ""We support our Teachers!"" and it said come in for 40% off your entire bill. There was no fine print, no explanations as to what the specifics were. So we showed up ready to enjoy. Looking over the menu, I was shocked by all the accolades this place had gotten and was ready to try some of the food. When we presented the coupon however, the waitress said it only applied to the person with the coupon, even though everyone at the table was a teacher, but didn't have their CPS id's. This wasn't printed on the coupon and we were thoroughly bummed. The wait staff was rude and indignant about us hoping for the deal, so we eventually just got up and left. We really didn't have a problem spending the money, but the way it was handled was awful and made us feel like beggers for even asking. We ended up walking next door to ""Small Bar"" and had a great time. I can't speak for the food, but the service staff was poor. Don't go here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The cream cheese looked like it was homemade with chives and came with red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and capers -- all of my favorite things! My friend got the huevos rancheros and we both really thought it left A LOT to be desired. It generally lacked seasoning and flavor which was shocking from such a would-be flavorful dish!We would definitely return for coffee and the bagel and lox but, although the waitstaff was friendly, we felt service could be improved.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Many people have difficulty with a lot of the rules at the Green Mill but they should all shut up. The reason that I say that is its brings more to the event.

"to get a reservation to the #2 restaurant in America, we had to call exactly 2 months before the date we had hoped to attend. we called them right when they opened at 10am and still had trouble getting through! but when we finally got through and booked our reservation, we knew that it was gonna be soooo worth it clear 3 hours from your night: dress nicely, bring a camera with good macro, and come HUNGRY! and prepare yourself for the most amazing culinary experience of your life. I've read many articles on the famous Alinea and Grant Achatz's ingenuity and creativity but I mostly tried to limit my research because one of the best things about this place is the ELEMENT OF SURPRISE!! so i won't elaborate on each of the 15 courses but i will say that it was AMAZING and well worth the hefty bill :]","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went looking for a nice and small neighborhood restaurant in the Gold Coast neighborhood (near northside Chicago) where I could get a tasty bottle of wine and a 'bistro' meal. I found it with the 3rd Coast Cafe Wine Bar. I had a delightful CA cabernet (Priest Ranch 2008) and a wonderful Italian stir fry. The meal was light (sauge and vegetables) with a little bite. I started with a Caesar salad and finished with an espresso and in-house-made NY cheesecake. The meal was delightful and it finished with a visit from the proprietor, Janet, which always impresses me (an owner at work after 9 pm). I highly recommend when you are looking for something 'off-Rush Street.'","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Go to Piccolo Sogno and sit outside (no matter how cold it is) -- you will not believe you're sitting in the middle of Chicago. It's one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to, and the outside area alone is reason enough to go!  The bar is a great place to start for a drink, and once we were seated outside I did not want to leave! We sampled their fried calamari, which was so tasty it didn't even need a sauce, and a plate of cold ham, cheese and vegetables. I also had the caprese salad which was so good. For dinner, I've heard that their fish is not fantastic, so I had their special butternut squash risotto which I tried my very best not to finish but apparently had to eat every last bite, and also sampled some other pastas which were all really good.  For dessert we tried the chocolate hazelnut cake (can't say there was any left of that) and the pannacotta, which isn't a favorite of mine. We also had a delicious Italian after-dinner drink (Moscato with something else in it, recommended by the sommelier). Next time I want to try the duck and their pizzas. Great atmosphere, great food, can't wait to go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Bachelorette party from Hades. Girls crying. Girls yelling. Girls spitting in fake plants at the airport (alcohol involved). The definition of a shit show on wheels. Lo and behold, Chicago q. I had my fingers-crossed that this sure-bet restaurant would save the day. I've always had a way for blaming frowny faces on empty stomachs, so I was hoping q's homemade bbq chips and house sweet pickles (crazy-good) would start steering this party in the right direction. Ya know what else makes people smile? A damn good Blood Mary. Please, oh please, waiter - pour some alcohol down these unhappy souls' throats! My mother is the Queen of Bloody Marys and I, well, I'm not a huge fan but q's smokey/meaty tomato kick-in-the-ass Mary is an exception. It may not have been what the group needed, but it sure as hell was what I needed at the moment. Our waiter handled our group very well. It seemed to be difficult to keep everyone at the table between the bathroom stall crying sessions and phone calls to home outside the restaurant. This social/company side of this sacred meal was nothing like I had envisioned it when I originally chose q for our dinner stop, but the food was exquisitely predictable. My kobe beef sandwich was piled high with juicy, lean chunks of meat and left me wishing I wasn't from out of town so I could party the night away with a to-go box in hand. So, maybe we weren't able to salvage the remainder of the evening, but we were able to fill the tummies of a bbq-loving bunch with juicy meats and bloody Marys. One more note - q is quite possibly the prettiest BBQ restaurant I've ever been to. It's like a worldly farm boy - hard to come by, but magic when you do.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I had the sandwich with gouda and bacon and it was yummy... very basic, but it was only $7... so they definitely know what they are serving. The truffle fries were awesome.

"I went here on a date not too long after they opened. The food was nice, atmosphere pleasant, and service adequate.  I had heard they were known for their rabbit and sangria. We tried a number of items, including their specialties. I thought the sangria was good, but nothing to write home about. The rabbit was gamey, but it's rabbit. I didn't like it. We tried the dates as well, which didn't compare to Avec's. (Avec stole my heart with their dates.) What I did really enjoy, though, was the Montana y Mar (I think that's what they called it), steak and sea scallops. Very tasty, very tender. Their mushroom risotto was good, too. For dessert, I had the four chocolates, which were all delicious.

"I wasn't sure if I should believe all of the hype about Piccolo Sogno, but my experience on Friday night made me a believer. After a year of reading about the acclaimed patio, I couldn't imagine that I'd truly be stepping into paradise, but this urban oasis really made me feel like I was in an Italian garden. Our server, Jeff, was knowledgable, honest, and entertaining. He dubbed himself our tour guide for the evening and took us on a wonderful adventure of Italian cuisine. Each dish we tried was more delicious than the last. I loved that each pasta dish could be ordered in appetizer-sized portions, which allowed our group to sample more of the menu. Don't skip the Ravioli Piccolo Sogno. The appetizer-sized portion is four pieces of Ravioli, so you can definitely enjoy it and still have room for an entree. Everything about this experience was decadent, from the atmosphere to the food itself. This is a MUST TRY on the Chicago restaurant list. http://www.girlthateats.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First time I came here, it was so crowded so we were seated at the oyster bar. We ordered lobster festival family course, which gives us two lobsters, appetizers, and soups. However our server gave us tiny bar seating, where we had to cramp all the food into the table, not a very enjoyable experience. We asked for a bigger table but they said they're full, however five minutes later there are two girls came for drinks and they gave them 4-person table, HELLO? We are all customers here! Geez. Couple weeks later, I came back but this time I reserved table through open table and we had an enjoyable and delish dinner. Our server was really nice and attentive, which is why i added one star to this review. Food is great and seafood selections are fresh. I recommend their blue crab stuffed lobster and oyster rockefeller.

"Decent food, decent service, been to better steak houses in Chicago. I was here last night with a group from work and I just wasn't overly impressed. I thought that the prices were pretty high (comparable to other steak houses in the area I suppose) and I thought that the servings were a tad skimpy (again, comparing steak house to steak house). I did appreciate the fact that they had more on their menu than just steak, though I ended up getting the filet. The appetizers that we ordered were ok - again, nothing to write home about. If I am going to spend money on a good steak restaurant in Chicago, this won't be the one I choose next time. Oh well, you win some you lose some :).

"2nd time at Texas de Brazil, but first time to this location in downtown (1st in Schaumburg).  It was a late Thursday dinner where we didn't arrive at restaurant until 9:00 PM and the restaurant closes at 10 PM.  I was worried that we would be missing out on the full selection coming in this late but we confirmed with the host, who told us everything would still be available.  We would have sat down at 8:45 but the valet attendant took FOREVER!  But I'll save that for parking company's review. First, I highly recommend joining their E-Club. They send you BOGO coupons or specials such as two for $69 for the salad bar, meats, and dessert, which is a bargain considering dessert is not usually included.  Tonight, we took advantage of the $69 for two.  I usually stay away from salad bar and go right for the meats. But, this time I tried a little of the lobster bisque, caprese salad, ahi tuna, and portobello mushrooms.  Lobster bisque is my favorite soup ever but was not impressed. Too much sherry? and no chunks of lobster and way too rich.  Loved the caprese salad. Ahi tuna needed more flavor and portobello mushrooms were a bit on the soggy side.  Now for the meats!  My favorite meats of the evening were the garlic parmesan pork, top sirloin, and flank steak.  Pork was cooked perfectly and not dry. Top sirloin and flank steak were so flavorful and a perfect medium rare.  I usually love the bacon wrapped filet mignon but the bacon was way too salty that I didn't enjoy the filet.  I don't usually eat mashed potatoes but loved how creamy the garlic mashed potatoes were.   Even though, we were there late, the service was still great. Our server Leah was always on top of things and always asked if we there any particular meat that we wanted to come back.  The manager even stopped by to check on us, which is always a big plus for me at any restaurant.   We had the creme brulee for dessert, which was amazing as always.  My suggestion for these churrascarias is to make the dessert portions smaller! All in all, a fantastic meal at Texas de Brazil with great service in a wonderful ambiance.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If you want to impress a special someone, this is the spot. Enter through a unmarked doorway in a brightly graffitied wall on Damen (right across from Big Star's patio), sneak through heavy velvet curtains in a darkened hallway, and enter a sexy, dimly lit den where stylish people are sipping craft cocktails in tall-backed booths that feel like secret coves.  Design wise, this might be the slickest place in Chicago. The ambiance alone is worth the trip. The cocktails were also something really special-- surprising, thoughtful concoctions mixed by expert bartenders and served up by knowledgeable staff.

"This was my fourth and final visit to Spacca Napoli. Two visits ago, I was dining with a friend at a two-top. After our plates were cleared, Jonathan Goldsmith (the owner) came up to us and asked if we would mind moving to another table as he was trying to set up for a party of eight. He offered us each a grappa and apologized for the inconvenience. We obliged without question. Last night I was dining with 3 friends at a four-top. We had reservations and were seated promptly. After completing our meals (including dessert), our waiter offered us the check. At that time, we had been at our table for a little over an hour. In the middle of our conversation, Jonathan Goldsmith came to our table and asked if he could settle our bill, to which I replied, No, we haven't looked at it yet. Shortly there after, we put our credit cards in the jacket. Jonathan Goldsmith collected it and then returned it to us. Within 2 minutes of signing our credit card receipts, he returned to our table and asked if we would mind moving to the bar (where he would offer us grappa or a drink of our choice) because there were a lot people who were waiting to be seated. In protest, I told him that this was the second time in a month I had been asked to vacate my table at his restaurant and that I found it in poor taste to be asked to leave the dining room to make room for another party. Taking issue with my protest, he told me that he was sorry, but that he was trying to be nice and didn't want to make his other customers wait 1.5 hours to be seated. Frustrated, we left the restaurant.Sadly, Jonathan Goldsmith's behavior exemplifies what is experienced in American eateries across the country: namely, it isn't about making the customer feel welcome or encouraged to digest one's meal at the table on which it was served. It's about turning the tables and making sure that every last available dollar is taken in by the end of the night. Fortunately, I live in a city where there are a number of fantastic pizzerias and Italian restaurants where the owners and managers encourage you to enjoy your meal (Calos and Pizza D.O.C. being 2 perfect examples) in a relaxed, unhurried setting.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Absolutely one of the finest establishments in Chicago. Love the cocktails - lovingly handcrafted, tasty, and refined. I dream of being able to mix like the mixologists here. It is an oasis of excellence in a sea of mediocrity. One my first visit to VH I spent twenty minutes discussing the merits of several different types of bitters for a Manhattan (the drink by which I judge all others). How terrific is that? I've been to VH many times and always enjoy the experience. It is a place which requires attention to the cocktail and the conversation which will ensure with your companions. Perhaps I love it for the fact that you need to converse/discuss/interact with the people you are there with. The art of conversation is alive and well at the VH. But lets face it - they make an absolutely fantastic cocktail. And the cocktail remains the greatest civilizing force in the world. The room is wonderful, with most of the space being devoted to small, intimate tables with high backed chairs, making sure that your focus remains on your drinking partners, and not the scene around you. It's a place to converse, not to cruise. The seats at the bar are also terrific, as you can discuss/debate to merits of various drinks and ingredients with the knowledgeable staff. I remain in awe of the Zarzamora - combining both Bourbon and Fernet Branca - absolute genius! As one of the few Fernet Branca drinkers in Chicago (as far as I can tell) it was a revelation. In short - this is a wonderful place. It brings people together for conversation and sophisticated drinking. It is clearly a throwback and not for everyone. When I introduce friends to this place they are generally in awe, never having realized that this oasis of civility still exists in the modern day. Go, you will not be sorry (unless Hooters is your idea of a great drinking establishment).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was looking forward to a graduation dinner here that was preplanned with reservations almost 3 months in advance. Unfortunately the weather wasn't nice enough to sit outside, which is first come first serve with or without reservations. Our reservations for 9 were at 7:30, again 3 months in advance and we called several times the week of to make sure it was still going to be okay. We didn't get seated until after 8 p.m. That behavior would never fly anywhere else in the city, and if it were to happen, most restaurants would at least comp dessert, an appetizer or one of our 3 cars that we had sitting out in valet. I would never wait that long to eat there again unless it was to enjoy a glass of wine on their patio; honestly the only reason we were going here. The food was good, as expected. It wasn't tapas but definitely smaller portions for an Italian restaurant. The wine menu was large but they didn't carry a Pinot Grigio, which I found odd for an Italian restaurant. I would go back, but not anytime soon. This place has been open for a while and it wasn't a weekend, they should have their act together by now. For a similar taste with better service, I suggest Osteria Via Stato in River North.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I have only been to India House during lunch when they offer a buffet for around $15. Its not the cheapest lunch/buffet but it is well worth the cost. The food is really good and they have plenty of vegetarian options. The wait staff is very attentive so much so you never have an empty basket of naan or glass of water.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I am adjusting my review down by one star for: a. Closing on a Saturday night for a wedding. If it was an employee I would understand, but I cannot accept that a business operating as local bar/restaurant can close for a function such as a wedding during a prime social time. There are plenty of function venues in Chicago.  b. Whilst this is not entirely the fault of the venue and involves poor parental control. I went in earlier in the week to enjoy a beer at the bar and have some lunch. The enjoyment was short lived as I had to endure a child running and playing in the bar area making a complete racket. I would have thought that it would make sense to place minors in the restaurant section and not at the bar. Needless to say I left after my first beer and without buying any lunch.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My wife and I just ate here last week for the first time. It is a really nice place to eat! The portions were very sizable, as I would expect from an Italian restaurant, and the price was actually quite affordable. I had ravioli, which was outstanding.They seem to have a pretty extensive wine list for those who are interested. Overall, it was a very satisfying dining experience. The wait staff was friendly, and residential parking was ample within a block, not to mention they offer valet service if you choose that route. We'll definitely go there again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was quite skeptical of this place due to the fact that it is a chain, but decided to give it a try after watching it on Check Please. Now I know why it is a chain, because the original is GOOD. The handwritten menu looks homey with interesting choices and lots of seafood dishes. We ordered calamari fritt - tender and juicy and just right bruschette alla toscana - i never knew a simple combo of tomato basil cheese and ham could be so good, and not soggy linguine alla sora assonata - pasta with scallops & spinish - yum linguine al funghetto - very mushroomy and good rigatoni dei sardi ravioli con pesto pollo arrosto alla romana - need salt tiramisu - super light & fluffy molten chocolate cake - with bits of chocolate in the middle, wow profiterole - giant puffs with ice cream in the middle peanut butter chocolate cake - salty and sweet white chocolate gelato - tasted like coconut to me! in one world, DELICIOUS! The pastas were cooked al dente, which I loved, and all the sauces were good. I have to say, I thought the other restaurant from last week had more flavorful sauces, but the desserts were EXCELLENT.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was extremely disappointed with both the service and the cuisine at Caro Mio, after having read so many complimentary reviews about the restaurant. I expected so much more from our dining experience.From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the man greeting us at the door owner was rude. They gave us a small table in a very obscure and noisy room.The server did not approach us for at least 7 minutes without even acknowledging us during that time. The two entrees that we ordered were mediocre and warm at best. They never came back to refill water glasses or to ask if our meal was satisfactory. We decided not to order dessert or coffee because we felt we had wasted enough time and money on a very poor dining experience.We are not pretentious or snobby, but we love Italian Cuisine and we are used to eating in good restaurants and expect good customer service and good food. What a disappointment Caro Mio was. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Jerry Nunn","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been going to Coast since 2008. It has some of the best sushi in chicago but somehow doesnt get as much hype as japonais, sunda, or sushi wabi. It's BYOB so that's a plus, although when they first opened, you could bring in whatever and however much you wanted. now, you can only bring in 1 bottle of wine or a 6pack of beer for every two people and they charge a corkage fee. the sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri are spectactular though. the service is just OK... a little slow. also, you can't make reservations, so i suggest walking in, putting your name down, and then running to the liquor store down the street and getting a bottle of wine. by the time you get back, a table should be available.  another plus is they have fresh wasabi.  yum! it's very affordable and i think it has the best sushi for the price you pay. scene/decor is just OK. my final ratings: food=10, scene/decor=5, service=7, prices=10.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Having heard so many things about duck fat fries, I felt that it'd be inappropriate to skip out on these ""life changing"" (according to Anthony Bourdain, I believe) fries on my visit to Chicago over the July 4th weekend. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I finally made it into the store and ordered two special dogs (the catalonian and the foie) and of course duck fat fries (they only have these on the weekends). Before I get to the good things, I've got to say that the duck fat fries were *very* disappointing. I'm not sure if it was a long day and we were just unfortunate enough to get stuck with fries from old fryer oil or what... But the fries were disappointing even if they were not fried in duck fat. Lacking flavor and a little bit on the soggy side, I probably wouldn't order these again. The Foie dog with the duck sausage was interesting. Hot Doug's definitely did not skimp on the amount of foie on the dog. I'd suggest eating this last as the foie can overwhelm your palate and have a tendency to stay in your mouth a little longer than you'd think. My favorite, by far, was the catalonian... Pork sausage with a saffron rouille... That combo was heavenly... Not only can you actually see threads of saffron in the rouille, it tasted sooooo good... I can probably eat the rouille by itself... If you don't want to wait in line for a loooong time, you really should come early...","[0.0, 1.0]"
I love this place. I have been eating here when it first opened and nobody heard of them. Now sometimes its hard to get on the door. The subs are big for the money they charge and the pizza is good.

"Coast is great sushi in a great atmosphere with great service. If you go to Coast you HAVE to get the White Dragon Roll. It is one of my favorite specialty rolls in the city! Its made of shrimp tempura, wasabi tobiko, cream cheese, avocado, scallion spicy sauce, wasabi dressing, eel sauce and tempura flakes. This roll is so good that some of the others can seem a little bland in comparison (like the sunrise roll). I would recommend a reservation and they also have takeout if you are looking for great food for a night in.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If I could come here and eat their mussels every day, I would. I always get the mussels for two and polish them off by myself. That's my appetizer, entree and dessert. Forget the bread that comes along with it. I'm here for mussels and mussels only. Oh, well the frites with the aioli too. What a perfect accompaniment to the meal.  They have a ton of beer selections but since I am allergic to alcohol, I can't really comment on that. I know people come for the cool beverages but come for the food. It is excellent.  Lastly, be prepared to wait. They don't take reservations (as far as I know) so come early if you hate waiting. But even if you do, it's worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Made a reservation at Pequod's for my birthday and the staff was more than accomdating for all 15 of us. The pizzas took a while to come out, and they actually forgot to put in our one thin crust we ordered...but absolutely well worth the wait and they took off 50% of the pizza they forgot about...I actually almost forgot the negative experience because I enjoyed the food so much.As for the pizza, it's amazing...from the crispy, caramalized cheese crust to the delicious sauce and endless toppings..it's perfection on a plate. The pizza differs from Lou's or a Gino's, which is much appreciated! It was so refreshing to find a place like this, and not too far away. I will gladly return again and again!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"FAMOUS FOR: Superdawg (hot dog) (10/10) Hahahahah! I just surfed over to my Yelp profile page and it says ""Your next review awaits..."" and points to Superdawg, and I'm like...Wat? Of all the times I've been here, I never reviewed it? In disbelief, I went to my reviews and did a search for Superdawg and found that every hot dog joint I've ever reviewed...Superdawg was mentioned, and yet, I never actually reviewed the place! Whoa! THE BEST CHICAGO HOT DOG So, what's there left to say that hasn't been said yet? Your hot dog is served in a box, which reminds me of Animal Crackers for some reason. The hot dog is tucked away and the box is stuffed with crispy crinkle fries. The dog isn't a Vienna nor is it a Chicago Red Hot. It's its own thing. It's about the size of a Portillo's jumbo hot dog, but without Portillo's ""chlorine"" flavor (that everyone says I'm insane for saying). By the way, that ""chlorine"" flavor that only I seem to be able to taste is in Portillo's Jumbo hot dog only, not their regular sized one. In any case, it's your good ol' Chicago Hot Dog, with the dog, mustard, radioactive colored relish, celery salt, onions (blech! - I order without), pickle, and tomato...all on a flimsy bun. But the tomato isn't chopped red tomatoes, it's a small green pickled tomato. The reason I mention ""flimsy bun"" and also the reason why it doesn't lose points for it, is because I like the flimsy bun. Bread to me is simply the container that the hot dog rests in. It's necessary not only for that, but to help even out the intense salt in all that Superdawg, The problem is, a lot of places get it wrong, and the bun is too big or too intrusive. You get a nice hot dog flavor for awhile, and then the bun sorta takes over and cleans house. I don't like that. That's why I like Superdawg so much, because the bun does it's job (even out the intense salt) while not leaving much of a trace. The dog also is just incredible. I'm always amazed at the flavor of a Chicago Red Hot, given its size, but man, the Superdawg dog is just fabulous. The flavor is as intense as a Red Hot (even more so), and there's so much more of it! The only qualm is that sometimes, and it may actually be more of a mood thing than an actual Superdawg problem, the Superdawg can be a little too intense. Sometimes, the mustard, pickle, and pickled tomato sort of join forces, Power Rangers style, and it gets a little salty. Nothing that an ice cold Diet Coke or a few helping of fries can't fix, but if you have to do that, then what's the point? ALL IN ALL Even though it's probably the least Chicagoey of the famous Chicago Hot Dogs, this is my favorite Chicago Hot Dog! OH YEAH - CASH ONLY! - There is eat in, but just a tiny little area with counters and chairs. It's meant for you to eat in your car a-la Sonic.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We came here with a large group for a birthday dinner. The service was excellent - we got tons of delicious cornbread muffins and drinks as we waited for our whole group to arrive. I shared crab fritters for an app and they were excellent, as were the sauces served alongside. For dinner I had the black bean cakes with both the mango salsa and the red pepper sauce, Yankee coleslaw (vinegary which I favor), cheese grits and green beans. I absolutely loved everything. The food was really flavorful, fresh and interesting. I also got the very reasonable flight of red wine for $7.95 which was unpretentious and good. I realize this place is totally batso crazy in the mornings and I think I'll just return for dinner. The whole place was dimly (with a big Christmas tree), fun but not loud and just delightful.

This was a new idea to me and ended up loving it. The fries and sandwich are served all together bunched up and yummy in my tummy.

"I absolutely loved this place. Stylish but not pretentious, everyone is welcome as long as you follow their house rules.  We sat at the bar and marveled at all of the drinks being prepared. It was very difficult to decide what to try! I wound up having a 23 Skidoo and a Blackberry Caipirissima. (We were there before they switched to the Fall menu.). They were both in the rum section of the menu but couldn't have been more different. The Caiprissima, with Flor de Cana 4 year, blackberries, demerara syrup and Briottet Creme de Muir, is the kind of drink that's right up my alley. It was light and refreshing, a drink you'd be happy to sip on poolside. The 23 Skidoo had Zacapa 23, Ramazzotti Amaro, El Dorado 5 year, demarara syrup and Peychaud's bitters and was totally out of my comfort zone. It was strong and masculine, something I wouldn't ordinarily order. That's the nice thing about their menu: all of the cocktails are $12 so you can just pick whichever cocktail sounds good and have fun. Of course, if you don't want to take your chances, the staff is more than willing to discuss your likes and dislikes and make recommendations. I love the decor and the seating. It's a great place for a date or a small gathering of friends. It is quite dark inside with no windows which really adds to the atmosphere. It's like being in the casinos in Vegas...you can lose all sense of time! Sadly, our time at the Velvet Hour came to an end all too early due to dinner reservations. Rest assured next time we're in town we'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I popped my proverbial sushi cherry here thanks to the lovely Jackie P. I posed around town as a sushi connoisseur as I ate only California rolls. I was informed that it wasn't really sushi I was eating so I had to go and get the full experience. So I did at Wakamono and loved the Rainbow roll and some of the other items I got to try. I'm not posing any longer but I do have more to try! The place seems nice as I did like the layout. I also like that it is BYOB, even with the $5 cork fee ... If I were a lush then perhaps I would have a problem with that. It is a work in progress on being a lush - I'm sure a few more Yelp gatherings and I'll be there! So I was part of a small party so I didn't pay attention too much on the prices but they seem fair enough with the amount of sushi pieces that came out. It was a good group to be with and everyone seem pleased with their food. The service was very good too as they were quick and attentive.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"One of my friends told me that she swore she once saw a bus on Elston Avenue some time back in the '70s, so I followed Sacramento Avenue up to its suicidal collision with the Nystrom building at Elston. I didn't see any bus signs, but wondered if maybe there was a secret off-the-schedule bus, or if CTA drivers still took occasional bribes for doorstep service like they sometimes did in the pre- GPS surveillance era. After waiting for hours with no sign of a bus, I became restless and hungry, so I followed Elston vaguely towards O'Hare. For those of you who don't know Elston, it is one of the few streets in Chicago that travel through both time AND space. That's why I wasn't completely surprised to have arrived, just past Addison, at a stained-glass caf in Bucharest circa 1930. Inside, a curly-haired Django Reinhardt was playing his guitar alongside a female Stephane Grapelli and some other rascal on guitar, gliding through standards like After You've Gone, Corcovado, and Misty before landing on an unrecognizable tune. Django scraped the strings lengthwise, Stephane moused her fiddle, Django plucked the strings between the saddle and the bridge, Stephane launched a small jet along the concourse of the strings. They smiled at each other, knowing the moment of spontaneous genius they had created. Branko, the owner, weaves his way through the dining area, checking on his customers.  Flames leap dramatically from plates of saganaki seemingly every fifteen minutes. $7 may sound like a lot for a plate of cheese, but with the fire and Branko's effervescence included in the deal, it's a steal. If the beer selection is noteworthy- Old No. 38, Barley Island Wheat Ale, South Hampton White, Peak Organic Amber- the wine selection may be more so. One specialty I didn't try was the Dracula's blood wine. There's good food here, too- I tried the whitefish but that's just the start of it. This could well be the best little world music venue in town right now. Other regular acts include a French accordion duo, Bossa Tres, a tango group, and a rumba group. I came here with a couple of guys... but now that I know the way the stained glass and orange light cast a warm glow on all around, I'm coming back with a woman. And maybe take credit for what Branko so tastefully created.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We were all on the same page... you and I both knew that we didn't have a reservation. If you did think we actually had a reservation, you never would have approached us with such an attitude. Too bad, all we were looking for was an idea of the wait time, and an invitation to the bar where we would have gladly dropped cash on drinks while we waited. People who are looking to dine in Andersonville, eat elsewhere...

After escorted to our seats, with a -few jokes, and pats-on-the-backs, our attentive waiter came over and again welcomed us. The menu was as expected with traditional fair from Eastern Europe. We started with the saganaki, which was perfectly done, and tasty. Then we ordered the goulash- my boyfriend, the braised short ribs, and I, the vegetarian. Each came to our table with a miraculous presentation and tasted equally fantastic. It was fresh, and flavorful, and devoured entirely.  At the end of our meal, the owner came over and poured an Eastern European liqueur down my throat directly from the bottle in an over the top demonstration of hospitality which was quite fun and memorable.

My party of 4 was seated promptly and got our order quickly. The pizza takes an hour, so we got mozz sticks while we waited. They were basic frozen (and one that came to us still was!) mozzarella sticks. When our pizza finally came the server cut it and dished it out for us. We had half supreme and half sausage (patty). I loved the sausage and the sauce. The only thing I wasn't crazy about is the crust. It was hard and bland. Even sopping up extra sauce didn't help it.

First off, although the staff was cordial, I got the feeling I was literally being ""rushed"" out of the place. This could be attributed to the fact that I arrived about half an hour before closing; however, if they took me in as a customer and were going to take my money, they should treat me like any other customer. I ordered the recommended Tiger Cry beef for appetitizer and was disappointed. Although the menu said the beef was char-grilled, what I got was mostly burned, inedible pieces of beef that were bitter to the taste, spare a few pieces towards the middle of the pile. Next, came the potstickers. Two out of the five pieces were so hard that I couldn't even bite into it. I had to use my chopsticks to literally pry it open just so I can get to the pork inside and toss the dumpling skin aside. The only thing I was totally impressed was was their yum woon sen (noodle and chicken salad). It's one of the best I've had and is probably their saving grace. The only complaint I have about this dish is the fact that they used mainly ground chicken instead of actual chicken strips, which most other Thai restaurants use in their yum woon sen. Their Kee Mao noodles was just alright. I've had better but there really wasn't anything too special about it. The plate was a bit small and was filled more with veggies than chicken or noodles. Also the fact that I got ALL 4 dishes at once practically made me feel as if they wanted me to leave asap, because by the time I got to my main dish (the Kee Mao noodles), it was starting to get cold already (it was the 2nd dish to arrive out of all the plates).Overall, I was unimpressed by the restaurant. I don't know if I'll be dining there anytime again soon. Hopefully I'll just chart this down to being there as their last customer. I wonder if there delivery service is any better...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am a frequent patron of Icosium Kafe. It goes without saying that the food is fantastic - read any of the other reviews to confirm that (my favorite is the Chicago crepe- and the vegetable soup is the best I've ever tasted). But what really keeps me coming back to this restaurant time and time again is the service. The staff is small, so over time the faces become familiar, and I am immediately greeted when I come into the restaurant. I feel like I'm eating with family.So imagine my surprise on Saturday morning when my meal was interrupted with shouting and swearing. I looked up to see what I assume was a manager, feet away from my table and in plain view of the entire restaurant, yelling in my server and swearing at her. He was accusing her of neglecting her tables. I can't speak for all her tables, and I obviously don't have all the information, but I can attest that she provided my table with impeccable, friendly service. Even if she had been neglecting tables, it was completely inappropriate for him to yell at her and use such strong language (I am not exaggerating when I say that he used the f-word over a dozen times), especially in front of her guests. It was infuriating. Thankfully I know that such behavior is not typical of Icosium, but I would be shocked if any first-timers in the restaurant that day ever returned. Who wants to eat at a restaurant where the servers are verbally abused?I don't mean to take up so much space detailing this event. I just hope that someone from the restaurant reads this and stands up for our outstanding server. I've been served by all of Icosium's servers, and have always been delighted. So, if the owners or other managers from Icosium read this, please know that your customers love your servers - they're what keep us coming back. Treat them with the respect they deserve!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food was tasty but the portions were not worth the price at all.The server did not return change even though it was obviously more than double (almost triple) what an expected tip would be..and then was almost impossible to flag down.When we left, I noticed they were moving to clear our table immediately. Not surprising given that there was only two or three other tables in there, but when I returned the next day to retrieve sunglasses I had left on the table I was told no one had found them even though they were right on the table and they were clearing before we were through the door.While portion size is not enough to merit such a poor review, that combined with the shady staff behavior means I will not be returning.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We live in Wicker Park and are long time patrons of the Alliance Bakery, but we recently had a bad experience with those amazing looking cakes in the window. Since I was completing graduate school, we decided to order something special for family that would be in town for the celebration. There was an awesome cake in the window that looked like a giant cheeseburger. Inspired, we decided to get one that looked like a deep-dish pizza. When I ordered the cake, it was much more expensive than originally quoted...over $160 for a cake that fed eight. When I picked the cake up, it was the size and dimensions of a regular cake, NOT of a deep-dish pizza, the frosting was pink instead of red like a marinara, with just a few fondant pepperonis and (gray) mushrooms. My expectations had been set by their impressive display window, and even the Alliance baker who heard my complaint agreed that he would also have been disappointed. The only offer made at that point was to add a few more pepperonis and mushrooms. Not only was my entire party very disappointed in the cake's appearance, the amount of money we spent was far beyond our budget, which made the disappointing product smart all the more. The cake itself was delicious, but the experience was a bad one that left us sad. We wanted to be happy, satisfied customers. We wanted a realistic looking cake like the ones their window display advertises. The Alliance neither delivered nor offered any recompense. We expected much more from them.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stopped by The Purple Pig for dinner while in town for a concert. Since my stomach eats on Eastern time zone, I arrived before the big dinner rush and was able to get seated quickly. We ordered 5 items from the menu per the server's friendly suggestion. My first complaint was that the menu descriptions do not adequately prepare you for what they are serving. I was frequently surprised by what I received versus the description and even more surprised to see what the other people at the communal table were receiving based on the menu descriptions. If you are going to have an exotic menu, I think you need to give patrons adequate tools to make their choices. My main concern, however, is that while the menu promises exotic eats, the dishes that are served are generally mediocre. The $20-something beef tenderloin was just okay, nothing special. The prosciutto balls (where's the prosciutto, by the way?) were bland. The panini was just a fancy ham and cheese. The saving grace for TPP is the pricing. I thought the pricing was excellent and a good value for the location. Overall, we had a fine meal and felt like we got our money's worth. But the quality of the food was very disappointing based on the hype.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Having been an avid fan of this joint, I feel the need to voice my disdain! I made birthday dinner reservations for a 7:45 Saturday night requesting a booth if possible. Upon our arrival we get the old ""we are a little backed up will call you in 15 minutes"". Ya no big deal! Like clock work we were called in 15 minutes and led to our booth where someone else was sitting and the waters were being placed on the table. WTF! Anyway, the seater leads us in a big circle and we end up back at the front desk where a mass of confusion seemed to set in. Courteously I waited another 15 minutes and no one was solving our problem. As a matter of fact no one seemed to even know about our problem except us. Happy Birthday baby!!! Now I am slightly ticked off and grab the coat tails of the only person that looked like they knew what they were talking about! He was in the middle of helping the girl who lost control of the check-in with her computer. She looked like she was playing video poker and was on her last ""dollah"". After another 5 minutes we were led upstairs and sat against a friggn wall in a corner. Uncool! I think I am done with this place for a while.

"The name says it all - this place is Simply It! I was the first to arrive for my first GNO. I walk in and find a huge table along the back wall all set up for the lovely ladies of yelp, so I shimmy my way to the middle along the wall. I figured I'd be in the middle of the gals, the booze and the food. I was right. So as I'm sitting down and grabbing the wine from my bag, the owner walks up and introduced himself. He's a small guy with a giant smile. He took my wine to open and chill it while I waited for the other yelpettes. Slowly the ladies began trickling in and while we got situated, the servers were grabbing everyones bottles and chilling, opening, etc. Very prompt and gracious. On to the food. I had never had Vietnamese before, but the menu sounded awesome so I was excited. They started us with an appetizer sampler. The servers came around and told us which sauces went with which app. I immediately forgot the protocol, but appreciated to quick lesson. I was sitting next to the fab Helena B. and when the server was telling us how to use the sauces, she noticed Helena already chose one and told her she'd ruined it. She wasn't snotty about it though, and we all found it pretty funny. Helena liked it anyway - rogue sauce and all. The egg rolls were super crunchy and I fell in love with the chicken dumplings. As the waitress was taking the plate away, I stuck my arm up to grab the last one off the plate - I mean, it's just the girls - I don't need my manners, right? Right. I didn't get to try the chicken pastry deal, and I wasn't really a fan of the spring rolls, but that's only because I'm not really a cilantro fan - so I didn't hold that against them. The salad was a cold shrimp salad with papaya and cilantro. As long as I didn't get a bunch of cilantro in the bite, it was super light and refreshing. The entrees were a lemongrass chicken dish, stir fried with sweet bell peppers, jalapenos, lemongrass (duh) and herbs. Very tasty. The chicken was moist and the veggies had a slight crunch to them. Then the mango beef. Served in a coconut with mango, garlic, onion, coconut and snow peas. So good. Then the calamari dish. This was the one I was most skeptical about, but ended up enjoying the most. I couldn't keep my chopsticks out of the pineapple it was served in. The calamari was cooked perfectly with cashews and, of course, pineapple and veggies. All served along side sticky rice. Dessert was fried bananas with a strawberry and chocolate drizzle. Scrumptious. Also a plate of fresh fruits. Everything about the meal was amazing. All the ingredients were super fresh and cooked perfectly. The decor was bright and clean. The service - the service was impeccable. They were there when you needed them, but not overbearing. The perfect balance of attentiveness that can be hard to achieve. On my way out, the owner was saying goodbye to us all, and he said goodbye to me by name! I was super impressed. LOVED HIM! All this fabulousness for $25? This may have been my first GNO, but definitely won't be my last.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is the typical Greek restaurant I grew up with when my family would eat in Greektown after coming down to check out the Marshall Field's window displays over Christmas (like every good little Jewish family does over the holidays). So coming back here as an adult, this place definitely makes me feel warm and fuzzy all over. But be prepared to wait on a Friday night. Food comes out quick and the service is always impeccable (if you come in with the understanding that you're going to have a cold, impersonal, male Greek server - no chicks waiting tables here). If you like garlic, you'll love their skordalia (think hummus but made with pureed potatoes, not chickpeas). I usually head towards a special of the night dish or their typical gyros platter and am never disappointed. Opaa!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Entirely overrated. The decoration is cheap and kitschy. It's too loud for conversation, which I think is important for a place set up as a restaurant. On substance, the beer they brew is not at all impressive. I'd rate it a little higher than Moonshine's beer, but still somewhat below Natty Ice. The food itself is fine enough, but the menu doesn't inspire much of an appetite. The server didn't seem to know much about beer, despite working at a brew-pub. Also, he billed for the mediocre cupcake he brought out when we told them it was my friend's birthday. Not that it's absolutely de rigueur to give things away gratis on birthdays, but any little pleasantness from the waiter would've been welcomed, and would've bumped them up a star or two in my opinion.

And the home fries they were served with were even saltier! Blech. I left some of the eggs benedict on my plate and ate very little of the home fries.

The obviously do a booming business, but their service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. After waiting 1.5 hours for a table, when we were finally seated (next to the host station, at the front door) our server ignored us for a full 20 minutes before even acknowledging our presence (though 2 other tables across the aisle from us, seated just after us, were greeted and attended to before we were). It took another 20 minutes to get water, which arrived about the same time as our pre-ordered pizza. The antipasto salad was mediocre.The waitstaff was clearly overwhelmed, and when I tried to speak to the manager about how poor the service was, he was unconcerned and blew me off.

"Never went here for dining in, but the both the thin and stuffed pizzas are predictably good, compared to the other Giordano's, a good sign of consistency from one restaurant to another. While YMMV, I have a bit of a prejudice towards all Giordano's with its staff and service; luckily for this restaurant, I get delivery, but that's for later... Both thin (which is not thin) and stuffed (not deep dish) are tasty, as are the added condiments - I always go for the SMOG (sausage, mushroom, onion, and green peppers), and its always excellent: tasty crust, sauce is good, and the ingredients are great. Since I never dined here, I always get it delivered - delivery times are actually not too bad, considering the time it usually takes to get a pizza from Giordano's; almost always get it under 75 minutes, a reasonable time to wait considering the prep to cook, cooking, and delivery.

"I've now concluded that for solo business travel, this is as good as spot as any to dine downtown. The piped in music is vibrant and festive, the bar lively, and the staff's recommendations are just dead-on. I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  I recommend just letting the bartender suggest highlights from each category, as well as your per-course wine pairings. They are simply money! Fried chorizo stuffed olives started me off and next course was beets with goat cheese whip and pistachios-- delicious! But what totally took the cake was the WAGYU SIRLOIN TIP with fingerling potatoes, caramelized red onions and olive and bone marrow vinaigrette. This dish was highly recommended by the bartender. I very seldom eat red meat but I decided to take the plunge because of her enthusiasm. It was thankfully a lighter portion than it sounded and was, in a word, stupendous. Every bite had a delicious combination of acidity, marshmellowy and charred beef, briney-ness buttery-ness and sweetness. I believe it ranks up there as one of the single best combinations I have ever enjoyed on one plate. Kudos to the chef, who recommended a medium temperature, which I went with. I can see why she did and was so, so pleased with the result.  Definitely recommended!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Food takeaways were the duck and pork liver moose with stone ground mustard and cornichones. Totally GOOD! Even the toasted bread was good on its own. Gnocchi was really more potatoey in flavor than I am used to, but I liked it! Buttery goodness going on in that situation. And the kicker was the braised beef. Cant really ever go wrong with something like that, but this was extra special. Tasted like they used some five spice, or anise something. Kicked it up a few notches. There was NONE left. Carrot cake was good too, but the icing was a little bit too sugary....needs to be lighter, more whipped up. Overall, I really really enjoyed my meal here. Cant wait to return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We got there at about 4 PM, it didn't smell like old fish, were seated right away, and had the best service all night. We were tempted to order the other fish specials, since they only have 3 different fish (tilapia, trout and catfish) for the special, all served the same way (pan fried with baby reds and mixed veggies).  Started with clam chowder - DELISH! A bit too creamy but was deliciously fresh with lots of bits of clam. Salad was a bowl of mixed greens - nothing fancy but agreeably a great traditional salad. The trout. EXCELLENT quality! Fresh, tender, moist, a FULL FISH. yummmmmmmmm. What surprised me were the sweetened pecans on top - I normally don't like my fish like this but it was a pleasant surprise. I was just glad it wasn't all over the fish.

"Being at Alliance is like reading its reviews on here: a LOT of people preoccupied with cupcakes.....(get a life people)  The uptight ungracious tsk tsk attitude of the place is constantly annoying: if you want the relaxed atmosphere of a cafe and the chance to meet people occasionally, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU .....Apparently all these people who feign study and high concentration are way too easily distracted, so they must not be studying or doing anything they care passionately about.  If you talk in there, or answer your cell phone, not only do you get a lot of hostile looks, but there is always someone twerpy and backward enough to explain condescendingly that you should NOT talk on your cell phone in there: again: get a life people: its 2009, people talk on their cell phones EVERYwhere now, and if you develop your mind a little bit (say get past the preoccupation with cupcakes and goody-goody attitudes) it is easy enough to learn to concentrate no matter what is going on.

"I would give Tru 10 stars if I could :) That's how outstanding our experience at Tru was. I chose this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and was a little apprehensive as my husband is a vegetarian. But they assured me when I made reservations that they could make 9 courses all vegetarian. From the minute we gave our car to the valet till the end when we got our coats back - it was an amazing and the most luxurious evening. It's not just about the food or the ambience - it is truly an experience. I was warned that our whole dinner would take around 2.5 hours at least. As soon as we gave our car to the valet (who also wished us a Happy Anniversary) - we were walked to our table, and on our way we were wished at least by 5 different people a Happy Anniversary. The place has a dress code - it deserves a dress code :) We were a little intimidated at first, but after a few minutes we were put at ease. We were waited on by 5 people during dinner. We chose the 8 course vegetarian grand menu. I will not go into the details of all the courses, but let me say that the food was outstanding. It looked like art, and there were a couple of courses where my husband and me did not want to put our forks on the plate - because it was soo pretty! You always have 2 people working in sync : to bring out a course or to pour water or clear the table ware - it is like a synchronized and orchestrated show but without being too pompous and pretentious. The service was impeccable and the attention to detail was truly commendable. The servers were very knowledgeable about the food being put out in front of us and answered all our questions patiently. As for the food, let's say we ate the fluffiest of gnocchi, tastiest of potatoes and the earthiest of mushrooms. We tasted flavor profiles that we didn't know could be put together so well. It was an excellent menu and put together beautifully. Chef Martin is a genius. It was an amazing dinner, and was made special because of the impeccable service. It was a great choice for our anniversary date. I have never been to a Michelin-star restaurant, but Tru totally deserves it. What else can you say about a place that gives you personalized menus with your names printed on it to take home.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love this place, and i go here at least 3-4 times a month. Some meats are too salty, but i don't blame the resturant. The chef's hand probably slipped. This server who was moved to Miami's location used to serve me all the times. And i always tipped him $50. After that, i still kept tipping $50 to every server of mine. But not long ago i went there and it was only 2 of us. At the end, when the check came the guy had charged me a 15% service fee. That angered me. For a resturant going to high places such as this, they should train their eimployees well enough to understand respect. Yeah, service charger, for tabels above 6 people is understandable. But for 2, sad. I still left the guy extra $50. Maybe he'll learn something that way.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My Oldest daughter woke up yesterday morning asking me if we were going to meet the beautiful Indian Lady at the restaurant. I realized my daughter was asking me about the India House restaurant we went to last weekend, and the girl who greeted us and seated us at our table. Both my daughters were amazed by her Indian Costume and she was supernice talking to our daughters and answering their questions, so they now think we would go there every Saturday as they heard me telling the girl as she was seeing us off that we will be going back there for sure. This was our First experience to Indian Food as a family, even though my Husband had tried it several times before, and it was his strong recommendation that finally made us decide to introduce Indian Cuisine at India House to our kids. I agree he made a great choice. The Food was delicious, and our daughters loved the Nan bread and the Chicken dishes. The Service was excellent. We informed the girl who seated us about our kids and my first experience to Indian food, and she ensured us the Chef could make the food mild for us, still retaining the flavor. The waiters were very attentive and helped us out with great recommendations for first timers. My Husband went for the spicier dishes, and he was enjoying it. I tried some of his dishes and they were really good. I think I am now ready to try spicier Indian dishes, so we would love to go back soon. The kids enjoyed the Mango drink called lassi, and they also have a great choice of Wines for adults. The Indian Ice cream Kulfi was delicious too. Even the Valet Parking team was good, as they were ready with our Car when we came out of the restaurant, so we did not have to wait in the Cold Chicago Weather. The only thing I hope they had different is their lighting style. The ambience is great in dim light, but it makes it hard to read the Menus, especially for beginners who would like to read the description of the dishes. I wish they turn up the lights by a notch so we didn't have to squint looking at the menu. But I have seen this at a lot of other upscale restaurants too. I hope they all realize the guest perspective on this issue and would do the needful to make a change. Overall - Great place for a Great evening. Try it out and enjoy yourselves.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yay for my first Yelp review ever~! I had to just write a review for Simply It because it's simply amazing. I've been here at least ten times already ever since I discovered it last summer, and the food, service, and atmosphere has consistently been very good. Being away from home (VA), it makes me really miss Vietnamese food. Now, I know that Argyle is much closer to me, yet I still venture out to this place all the time despite the 7..8 minute walk from the El. Why? Not only is the food really good, but I was greeted with such warmness that it made me feel so homey. Cau Tuan, the owner is such a nice man. He treated me like I was part of his family and that's what I appreciate most. And his staff is very hospitable as well. The service is wonderful; very attentive and quick. I always get the Banh Xeo, Avocado Wontons as appetizers. I usually don't really like getting Banh Xeo at other restaurants, but their version is actually really good, and the portion is big too. Other good ones include the Seafood Eggrolls and Calamari Salad. I've tried a variety of their entrees. I like the Pineapple Calamari a lot along with the King Crab Pasta, and Seafood Noodles. Though they don't have a dessert menu, we are always given a small treat at the end of our meal whether it is rice cakes, fruit, or even fried banana! Also try the bubble tea! It's amazingly good!!The place is so good, that we keep coming back with friends. In fact, we're going tonight! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I really wanted to like this place based on what I've read, but it just didn't live up to the hype. The food was decent, the service horrendous. If you are looking for a better option, Ukrainian Village is full of them. I personally would settle for a small Lou Malnati's deep dish over this place any day, however, as I've stated in some of my other reviews, I really do recommend Picante, Smoke Daddy or even Janiks over on Damen/Division.  There's also a nice couple of Italian restaurants in the area as well. Overall, this place is worth checking out as we may have just gone on a bad day and ordered the wrong thing, but we just waited so long that if I had a choice between picking up a burrito and eating right away while watching football or sitting down and waiting for an hour and having to raise our voices over the ruckus from the kitchen, just to be heard, I would take the burrito.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"When my friend told me about a place that was known for its meat (and appropriately located in the meat-packing district), I had high expectations and The Publican more than met mine. The ambiance was nice and I loved the big chairs and tables and the eccentric pictures of pigs on the walls. Our server was extremely friendly and upfront about what was available for the night. He gave us great recommendations about beer and other drinks (I tried the hard cider). We ordered: - a round of oysters - they were so good! I had never tried raw oysters before in my life. These tasted really fresh and the flavors ranged from sweet to somewhat salty. - a cold plate - came with an assortment of prosciutto, sausages, and other sliced meats - a hot plate (my favorite) - rabbit sausage, beef tongue, pork confit and a few other things all tossed in a couscous You can find the exact descriptions on their website :) We also tried the dessert: - Rhubarb pie - excellent taste. Not too sweet, not too tart. - Waffle with blueberries Bottomline: if I'm ever in Chicago again, I will definitely go here. The food was tasty, the service was quick and the company was fantastic.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My name is Quoc-Viet Nguyen and im from Kansas City. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurant from Dallas, California, Missouri, Chicago etc. I believe Simply it has the best service and quality of food that a vietnamese restaurant ever had.I have been to Argyle, Little Saigon or Viettown in Chicago many times. I have been to Tank Noodle, Pho Viet, Pho 777, Pho 888, etc and the food their is alright. I am from UIC campus so its a long trip out there, but going to get Pho up their gave me my Pho kick when i was craving vietnamese food. At first i was skeptical because what vietnamese restaurant is in Lincoln Park and called Simply IT ? It was really strange to me, but some vietnamese guy i met at the apple store on Michigan avenue said it was better food than Viet town. So i went, and it exceeded my expectation. The PHo i have to admit was Home cooked quality, i actually left saying, Man that Pho was actually really good. Also the Fried Banana and icecream is to die for... Plus, The owner is extremely friendly and talks to all the customer. He clearly knows how to run a restaurant. I know this might sound to good to be true, but what do you have to lose. If you are in Chicago and want to try Vietnamese food or if your Craving Pho, i recommend you go to Simply It, I believe the best Vietnamese Food in Chicago.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Bongo Room was the first Chicago restaurant I ever patronized. I loved it! We had just arrived by train and were famished. We each ordered croissant breakfast sandwiches- my bf got the egg & bacon one and I got the veggie. The veggie was excellent, according to Jim the egg one was just OK. Then we decided we had to have round 2 because the pancake selection looked so intriguing. The waitress (very nice) let us know that we could order them individually, so we got one caramel white chocolate pancake and one slice of the ginger pineapple french toast. The pancake was good, but the french toast absolutely blew it out of the water. It was like...revolutionary. It came with a scoop of ginger ice cream.

My favorite is the spinach, green pepper and onion, but I usually chose my slice by pointing to the most fresh-out-of-the-oven-looking pizza (steaming and extra saucy).

"This is Chicago dining in full force. What do I mean by that? I mean an urban, design-oriented space, well-executed dishes and impeccable service. In Chicago sometimes the food is a bit too ""messed with"" for my palate, but generally creative, and served in very ""design-y"" spaces with excellent table service. Fluke tartare - flavorful fresh fish, transparent, well married flavors. Excellent. ""Game birds"" - squab breast w quail egg - don't remember the preparation very well, but I remember thinking ""how clever"" and ""how delicious"" in quick succession Deconstructed ceasar - tight bundles of romaine hearts in three neat stacks, one atop a ""brioche twinkie"" and all of them topped w a tiny little anchovy fillet. More clever than delicious, but still good, and will definitely elicit a chuckle Chicken noodle - was almost over a cold, so figured this would be perfect. It was. Chicken stock reduced till thick poured over small packets of flavor, such as a carrot ""marshmallow."" Delicious and clever. Sweetbread empanada - love me some empanadas, and these were no exception. Possibly the best dish of the night -- certainly the most beautiful. Plate once again peppered with little flavor packets that kept you guessing but never unhappy. Delightful. Hog cheek - the only dish that may have been a bit overdone. Flavors seemed too concentrated, too salty, and not in balance. The wine list showed immense creativity and broad knowledge. One of the most interesting lists I've read in a very long time. The beer selection is also deep and fascinating. Some dishes were paired with beer rather than wine (appropriately), which showed ingenuity and expertise. The one cocktail I had wasn't great, though the liquor list seemed well chosen. Service was unobtrusive and prompt. I could find no fault. Despite a few missteps, my overall experience was exceptional and memorable. I would recommend this place enthusiastically.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to this place at least 6 more times since my last review. Every time, there is always something that grosses me out. Despite i LOVE their pizza and beer, I just cant go back there anymore. Couple times I found some whitish slimy stuff floating in my water cup. Yuck! The worst thing about it is that I would notice it after drinking at least half of the water. When I told the waiter he didn't seem to care. Though, he did bring another glass of water after we paid our bill, tipped him and were on our way out.Then, once I have sat on a seat with some sticky brown liquid on it. Double Yuck! I was wearing shorts so the thing got stuck to my leg. I went to the bathroom to wash it off, but didn't complain this time since the complaints don't go anywhere anyway. But even then, I thought every place have their bad days and I still returned. I came here again (God knows why?). Ordered beer (as usual), pizza, and water. This time both mine and my husbands beer glasses had stamps of some pink lip-gloss on the edges. I don't wear lip gloss nor my husband. Don't they wash their glasses?

"THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!!! I've always wanted to visit Chicago for many reasons - but none bigger than to try their famous deep dish pizza. My friend and I made a trip there in June and tried out a couple of their famous pizza joints, and Giordano's was by far my absolutely FAVORITE. We ordered the stuffed crust mushroom and sausage pizza - I guess it wasn't actually legit deep dish pizza because the crust was fairly thin, but the way they piled on the mounds of toppings and cheese made it as deep as an actual deep dish pizza. The thin crust was stacked with a generous layer of the very flavorful sausage and fresh mushrooms, followed by the ooziest/yummiest/thickest layer of SOOOOO MUCH CHEESE, followed by another generous layer of toppings, and finally covered in a layer of marinara sauce. Honestly, I don't think I could eat a more delicious pizza in my life - and am (somewhat) seriously contemplating paying $60 to have some authentic Giordano's shipped to me... :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to Publican for their Brunch but this time I came for dinner with 4 of my gal friends .I'd say a party of 4 is the way to go at this place, so you can try a lot dishes but still recieve a fair portion per person. Everything is small plates and by small I do mean small, like tapas size or smaller. But expect a total Foodielicious experience! Here's what we ordered: The meats: -SPICY STEAK TARTARE was a delightful delicacy for rare meat lovers that we all raved about. Served with fresh veggie garnishes and a great flavor, I think this was one of my favorite standouts. -COUNTRY STYLE RIBS - we did the full order and this was a good comfort food dish, a better portion for a group of our size plus juicy and tender. -BOUDIN BLANC - at first glance, i was like, 'What! you get one tiny sausage to share between 5 people."" but once you experience this dish, your taste buds will go haywire!. I think this was one of my favorites - the meat was so tender and had a wonderful flavor! It makes my mouth water just thinking about it now! The fish: - BEAU SOLIEL, SPANISH MACKEREL, AND STRIPED BASS ok, I'm not afish lover and rarely eat fish, but i definitely ate this fish. It was so fresh, no fishiness and all the flavors of each dish generated ""ooo's and ahhhs"" from our group. -The Spanish Mackerel, though simple in presentatation, was very tasty - expect it to be on the salty salty side. -the Striped Bass was so memorable -served with cucumbers and almonds, this dish was my favorite fish dish. -The OYSTERS: A group of our size required the full order of 12, and it's worth it! Very fresh, I swear they must fly their oysters out to the midwest often!  The vegetables: - POREINI & KING MUSHROOMS: Definitely one of my favorite dishes. Our first reaction was ""what! this is all you get for $20!"" But again, once you taste the dish, you will know why you paid what you paid. The mint,balsamic and burrata just bursts with flavor in your mouth. We were all like ""wow"" and lip smacking =) . -ASPARAGUS - skip this dish, while it's good, it's nothing special and unique. -SUMMER SQUASH SALAD: While very fresh, it's not a good dish to split between 5 people - we each had like a piece of lettuce and a small veggie, so i can't comment on whehter it was special or not since i barely got a taste! DESSERT: -the waffle dish and an apple pie w/icecream dish - this really topped off the meal. Everything was really good. The Damage? With one drink per person, we each spent $75. Expect to spend a lot of dough in order to experience what this place has to offer, which is a heaven for your taste buds.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Girlfriends and I dined for a super early Sunday dinner. Our reservations were at 4:45pm because someone from our party had to catch a flight. This place is really small but in a very cute way. Clearly since our reservations were so early, we were the first to arrive for dinner. We were greeted promptly by our friendly waiter. This place has a prixe fix set five course meal. We stumbled in the day they were serving quail (too bad it wasn't foie gras). Our five course meal consisted of: Starter: Amuse First course: Salad of baby red oak with sablefish sashimi Second course: Charlmoula Lamb Third Course: Curried lobster bisque with tempura lobster Fourth Course: Stuffed quail Fifth Course: A tribute to bananas (medley) I substituted the lamb for a fish since I don't eat lamb. The presentation for each course was excellent! Everything had excellent flavor - just right. I can't remember what fish the chef used to substitute the lamb course but I wish I could because it was simply amazing! One of the best fish I've ever eaten in my life. It was my favorite of the five. I also enjoyed the lobster bisque very much. There was a bite after each sip but it was so good. My friends thought it to be a little too spicy for their taste. The quail actually looked a little scary but it was tasty. I'm not a big dessert fan but the girls loved it! Unfortunately I couldn't finish my dessert platter. What I loved most about this place was the service. The chef (both the pastry chef and food chef) came out after each course to check on us. The waiter never let our beverage glasses stay empty. The moment he took our utensils away, he would replace them immediately.  Both chefs greeted our tables numerous times and personally brought out the meal. It felt very ""homey"". I thought the prices were reasonable. The menu is set at $65.00 per person so depending on what you drink, you're looking about $85 a person after tax and gratuity. I highly recommend coming here on a date. It is very romantic.  It also feels a little fun and mysterious that they're an ""underground"" restaurant. Actual rating: 4.5","[0.0, 1.0]"

Our busboy came by 100 times as we still had food on the table asking, Are you done yet?Once we finished our food, they asked us 400 times if we wanted anything else AND to check to see if the bill was paid yet.They should change the name of this place to one of these two:Hurry Up, Eat and Get Out!orCan I take that for you?!!!!!Never go again.

"I went to this place on Friday because a friend recommended it and I had seen it on Check Please! several weeks ago. Boy was this a bad recommendation. First, I LOVE middle east food. I got the veg dinner and it was mediocre, at best. Second, some of the staff could not have been less helpful or downright rude. We waited fifteen minutes to pay for our food. The boss was someplace else and was the only one with access to the cash register. Finally one of the guys behind the counter started taking money and making change out of the tip jar!!! This place is in dire need of a worker's revolt. The management here is clearly incompetent. I will never go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I recently turned vegan, and was not sure if I could do it...but this place satisfies my every craving! They also have organic margaritas, beer, bloody mary's, & more alcoholic beverages. Everyone must try their delicious bakery items. My all time favorite menu item is the Titanic burger, but I recently attended their 29th anniversary party and had the Chikun pesto panini...looks like the Titanic may start sinking. My father, who hails from a cattle rancher/ industry family, recently tried some of the items...could not believe it was organic & vegan.

"It is sad to plan carefully your meals in Chicago--two lunches and two dinners out--and to be disappointed with inferior food. We were pleased with the ambiance at India House. The martinis were expensive, but really well done.  Then came the appetizers. Chicken samosas - dry. Veg pakora - dry and bland. The chutneys made me worry for our health. They were clearly used at another table and not cleaned up or replenished before being placed at our table. The tamarind and mango chutneys were less than half full, and the spoon handle for the tamarind was caked with the sauce.  The lamb curry had a delicious sauce but the meat itself was dry and undercooked. Cubed lamb in a curry dish should be moist and fork tender. It was borderline tough. The service was inconsistent. We had to ask the bus staff to get more drinks and the check because our main guy was stuck to a table of ten. When he was free, I could never catch his eye. Won't be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"4.5, really. I ate here a few weeks back, and I can still remember the big, bold flavors of my meal. I had the 2 course lunch here, and I chose the Arroz a la Cazuela (a type of Chilean soup), the Butifarra con Judias (house made sausages with truffled white beans) with the fries as a side, and my friend and I split the chocolate croquettes as a desert. The Arroz a la Cazuela was a solid dish. The saffron added a great aroma to the broth, and the flavor was subtle, but not hidden. I didn't care too much for the artichoke confit--the shrimp, chicken, and chorizo, when eaten with the aioli, blew that away. My second dish was essentially house made sausage with with truffled white beans. The white beans knocked my socks off. They were the best beans I had ever had. The accompanying fries were well cooked, the but the aioli wasn't too memorable. For desert, a friend and I split the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow. My friend loved the croquettes--she devoured hers so fast, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the marshmallows with caramel. Silky smooth with rich banana flavor . . . highly recommended. Don't let the olive oil turn you off of this desert--it adds a nice contrasting flavor to this dish. I will definitely visit Mercat when I'm in Chicago again . . . I can't seem about to forget those delicious truffled white beans . . . Oh, and I also had the seasonal sangria. If I'm not mistaken, it was ~$7 and well worth the price. You'd never think of putting basil in an alcoholic beverage, but damn, was it great.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been going here for at least 15 years. The food is authentic, consistent and excellent. There are only 2 negatives. Their service is what you'd expect from Korean establishments, not so great. They treat Korean adults (40+) differently than young adults, particularly favored towards men. When I go w/ my uncle and his family, we get many free refills on the banchan. When I go there with my friends, the free refills disappear and out comes a $1 charge per dish. Totally unfair, but true. 2nd negative is that the ventilation inside is very poor. I always leave w/ my clothes, skin and hair reaking of korean bbq. So, be prepared to be smelly afterwards.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is such a great place. They have delicious homemade pasta. I have been here twice and both times I got the veal meatballs. They were large and super tender. My family went crazy over their pumpkin ravioli, it is the best pumpkin ravioli I have ever tried. Their desserts were delicious as well, with a hazelnut (I think) panna cotta, as well as the tiramisu. But to top it off, and the reason they absolutely get 5 stars in my book, is that I just received a card in the mail from them. I had filled out my information on a card at the restaraunt last time I visited, and I just received a handwritten thank you note from the chef, along with a gift certificate to come back and use! I have never had a restaraunt do that unless it was my birthday, so I think this really shows how much they value their customers. I will absolutely be coming back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Old Szechuan is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago. Yes, it's in Chinatown and doesn't have the best decor, but it's authentic, reasonably priced, and delicious! I have been a loyal patron for 8 years and I keep coming back. This restaurant is recommended by a Chinese professor from the University of Chicago and my Chinese parents.Both the hot pot and the regular menu items are great. This is what we usually order:Chef's Special Sizzling Rice Ginger PorkGarlic SpinachDry chili chicken (Don't eat the chili peppers)Salt and Pepper SquidMaPo Tofu (Spicy!!)(I may not have gotten the names exactly right)The saltiness of the garlic spinach goes great with the Sizzling Rice dish. They also serve deep fried mantou - YUM!A note about how to line up at this restaurant. You need to go into the restaurant, get the attention of one of the servers to let him/her know how many are in your party, and get a ticket. It's a bit chaotic so I would suggest just having one from your party get the ticket, and then wait inside until they ask what number is next.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Still so full as I type this from dinner tonight. This was my second time at Geja's. The food is just oh so yummy! I really think I'll go in next time and just start with the chocolate fondue because it is definitely my fave!  The first time I went to Geja's, I wasn't too happy with the service. While the hostess was going to seat us, a waitress went up to her and said don't seat them in my section. I don't want another table. Ive been a waitress so I get having bad nights, but really? Right in front of me? Someone must have called her out after because she came to apologize but the damage was done. Good thing we didn't get sat with her. Our server, who was awesome, got a really good tip! Only reason Geja's is missing one star is for that rude server.Today was no problem. Typically, you need reservations to come in but we walked in and crossed our fingers. The hostess was very nice and said to give her 10 minutes so we went to the bar for a quick drink and we were promptly sat.Again, from start the finish the food is awesome. We had the Prince Geja's combination which is just that, a combination of everything. Can't go wrong with this!

"I've been here a few times and I really enjoyed it. They have tons of options to customize your pizza, ranging from your choice of sauces and toppings; they've got your standard sausage and pepperoni, but also a few different things like mashed potatoes, clams, artichoke hearts, meatballs, and bacon. I've had the plain sausage as well as sausage with fresh tomatoes (I'll be more adventurous one day, I swear). Both hit the spot just as I needed and they were VERY generous with the tomatoes - each slice would have a few sections of really thinly sliced tomatoes fanned over it. It was pretty tomato-y. In a good way, of course.  A bit of a warning though, you may want to let the pizza cool for a minute before you grab your first slice because it comes out ridiculously HOT. If you try to scarf it up the second after it lands on your table you may end up with permanent, sandpapery cat-tongue!  They also have karaoke on Thursdays and live band karaoke on Saturdays. It's pretty entertaining for as long as your own karaoke threshold may be.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went to Sabatino's last night with my husband and a friend that we haven't seen in years, who had never been. Of course it was fantastic. We love this old school Italian place. This and Buona Terra in Logan Square are probably my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. We started with strong cocktails. Yum. Minestrone soup came next, then salad. The soup was perfectly seasoned, filled to the brim with chunky vegetables, and was exactly the right temperature. The salad was simple, with a garlic dressing, and was perfectly chilled. A big warm loaf of Italian bread was accompanied by their signature cheesy bread. There's Parmesan cheese, butter and olive oil on the table, so you can select your favorite bread accoutrements. For entrees, I had the chicken meuniere -- sauteed chicken in a garlic, butter and wine sauce, with oil and garlic mostaccioli on the side. Our friend had the special fish -- skatewing sauteed in garlic and oil, with red sauce pasta, and my husband happily remained in his chicken parm rut with a side of spaghetti. The service was gracious, and the portions are huge and very reasonably priced. The tab, including drinks and tip, for the three of us was $75. Every table in the room was filled -- on a Tuesday night, natch. We skipped the baked alaska (personal favorite) prepared tableside and the rest of the dessert menu, but we did indulge our ears: there was a violinist and a guitarist working the room, singing Italian songs, so to speak. If you don't try this place once, you are making a HUGE mistake! P.S. It's exactly 24 hours later, and we are having our leftovers for dinner. Yippee!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Revolution Brewing... key word is...BREWING. The first beer I tried was the cask Workingman mild, I have always had a bit of an obsession for cask brewed beers; revolution is totally lost in this process. The beer smelled like warm pool water and the taste was a mix between water, water, and yeast... in short terrible. The iron fist pale ale was no more appetizing than drinking a skunked PBR. I gave them one more chance with the Bottoms Up Wit, it might have been ok with a wedge of orange, the aftertaste was similar to licking a quarter. Beer gets a negative 2 stars. If I ever go back I'll just stick with Fat Tire Revolution's redeeming quality is found in the kitchen, the smoked pulled pork burger was fantastic. Their pork was just the right mix of tang and sweet, on top of a medium rare slab of beef... it completely redeemed the place for my beer. If you get a burger ORDER THE POTATO SALAD!!!! The blue cheese potato salad was a perfect complement to the burger and was a great improvement on the old stand-by. Their Margherita Pizza was great, a safe move as a first timer.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"we went on Sat 5/29/10 as walk ins and had to wait over 1 hour to be seated. the best thing our group of 4 did was walk to Havana bar, literally the next block south on Clark and had our Mojitos there with a small appetizer. the server seemed like he was impatient with our order and would roll his eyes when we would ask to repeat a question b/c we were unclear about some things and even when we chose to not order dessert. the trio ceviche was definitely worth it. the icing on the cake for this awful rating was when my husband was eating the left overs the next day, he almost broke his tooth biting on a ROCK! seriously, it was a medium size pebble, and makes you wonder how it got there. so after all that is said and done, we can check Rick Bayless' restaurant off our Chicago to-do list, but probably would not go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Finally, went again yesterday to give them another try. It will be the last. First when we were seated, we were seated in the worst location. In the corner by the front door. There were multiple open seating and when asked about an alternative, the person seating us stated we have that one (pointing over to a great table in front of the windows), but he states I will have to clean it first and then paused without offering to do that. It was clear he was not planning on cleaning the table. We were then seated at the bad location, when we then spotted a cockroach crawling on the ledge right behind my head. I told one of the staff and she quickly took care of it without saying anything to us. We stayed at the table a bit longer, but already the night had been ruined. Then one of our guests stated that every time the front door opened his chair moved. That was it! We left the restaurant. I also noted that in the 15 minutes that all of this transpired, two tables had not been cleaned, likely the root of the cockroach infestation. Trust me, they have been reported.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I hate hate HATE doing this. I really do. A restaurant that magically turns every hot-dog, hamburger, and chicken into a vegan friendly meal couldn't possibly be bad. In fact, as a vegetarian of 10+ years, I was kind of expected to love it, wasn't I? I wish I could say that I'd found my safe haven from all meat-eaters, but instead I'd found a restaurant that specializes in fake meat. First I blamed this on the fact that I'd been so conditioned to skip over such items as a cheeseburger that I kind of skipped over the whole menu. Going back to revise it, I did settle on one of their soy, fake, imitation meats. I love tofu. Soy has always been a true friend to me, but I just could not get into it here. Even if I didn't have the best experience, I'm really happy this restaurant is popular and hope it continues doing well. I love it when people are surprised how good something tastes without meat.

"I don't understand why this place packs 'em in, especially on the weekends. Food is at best average with an unimaginative menu, and employees seem to treat most customers like they are a nuisance. What I do like is the outdoor cafe on Division St... it's very pet friendly and has big umbrellas to block the sun. For a better breakfast or brunch, I suggest jam around the corner on Damen.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Despite there not being any other patrons there (it was late on a Monday night), my friends and I still liked the atmosphere at LBB. Yes, Bronco is a little over-attentive, but we were up for it and generally enjoyed his attention and recommendations. The food was DELICIOUS - each of the four of us was stealing bites off each others' plates. We're looking forward to going back, especially during a busier night when they (appear to) have live music. Didn't give 5 stars only because, like many others said, if we didn't have a coupon it would have been far too expensive to return. If the entree prices went down about $5 each it would be 5-stars, hands-down.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Wowzer....this place is fantastic!!First, I must say that the ambiance of the place is spectacular. We went on a Wednesday night and had a fantastic time. The space is warm, inviting, and comfortable. The service is unlike many other restaurants in the city. They are very attentive-from managers, to servers, to bussers-all stopping by to make sure all was taken care of. Our server, Jonathon, was fantastic and made our experience both satisfying and fun. He was very knowledgeable and helped guide us to the perfect wine and meal-all with a bit of wit and charm!The hush puppies were amazing!! I'm still thinking about them. We split the Comp St Louis and the pork and had never had better tasting meat-incredibly tender, flavorful, and juicy. The bbq is good but honestly, it's not really needed.We will be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"OK...for years, I've been walking past Sun Wah and been saying ""I've hit every restaurant on Argyle, but never sun Wah...never the one with the ducks hanging in the window."" Well, it was about time I ventured into the infamous hanging duck place. So you ask why I thought those ducks were so intriguing, well, its simple; I love duck!  There I was, walking down Argyle with a friend,deciding whether to go to Pho 777, 888, 999, Tank, Haye Yen, etc etc. and the decision was made...Sun Wah. It was definateley not what I thought. I actually expected it to be a lot nicer in there than it was. When you first walk in, you are in a little vestebule area where the cashier counter is with some odd snacks and a menu on the wall. At first I thought that was the place, but then the friendly server showed us the rest of the restaurant. Not much to look at, sort of seemd like they threw a few tables around a room and forgot to put away the shipping crates, but I was there to try the BBQ.  I scanned the menu for a good couple of minutes trying to decide what sounded best. Since the doc shared the news that I am a border line diabetic, I've cut out the carbs so I look for dishes that are mostly proteins and veggies. Not a problem at Sun Wah. I ordered the three meat plate that is basically enough for two and only cost about 5 bucks. It had bit of chicken, duck and BBQ pork. I couldn't get enought of that pork...all sweet and BBQy...it was amazing. The chicken and duck were flavorfull and moist and everything laid upon a bed of this sweet soy sauce. The only issue I had with the chicken and duck was that it was cut is small pieces through the bone, so you had to really pick a lot and ended up with this gross pile of unedible chicken parts. :( After spooning on a bit of the soy/fish (whatever) sauce with the jalepenos in it that was on the table, my meal was boosted up another notch.  All said and done, I think my friend and I tabbed out at about 14 bucks total for the 2 of us to order 2 large dishes, a beer and some some tea. You can't beat that with a bat! The staff was helpful and friendly, the food was great and the prices were rock bottom low. Love it!!! I'll be back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I really don't know what others see in this place. My pasta was not edible and the server cared less. The red pepper flakes were so overpowering the broccoli and shrimp got totally lost.

"Had dinner here on Friday night to celebrate the aging of JN. The place was obscenely busy. Like, the waiting area was swarming with groups of people and I had to run away to catch my breath while waiting for our table. So, make reservations and definitely go elsewhere if you want a quiet dinner. This place is enormous, colorful and seemed filled with large birthday groups. Anyway, our server was great and the food was pretty good (and they make one tasty mojito). To start, we split the arepa, ropa vieja, and the salad special. The arepa was a big hit with J but I felt the pork was a little fatty. The rope vieja was all sorts of awesome though. Braised beef and plaintains? Yes yes yes! My favorite of the evening was the special salad - local greens (it was this thick purple spinach that I've never seen before and have been obsessing over ever since), marcona almonds, local cheddar, onions, Michigan apple and a chili serrano vinaigrette. Swoon! We should have stopped there but also had the pernil and arrachera (Maria's fault!). The pork shoulder was very sweet. The arrachera was beefy goodness and honestly, you can put chimichurri over anything and I will swallow it whole. Dessert was a little disappointing. We ordered the churros and they were really crunchy, like, a good baguette almost gum-cutting crunchy. Luckily, our server brought J out a little birthday treat - a sticky toffee cake topped with pineapple sticks. Quite tasty. So why only 3 stars? This type of restaurant just really isn't my scene. When I want ethnic food of any kind (Mexican, Vietnamese, Japanese, Cuban, etc etc) I am much happier when I eat in a small, no frills, family run place - they are my happy place. Swanky lighting and bright wallpaper always seems to detract from my experience. Of course, if J wanted to come back for a special occasion, I would too and eat a bunch of beef and pray that they have those purple spinach leaves again.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Dear. Mr. Pequod - One of my favorite places to go in the neighborhood over the last 5 years. But why skimp on your toppings lately? I love the outside caramelized part of your crust, but lately the crust seems to have grown while the toppings have slowly disappeared. Splash a little extra cheese on there for me. Give me a few more pieces of sausage, so my wife doesn't eat them all directly out of the pan. I will visit you more often if you do. I will come back and give you the stars you deserve. I promise.

"Meh. For the hype and the price this was a let down. I got the scallops for an app. They were raw, not a lot flavor. I got the steak for an entree. It was RAW and chewy. Not good.

"This places rocks!!!!! I've been excited about it since before they opened. It took the place of the tragically poor Calvin's BBQ. Now that they have table service and the best patio in the near west side. They are truly one of my favorite places in the city, let alone the hood. The empinadas are awesome, the bisteak, guarito and lechon sandwiches are all killer. the steak dinner is great as well, the mariquitas are covered in a pungent garlic sauce that is very addictive. their house hot sauce is very good and they offer habenero sauce for those of us with true chili pepper addictions.

"The Third Coast is home for me and my friends. We have met here so many times. I think we usually say we are meeting for coffee, but we always have a meal.  The coffee is good. The roasted carrot soup is fantastic!  The breakfasts are excellent. Some people are saying the prices are high, but to me, they seem as low as you are going to find in a regular restaurant. Most of the meals are in the $10 to $15 range and well worth it. I have been here so many times, I cannot imagine not having this place to go to. It is our automatic go-to spot. It is good for adults. I would not recommend it for people with kids. It is not that kind of place. It is good for meeting and talking or going by yourself and thinking or something.  To me, it is just a perfect place all -around. Great music, great vibes, nice tables, an ever-changing display of real art on the walls. One thing? They used to have a good guitarist-singer who would come in one night a week. They should bring back live music. It was fun to fall in after a night out and have a glass of wine and listen to some live music.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Truly the most amazing experience I have ever had at a restaurant. It was also one of the most expensive meals I have ever had, but well worth it.The combination of ingredients used in the many dishes are unique and creative and often sound like they would not fit together, but are complete taste sensations. The various wares they use to serve the courses are mini works of art and not like anything I have ever seen.As long as you are willing to spend the money don't skimp by not doing the wine pairings. It does add to the already exorbitant price of the meal, but the wine pairings truly compliment each dish. I have been to many fine French restaurants, but none of the wines in those restaurants complimented the dishes as well as what I experienced at Alinea.This is an experience worth having!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Their Korean food is really good and you will always leave feeling full. There really is something for everyone (even the less adventuresome). If you are looking for fancy, shmancy, Americanized Korean food then this is NOT the place for you. However, if you're looking for the real thing then come here. Nothing fancy. Just good food. Now my reason for 3 stars...the service is pretty terrible, be prepared for typically unfriendly waitstaff who don't like fielding questions from unneducated diners. You get what you get. Also you're better off walking than parking (their lot is impossible) and the 'Sushi' side of their restaurant is less than stellar. Stick with the Korean side and you're golden!

"Awesome restaurant, though the lack of room is keeping it from a full 5 star rating. The place has a great vibe, nice lighting and pretty yet simple decor. But there isn't quite that much seating, so when it gets busy, you get pretty cramped--we were literally separated by 3 inches of space between each 2 person table. The waitstaff was really attentive and did a great job. We even got complimentary lemonade on the house! Though it's not really necessary when you've got the no fee BYOB policy--a nice touch. The food was really good, especially the pho. Since visiting Vietnam, I have been searching for a place to satisfy my pho cravings, and Simply It did a fantastic job. It's a HUGE bowl of pho, that I could hardly make a dent in after our 2 appetizers, but so delicious. I will definitely be back for some more.I love pho!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is the place to get amazing Korean BBQ. I love the fact that this place is also open til 4am. You never know when I am going to get a craving for Korean. And normally it's all the time. The first time I came here was with my sister a long time ago around midnight. Since then, I have been here possibly 20x plus. I love the 20+ banchan dishes you get. I always order Kalbi and the hubs like the dak galbi. I think the best part of Korean BBQ is the grilling over the charcoal. The smells wafting throughout the restaurant are just irresistible. The food is always consistently amazing. The meat is fresh and perfectly marinated. I have a huge appetite and when it's Korean BBQ, I somehow have a bottomless stomach. I can eat and eat and eat some more. The service is good and that is surprising in itself. Most of the time, the Korean ladies are rude and short, but it's part of their charm. This is my comfort food restaurant. I immediately feel better after that first bite. And again, the fact that they are open til 4am is key. Nothing like late night BBQ.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was born and raised in the South so entres such as: ""Shrimp and grits"" or ""Biscuits and gravy "" sets my heart a flutter. Needless to say, I am a poor unemployed graduate student and the prices have kept me from venturing over. Having a dinner date last night with some girlfriends gave me the perfect excuse to spend some money that I don't have. First and foremost, the ambiance is A+. Posh indeed. When you first arrive you are blocked off from the diners by a heavy velvet curtain. Only until the hostess has confirmed your reservation are you allowed past the veil. Secondly, the service....A+. Very hospitable and knowledgeable. Answered all of our questions about drinks, entres and deserts. The food....here is where I seem to differ from the loyal following of Yelpers who have reviewed Big Jones. I admit that as someone with no money who is hesitant to part with it, my opinion on what makes a good eatery is a bit skewed (Cheap, big portions and consistent quality) from other populations. The prices were just a little bit too overpriced I felt for the quality and size of portions. I ordered the Pork Shoulder (one of the cheaper items on the menu at under $20.00) and while the pork was DELICIOUS, there was not enough ( I would have priced this entree for no more than $10.00, anything more than that would be pushing it). Same with the desserts. Yummy but small. My girlfriends all had ONE alcoholic beverage ($10-12 a pop) and their bills were around $60.00. So, yes the ambiance, the service and the food is good...I still don't find that the small portions makes it worth the price. Maybe, in a couple years when I hopefully have some extra money, I will think differently. Maybe for a special occasion (or someone else is paying) but until then, I wont be returning.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I grew up here! My cousin and I would make frequent runs, dodging cars like playing a game of Frogger at N Milwaukee Ave & W Hermione St (our Grandmother lived right on W Hermione St). My Grandmother has passed since and the house was sold, but that does not stop me from driving all the way from Romeoville to Milwaukee & Devon!!! There is NO other hot dog place that can top Superdawg... EVER! Their shakes and malts are to die for. The pickled tomato is just like a cherry on top of a sundae. Of course, I've had everything on the menu at one point or another and everything is just awesome. My favorite part is the old fashion drive-in where you park, order from your menu board, then they come to your car with your food and hook the tray to your window. The staff is just awesome, the food is great, the atmosphere is to die for, and they even sell souvenirs! If you've never been and live within an hour radius.... GO! It is a 1-3 a year treat for our family of 6.

"Who knew there could be such an authentic taste of Columbia on Chicago's North Lincoln Avenue? Las Tablas offers an array of tasty entrees highlighted by the signature dish ""Matrimonio,"" which celebrates the marital bliss of tender steak and seasoned chicken. Several seafood options can also be found on the menu. Many feature South American style shrimp. Each entree is easily sufficient for one person with tasty Columbian favorites yuca and plantains alongside. But for a group of four, sharing three of the main courses should leave everyone satisfied. The tables outside the restaurant make for an enjoyable evening during the summer, yet they aren't necessarily large enough to hold everyone's small plates along with the entrees. Service appears to be acceptable. Although in our group there was a forgotten salad which finally arrived after the entrees. Also when it was time to pay, the waiter suspiciously disappeared. But overall Las Tablas is certainly a nice find in South Lakeview. It's BYOB and the meal is reasonably priced. Ole!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I still don't get it. After an intentional hiatus of several years, I came back here yesterday to visit with some old friends whom I don't see very often. That was the only factor which made the long wait tolerable. We checked in at 10:50 and were seated at 11:35. At the time that we were about to be seated, I heard them quoting newcomers 60 to 90 minutes. The hype machine rolls on, I guess. I don't understand why people make this a destination. There are so many other options nearby, not to mention other neighborhoods. My breakfast was bad. Not ""just okay"" but bad. For some reason my dish came out about five minutes after the rest of the table's, so I'm not sure what was going on back there. I ordered the rock shrimp benedict and asked for the remoulade hollandaise on the side after seeing benedicts going to other tables drenched in sauce. The sauce turned out to be fine and in fact I also used it on my breakfast potatoes. But the benedict was awful. The english muffins were limp and chewy and the shrimp were tough and rubbery. Also, the dish was nearly tasteless. A sparing application of the hollandaise added some flavor, but when your main ingredients cannot stand on their own without a dousing of sauce, you have a problem. I do have to say that the single lemon ricotta & sour cherry pancake that I ordered for ""dessert"" was damn good. Way too sweet, but damn good. The service was adequate but lacked personality. Some of us enjoy a little happiness with their weekend brunch, you know? In the attic of my mind, this place seems like a relic of the early aughts. I associate it with a time in my life before I knew anything about decent restaurants, in the pre-pre-Yelp era, and in the years before a plethora of spots sprung up to accommodate this town's brunch obsession. Now, there are so many better options, all with shorter waits. When I dated a girl who was a brunch nut but only knew a few places, and later when I had friends who lived nearby for a couple of years, I would shrug and find myself tagging along to the Bongo Room. But now that I know better and usually control my own brunch destiny, there is no reason to come here and suffer long waits for mediocre food. Except to catch up with some good friends. For that I would be willing to go anywhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

So, we only ended up having to wait about 10-15 minutes.  After getting seated in the back room- which was INCREDIBLY loud we got water and chips & salsa right away.

"This is truly a mixed review. I was so stoked to come here for lunch because of all the hype and because I love duck so much. Christopher was sweet enough to take me even though he does not eat duck. When I saw the extensive menu I thought it would be a piece of cake to find some good food for Chris. He opted for hot and sour soup and the sweet and sour pork. Both were dreadful. The soup was neither hot nor sour and so full of egg it was more like egg drop soup disguised as hot and sour. We tried to doctor it up with the abundant condiments on the table, but it really didn't help. The sweet and sour pork had a standard sauce, but the pork was extremely tough. I, on the other hand, opted for variations on duck. I had the combo over rice. It was good, and portions here are certainly ample. I also had the duck and shrimp dumpling noodle soup. I enjoyed that as well and we took home enough food to feed a small army. I am still going to try and doctor up the hot and sour soup, just cuz I am perverse like that. I want to come back and try the Peking Duck, but will have to find a dinner companion because Christoper will not be making a return appearance.","[0.0, 1.0]"

After going through some difficulty in locating someone to make payment to due to our waitresses' neglect, I was talked back to by our waitress who continuously rolled her eyes at me as well. In addition, she charged our credit cards the wrong amounts and the manager told me he ""had 6 things going on and no time to hear what I had to say"".

I tried it simply because it was advertised as being made in collaboration with Sage Francis.The biggest insult on the veggie burger was the fact that my caramelized onions were ice cold!! I took a bite and could understand why something was that cold in the burger. Turns out it was the caramelized onions, i was disgusted. Do they just make a whole batch, refrigerate it and add it to burgers? If you're not going to make it to order at least have the decency to heat them up.I tried the truffle oil fries, they were ok, I don't know what truffle oil is supposed to taste like but I don't even know if I tasted anything other than regular fries.My iced tea, I had to send it back, it was barely yellow and the only flavor was the lemon i squeezed in it.Service was ok to say the least, after sending back the iced tea i settled for water which was only filled once after our waitress brought the check.I would not recommend Bad Apple, if you want good burgers go to Kuma's and if you want good Veggie burgers with actual caramelized onions go to Earwax. The menu looks sexy and interesting but it is an epic fail.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I ordered the thin crust last night, while the toppings (Sausage and Mushroom) were delicious, i wasn't overly impressed. The outter pieces were must better than the inner ones as the crust wasn't even substantial enough to stay together-it fell apart quite easily.

"This restaurant is amazing! If you truly love red meat and haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you've got to try one. Positive: The filet mignon is to die for! And then the filet mignon wrapped in bacon was even better! The service is outstanding. The guys (gauchos) serving the charred and seasoned meat have cuts ranging from medium rare to well done. If the cut of meat you want isn't available on that skewer, they'll get it for you. If you want your steak (on the stick) cooked longer, just ask! The chicken was surprisingly great too. They have 15 different cuts of meat. The ribs are OK. The pork and lamb are above average. The top and bottom sirloin is tasty. The pichanha (steak) is very good, but the filet is where it's at! The cheese rolls that come with dinner are very good.Negative: It's pricey. $48.50 for dinner. Granted, it's all you can eat and that's how much Brazilian steakhouses usually charge, but it's still pricey. The salad bar, while VERY fresh didn't have a very large array of choices. I understand that the meat is why you go there, so overall, it's fine. The parmesan covered pork has way too much cheese on it. There's no seafood. I hear some of Fogo De Chao's competitors serve shrimp. That would've been a nice touch. The fried bananas, polenta and mashed potatoes are good, but not really the point of going here.A couple of tips:1. This is all you can eat, very tasty meat so prepare for your visit. You may not want to eat too much earlier in the day if you are having dinner there. I saw people looking very sleepy and others, well, they looked like they didn't feel well. It's not Fogo De Chao's fault. You've got to have stomach room.2. While the salad bar is nice, do you want to pay $48.50 for fresh salad? Save your stomach room for the meat show! 3. Please pace yourself. Your stomach will thank you. They give you a coaster-looking object that is green (please bring me meat now) on one side and red (I'm taking a break) on the other. I recommend not having more than two or three meats maximum on your plate at one time. They'll get cold if you exceed that limit.4. Experiment a little. Don't order lamb much? Try it here. Usually like your meat medium well, try different cuts at medium and you may like them better. Since it's all you can eat and you can just get smaller cuts on your plate, you can afford to experiment and have fun!5. While I've heard they have a great mojito-type drink, beyond having that, you may want to limit your drinking. You'll already probably be sleepy from eating all of that meat plus now you want to add lots of alcohol? Hmmm. It's up to you.6. Allow plenty of time. At least two hours minimum. You don't want to rush through all of the delightful food and sights. We were there for almost three hours and had a ball.7. You may not want to bring anyone who doesn't really like meat. Besides vegetarians, even people who aren't big on red meat will probably be frustrated.8. Live a little! While this place is expensive, if you love meat, find a special occasion and get over there at least once. You'll have a great time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Best sushi in Chicago! Everytime I dine at SUNDA the customer service blows me away, but last week in particular really blew me out of the water. I had called earlier in the afternoon around 1PM, hoping to make a reservation for two in the dining room, unfortunately the dining room was fully commited so the hostess reserved us a spot in the lounge. I know reservations are hard to come by, expecially on a Friday night, so I was ecstatic to have a seat regardless. Much to my excitment later in the evening received a phone call from Carla, one of the hostesses who informed me that she was able to find me a seat in the dining room because of a cancellation. She couldnt have been friendlier on the phone and when I arrived treated me as though I was the only one in the restraunt. Once seated we had the pleasure of having Rachel wait on us. She was very knowledgable of all the dishes, super friendly, and fun- she made our dining experience one to remember! All in all the food, ambience, and service that SUNDA provided was impeccable- I highly reccomend this restraunt and will definately be a retunring customer.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Be prepared to wait in long lines outside anytime on the weekends, and sometimes during peak lunch hours during the week, but it's well worth it.

"Came with a group of 4 on Saturday night, the last night of Restaurant Week. It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it did NOT disappoint.With a friend I shared an appetizer of spicy lentils, a meal of meat messob and a dessert of sambussa turnovers in raspberry sauce. The meal was INCREDIBLE. Combined with the great prices, this was a five star experience.The lentil dish was amazing; spicy with strips of pepper and perfectly delicious when scooped up with the spongy bread that is offered with every meal. The best part about being able to eat with one's hands is that it completely removes any taste of silverware that, though subtle, might interfere with such delicate and layered flavors. As an appetizer for two, it could have easily fed three or four. The lentils were incredibly filling and though delicious I had to hold off on finishing my half so I would have room for dinner!The meat messob was wonderful. We were thrilled to find each different dish a new experience. For those who haven't had Ethiopian before, if you like Indian food, especially heavily spiced curries, you will definitely go for this! The meats were incredibly tender, spiced to perfection, some hot and some mild (I like it hot!). The lamb dishes were my favorite, full of spice but not so overpowering that the meat's own flavor didn't come though. Some dishes have bones in them which may startle the less adventurous diner. Never fear! The meat is so succulent and tender it pulls right off the bone. One of our dishes was served with a smattering of some sweet cheese next to a marinated hard boiled egg, it was the perfect compliment to the meat offered, light and tasty on the tongue. When dessert came I expected the almond and walnut sambussa to be a bit like baklava but it was very unlike anything I'd ever had before; sweet and flaky and a little savory which is a plus for me in any dessert. Combined with the sweetness of whipped cream and the tartness of raspberry sauce this was the perfect capper to a spicy meal.However, my very favorite item on this menu was, believe it or not, the coffee!! Hot, strong Ethiopian coffee served in a clay pot. WOW! From someone who can never have their coffee strong or rich enough this is high praise! It's served up black with a saucer of sugar on the side. All of my friends spooned sugar into their cups and enjoyed the taste immensely but for me the pure flavor of this good strong coffee was absolute heaven. We had coffee with our appetizers but it would be just as lovely to accompany dessert.For anyone who's ever had a hankering for Ethiopian food, or in the mood to try something really exotic, Demera is a winner!Good food, good service (our water glasses were never empty and we were checked back on just frequently enough to make us feel well cared for), and great prices for such an extraordinary experience!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What a gem! I love this restaurant. So boyfriend and I were in the mood for Tango Sur but we didn't feel like waiting for one to two hours for dinner so we decided to try Las Tablas and it was love at first bite! :) The Entrada steak is great! With chimmychuri sauce on the side, it is a little taste of heaven and it was only $19. The steak came with plantains, yuca, and potatoes. The portions are huge and we had a lot to feast on the next day! (Not the best meal if you are on a low carb diet... and they don't have any subsitutions for the sides... but oh well!) We ordered the Empanadas as an appetizer. I normally don't eat fried food, but I would have to say they were quite delicious. My boyfriend was not thrilled, too greasy for his liking. I would totally go back to this place. Great service, great food, great ambiance! What's not to love!? Also, the fruity alcohol drinks are so fresh and yummy and suprisingly strong. I had the sangria (SOOOOOO GOOD!), the mango motio, and a strawberry martini. Great urban oasis! I felt like I was a resort for a few hours... not in Chicago. I want to go back .... now.... so good!

"I have been coming to this place since it first opened, I thought it was just what the neighborhood needed and I liked talking to the owner. I recently went on vacation and upon my return I went to have dinner. OMG, I never expected to see the menu has changed completely. I can understand if you add new items to the menu or even put specials as an addition, but what I found was another restaurants menu in it's entirely. I cannot believe Albert (the owner) has to stoop this low as to take upon someone's menu . I talked to the owner and he told me that he hired a new cook. Albert, word of advice; stick to what you do best stop trying to copy what other people are doing, you had a real diamond, you used to be unique, now you are just another Cuban restaurant trying to be like all of the others. You have the veterans Bolero and Cafe Laguardia at your door step which are very similar. That is why I would go to you, now you are just like them but smaller, I will not be going back to you any time soon. VT","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you crave thin crust pizza from Rome, then this place will provide you with a quick fix. That's about it. We got there about 45 minutes before closing on a weekday night and were seated inside, in the room just west of the entrance. The place was spacious, but they sat us in the corner, next to two other couples. After the couples finished their dinner and left, the staff started breaking down the outside patio seating and bringing it inside. The door was kept ajar, so the cool restaurant air left the room. The place got warm and the ceiling fan didn't help. I felt like I was being rushed. How can you eat and drink when staff members are moving tables and stacking chairs right in front of you?  We ate our pizza and gulped down our wine. The dessert menu came. We decided to pass. In summary, if you want a place to relax and spread out, this is not the place. If there are open tables, the staff will not spread you out -- it will seat you next to other people. Why would I want to feel cramped?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Best hot dogs ever. No real comparison at this point and I'm not really a hot dog person. The menu changes consistently and is posted on the wall (by the time you get to the menu everything looks good), the options keep you interested even if you've been to Hot Doug's before. The duck fat fries weren't bad, but for me, they underwhelmed. That being said, the hot dogs more than made up for the fries. As most everyone else has already pointed out, Doug works the counter and is friendly as can be. Doug's got a great sense of humor, quirky, down-to earth and will offer suggestions based on whatever info you give him (though you really can't go wrong). Best hot dogs, ever.The only downside is the wait and that it's crowded. We waited for around an hour and a half, which for some is ridiculous for any food, let alone hot dogs. For us, we'll be back, probably with a good book to read in line and we'll probably order more than one dog per person next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What a shame.1. Salad was absolutely drowned in dressing. The greens were floating in dressing. Also, the greens were nothing spectacular: generic salad mix.2. The cheese fondue is like Gruyere nacho cheese. By the time we were finished it was congealing on the sides of the pot. It is awfully thick, and seems as though it must have been prepared hours earlier and sat in a pot waiting. The cheese, if it truly is Gruyere, is obviously low quality. By the end I was eating plain pretzel bread (pretty good) to try to get the taste out of my mouth. 3. Chocolate was fine. The pound cake was pretty burnt.We skipped any sort of meat, noting that they advertised grain-fed USDA Choice beef, as if that were something to be proud of. In an age when many restaurants are offering grass-fed options beef (and even charging extra for it), bragging about grain-fed seems very dated. For over $40/person and not huge serving sizes of meat, I would think they wouldn't brag unless it were USDA Prime. I suppose it wouldn't really bother me if they had just said beef tenderloin without all of the extra features.Everything is just behind the times and seems careless. Each course comes out in only a couple minutes after ordering, indicating that most likely almost nothing is made to order. None of the ingredients seem high quality. $40-$50/person would be much better spent at countless fantastic Chicago restaurants.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I usually do not write reviews because everyone has their own unique experience but my experience with Brazzaz the other night brought one on. It was on a friday and it wasnt too busy which was good. General decor and ambience was not all that impressive. We were seated and immidiately 3 people came up and began pooring water, taking drink orders and so forth. One of the men pouring our water, i thought was one of the bus boys, but he turned out to be our waiter. We asked for menus and they told us they dont have menus. So we asked what the options were and the cost. Our WAITER: ""ummm what is today, friday.......well the meat meal is 39.50 and if you only want the salad bar its between 25 and 30 bucks. So our waiter wasnt even sure??? Meal then went fine, food was average to above average but I must admit the salad bar is very good. Lots of options and unique dishes. And now the disaster. We got our check and we were charged for 3 ""meat"" dinners at 48.50 a plate. We only had 2 meat dinners and 1 salad bar for the 3 of us. So our waiter came and gave us a little trouble because he thought we all got the meat. So he went and changed 1 meal to the salad bar at 29.50 but left the other two dinners at 48.50 which HE TOLD US was 39.50, and would not change it because he said he made the mistake, whatever sense that makes. So we go to the front to speak to the manager and after explaining he had a smirk on his face and said ""im sorry, our waiter made a mistake and told you the wrong price of our meals.. Its 34.50 mon thru thur and 48.50 fri and sat. He explained there is nothing he can do and we must pay the 50 bucks a plate even though we were told 40 and the waiter made a mistake. He said the money would come out of his pocket if he changed it and was unwilling to do so. WOW, for a resteraunt that gets the attention this one gets i have never experience a more unsatisfactory experience. Needless to say that waiters tip instantly got included in the bill, NO SOUP FOR YOU. So my overall opinion would be this, with the options available in Chicago for brazilian steak houses and visiting almost all of them myself, i WILL NEVER go back to Brazzaz. Fogo de chao hands down has better food (meat). The service blew Brazzaz out of the water and the overall ambience and environment is much better. There is nothing worth anything close to $50 a plate at brazzaz. I will say the salad bar is good, if thats all you looking for. Fogo de Chao is def the best brazilian steakhouse in the city. Never again Brazzaz.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"F*ck the pedantic pretentious pageantry of so called ""fine dining."" F*ck using the ""right fork"" and choosing the ""right wine"" and getting all dressed up like the Queen of England when you're just Bob from accounting the next morning. And f*ck you for making me put on a jacket. I get enough of that at work.  At Schwa, you're eating a mind-blowing meal cooked by hard working, bad motherf*ckers. It's upscale for the proletariat. It's food on par with Alinea in every way that actually matters. If you're reading this you likely already know that it has some quirks. These quirks don't exist to attack your lofty sense of self importance; they exist because Michael Carlson operates his business the way he needs to in order to deliver the best food he possibly can to your table. Made a reservation on the first call. Kiss my bitter Greek ass. The gorgeous, amazing girlfriend and I are both vegetarians, and chef didn't blink about it. We had no idea in advance what we were eating, as is always the case with prix fixe veg outside of seasonal vegetable menus from Trotter's, Avenues, etc... Accordingly, we brought a bottle of Martinelli Pinot, an Argentine Chardonnay, a bottle of Alsatian sparkles, and a second similar sparkler for the kitchen. We opened it all and paired as we went. Super duper rad. Apparently the best pairing for any meal is to have your favorite bottles open all night and to take whiskey shots with the kitchen. Hell yes. We poured a glass of the Martinelli for Chef and he called it ""barn-yard-y."" In a good way. Brilliant. Next time I'll bring wine for the adjacent tables as well.  The food was beyond rad and made us giggle like Dick Cheney eating a baby. There was foam and other molecular fun, but the focus was on flavor above everything else.

"I've been here twice and tried maybe 4 or 5 of their beers. A couple are great, and a couple are sadface. Overall I find them to be weak, some to the point of being downright watery (not in terms of alcohol content per se, but in terms of flavor).  The Bottom Up Wit is really disappointing. It's supposed to be a Belgian-style wheat, but it tastes like watered down lemonade and looks like piss. Way too much citrus, not enough BEER. Everybody's trying to be Blue Moon, and say what you will about popular mass-produced conglomerate beers, but at least Coors actually makes an enjoyable product in Blue Moon.  The Working Woman Brown Ale is utter crap. It tastes like weak funky water. As a working woman, I'm insulted. And shame on you, waitress, for recommending this abomination! HOWEVER, the Anti-Hero IPA and the Eugene Porter are both really good. The IPA doesn't actually taste like an IPA, more like a regular pale ale, but whatever's clever, it's good. The Porter is nice and smooth and has great chocolate/coffee tones.  It's a fun space, although they need to turn down the lighting earlier. I went for a first date at 9pm and it was still bright as shit in there. Hello, do a girl a solid and bathe me in flaw-minimizing glow, not raw honesty! They finally dimmed the lights at like 9:45. Just be aware, this place is lousy with hipsters and young families (!). Doesn't really bother me, but if you're looking for a gritty post-Soviet working man's bar, this isn't it (despite the theme of the bar and and the names of their beers). I haven't had much food here, but I did try a bit of the polenta fries, and they were pretty good (don't know why they're calling them fries, since they're like the shape of fish sticks, but still, good). The tomato aioli is great.  I suppose I really feel more like a 2.5 about this place, but I would come back, so I guess 3 for now.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"But he has nothing on!The Emperor has no clothes, folks. My crap review is going to do nothing to dilute the totals for Mr. Doug Sohn. He is clearly a true mensch, and deserves the Encased Meats Medal of Honor if there were one. He works his butt off and for that I respect him. But there are a few things worth noting:Love for HD is 50% tourists. He's listed in all the guides so tourists make the pilgrimage. This means dauntingly long lines. Hours plus. Just to get a freaking hot dog. Any other decent business owner would just hire more people. Increase capacity. We're not talking about product that cannot be made in higher numbers, or more quickly, by moving to a lager location or hiring additional staff. These sausages are NOT made by Doug or his staff. They are merely grilled or boiled by him. This is really not complicated restaurant work. The lines are the product of a SADISTIC and EGOMANIACAL restauranteur. Anyone else would just increase hours, have someone else man the front desk. Doug just needs to be the center of attention. He doesn't care if people stand in line for an hour ... it's all about HIM. There are at least 4 other places in Chicago making hot dogs and related encased meats that are just as good if not better than HD. If you want to stand in line for an hour for bragging rights or god knows what, that's fine with me. But don't pretend it's (a) for a unique experience or (b) for any reason other than to be a tourist in your own city. Making people stand in line for an hour for food that takes mere minutes to make is just wrong. And it really isn't all that good. Oh, but the tourists think so ... As Chicagoans we need to stick up for our city more. If I visited another city, waited in line an hour for a mediocre food experience, I'd look down at that city. This doesn't happen in NYC. Or LA, or Mexico City, Rome, Paris, etc. So overrated, so arrogant, so annoying.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'm a thin crust guy and when I get it from Calo topped with prosciutto and mushrooms it's the closest I've found in Chicago to the outstanding pizzas we had in Rome & Sardinia.

"My family has been dining at Trattoria Sapori for years and we always have a great meal. Start with the Crostini Di Avocado (chopped avocado with cheese and chopped tomato on Italian bread), a surprisingly good take on the familiar bruschetta. For the salad course, we really like the Insalata Stella with endive, provolone, pinenuts & fruit. I've had the Risotto ai Funghi and Gnocchi al Brivido in the past and loved both, but Cappellacci di Zucca (a pumpkin/squash stuffed ravioli) is my favorite dish here. We've always seen generous portions on all dishes. This is NOT traditional Italian food. I love that there are lots of vegetarian dishes (I don't eat meat), and plenty of veal, chicken, etc. for my dining companions to enjoy. The atmosphere is cozy, there is a small dining room with a couple of more private dining areas toward the back of the restaurant, and some outdoor tables in the summer.

"Saw this place on Check Please, so put it on my long list of places to try. The boyfriend loves seafood and checked it out solo and raved so we went a week later. I must say I was overwhelmed in a good way. There were too many fresh fish types to count, so I wimped out and got what I knew, stuffed catfish with shrimp stuffing. I devoured, $22 well spent. I barely got a bit of the bf's tuna (because he ate it without looking up within about 5 minutes) but what I had was good, perfectly cooked medium as he requested. Can't comment on the atmosphere since we ate outside. Took a little longer that necessary for our waiter to come over, but after he did the first time he continued to check in regularly. If you have room, I'd say totter across the street to Margie's candies, that was incredible as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The Gage is my favorite place in this touristy area of Chicago, and it's a great place to bring out-of-towners for dinner or a drink. The beer selection is great, and I usually like to sit at the bar and have a few appetizers, especially the Poutine (fries with elk ragout and cheese curds)...ok, that sounds kinda gross but it's delish. Last night we also had the duck fat nuts and Wagyu steak salad....all great. Service is friendly and efficient...and the bar is usually crowded and loud, and one of the funnest spots in town. Outdoor seating is excellent for people-watching. Steer clear of the $10 burger...I have to assume the more expensive Gage Burger is better, but I've never had it. The fish and chips are very good. So check out The Gage after your touristy afternoon at Millennium Park or Art Institute for a great meal or a quick bite of quality food and a few good beers.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My five stars are for the pizza alone! I can't really say much about their entrees since I usually get the pizza which I've probably ordered 200 of during my 12 years living in the neighborhood! Dining in? The space is great with great wait staff and a fun bartender who makes a great martini, dirty with olives stuffed w/ blue cheese! Delivery or carry out? Quick and delivered HOT!

"In my opinion the cocktails at the Violet Hours are tip top. The price is on the high end, but I have had plenty of cocktails at the same price point that were not even close to the taste and diversity that this place has as to offer. For that fact alone this place has 5 star potential. I am not going to go into the details of the drinks and the interior, it has been beaten to death in the reviews. Unfortunately the last time I attempted to enjoy a this place they did not have a call list and were not that friendly about telling me that small fact, shame on them.

"Came here while visiting an old friend who now resides in the Windy City. I asked her where a good place in the city to get a deep dish pizza was and voila, we went here on a Monday night for dinner. As far as my expectations for what a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza ought to taste like, this place delivered. Atmosphere was nice and pizzeria-esque, pretty much what I expected and service was prompt and attentive. As for the pie itself, it was very filling, backwards (dough, then cheese, then sausage, then sauce on the very top) and very tasty. Personally, I'm a thin crust person but I would definitely say that this place had the best deep dish pizza I ever had. My friend did not disappoint in bringing me here!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I love Mexican, been eating it around the city for many years and this was a place that had been on my radar for some time, especially after my cousin moved to Pilsen last year. Finally got to try it on the 2nd. Went with two others, arrived on the early side of dinner ~ 5pm. While we were able to find a nifty parking spot in the somewhat hidden free parking lot, the restaurant already had a nice crowd and small line for the main dining room. We brought a few bottles of wine, no corkage fees to be found on the menu, and dug in to our inexpensive meal. Chorizo tostados looked really good and not greasy at all. Taco plates are cheap as heck! I splurged and ordered shrimp fajitas, and got a positive response from the server which got me excited. Huge plate of steaming veggies and shrimp which provided plenty for leftovers the following day. As we were enjoying our wine and lingering for a few more minutes, the woman behind us stopped at our table to ask what I had ordered, as it smelled so delicious. The only downside was the guac, which on the menu for my order stated it came with avocado and rice, but it was just a squirt of somewhat industrial looking guac, but that didn't turn me off, as the veggies were so plentiful and tasty.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Not much I can add here, except a couple of observations. One from a friend from New York who now lives here. She cannot believe that people line up as they do here and that they act so civil towards one another. I had told her about barging through a line of about 50 people there one day to deliver something to Caliente Doug. She claims in New York I probably would have been attacked or otherwise maimed for that, and that people in line would not be so civil if they were New Yorkers. I hadn't thought of that angle. Even after living and working in New York. My observation about the lines is that I cannot believe that people wait OUTSIDE in 20-degree weather to get in here. I love it dearly, but can guarantee that I would never do that. Back in Oz, where I come from, no-one waits in any lines for anything or anyone. Not cubs, not Apple stores, not rock concerts, nada! Well, maybe if it's just out the door, I would...but not halfway down the block. I am thinking, too, that during our current ""economic downturn"", foreigners, out-of-towners, and other innocents who drive by Doug's must think it's a Depression bread line, a soup kitchen, or an unemployment office. My other observation is that I am both surprised and impressed by the fact that with all of the hoo-ha and fame surrounding the place, it is still humble Doug who sits there everyday, greets you, and takes your order. I think if I had his culinary success, I would delegate that task. I have to admire him for that.","[0.0, 1.0]"

This is a good place to go with a big group because the seating is ample and very comfortable. The menu is very tempting, with a lot of food that sounds like it would be delicious- but really high in calories. Its basically fancy bar food. This is the type of place you can't go if you are trying to eat healthy because they serve you a huge pile of food and 1/3 of it is going to be cheese.

Unfortunately, every other time we have gone here, the service is pretty bad. We live close and would frequent this place if it weren't for that. Also, ordering carry out from them is a nightmare. The order is often wrong, you wait around for it (they say a certain time, always add 10-15 mins before you go get it) the food is served in messy containers, and just isn't as good.

I could give this place five stars but pulled one back due to two reasons: 1) i like the flank steak smothered in red sauce from El Jardin a bit more. 2) my tab is never under $70 (for two). I eat here about once every two months but would go more if my tab was closer to $50. Again, this is my fault, as ordering no margaritas would probably solve that.

"Violet Hour experience # 1 : we'll do this bullet-point fashion...1-the ambience is simple, classic and nice. yes, very ny like, and the age ranges from mid twenties to upper fifties--which I thought was an interesting mix, in a positive way!2-do not attend this place if you're hungry, or anticipating a great eatery. Their sustenance menu could be better perfected--do NOT order the mini hot dogs or chicken wings, better elsewhere. The best : potato tater tots. Sort of a random mix menu...3-The wait actually isn't too bad. It's all a little hyped up, to be quite honest, as if you're walking into an exclusive club. They were very understaffed for Sat. night, but kind and unpretentious.Overall, would I go back? Maybe...if someone else in my party was itching to go. Would I recommend this place? Sure, if you want a nice sit down, wine/conversational setting. It's not loud, rather quiet and simplistic set-up. I would NOT order appetizers again, and just drink their Malbec hence, I attend again--not satisfied, but not ecstatic...it was mediocre, and a lot of hype.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'll have to say this place got even better. In fact I think it might be one of my favorite restaurants in the Logan Square and Bucktown area. I went back and had the frog legs in buffalo wing sauce and they were ridiculously delicious. Then the family farm pork belly steak was unbelievably tender. The most tender I have ever had. I seriously could not tell if there was fat in it or not. Now what really made it better was my confusion on my order of the sweetbreads. I actually had no idea what it was, just assuming it was type of bread. When I got it though, I found out it was actually a part of a cow. It didn't taste bad, it was just bland even with the sauce on it. Anyway, the waiter asked my thoughts towards it, and when I got into my description above, he took it off the bill. I even said no to that, and apologized, hoping I didn't offend the chef. The waiter said that their goal at the restaurant is to make sure the customers are enjoying their food, even if they're not quite sure what they're ordering. I was just so surprised at how nice the guy was and the restaurant's consideration.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Just a friendly warning to others...we experienced horrible service at the greektown location. We will not be back. We arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday and got a table right away. If you decide to try this place on a weekend, I would recommend going before 10am, because it did get busy at that time. We were rushed to order right when we sat down and the menu is quite extensive so we asked for a few minutes. Even though she came back twice in one minute, it wasn't that big of a deal and we ordered several things off the menu. The coffee smells a little burnt and tastes bitter--not my favorite--had to put a lot of cream in it. The juices we tried were smooth but not good flavor combinations. The donut pancakes were fine but doughy in the middle. The potatoes and eggs were fine. The service was frustrating. We weren't there but 20 minutes and they tried to clear my friend's coffee cup away from her. It was empty because no one cared to refill her cup. There were 4 young girls (hostesses?) standing behind us just staring at tables to get them to leave. Plus there was an older man breathing down my neck and instructing the bus boys to clear away everything immediately. We were still eating when they took one of our plates. We had to ask maybe 4 times in the meal to leave something on our table. I am very aware of people waiting for tables and will not stay at a busy place just sipping on coffee for hours, but I started to feel angry that we were rushed throughout the whole meal. It was rude and unnecessary. We were there for less than 40 minutes for a party of 4 spending $25-$30 each plus tip. Plus, there were only 2 parties waiting for a table at the time.Bottom line: there are so many options in Chicago that, even if the food was great, it's not worth rude customer service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

If you aren't feeling as adventurous just as one of the bartenders, who are extremely knowledgeable and are great at steering you in the right direction.The only part of me that wants to give this place anything less than 5 starts is the part that doesn't want anyone else to realize how great this place is and to have them show up and take the last seat, but the employees here have always been great so I have to give them what they deserve.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Having lived next to Chinatown for 5 years, I figured it was finally time to give it a try. If you haven't noticed, I don't get out much. But Lao was the obvious choice after speaking with my Asian friends. The menu is roughly 53,281 pages long so picking an option took 35 minutes of browsing. Jokes aside, I closed my eyes and picked one. With my horrible luck I ended up getting one of the most boring and bland dishes they serve. But others ordered a spicy beef dish and fried pork which were nothing short of outstanding. I was grabbing seconds and thirds as I pushed my order to the side. My advice - don't get the chicken with vegetables. Seriously, don't. Follow my advice and you'll love this place. Delicious.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hmm. I was unimpressed by place. I hope I don't sound like a complete snob, but when you're spending a certain amount of money you expect top notch everything. First off we ended up getting seated 35 minutes late for our 8pm reservation. After viewing other reviews, it seems like this place has an issue with this. We came for the steak. Like most people do when they go to a steak house. It was over cooked to begin with. But they also serve food on 500 degree plates. With nothing to cover the borders. You're warned of this, but aren't they aware that meat would continue to cook at that high of a temp? Half way thru my steak it became inedible. Disappointing for a 40 dollar fillet. Also food doesn't look presentable. They didnt wipe the plates so there is grease and whatnot splattered all around. Making your dish look unappetizing. We ordered side dishes. Mashed potatoes, asparagus, and spinach. All of which were pretty lack luster and the portions weren't as large as Gibsons and the price was about the same. Wine suggestion was pretty blah too. We bought by the glass, I believe it was called undercut or something similar. I probably wont be back. There are better places to go for steak in my opinion.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My favorite thing about La Pasadita is that they confuse the hell out of you by having a few locations right next to/across the street from one another. It always makes me laugh. I usually go to the location farthest North on the West side of Ashland. I love this place. They do things the way it was intended to be done. I ordered 2 steak tacos and they come with onions and cilantro. Simple and delicious. I'm a big tomato fan and had them throw some tomatoes on since I was feeling frisky this afternoon. The reason I recommend this place is that I never get those big fatty chunks of meat in my steak. There's nothing worse than digging a fat chunk out of your mouth mid-chew and leaving it on your plate for others to stare at while finishing your dinner. Besides that, the steak is incredibly tasty. Not sure what cut/marinade they use but I really love the flavor. They also have big squirt bottles of green salsa sitting out on the counter for you to grab as you sit down for a little extra kick. La Pasadita can't be beat. It's not just cheap food, it's authentic, great tasting Mexican food that you must try. Stop in anytime and give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cheese, Swine & Wine - what more do you need to know? I was in town for work staying at the Intercontinental and wanted to find a place nearby to get a light dinner and glass of wine. I walked in as a party of 1 and only had to wait a few minutes as the hostess tried to determine which communal table to place me at. The bar was completely full but since they had several communal tables I only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The tables are a bit tight on space - they are high with as many chairs that will fit as possible. I'll assume she realized that I was not from here and wouldn't be able to handle the cold and sat me inside away from the door. ;p The wine list was fairly long with Italian and Spanish varietals which will pair perfectly with the tapas style dishes. There was a lot to select from and it was so hard to pick just a couple of dishes as there were many I wanted to try, but this would be a great place to come with a few others to share many dishes. I started with the Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette and then got the Jamon Serrano with mushrooms and farm fresh egg. I was bummed they didn't have the butterscotch pudding but had their affogato which came with chocolate soft serve - different, almost like having a mocha. Overall my meal was very good, only complaint was that my grilled bread was a little over grilled so it was very hard to cut through the crust. Had great conversations with a few strangers at the communal table - funny that 2 were from California.","[0.0, 1.0]"

And the shrimp tacos are decent. I don't know if I'd try to go here for a low key dinner, though. It gets pretty noisy, since the place is small and full of people.

"Gino's East is a solid four stars. I had this pizza the night after I had Lou Malnati's, and the deep dish here was so much better. Ordered the deep dish sausage patty pizza with mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. Delicious - the sausage literally covers the entire surface area of the pie, which ensures that you get a bite of sausage with every bite of pizza. The cheese was also good - not too overwhelming. I also liked the fact that the tomato sauce was chunky, and more than enough to keep this pizza moist. My favorite part of this pie was probably the corn meal crust - it it not a doughy crust that others use, but dryer and more like corn bread... really unique. The wait can get tedious at times - don't come here with a huge group if you want to get in. 2-4 is probably the best option, but you are looking at 45 minutes to an hour just to get seated, and then another 45 minutes to get your pizza. They don't put your order in ahead of time like they do at Lou's, but this pizza is so much better and worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Well, if you read through the reviews you get the picture. Everyone who actually got to eat here gave 5 stars. Everyone who got the run around and cancelations gave 1.

First, they give you this complimentary pizza bread when you sit down that is amazing, I could eat this stuff every day if I could...Usually, I order the same thing everytime - Chicken Piccato. Chicken that is lightly breaded with a butter, lemon, and white wine sauce with pimentos and capers. This comes with three good sized chicken breasts and a side of pasta as well as soup and salad.You get A LOT of food for your money, it's reasonably priced, dim lighting, and perfect for family dinners and date night.

"Like a few other reviewers, we also came here with the Gilt City certificate. At around 7:30 on a Thursday night, the restaurant was crawling with businessmen and their clients. While we waited to be seated, we ordered drinks at the bar. If you check in on foursquare there is a $1.99 sangria deal! When we were seated we received the pan con tomate, which really reminded me of when I lived in Spain. Just a simple piece of garlic toast with tomato. Delicious. We then received a beautiful bowl of Spanish olives, some Spanish salami and a cheese plate. The salami portion was huge and the flavor was insanely good. My favorite part was the cheese selection with apples and a burnt caramel sauce of sorts. The meal was off to a great start. We continued with our 2nd course, which was a selection of tapas. My favorites were the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. They were rich-almost could have been a dessert. The ravioli stuffed with butternut squash and lamb were also very tasty.The gambas al ajillo were done very well, as they were a dish I would often order while living in Spain. Moving to the 3rd course, I really liked the jumbo prawns with their heads still on. There were only 2 of them to share, but their flavor was incredible. The rib eye was a little tough for my liking and my boyfriend's pieces were full of gritty fat. The spinach with currants was also decent, but was missing something. Seeing as I was already pretty full, I was ok not loving our 3rd course as much as the 1st and 2nd. Dessert were small chocolate croquetas that were served with a rosemary caramel and banana marshmallow. I thought these were the perfect mini dessert. They weren't too sweet and the portion was great after such a large meal. I enjoyed my time at Mercat. The decor is great and the dishes come out at a reasonable pace. I just really like to see chefs who are very involved with their restaurants, and I doubt Jose Garces will be moving to Chicago anytime soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Three reasons why I give it five stars. 1. Food, of course. My chimichanga was hot, fresh, and made with high-quality shredded beef. The sides were great, as was the fresh pico de gallo, guacamole, and chipotle mayo sauce it came with. My girlfriend's veggie burrito was huge, fresh, and delicious (according to her)--and only $5.25. The salsa that came w/ the tortilla chips at the beginning was great, too. 2. Service. We went in on a Wednesday afternoon around 3:30--not a time when many waiters/waitresses are in the best and most attentive of moods--and our server was fantastic. He was happy, with a genuine smile, and very attentive. And our food came out really quickly. 3. Cost. Not an out and out steal of a deal, but really great Mexican food for a very reasonable price. With my chimichanga and my gf's veggie burrito, and just water, we got out for $14.50 before tax. Glad I listened to earlier reviewers. Yelp hit this one right on the head. I'd definitely go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I decided to give this place another chance and go to the store and place an order. I ordered a Four Cheese pizza. I am not an ""all-cheese"" pizza fan (except for this one pizzeria on Manhattan's Upper West Side ) but figured that was the best menu item to start with. I was pleasantly surprised.I think that the smell of food is just as important as the food itself. It was a good sign that the pizza smelled great and you can actually pick up some of the ingredients. The pizza had a great balance of crust to topping. The crust was light- not at all heavy and or ""powdery"". The spices were subtle, but clearly apparent and were not overpowered by the sauce or cheese. The sauce was excellent, lightly flavored and not acidic or too sweet. All the ingredients came together to make an excellent pizza.I thought it was impressive that after my pizza was done, the baker took it to the manager (owner?), opened the box, and had him look at it. He shook his head with approval and I was handed it. I have rarely seen that kind of attention paid to food.The establishment was nice, clean, and large enough to hang out in. The staff was friendly and seemed to like each other. Notwithstanding my previous experience, I will definitely be going back to Fogo 2 Go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Apparently, I got there when the line was ""manageable"". I still waited 45min. I love that they have a policy that if you have not ordered, you can't sit down. Somehow, there is always a place to sit once you order! You have to get the foie grad hot dog. It's just amazing. But you know, the standard Chicago-style dog is great too!

What else...excellent location right by the Irving Park El, cute atmosphere with simple but classy decor. Waitstaff was very personable and helpful.

"The customer service is terrible! It's like it's what they're going for they're so good at being bad it! If that makes sense. My sister and I went in there to get food for the movies, their fries (which was supposed to come with a truffle aioli, delicious sounding) and I got their hot dog. Neither had ANY condiments when we got to the theater. Those are 2 foods that require them! The girl that took my order had a disgruntled, I-don't care-nor-like-this-job attitude that seemed perpetuated by the nonchalant manager who kept walking off while a long line of customers meandered around. Then, after the movie, my sister wanted to go back in to get some snacks for her and her man. OK, I could go for some cheese myself. We're checking out and having a very pleasant chit-chat with the cashier. SHE was very nice, and welcoming, and doing a good job. I'm waiting to sign my credit card receipt, which is stalled by HER manager walking up to her and sticking a receipt in her face. She says ""I uh, didn't do that"" and then he flips it over to show her something that must prove that she did it or something. Meanwhile I am still waiting to sign my receipt. The manager couldn't even wait to reprimand her! THAT IS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, FOX AND OBEL! It showed a complete lack of respect toward me, the growing line behind me, and the poor girl who was doing a good job! If she screwed up at least give it to her in private. Sheesh.

"Before entering the restaurant I spotted lechon (a full pig roasting) outside! (drool). In my yelp book, it already got a star for that alone. Anyway, the service was prompt at the beginning but slowed down towards the end. During the meal, I was a bit cold. Many of the other patrons that were also seated in the back of the restaurant, appeared chilly too. They literally zipped up their sweaters, put on their hoods or switched chairs to avoid the drafts. However, despite the coldness, the food was delivered quickly and warm. For appetizers, we had yucca fritas and croquetas. From just one bite, you can tell that they can easily fill you up ( super starchy/heavy foods). So, some advice: eat sparingly to save room for your meal.  As for our meals, I had the pork chops and my brother had the lechon. My pork chops were thick and juicy! My brother's entree was a little dry but had a lot of flavor. We both really enjoyed the rice, beans, and sweet plantains. The sides really stood because they're simple but were seasoned and cooked well! Overall, I wasn't wowed about the main dishes or appetizers, but the sides were very good. The chilly factor and slower service at the end was kinda a bummer.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I created a Yelp account just so I could comment on this place. The food is pretty good, the decor is nothing to write home about and the location/parking for this place...meh. But the reason I love this place so much is because of the owner. He is perhaps the sweetest man I have ever met. He always welcomes you into his establishment with a smile and you can't help but be in a good mood when you leave. I support this restaurant because it is in my neighborhood and they have been going through some rough financial times (there is a great tear-jerking article about this place in Time Out Chicago). I believe supporting businesses that continually go above and beyond - these are the nicest people and the food is good, so I try and go once a week.Now for the food...the curry is flavorful - I recommend the Clay Pot Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry. I usually get one of those two when I order, but I must admit I have only lived nearby for a few months. But try the watermelon smoothie when you go (no bubble tea). I can't eat there without getting one.Please try this place. You will not be let down. And say hey to the owner for me.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Excellent servers that knew the ingredients (including their source) inside and out, with great beer and wine pairings. Top notch ingredients and very generous portion sizes. The unctuous, pure flavor in the Pork Belly was paired with expertly prepared Brussels Sprouts. Someone else mentioned the mussels: fresh and steamed to perfection, they were simply sensational. The Publican convinced me that Chicago is the spiritual home of pork!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Hm, more like a 3.5, but everything was just a little pinch away from being mindblowingly delicious. The bf and I needed a late dinner, yes we dine at 11:30, and apparently this was the place to be! Friends recommended the place, since we're from out of town, and I'm really glad we went. Amazing wine selection that's perfect for pairing with all of the yummy snacks. Had the fried pig ear, which was darn tasty, but a little too salty...can't say it was an OMG UMAMI PORK moment, but it worked well with the crispy kale. MM! Artichoke heart antipasti was way too salty for me, and I throw on the salt when it comes to home cooking. We had the balsamico, mortadella, pistachio spread and it was beautifully presented with a web of balsamic reduction laced on top. The only downside to the aesthetic was that the vinegar reduction drowned out the subtleties of the rest of the dish. Evening's best dish was the gargantuan cave man turkey leg. Tender, falling of the bone and greasalicious (I mean that in the best possible way...). Highly recommend that, as it is probably the largest dish on the menu and only $15!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is special. When I lived in Chicago, I used to go here about 3-4 times a month for Beijing duck and Yang Chow fried rice (and other delicious things). I recently moved to San Francisco hoping that there would be something similar. Nope.  I had reluctantly moved to Chicago and I can't imagine what my life would have been like without Sun Wah. You will have hard time finding anything like this restaurant anywhere in the US (Boston, NYC, SF included). The Beijing duck treatment for $37 can feed 4 normal people (comes with a full duck, buns, duck soup, and duck fried rice) and the taste is absolutely unbeatable. When there are bigger groups, I get the roast anything (duck, pork) and a Yang Chow fried rice. Other dishes are not bad, either. The quantity is very good, too.  Enjoy while you can!

"it was a toss up for dinner between Joe's Stone Crab and Shaw's Crab House. Shaw's won out because I have never tried it and was able to secure a reservation on a Friday night through opentable. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the overwhelming fishy smell. Most high end places I have frequented don't smell like that. We were seated in a comfy area in the old-fashioned restaurant. I loved the pictures on the wall of Charles Shaw and the first crab shacks way back when. it definitely has history and character.  We ordered the cold seafood platter and sampled cocktail shrimp, oysters, King crab bites and crab claws. All of it was very good. Next up was seafood linguini and 2 sushi rolls (Spicy tuna and I have already forgotten the other one). Decent. Didn't love it, but didn't hate it.

Appetizers of crab cake and celery root soup were very tasty, though the celery soup was one-dimensional.

For drinks they had a nice tea selection and nicely presented, while I had the 'homemade' ginger beer, which was very tasty and refreshing.

"Incredible!My fiancee and I brought some friends in from Boston last week and we were all blown away by our experience. From top to bottom, this was a great evening. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. Although a little difficult to find (it's inconspicuously located in the Blackstone Hotel) the decor and vibe is perfect. Great attention to detail.We were seated within five minutes of our reservation and our table was smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. Great views and plenty of space.Our server (Fred on the check) was over promptly to tell us about the menu and offer drink suggestions. Although the restaurant was packed, we all felt like we were shown plenty of attention. After a great description of the menu and cuisine, we decided to be adventurous and go with the chef's tasting menu. We were not disappointed! It was three courses and about 16 different items, all spectacular. Fred was there throughout the meal to make sure we knew all the ingredients and flavors as well as to explain the wine pairings we decided to get.Food highlights: Bacon wrapped dates; serrano fig salad; short rib pizza thing; lamb chops; patatas bravasWine highlights: Gine and Gine was our favorite on the chef's wine pairing. Fred wrote down all of the wines for us so we could buy them at home!For dessert, Fred had the chef make a dessert sampler for us as we couldn't decide between the four or five that were offered! Desserts were OK to good, but didn't quite hold up to the incredible meal we just had.Our friends were very impressed and even more impressed when we found out that the chef just won the Iron Chef competition! We'll definitely be back! Thanks, Mercat!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food is wonderful, but authentic. I say 'but' because some might not anticipate getting an entire chicken leg in their soup. You might. It's delicious, by the way. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because it's small, cramped, always crowded (expect a line - be pleasantly surprised if there isn't one), there are usually families with kids, if you don't get a booth you end up at a long communal table, and some booths are near the door (which is always open because of the line which might make for chilly eating).

It's like that friend who flirts with your chick, threw up on your carpet during your birthday party and always shows up fifteen minutes late to everything. Douchey but you still love em. There's enough praises about the pizza and the brews but one of the main things I love is that it's a great place to bring big groups (6+ people) when you wanna hang out in Wicker Park and sometimes do it at a moment's notice. It's a big space, the beer selection is great, there's games on the screens and the crowd is pretty diverse so that really does make the hour to two hour wait bearable. Their Golden Arm is a great light beer to drink in the summer heat and by the time you sit down for your pizza you won't be (too) shitfaced. You can also make reservations a couple weeks ahead but if you're like me and dial up your posse at a whim then you wanna get your night started here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This Garcia's location is closer to home, so we decided to give it a try. It quickly became part of the ""regular rotation"". We really enjoy the food and the drinks, as the margaritas are some of the strongest we've had.Typically get tacos (chorizo or al pastor) or tostadas. They have been great everytime. Also, in my opinion, the cadillac margaritas are worth it ... stronger and not as sweet! One knock is the salt on the margaritas glasses; it's a little too fine for my liking (seems like table salt).Otherwise, we enjoy the food, the low-key atmosphere and will continue going back regularly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My husband and I met My Two sisters and my brother for dinner at this fine dining steakhouse. All was well especially the service until at the close of dinner we realized shards of glass in the steaksauce. It is, I suppose customary and more classy to put the steak sauce in small white procelain containers We had maybe three given to our table so we shared the sauce. My brother kept crunching on something he remembers but thought it was the char on the outside of the steak (he takes his well done).When we complained to management, they handled it well until they informed us that they would only take care of my brother sisters portion of the bill. No matter how good the food was we were all placed in potential danger and definitely inconvenienced. For the trouble I think it would have been their pleasure, being the type of establishment it was to pay for everyone at the table. However, they took our information for their incident report and apologized numerously for the inconvenience. In the meantime our server was even embarrased that the check was not handled. Oh management did give a $75.00 gift certificate to my brother and sister together. We chose to use it because we will never eat there again. I'm taking my business to David Burke's, the steak was better there but not the service.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It's been months since i ate here and only now catching up on my yelping but i am a huge fan and would fly out again just to eat here and fly right back to nyc.

"I usually go to the west loop location since it's close to work, but I wanted my friend to try this place, and this one is closer to our apartments. We went on a Sunday during peak brunch hours, but the wait wasn't very long. And there was a huuuuge xmas tree for me to look at, so extra points for wishbone. I ordered what I typically get, eggs, chicken sausage, a biscuit, and cheese grits. I'm in love with the cheese grits. It's like the sauce from mac and cheese and some grits. So good. My friend ordered crunchy french toast which I had also considered. And that's how I discovered my new brunch love. Three of my favorite food things: french toast, corn flakes, and crunchiness. Hooray! I would've eaten all of her food if she had gotten up to go to the bathroom. And it even made the cheesey grits seem less amazing by comparison. I also got a strawberry mimosa which wasn't that great. But oh the crunchy french toast!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After a particularly unfortunate day, the hubs said screw it, let's go out to eat and try to enjoy a few minutes. Not one to turn down eating out, I said sure. My sweetheart gets gift cards to Lettuce joints from work all the time so we opted for RJ Grunts. I used to go to the other locations as a kid all the time which are now long gone. I always liked going and fondly remember the miles-long salad bar. It has been forever since I've been to RJ's, and never to this locale. It was pretty much as I remember it: kitschy, strange and pretty decent food. As we left, the hubs said he now knows where the idea for Applebee's and the like came from. We got seated right away, well, probably because it was Monday, though it was a booth next to the service entrance to the kitchen, next to the bar service well. I didn't think we were that ugly or poorly dressed, but even though it wasn't the best seat in the house, it worked out fine as we were dour, not wanting to be around other people anyway. Food summary: the french dip was tasty, the cottage fries were real good especially dipped in the Merkt's cheese sauce side order, hubs wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken wrap but he didn't hate it either. My sloe gin fizz was a little heavy on the citrus. And too ice heavy for such a small glass at $8. Brownie with ice cream for dessert; brownie was too undercooked for my liking but the ice cream was good. Big enough for 4 people to share, easy. Our server was nice and pleasant. All in all, way better than cooking and cleaning up. I'd go back. Stupid long trek from Irving Park neighborhood and of course parking is hard. More like 3.75 stars or so.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I wanted to try Coast so badly based on all the good reviews and recommendations from people. I made reservations for a Friday night. I was pretty disappointed with the table we were given, which was right in the middle of traffic, but they had nothing else available. The restaurant was very crowded and so loud that we could hardly talk to each other without shouting. We could, however, easily hear the lady one table over with a loud, aggravating voice. It is a really big place for a sushi restaurant, and it doesn't look like much has been done to reduce noise issues and keep an intimate atmosphere. So my much-awaited Coast excursion had a very rocky start. The sushi, however, was extremely good. If it weren't for the amazing sushi, I probably wouldn't bother going back. But I will probably try this place again - perhaps on a non-weekend night or with a different group who has better hearing :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'm not a deep-dish pizza lover, but I had some of my daughter's and I wished I had ordered it. Even so, the ""thin"" crust pizza my son and I shared was superb and more than enough for the both of us, plus some for a doggy bag. The final tab, less tip, for six people was $72. That's one of the least expensive meals we had in Chicago, and easily the tastiest. I highly recommend Giordano's.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Some friends wanted to come visit Chicago and their itinerary was the Christkindl Market, a matinee of Banana Shpeel, and dinner at Frontera Grill. She tried to make reservations like two weeks in advance but was told that although they were no longer taking reservations for that night that we'd be fine if we came in when they opened at five, which seemed fine. So we get there at five o'clock and there's already a line, which is fine. But then you get up to the host stand and it's five people in the party and it's 25 minutes to sit at a table in the bar and, she says with bitchiest laugh and something that seemed unpleasantly similar to an eyeroll, ""Like two hours *haughty grunt/sigh/bitchy laugh* for a table in the main dining room. And it's like, even this would be fine because restaurant hosts are genetically engineered to be maximumly haughty, irritating, and delusional. So we're told twenty five minutes and shooed away from the host stand to the corral around the bar. Meanwhile, they're not seating anyone despite that every table in the restaurant is empty. No explanation of, ""We start seating at such and such time,"" or anything like that. Just stand at the bar and watch them set up what is clearly your table and keep standing there for a HALF HOUR after the table has been set up. My friend walked over to the host stand and said there were like seven people standing around looking bored. I suggested to my boyfriend that perhaps they were staggering seating so the servers and the kitchen didn't get overloaded. He's in the restaurant industry and replied that they need more waiters then because any decent restaurant should be able to accommodate all of their tables being filled at once.  It's ridiculous and insulting to leave people standing like that without a word of explanation. After that experience I think I would never return there and I probably will try to steer my guests from that place as well. So we sit down and I'm not feeling particularly hungry at the moment. And, no thank you, I didn't want anything to drink either but our hostess ordered some vegetarian appetizers and once I had some grease in my system I mellowed out a bit.  The guacamole was pretty good. The deep fried quesadilla things were just all right and mostly just made me crave empanadas from Buenos Aires Forever. My favorite were the plantains with sour cream. She also got the mushroom fundido and that was good but I wasn't sure it really did it for me. I also liked the salsas that came with the chips. I ordered then an Autumn Margarita, which seened like it had too many ingredients, but I ordered it anyway and it was kind of busy but sort of all right. I was assured that there would be plenty of vegetarian options because Rick Bayless's daughter is reportedly a vegetarian. These options consisted of mushroom tacos (substitute out the beans) and some MIlanesa de Verdura thing which was basically like breaded and fried turnip slices and such with mashed beans and cabbage. It was fine but it seemed more like a plate of side dishes without an entree. It looks more substantial in the picture on the website but the problem isn't the amount of food on the plate, it's the fact that it's so underwhelming. It was just kind of boring. The desserts we tried were the pecan pie, the flan duo, and Bunuelos Navidenos, some mexican holiday pastry ice cream thing. None of them was particularly amazing but they were all right, in the order I listed them. The pecan pie was actually pretty good. I think I might have enjoyed everything a little better if I hadn't been so put out by the first forty minutes in the restaurant. I mean, I would think they'd want to get people seated right away so they could have them out the door by seven o'clock. Weird and rude is how I felt about that.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My girlfriend and I went to Shaw's because i have heard from others that they have the best crab legs in town. We weren't disappointed. Reservations were made for 6pm on a Saturday. We arrived on time and was seated immediately. The concierge offered to check in our coat for us which i thought was a nice touch. I can tell they wanted us to know we'll be taken care of at Shaw's. The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu, very polite and did a fabulous job. The food was incredible. We both ordered the Alaskan king crab. The sizes of these legs were so huge and delicious. We both felt we have eaten the best crab ever in our lives. I definitely got my moneys worth. Hands down the best in the city, if not the entire Midwest.

"My wife (she was my girlfriend at the time) and I went here to celebrate our 10th anniversary of dating. We each did the chef's menu, and our summary of our experience is: there was not a single course that made us say, ""I would eat a whole entree of that."" The only course I remember is a salmon with barbecue sauce that I swear tasted 100% exactly like the flavored powder on Lay's K.C. Masterpiece potato chips. Now, I like Lay's K.C. Masterpiece potato chips, but this is not the way to stand out with flavor. What was good? The sommelier and the wine selection. The service, while a little too formal for my tastes, was also spot on. Also, while we weren't in love with the flavors, the presentations and textures of each dish were absolutely outstanding. Tru is certainly an experience, just not quite the one we wanted.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Started out with some cheese empanadas which were crispy and oozing with cheese. Ordered a limonada (like a lemonade but made to order with fresh squeezed limes highly recommended!). Then had the combination platter with the skirt steak and grill octopus. Now I usually expect octopus to be pretty bland so I order it more for the texture than the taste. But the grill octopus was so juicy and flavorful that my friends kept grabbing them off my plate! The steak was also equally if not better than the octopus. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfectly pink and oh so tender. It was SO GOOD I immediately think about it every time I hear ""steak."" lol Service was a bit slow but expected since we had such a huge group and the place was super packed and crowded.

"I stopped in for the first time for a late Saturday lunch. The place was comfortably full, but my young daughter and I were seated promptly in a booth in the side section. The space was more kid-friendly that I expected - it's a sports bar atmosphere with music, but not unbearably loud, at least not during the late lunch hour when we visited. I tried the oatmeal stout beer and liked it very much. So far so good. We ordered a plain style pizza (which means it has parmesan but not mozzarella cheese). After a longish wait (20-30? minutes) our pizza arrived with the crust looking plainly overcooked. Our server managed not to notice or care. The crust was hard enough that cutting it with a knife and fork for my daughter was a real challenge. It's hard to factor out this rather essential failing in trying to assess what the pizza might be like if properly prepared. To its credit, it was missing the thick layer of greasy mozzarella that ruins 99% of thin crust pizza in Chicago. The sauce was a little on the light side both in quantity and taste with a strong lightly cooked garlic flavor. Overall, this was a major disappointment for such a highly touted pizza joint, and the fact that our server seemed totally oblivious to the clearly subpar product she served us only compounded the feeling.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The vegetable lo mein was made of limp greens in what appeared to be over cooked two minute noodles and not cheap. The char sui pork (bbq pork in honey?) was chewy, fatty and just not edible. When raised with the waiter he asked ""have you ever eaten char siu pork before?"". ""Ah yes and this is terrible"". The manager came over to our table and to her credit apologized and swapped the dish over for char sui that was tender and tasted good. The roast pork was just OK.

For breakfast, everything is tasty, but whatever you get, make sure you order a cup of coffee or a latte to go with it - you'll never drink Starbucks again!For the regular dinners, you won't go wrong with any of the entrees, but be sure not to pass up the Martini Special appetizer - usually a special risotto that's to die for.And, by all means, make a special evening out of the the underground restaurant experience!

"Normally when I think of Peking duck, I see myself hopping on a plane to ride 16 hours to get Asia. Luckily Sun Wah saves me. They can slice the crispy skin succulent Peking roast duck table side and that you can enjoy it wrapped with white steamed buns.  They give big portions and are authentic. You can order congee, wonton noodles (they have the biggest wonton dumplings in Chicago), roast duck, roast pork, and seafood. They moved to broadway from argyle several feet away a much larger and modern restaurant. Verdict: this place never disappoints and has delicious roast duck and roast pork.

"OK, so we've been to Big Jones on three consecutive Saturdays for brunch. The food is unbelievably freaking good. The cuisine is ""coastal southern"" which works out to lots of hearty southern fare with a more than your usual mix of seafood, crabcakes, etc. This isn't diner food -- while brunch is clearly a great idea, it's up a notch from the Golden Nugget. The food is, without question, among my favorites in Chicago. It's also locally and sustainably sourced, which is rad. Things I like there: they do a biscuits and gravy that is so complicated you feel like that traditional white gravy was somehow cheating you. It's a redeye gravy over sweet potato biscuits, and comes with a big pile of southern greens and andoulle sausage. Mwah! The Eggs New Orleans is also ridiculously good. Poached eggs over crab cakes over hash brown potatoes. So money. There's other things to like about Big Jones -- wait staff is friendly and prompt, decor is interesting, drink list is complicated and good (a Bloody Mary is thick with actual spices and veggies, not pulped mixer). But mostly, it's the food. The glorious food. I never have a problem getting seated right away, and at $10-15 for most of the good stuff, it's a steal. We did brunch for two with coffee, ticket was under $30.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I stumbled upon Simply It's menu and promptly ordered Pho Bo (beef pho), Goi Coun (Shrimp Springrolls), and an Avocado smoothie (for those of you who thinks that's gross, don't knock it til you try it). Half an hour later, not only did my pho arrive neatly packaged and piping hot, but the owner actually threw in extra veggies AND upgraded my smoothie to a LARGE AND gave me a mango salad for FREE! The delivery person said he knew I was sick and wanted me to feel better. WTH??! Who does that?! I was completely blown away as to how nice he was and called back to say thank you.Now...the PHO. It was exactly what I needed. Tasted delicious and was STILL good hours later when I ate the last half of it. Portions are great (enough for 2) and they do not skimp on the beef! Spring rolls still tasted freshly rolled even after delivery, too. Don't forget to get extra Peanut sauce and chili! It is delish!Try it and say hi to the owner, he's awesome!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had a wonderful first experience at Zed451 and came away pleasantly stuffed. I went with a group of 6. I can't eat dairy and to avoid any complications asked the hostess if I could speak to someone who could go over what I could eat on the menu. Wow! Best dining experience in a long time. I got a private tour of the food from one of the chefs. She pointed out her favorites, which items I shouldn't eat, and even made a few special for me because according to her ""I just had to try them."" It was really nice and what might have been a stressful eating experience turned into a relaxed, splendid dinner with friends. My friends were jealous because of my special tour of the food! If you have a diet restriction or are even vegetarian, this place is really accommodating. I could have eaten just from the side-bar without having any of the meats/fish brought around (which were also lovely). Everything was yummy. Faves were the pear salad and rabi with sesame oil.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"How can you not love this place?? Every time I come here, I leave with ""the meat sweats."" Not sure if that's a good thing, but it definitely means two things for certain: 1. Im gonna smell like beef for the next 2 days 2. I had an excellent experience at Fogo's! Fogo has the best Brazilian-style meat selection in the city, hands down! I have been here on numerous occasions, including my last two birthdays. You just can't beat the flavor and quality of meat they serve here. The waiters/waitresses have always been friendly and accommodating. The ""carriers of skewers"" are fast and efficient. If there is no meat of your platter, they are quick to come around and check on your status. The bar is actually cool as well. It is located by the front doors in a small area, but the bartenders are cool as hell and they have a heavy pour when it comes to making drinks. Definitely try the Parmesan-crusted pork and the smoked sirloin...unreal!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I love Mia Francesca and have been going to this restaurant since it opened. I have celebrated many special occasions over the years at Mia - everything has always been outstanding.However, this past Saturday, we made a reservation for 6 people at 8:30 to entertain friends from out of town. We arrived on time and were informed that it would be a few minutes until a table was ready due to several tables not turning over.After 45 minutes past our reservation, there was still no table available. All we were told was that our table was finished but wasn't leaving and they could not tell us when we would be seated, nor did they make any efforts to offer us a round of drinks or any other accomodation.There is simply no excuse to not honor a reservation after 45 minutes or to find some other way to accomodate us. The whole point of having a reservation is to enable the guests to coordinate and plan an evening. Had we been on our own, we might have stuck it out, but our guests had additional plans and could not wait indefinitely.I hope this is an isolated incident but wanted to share this experience so that other diners who require a reservation to be honored are not put in the same position. VERY DISAPPOINTING (but I can't give them only 1 star as they are usually a 5)!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I don't know what else to add to all the great things that have been said about Hot Dougs. So Instead I'll list some of my favorite encased meats that Doug offers.  -Pork and blue Cheese sausage. The cheese and sauce differ from time to time but I make sure that the sausage includes smoked almonds. The almonds are the key. If they aren't included, I look at the alternatives offered. -Atomic Ribeye sausage. This is my favorite of the bunch. I don't see it that often but when it's on the menu, I get in my car and go go gooooo!  Beefy and spicy! Well worth the $8 sticker price! -Boar sausages. The kind of sausage sometimes differs but the boar taste comes through. It's meaty but diiferent than the beef sausages. Excellent! If you are just looking for a chicago-style hot dog, go someplace else. Not that Hot Dougs doesn't do a great version, because it does but you can get chicago dog without having to wait over an hour anyplace else.  I haven't been back in a couple months because I just can't wait in line the reported 2 hours+ that people seems to be writing about. I'm glad that Doug is getting the praise because it is well deserved. I just wish it didn't interfere with my encased meat consumption.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was one step from giving Sultan's 5 stars! The only thing holding me back is that I know what it was like before they opened thier second store! The falafel sandwich is still the tastiest in the city but before the franchise it felt like the employees making the sandwiches took much more care in listening to your order and gently making the sandwiches.I never had a falafel sandwich burst open or fall apart until that change over when some of the folks from the Wicker Park location were moved to Lincoln park. Customer service is down two points but, the tasty factor is still there!Also, new smoothies not so good! Stick with getting the Naked juices!BUT OH BABY THE LENTIL SOUP! That's off the hook!

"I have been going to Pequod's for about 5 years now. I love the pizza. That said, I have completely stopped ordering from them because of how often they have screwed up my orders. Not once, not twice, and get this... not even three times. They have screwed up FOUR delivery orders in a row. Once, I got someone else's pizza. Yeah, you heard me right. Another time, they left out my appetizers and had the nerve to ask me if I STILL wanted them! EXCUSE ME? Another time I got the wrong toppings completely. It wasn't even close. Ugh, this is taking me down a dark path now. I'll just end this by saying the last time I went to Pequod's to sit down with a few friends, we waited 90 minutes after being told it was a 30-minute wait. I haven't been back since.I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, expecting my next experience to be better. I don't care anymore if the pizza is good, I can't accept horrible service time after time. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 4 times, we're done here.

"What a wonderful surprise. Went to Demera just because we were hungry after a concert at the Riviera and they were close and open. Had only eaten Ethiopian food once, long ago, but I was hungry enough to give it another try and I was not disappointed.We were seated within five minutes despite the flood of patrons coming from the concert. Service was prompt and super nice. Just as we were about to place our drink order, the owner came by with a tray of free samples of the homemade honey wine. It was so good, we ordered a bottle.At his suggestion, we started with some chicken sambussas - crispy, flaky turnovers with a sweet spicy sauce (move over empanadas).We let our server - who was also from Ethiopia - decide the rest. There was lamb and tilapia, lentils and collard greens, some spicy some not.It was all wonderful. Then at the end, another surprise. When they found out we had just come from a concert nearby, they took 5 dollars off of our bill. Some kind of ongoing promotion.We will definitely be back. With friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is definitely dedicated to its concept, a metal/prison theme complete with smoke machine and laser show in sync with the concert DVD playing on the wall of flat screen television, tin prison plates, and (perhaps oddest of all) black linen napkins. This place could be cheesy but luckily falls short of too over-the-top.The food was superb and the service was very good. I say this as a guy that has lived around the area for a few years and has been waiting for a place that not only has good burgers, but is as dedicated to the idea of the perfect burger as Kuma's Corner over in Avondale or the Rocking Horse in Logan Square. Yes this sounds like a bit of a hyperbole, but I was stricken with love at first sight with the Cruelty to Animals, a gigantic mound of ground beef topped with three different kinds of pork.My gf was pleased with the only vegetarian option, the Identity Theft (a fried eggplant sandwich) but was more impressed with the dessert, the Community Service (Banana Wontons).The beer list is also worth taking a long look at. There are some great choices in addition to the standard domestic drafts I avoid like the plague. The prices seem on par with other establishments I have been to of late. I think it is important to note that my gf and I are not metal fans. This is important because we still had no major issue with the music. Sure it was a little loud, but this is a metal bar and we only had to raise our voices a little bit to talk to each other or the server (as opposed to screaming).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What Alliance lacks in food and rink, it makes up for in atmosphere. The best coffee shop to work or study at in the area, easily. I live near Alliance and head there regularly to do all of the usual coffee shop things. The staff is always attentive, friendly and professional and the coffee is consistently good.  There's better coffee out there, but I haven't had a bad cup at Alliance. I wouldn't recommend any of the espresso drinks, though. The americanos are good, but any of the milk espresso drinks can be passed on. Maybe I haven't found the right treat yet, but most of the cookies and pastries I've tried as Alliance have been underwhelming. You're paying for presentation. The real draw to Alliance Bakery is their lounge next door. It's usually fairly full, but you can almost always find a table for yourself. Being separate from the kitchen noise of the bakery helps to keep the lounge nice and quiet, and aside from the occasional conversation the clientele tends to preserve that quiet. It's perfect for working and studying. There isn't a better coffee shop in the area if you are looking to hang out for a while. THE END.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Since moving to Chicago about 2 years ago, i would say this is the best Restaurant I have visited hands down. The food as you can imagine was delicious our waiter was knowledgeable in all the menu items, even suggesting a few to us. We decided to go with the Fixed Priced menu and it didn't disappoint. The only downside to going that route was the amount of food it brought along, 5 courses, if you can consider that a downside. The best part of the meal was the 4th course, which was a grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions. Just amazing.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It hurts me to rate this place so low because their breaded steak (Milanesa) is so good, but damn, their service is letting me down. The last 2 times that I've been here, they've gotten our orders wrong.  - The first time, my friend wanted the Milanesa Dinner, no tomatoes. Instead, they brought out a Milanesa Torta w/ tomatoes. - Then last night, we order the Milanesa Dinner. My friend said, ""Milanesa"" pointed at it on the menu, the waitress nods. I order the same thing with a side of extra cheese. She nods again. When the food comes out, she brings us two Carne Asada Dinners, no extra cheese. It tasted fine and all, but that's not what we ordered. You know what that's like? Its like wanting a PS3 for Christmas, getting the PS3 box, but inside is a really nice sweater. Nice, but its not what I wanted. I'm definitely going to come back here when the opportunity arises, I just hope they get my order right. Will I have to write it down for them? I hope not. I'm still jonesin' for some breaded steak. There is a place near my house that has it, not as as good, but at least they get my order right.","[0.0, 1.0]"

They have some great beer and wine choices. I had a $7 glass of very nice Chardonnay.  We ordered THREE orders of cheese fries for 6 people...one of the friends we were with really loves them. I am not a huge cheese fries person (hate that fake cheese), but these were absolutely delicious! That was REAL cheese on there!  I had a turkey burger and sweet potato fries. The turkey burger came with LOTS of pickles, which is a good thing. A few people at the table had salad; they ordered two different dressings, and both said they didn't like their dressing much! Not a good thing... They bring hot washclothes with lemons at the end of the meal...only had that at Asian restaurants before, but it was a nice touch.

Hencewhy when I walked into the place I was like ""Wtf unmarked old wooden doors and billowy heavy curtains that make me feel like I'm in a high school drama aka: really nervous and tense I'm not going to find the opening in time"" 4. Then I made my way through a-ok and was escorted to the bar by the maitre d'(?!) 5. Sitting at the bar feeling weird that this place was so pretentious and why couldn't we have just gone somewhere where Guinness was on draft and maybe a dusty dart board was hung up in the corner 6. Glancing over the menu, still no acknowledgment by bartender that i existed, deciding on a drink and waiting 7. Ordered cocktail - received cocktail in fairly timely manner - finished cocktail - thought about ""Should I have another one?"" 8. Bartender comes alive and asks opinion of drink I say ""too sweet"" He says ""That's not sweet"" and I say ""Too sweet for me you don't know me"" He says ""What do you usually drink"" I say ""Well, yesterday I was drinking Lagavulin but usually it's a nice hoppy IPA or something super salty like whoah"" To which he replies ""Let me mix something up for you"" 9. Oh and real quick: don't order a dirty martini, they will cane you with their mind. 10. The magic begins to happen, and I stare back at him in awe. He's pulling out bottles left and right, throwing things in the air which I could swear are coming back down in quantities more than what had begun. Adding, subtracting, carving ice cubes to fit the glass like a glove. 11. He comes to me and I say ""Thank you"" and reach for the glass, to where he says ""Uh uh, I'm not done yet"". As he is describing all of these things he has used, he squeezes the orange peel above my glass and lights it on fire to which there's a little flame POOF! ""It's very herb-forward, let me know if I didn't hit the nail on the head."" 12. Glass up, lips perked, and go! The cocktail hits my tongue and immediately all moisture is sucked out of my face. This drink is G-U-D good. 13. I smile, lift my glass to his direction ""Perfection"". 14. Turns out he DID know me. **He later told me no charge for the first drink, to which I thanked him and tipped him over-accordingly.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"What can I say that the hundreds other haven't.  I loved my experience at Irazu. We got there early after work and the crowd was small. Brought a bottle of wine and Omar brought us out some chips and salsa and took our order for guacamole immediately. After guac we decided to go for the new empanada sampler appetizer. Super crispy and extra doughy. While I would pass on the chicken in the future, the sweet plantain and spinach and cheese empanadas were excellent. I have to point out that the Pico De Gallo served with the empanadas was AMAZING. It had a ton of cilantro and fresh cut tomatoes. I will definitely ask for this in the future for chip dipping. Our excellent server, Omar was working the whole room and as he took our order made it a point to let us know, customers preference rules at Irazu. I felt no guilt as I constructed THE WORLD'S MOST PERFECT BURRITO EVER! It was a large warm tortilla overfilled with Black beans, YELLOW rice, Cheese, Avocados, Sour Cream, CHORIZO, Spinach and Mushrooms. And yes the rumors are true, I could barely finish half it was soo huge. My friend loved her veggie burrito but my other friend did not like her fried pork dish. It was completely over-fried (Is this possible? Apparently so.). We all loved the side of sweet plantains.  At the end I was disappointed that I was too full for a ""famous"" oatmeal shake but Omar told me I could pop in anytime to grab one on the go. A few minutes later, a bread pudding was magically ordered and it was a block of thick rich cinnamon deliciousness. Done and done. The damage for 3 girls and a ridiculous amount of food was minimal and Irazu has a new cheerleader in me.  *Can't wait to come back in the summer to booze up the shakes on the patio. **I would like to point out although we got there nice and early, Irazu was nice enough to let us sit there for about 2 hours and truly enjoy our meal and conversation even though the line was out the door.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Can the gringo out mexican the mexicans? We enjoyed our brunch at Frontera, but it wasn't the second coming. I made reservations for nine people. It was decided by popular vote that I ordered the best entree: three little corn cakes, topped with egg, shredded chicken, or chorizo and plantains in a bowl of smoky black bean puree drizzled with crema. I've made black bean soup, from canned and dried beans many, many times but Frontera did something special to make this humble dish a standout (homemade broth? hours of boiling with a ham hock?) The agua del dia was delicious: cucumber, pineapple, and parsley. The misses: the red pozole was bland, the broth watery. And the special, a wet tamale, was way too salty, which drowned out the delicate spices Annoying: the waiter trying to upsell with the bottled water (after we'd already been served tap water, which tasted fine) and pushing the appetizer plate ($7.50 per person, for guacamole, ceviche, quesadilla, and taquitos. no offense, they're probably pretty good, but we could get a knockoff version at taco bell) Instead, we ordered the more interesting capitale quesadilla, which are deep fried, cheese filled empanadas, the guac and the ceviche (too sweet) Bright, festive decor.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"At first, I was a bit hesitant about going to the Violet Hour, it looked to fancy and pretentious, I'm the type of girl that is comfortable in my sweats, but likes to dress up once and awhile within reason. The Violet Hour has to sign, nothing so it's easy to miss i.e. just like the speakeasy's of the 1920's. I was walking pass a wall with graffiti when my friend told me this was it. Really? What? We waited in line since the place is very small and intimate. When we got inside, I was impressed, darkly lit, cute, laid back, that's what I like!

I like my sweet girly drinks so I had the Pimms #5 that tasted just heaven. I could spend hours there just chatting and talking with people. When we were ready to leave for the next adventure, one of the staff helped us on where to go. Who does that nowadays? :) Great place, great people, great times.","[0.0, 1.0]"
This place is amazing!!! The service is amazing. The servers are very friendly and the setting is so inviting. Its a great place for a date. Full drink selection great choice for dinner and very relaxing. Its a nice place to set down and have a few drinks with dinner before a night out on the town. I will for sure return and ask for Mike to serve me!,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food here is good, and the acrobatic display of service is interesting, however I am left uninspired by the stiffness of said servers.  I also think the mood could be improved, as well as a few other things. It's almost like eating at a museum, and the times I have been there, I've been worried about my servers having a nervous breakdown behind their painted smiles. Tip toe service, I'd call it. I am just so uncomfortable when no one is having fun. But if you want to be treated like royalty, this is the place to do it. Meh.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We stopped by to check out the remodel. The remodel is great...the food is best left for 4:00 am. I had a garlic shrimp dish. The main issue I had is that they should put the shrimp in a separate dish. It was bathed in butter. Now I like butter as much as the next guy, but I like the ability to shake the butter off, or dip it in. Instead, the butter ran across the surface of the dinner plate. So, the iceberg lettuce and my rice were sopped in butter. A little harder to shake butter off rice. The quesadillas were also strangely, seemingly dipped in butter before fried. The side of beans, had oil (or perhaps butter) pooling on the edges. The margarita tasted like it came out of a slurpee machine. The taco meat on the other hand was lacking flavor and was a bit dry...not buttery at all.On the plus side - the place looks good and is clean. The bathrooms were nice. The waitstaff was attentive. The portions were large. The drinks were not watered down.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here for dinner a few weeks ago with a party of six. Make sure you are hungry when you get here because the food is literally never ending. The formal buffet style of this restaurant allows you to try a little bit of everything, while still allowing you to choose the pace of the meal. The food was very good, although the wait staff was a little too attentive, often interrupting conversations to ask questions and offer more. The drinks were good as well. The biggest hiccup came at the end of the night when the bill came, and the waitstaff found it very difficult to split the bill up among the multiple couples. Overall a good place that I would go again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I just wanted to say thanks to Maura (I hope I spelled it right) and everybody else who collaborated on Sun. night to make my first visit to the Violet Hour a super great one. I was in town visiting from Denver and have been wanting to go get a drink here for a long time. Unfortunately my friend and I arrived just a little too late and almost weren't allowed in, I whined about being there all the way from Colorado and luckily we got in. (Thank you floor manager & hostess for being cool). I started talking to Maura about bartending and drinks in general and she was so kind and made me a Juliet and Romeo. (even though we had originally been told it was too late for anything other than a beer and/or shot) Super delicious, I loved it. Wish I could be there more often to try out more drinks, this place is really quite lovely. I will be back as soon as I can! Here's to your continued success.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is the best Persian food in Chicago -- so I'm told by an Iranian friend.Quite aside from his words, I like it a lot. Of their kababs, their ground meat one is my favorite. Oddly enough, the more expensive filet mignon is less enticing; it's been too chewy the times I've tried it. Their salmon is also very good, fresh and perfectly done. As for rice, the dill rice is both traditional and clearly the best.Their hummus and babaganush were very good, though not extraordinary. Desserts look like the Middle Eastern classics, whichto my taste buds, come through as all the same.I've both eat in and taken out -- they don't stint on the take-out, and itsvery reasonable, even if you have company. I can almost smell that dill rice.....mmmmm. It's worth a visit just for the rice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I adore Revolution. The food is spectacular, the servers are friendly, the beers are delicious, and the people-watching can't be beat. It's getting pretty busy there now (expect a two hour wait on Friday or Saturday nights), but it's so good that I don't care! If you want to get in and get your food quickly, try an early dinner or lunch, or go for brunch on the weekends. Must-haves on their menu include: Appetizers - Bacon Fat Popcorn and Soft Pretzel Entrees - Workingman Burger, Farm Burger, and Iron Fist Fish and Chips Brunch - Breakfast From Scratch and Egg In A Hole As far as beers go, I'm partial to the Cross of Gold and the Bottom Up Belgian Wit, and I've only heard good things about their other beers. They have some nice whiskey drinks as well. This place is a must for anyone who wants to see the best of Logan Square!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"What to say...oh sooo much. This is for first time trials to an Ethiopian restaurant, like my experience. So let me dig into it (literally). First things first, the lunch buffet is no longer existing, BUT they do have the lunch specials. There is no sheet that mentions it, it's only word of mouth so listen closely and ask you waiter(ess). For $7.95 you choose 3 different clumps of thick pasty ""stews"" that include beef or vegetables, as mild or spicy. We had the beef Michetabish that had a nice flavor. It will come out on a round platter with Injera and a separate side of Injera (a large circular flatbread of a 20 inch diameter made of sourdough fermented with teff flour--see photos from demera for an example I included). Not only is it used to serve the food on but also comes to scoop up the food with (you won't find silverware anywhere around and use should use your right hand as custom says). I could go on and on poetically describing the Injera but the unique consistency is of a soft rubbery ""makeshift utensil"" like a children's play goo and looks like carpet padding with all the little holes. That's the best I can do. The taste has a sour hint to it too, hence the sourdough base. Lastly, the portions are very large, even the lunch specials! We tried the Chicken and Vegetable Sambussa appetizer which were delicious dough triangles stuffed with what it names. The Ethiopian tea was tasty with a cinnamon after taste (unfortunately, I noticed that it was brewed with teabags instead of loose leaf, but still good). The servers are from Ethiopia along with all the decorations and music. The waitresses are very nice and smiley, and they try their best to explain the items on the menu. At the same time, they leisurely assist you and you will often have to call them over if you need anything. Quite an experience, enjoyable I must admit.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food is good. The service.. the waiters are very nice and they really try.. but the place is crowded so its very difficult to receive a good service.

The hostess are not very nice and I think they should try to look a little better or at least wear something that help the client recognize them, they are wearing normal clothes.. .. but the bartenders are very nice.. highly recommend the squash.. the pork neck.. and the pistaccio ice cream.","[1.0, 0.0]"
This place is a joke. The food is disgusting and the dust alone on the wine bottles is enough to make you throw up. I left reeking of fishy oil that never came out of my clothes. Our African American server stunk of booze and it was only 9pm. His breath was a liquor cabinet. I was shocked. I wanted to remind him that he was playing with fire and to perhaps think before he drinks ON THE JOB!! The one decent thing is the chocolate. I would never come back but if I did ha this is the only thing on the entire menu worth a sinlge dollar. This place is a joke. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

I think they made their miso soup from scratch not like those other Japanese Restaurants who I think just prepares the instant one.Service was just okay.

"We went too this restaurant tonight and I had the most embarrasing time of my life. I have never reviewed a resturant. I have had some bad meals and some good meals. I cannot say that my problem was with the meal or for that matter with the particular young man that helped us. But with the establishment as a whole and the philosophy of the place. Our bill for two came out to $76+. Kind of hefty for a mid week chinese meal. But then again this is not a problem either. OK so here is the problem. We ordered some appetizers and then we ordered the main dish the Hot Pot. They brought the food to the table and we thought that at $16.95 per person the food they brought us belonged to us. But no only the food you eat is yours. Yes the fine print on the menu says that you cannot take away the hot pot left overs, didn't see that. But then again who would expect that if you bring food to the table you are going to take it back. So why, well there could only be one good reason, because they bring you the food and if you don't eat it they serve it to someone else. Highly illegal and quite unsanitary, I might add. Why else would they tell us that we could not take home the food that was on our plate. We ended up getting into an argument in the middle of the dining room. I have never had that happened before and I have dined all over the world.So tomorrow I plan to file a complaint with the health department. These people are reserving food. plain and simple, no other reason why they will not let people take food home that is already on the table.So worst restaurant experience of my life.Oh, I forgot to mention the waiter that came yelling at us and almost dropped his false teeth from his mouth.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Actually 3 1/2 stars. The dishes I tried were all good but a bit ordinary... bland maybe? I expected something orgasmic with all the wonderful reviews I've seen on Yelp. Bummer. For starters, I had the corn cake and lentils. It was decent. There wasn't anything in it that made me go ""wow"" or ""what is that"". The lentils and the corncake had similiar textures, so it made the dish a little boring. The lime helped a bit... For my entree, I had the monkfish with braised taro. Nicely made. There was some mango salsa for the fish which was refreshing but nothing special. I'm not a big fan of bread pudding but fellow yelpers raved about it so I got it. While it was tasty, I was disappointed. It was the same bread pudding I've eaten a dozen times before. The homemade ice cream kiley had was good though... Overall the food was good but nothing really surprised me. I loved the casual atmosphere of Bonsoiree and our server was great. I'll be coming back for sure! You really can't beat the price. I'll give the lamb a try next time...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I may be biased toward Gejas because I recently proposed to my fiance there during dinner. However, there is a reason why I chose Gejas to do that and it is because the food and service are both top notch. The restaurant is set below the street and is very quaint. We get the premier dinner when we go, which includes cheese fondue to start, then your choice of meat and vegetables, and it finishes with a chocolate fondue for dessert. It is a bit pricey, about $30 each for the premier meal. But it is a nice place to eat once in a while when you're looking to have a good time with friends or family.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This was my first fondu exerience and I will do this again. The question is whether it will be at Gejas. The Good: Good quantity of meat and veggies. Nice fruits for dessert. Nice decor, even better if you are on a romantic date. The Bad: Ok service, though it seemed we may have just got the waiter on his bad night (Tom) as he had really bad attitude. Very smoky so you will need to dry clean whatever you wear. And a bit pricey for cooking your own food. You will be more full and have better service at Zed451 but of course, that's not Fondu! The cheese was ok, but I kept picturing a big bucket of processed cheese whiz in the kitchen being slopped into crockery and brought out to our tables. We would probably go back with another couple that wanted to try out Fondu. But, if they just want a nice restaurant for dinner, this would not be the choice. Thanks Yelpers for the tips for a Fondu virgin. VERY helpful.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The salad bar had a variety of cold tapas but nothing outstanding that made me go up for seconds (and I was really looking for something to balance all the protein).

"I used to like Garcia's back when they weren't so big and popular. The food was great then and the service was not so bad. I went there sometime in december 2011 with my husband, and the food was bland, the service was even worse. It took the waitress way too long to get our check and didn't even pick it up after 10 minutes of the checkbook with our credit card hanging out sitting on the table. We tried to get her attention but she was just way too busy. Finally we got fed up and i just paid up front. I had better service in Paris, and there usually is only one waiter/waitress for an entire restaurant/bar there. The only reason for my one star is because they havent taken away the ridiculously large horchata cup, but even so, the quality of their horchata has gone down. Never ever ever will we go back to Garcia's. The only people who like it now are those out of towners who recently moved to chicago or tourists who don't know any better... I'd much rather eat at a hole in the wall mexican restaurant with excellent food than eat at a Mexican restaurant with bad service, bland food, and over priced to boot, (all of the above = garcia's).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Glenn's Diner is a small restaurant in my neighborhood that serves some of the best seafood I've ever had. You'd never guess that by the name. Most unknowing folks figure it's going to be patty melts and BLT's. But this place has great, high quality food, even if your not a seafood lover, they have many other menu choices as well. We love going to Glenn's and used to go at least once a week. Now, we only go about once or twice a month. In fact the only reason I didn't give Glenn's five stars is that they've gotten so busy (which is good, I'm glad people are supporting them) that I think their service is starting to suffer a little. 9 times out of 10 I'd say we get seated relatively quickly, and have a great server that offers good service. They are friendly and attentive. On rare occasions, we'll get a server that is friendly, but isn't very attentive because they are so busy that it becomes hard for them to handle and you can see and feel their frustration. However, the dinning room attendants are amazing! They seem to anticipate your every need. They've even brought us refills when our server was too busy. Recently we made reservations for one of their specialty nights. I was unable to go at the last minute, but heard from those that did go that even though they had reservations they ended up having to wait 45 minutes for a table. Now, this would be understandable if every table in the house was full, but they had empty tables and were seating walk-ins at those. I read another review that had a similar experience. I feel that if you have a reservation you should have priority seating and walk-ins should have to wait the 45 minutes. I think they need to rethink the way they handle their reservations. Overall though, this a great, no, awesome place and we'll definitely go back, again and again. By the way, the Manager is extremely friendly and accommodating. I saw that someone else had posted something negative about her and all I can say is perhaps she had a bad night that night because she's always been nothing but professional and friendly to us. In fact, most of the time she recognizes us when we come in. She may not know our names, but knows we've been there many times and always says, Its great to see you again"" or ""thanks for coming in again"". She was very accommodating to my friends that had to wait for their reserved table. In fact she did more than what was necessary to correct the situation but it was very much appreciated nonetheless! Go to Glenn's, but know before you go, it's not exactly what you would consider diner food and is not diner prices. It's not overly expensive either. I'd say mid-range. Despite my comment above, I highly recommend making reservations, especially on their specialty nights otherwise you could find yourself waiting for quite a long time to get a seat. In either case, it's worth the wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I know they have been around for a long time, and their age is starting to show.A bit of advice: If the diner folks want to stay current they need to start thinking about sustainability, local and eco-green. The building looks a little run down, and exactly how green is it? Do they use organics?Local? Is it a good organization or just a front for a wealthy dude to make $$ off of us trusting vegans?

"don't believe the hype. my wife and i went to sun wah wanting so much to find a new asian restaurant with good food. the reviews on this place sounded as if you could not go wrong, wrong. first the atmosphere in the place is as if you are in a huge cafeteria - really no aviance just come in and get your food. i do not have a problem with that as long as the food quality and taste makes you forget your surroundings so after you are seated we looked around and it was a good diverse crowd with what seemed like a large staff serving the people. however it was literally 10 minutes before someone showed up to our table and just appeared out of no where and asked are you ready to order - no hello how are you or would you like a drink, just are you ready order. i wanted to get a taste of what the peking duck tasted like without ordering the full meal and the waitress instructed me to try one of the ducks at the top of the menu ranging in size; small, medium and large. so i ordered the duck and my wife ordered her entree (mixed vegetalbes and tofu) an appetizer (fried scallops) and pea pod greens. the waitress put the order in and the duck showed up in less than two minutes all sliced and ready to be eaten - mind you nothing else not the appetizer or even our drinks. just a plate filled with a half of duck. my wife and i sat and looked at the duck for a few minutes, then i took a piece and tasted the duck. the duck was bland and gamey in smell and in taste - my wife did not even want to taste it after smelling the duck. so we sat at the table and joked for about the next 5 minutes about why would someone drop off a plate of meat and just leave. so i go to the front counter and ask one of the waitresses standing at the counter if they could take it back into the kitchen and put it under warming light or something - she did, and eventually brought out all the food together with appetizer. all the food was bland and tasteless except the pea pod greens. so i ate the greens and my wife picked at her platter and when the waitress asked if we wanted it all wrapped to go, we got the vegetables and greens to go and left the duck practically untouched.save your money go to panda or that place down the street, but do not go out of your way for crappy food","[1.0, 0.0]"
Mercat was a very enjoyable albeit somewhat predictable tapas experience.

"I have no idea what to compare this place to because in Seattle we don't have a lot of good, authentic Mexican food. But these little things were really tasty. I tried the carne asada taco and the other taco with beef in it; both were good and distinctly different in flavor. Be prepared to have your fingers smelling like meat juice for the rest of the day! I do think the price is a bit on the high side for street food, but not so high that it detracted from the experience. It's just that the cheapness of good street food adds to the experience of making you feel like you are getting away such a deal. Here, you are feel like you're paying for what you get.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Huge fan of this place! They have a brand new upstairs bar area in addition to their downstairs bar and seating area, with a cute fireplace and couches, normal tables, and seats at the bar. Unfortunately they would not seat me until my party was all there (and we were all coming at different times) so we just sat at the bar- no problem. They offer 4 oz samplers of all their beers for $2 or $4 depending on the beer. I loved all their beer. I tried: (score of 1 is best beer ever, 5 is worst beer ever) Bottom up wit: Banana flavor wit.

"A review by a vegetarian! I'm one of those people that just stares with disappointment when my meat-eating friends rave about the beautiful broth in pho. So, having never experienced it, I have been on the hunt for a broth in a vegetarian soup that makes me rave about it. The answer I found was in the rice noodle with curried tofu at Tank Noodle. YUM'O!! The coconut curry broth was nothing short of mind boggling. I also got to try the spring roll (4 stars), the stir fry with cripsy noodles and assorted veggies (4 stars) and the smoothie with mango, custard apple and tapioca (5 stars!!). The restaurant is in a neighborhood with a variety of vietnamese and other pan asian places but, this is by far the busiest and since me and the husband like the food here, we can't wait to be back on weeknights when they aren't so crowded.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"CRISP STOPPED CARING Yes, that's right, Crisp has officially taken a dump. One, pricing is getting a bit out of hand; it used be somewhere around 6.99 for a Steak Bowl (all it is, is seasoned beef and rice) and is now costing around 10 bucks. Two, they give you less of everything; steak bowls used to be stuffed to the brim and had at least 2"" thick of beef. The wings USED TO BE, dare i say, pterodactyl sized. Now, everything has been sacrificed for greater profits. The wings look fairly generic in size (i used to love steroid sized wings). Three, their neo-hipster staff needs to drop the $hitty attitude. If i ask for extra atomic sauce for my steak bowl, just give it to me, don't hassle about 50 cents, that is completely petty and classless. Just stop with the attitude in general, that guy ""John"" who used to manage the place would have never stood for any of that ""ironic shirt, PBR drinking, thick rimmed glasses"" crap. It is so unfortunate to see a restaurant I once treasured, completely lose its way. Also consider, this review is coming from someone who allocated several hours to essays promoting Crisp to the food network and other local news organizations....my stomach is empty and my heart is broken.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food is good. But not great. At least not for the price and the skimpy portions. Having had several meals under the chef's directions I can tell you that if choosing the chef's menu, you will be surprised once or twice, very pleased at least once, but disappointed at the end. You feel as if you were promised a magical journey of gastronomical delights, but then wind up with cheesy rice and cheezit crackers. Or popcorn sprayed lightly with truffle oil. Both easy and a let down. I expected more each and every time I visited (total 3 to give it a fair shake.) The service is American. The dishes are midwest haute cusine. The prices are more for NYC or Paris or Shanghai. Overall I think you should try it, but most likely you too (if you've had a bit of culinary exposure) will come away a bit bummed and still very hungry. One gets the inkling that he is trying too hard to impress, and that in and of itself is non-impressive.

"The food is hit-or-miss, and with great breakfast places in the city (sweet maple cafe, m henry, or big jones), there's no reason to ever hit this place up unless the environmental spin is important to you, and even then, there are better places in the city that provide local fare. Also, the customer service is decidedly lacking, but it seems to be more of a problem with management than the actual floorstaff. Upon being seated, we were given 3 menus to a party of six, and were told they'd try to find us some additional menus because they ""always run out of menus when the patio is full."" I'm not really uppity about these things, but I kind of wonder, if it's a persistent problem....why not print up more menus? Also, be warned that according to our server, it's against restaurant policy to split checks for groups of six or more--regardless of how many cards you are trying to pay on (meaning that if it's a party of 12 and you attempt to split it down the middle on two cards, they won't accommodate). I get it that it is obnoxious to ask a server to split the check on several different cards and there's definitely a point at which it becomes ridiculous, but there are plenty of other eateries in the city who won't mind splitting the check in half for you :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you think you don't like grits, you are probably mistaken. Wishbone has amazing cheese grits- better than what I've had in Texas or Georgia. And much better than the sad, watery, bad-Cream-of-Wheat grits that causes most people to think they hate grits. I'd pick Wishbone's cheese grits over polenta any day. Yummers. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge brunch enthusiast. In fact, I say the phrase, ""Brunch food can only get so good,"" often enough that my friends probably are on the verge of never inviting me for brunch again. And for the most part, I believe it; I believe that there is a ceiling to how good an omelet or French toast or an egg-bacon-home fries combo plate can possibly get. But Wishbone blows me away - I'd sooner have brunch there than dinner at most other restaurants. If you go on a day when they've got the special Brisket Hash, get it. Or the day when they have the spinach, avocado, and Swiss cheese omelet, get it. Everything I've ever tasted at that place has been swoon worthy, and for me, swooning pretty much never happens at brunch.

"Absolutely THE BEST Indian lunch buffet in the city! There are several others that are good, but Indian House remains my undisputed favorite in terms of ambiance, service, quality of food and variety of dishes. There's a little bit of everything offering something for every appetite...soup, samoas, great rice, vegetarian dishes, lamb, chicken, and sometimes a fish dish , and 3 kinds of dessert.  Not to mention lots of glorious TANDORI CHICKEN and NAAN that's served upon arrival. The service is very attentive and spot-ON....and I mean ON! New plate...drink refills...more food...whateva....they GOT YOU! I've been here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. It's perfect for a week day lunch and especially nice for Sunday brunch.   Over the years, India House has become my ""go-to"" spot for impressing out-of- town visitors with a hankering for Indian delights.  Each and every visit to Chicago, my mom asks to be taken here...and if you knew my Mama, you'd know that keeping her happy is priority #1!

"In retrospect, perhaps I should have tried to come here for dinner instead of a 0730 early breakfast, because I just wasn't terribly impressed with my texas french toast for breakfast. Love xoxo's description of this place, cuz quite apt. Dont' come here to this quiet locale in Gold Coast for noise, trend, cool, glitz. Ain't gonna happen. Instead, walk a few steps down and walk into what is more like a dated conversation pit that was so in a few decades ago in living rooms....there's even an old-fashioned cash register that one has to press down really hard for it to make that clunkety-clunk sound that just adds to the overall feel. Apparently, at least 4 other parties were already well into their breakfasts. Though quite ample in portion, the toast was just chewy and 'limp'... don't know how else to describe it (I have had stellar french toast in my time....read Tower cafe or Bella Bru, Sacramento). Though dipped in egg and then pan-fried, the toast did not possess that great play in crisp and then soft on the inside...instead it was all completely soft somewhat tasteless. Would have been a nice touch had they just added a splash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the egg batter. Syrup is the other half that comprises a killer french toast experience: it was... meh. From the perusal of breakfast reviews, it's sort of hit/miss with this well-established place that is connected to the south of a condo building. The entree + grapefruit juice ran about $14 for breakfast. Just south of Goethe on Dearborn... had a wonderful, quaint, stroll through historic Gold Coast looking for the FLW Charnley House.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went to Hot Doug's a few weeks ago so this is a little late...my friend and I biked from downtown which made us feel a little less bad about our pork filled gluttony. We waited about an hour and a half- it was really nice out and everyone seems to be chatty in the line so the time passed fairly quickly. I went for the bacon cheeseburger hot dog- yes the pork sausage was stuffed with cheese and bacon AND topped with more cheese and coca-cola BBQ sauce, I'm probably missing something but it was very decadent and very tastey. I ate every last bite. We of course opted for the duck fat fries which were delicious, but I'm not sure how they really differ in taste from the others? just more crispy? Either way they're fabulous fries. You can definitely split between 2 people. Oh and we ordered a side of cheese to dip them in. Repulsive I know but sooo good.

The empenadas were amazing, especially the goat cheese variety. I would easily order that again. The dinners on the other hand... my steak was thin and cheap, the chicken was thin-cut and cheap as well, and even worse for it than the steak.I find that it doesn't really matter though when you're sitting outside in their outdoor section on a great summer evening, pouring your own rum in front of you.

"The pizza here is pretty good. It's not my favorite stuffed/deep dish/Chicago-style or whatever you want to call it in Chicago, but it's up there. The crust-cheese-sauce-toppings ratio is good, and I appreciate the texture and flavor the cornmeal adds to the crust. I also like the amount and flavor of the sauce. It was a little on the pricey side (over $40 after tax and tip for a large pizza with a bunch of toppings). The pizza did feed about 8 people, though . . . so I guess the price wasn't obnoxiously high. We decided to order from here because I have a cousin visiting from Poland who wanted to try some Chicago pizza. Because we needed it delivered, we couldn't get it from my favorite, Pequod's, so I looked for some reasonable alternatives. Calo was very highly rated, so we decided to go with them. And, like I said, the pizza was good. The service left something to be desired, though. I don't think my order was overly complicated. I wanted a pizza that had mushrooms, green pepper, and onion on the whole pie, and pepperoni on half of it. I went over this with the woman taking my order over the phone about five times to double check. It was really important because at least two of the people eating the pizza were vegetarians who didn't want pepperoni or any kind of meat touching their pizza. The woman taking my order was, somewhat understandably, getting a little annoyed that I was triple and quadruple checking this, but, like I said, it was important. Did I mention that this woman wasn't particularly nice to begin with? But, whatever, if the food was going to be good, it wouldn't matter. So, about 45 minutes or so later, we got the pizza. And it was really good. But it had sausage on it. All of it. To be fair, it also had all the other toppings, but the sausage made it inedible to the vegetarians. If you're going to have an attitude about the way I'm ordering, at least get my order right.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I loved the decor, I loved the service and I absolutely loved the food. Everything was fresh. The waitress knew the dishes and the ingredients just perfectly.  I will be going back for sure. Thanks Nana...you guys rock!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great place..good atmosphere...really good food. It's not cheap but worth it.Try the chef's tasting menu. Really good, lot's of courses, it's about $50/person but you get so much high quality cuisine. If you order individual tapas it will cost more for less.Lunch is great there also and cheaper.One of my favorite Chicago restaurants","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have dos palabras para ustedes: HUEVOS RANCHEROS. Seriously dude, the huevos rancheros are to die for!! My one complaint about this place is that you have to order at the counter and then just stand there until a table becomes available. I personally prefer to be waited on, and found it a little stressful that we all ordered and then had to just chill there, lurking over this poor table while they were trying to enjoy their own huevos rancheros! Also, we were meeting a friend so it didn't really work right because we ordered, they were late, then we ended up getting our food before they even ordered. I think typically the staff tries to time everything out, so the fact that we were served so far in advance was a mistake they apologized for, but it was still annoying. They had really good coffee as well. I ordered a vanilla latte and enjoyed every ounce of it. They don't have a TON of selection, nor did it seem they had your typical bacon, eggs and toast variety. If you did want that, you would have had to order a bunch of sides. That = pure lameness. Luckily, the huevos rancheros had my name on it and I would come back here for brunch so long as I got here before the crowds started up, just to avoid the wait. Also, a long time ago I bought some cinnamon donuts here, which were also pretty bomb. Highly recommend those little sweet nuggets. Other than that...oh they had a nice outdoor seating area as well. Too bad we are about to enter the blistering cold months here in Chicago, but I'll have to put this on my to do list for when the weather starts to cheer up a bit.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Excellent coffee. This place also gets a lot of little things right about how to be a good coffee house - the music is the right volume, the staff are the right balance of helpful and laid-back, and the wi-fi works all the time. Can't speak for the baked goods.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Eat here eat here eat here eat here.I've been to XOCO and Frontera, and I grew up watching Mexico: One Plate At A Time. Which means that I love Rick Bayless a lot, and his food soared above my expectations.Yes, it's a bit pricey, but very filling. Yes, the lines get long--the wait can be unbelievable--but 100% worth it. TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. Come with friends so that you can chat while you wait. I'd also come before you're hungry since you'll probably be in the line for a while.I've had both their soups and salads, and they're wonderful. Well-seasoned and very filling. The guac and salsa is also excellent. If you like hot chocolate that leans towards bitter over sweet, then try theirs--if nothing else, it's a unique experience. I'm also usually a fan of stuffed churros over not, but these ones are AMAZING. Try them. You won't regret it. The dipping sauce and ice-cream combo are drool-worthy.If you're looking for a quiet night out or a date-like place, I wouldn't come here. It does get packed. However, you should DEFINITELY come here with some friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So, we were fortunate enough to score Sunday dinner reservations after the restaurant moved from its phone-based reservation system to the 'Next-like online ticketing system. I can honesty say that this was the pinnacle of dining experiences for me - that every fine dining establishment from this point forward will be judged against my experience. I'm not sure if this is fair, because Grant Achatz and team set an insanely high bar.  Prior to dining at Alinea, literally an hour before, I finished reading Grant and Nick's autobiography 'Life on the Line'. I appreciated having the insight into the creative passion and love for food that drives Alinea staff. I'm also slated for a trip to San Francisco in the Fall and am very much looking forward to scoring (hopefully) reservations at The French Laundry, which had a huge influence on Chef Achatz. Fingers crossed that my redial finger make it through to the reservationists.  Back to Alinea - We're not going course-by-course in this review, as I agree with many other Yelpers, that just simply ruins the experience. Although, I'm guessing that the Fall menu isn't too far from around the corner, which has me eager to go back for sure. From the time you check-in with the doorman to the moment you step through into the darkened, wedge-like hallway, your dinner begins and it doesn't stop for almost four hours. Every detail is meticulously considered and it shows - at the time I confirmed our reservations and any dietary restrictions or other notes of importance for the staff, I did not notify them that my other half was left handed. I didn't realize that was even a reason to make a special note, but at Alinea it is. Once they realized he was left handed, every course was situated and placed correctly in front of him.  I know for some the ticketing system has been a nightmare (and the person who rated the restaurant one star based on her inability to get a reservation really irks me), but perseverance and patience will pay off. If you get a reservation or have the opportunity to make one - don't think about it, just do it, turn yourself over to Alinea staff and be prepared to be blown away.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been dying for this place to open! They were supposed to open in September, but just opened last week. It sucked, but whatever, it's so well worth the wait! When we got there on this past saturday night, it was incredibly busy, which I was happy about for support on local businesses, but we got seated pretty fast (there was just the two of us though, so that's why) The chips and salsa was very good. The salsa is fresh and they refill it for you. We ended up getting a pitcher of strawberry margaritas and I was determined to finish it. We both got a dinner combination, which was i think 9 or 8 dollars each but it more than filled us up and enough to take home. For the price and the amount of food they give you for it is really affordable. The pitcher of margaritas cost around $27, but it gave us enough for four drinks each, full to the top! It's a cute place and the remodeling opened it up alot. I love this place, we go to it all the time! I take my friends here and to Bowman's when they come to visit, and they all love it as well!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So glad to find such a restaurant that serves legit Asian food and is NOT in Chinatown. That means greater services and much better ambiance, which make your dining experience holistically better Bamboos, mirrors, and wooden frames dotted the dining area while bamboo chopsticks are neatly placed on the ceramic place waiting to serve. It's a great night dining in the illusion of space and time. We ordered: Fresh Spring Roll: all materials are tastably fresh, but not very flavorful without the sauce Roasted Duck: best roasted duck I've had outside of Asia. This entree was downed in no time. Sliced beef sirloin with lettuce wrap: WARNING! this shares the same idea with a lettuce wrap appetizer. Beware what you order SIDE DISH- Grilled Eggplant! This is heavenly. It's nothing like the soggy grilled eggplant you get in Italian restaurants. This is legit thinly sliced small cut eggplants marinated with Asian spices, garlic and a kick of lemon. I would come back just for this dish, to be honest. Overall though, entree could be better. if you are craving for real Asian food, go to Argyle/ Chinatown. yet if you are willing to budge on taste and get compensated in ambiance, come to Le Colonial","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been a long time Glenn's patron, even being one of the first ones to discover Glen's. When we first found Glenn's, it was amazing. relatively small amount of customers made a nice atmosphere and the food was very good and unique, something that would make you crave Glenn's because no where else had their style of food. However over the few months its been open it has become immensely popular, and yesterday, we say many people standing around open table, waiting to be seated at 10:00 A.M.. When I asked if we could sit at one of the open tables they said that they those tables are reserved. RESERVED!!! for breakfast. Sorry Glenn but you sold out","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is my kind of pizza! The thin, chewy crust that is charred on the edges is my favorite in the city. And I adore how you can actually taste the ingredients: tomatoes, olive oil and basis without a dairy overload from a mountain of cheese. I think Italian is done best when the flavors are clean and it's not weighed down wiht heavy sauce or cream. My friend has raved about this place for years and now I'm hooked too.

"Having just had a great time with friends here last night, I felt the need to share how wonderful this place is. Last night was a typically great night at The Violet Hour. The hostess for the night did our routine ID checks and when she saw mine, she wished me a happy b-lated bday. Then, I remembered how I should have reviewed the night of my 30th birthday on Saturday Dec. 18th at this wonderful establishment:I showed up early as I had been here before and knew I had to be here at open if I had a chance of sitting in the back area with a decent sized group. I showed up with 10 people and with 6 more on the way to meet me. The hostess for the night was completely amazing. She offered to split our group and knowing this was a special night she made sure all my friends knew where I was seated so I could greet them when they came in. I had 16 people in my party and I was able to mingle and catch up with everyone. The hostess came back to make sure my whole party was seated and asked before she removed one of the seating stools from one of the tables that wasn't being used. Then made sure there wasn't anything else I needed. She was completely friendly, accommodating and professional. The waitress for our table was amazing at describing drinks for the newbies and recommending drinks for the ones that had been here before. SUPERB SERVICE.Everyone left thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere, service and quality of drinks/food. I made sure to thank the hostess of the end of the night for the wonderful experience (I wish I remembered her name!). I was one happy birthday girl. Thank you Violet Hour.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My experience at Bin 36 can only be described as divine. Their House Smoked Salmon was rich and decadent and their recommended pairing of Bin 2 - NV Vouvray, Demi-sec, Vigneau-Chevreau, ""Petillant,"" - was perfect, the bubbles beautifully cleansed my palate and the crisp juicy flavor was a wonderful counterpoint. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and, best of all, passionate. I noticed their cheese-monger restocking the cheese chill chest and struck up a conversation. In no time he had brought out a cheese plate with his favorites for me to sample, on the house. Log off the computer and go!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My first visit to this restaurant was OK. Our server was very nice and offered a few specials, but the food for person in our came out about five minutes later than the rest and one appetizer never came at all. Given this is a neighborhood place and BYO, I am willing to look past this point. The food is very average, I challenge someone to point out a dish at this restaurant that is done better than at any other Italian Restaurant in the city save Buca di Beppo. Went back...err...tried to go back for seconds last night and have never been treated so poorly in my life. Our entire party was not there and the host made it a point that we needed all people there to be seated (OK) and informed us that at 6:15 that our reservation would be lost. Mind you the restaurant is half-empty at this point. Upon the arrival of the rest of our party at 6:19, we were told that our reservation was lost and that we were not welcome. The owner/manager needs a serious attitude adjustment, and given the mediocre food, should be more accommodating to his guests. I am simply dumbfounded at what a prick the manager was (an older couple that had an incomplete party and was waiting agreed). Hey asshole - you still only have three other occupied tables in the restaurant and it's well before prime supper time on a Saturday. Ended up at the Cuban restaurant next door where we were treated with good food, great service and respect.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've lived most of my life in Chicago and missed Chicago pizza when I moved out of state. I LOVE Giordano's pizza. HOWEVER, while visiting the Mag Mile I tried to order a pizza without tomato sauce for my child who has a food sensitivity. The manager of the 730 N. Rush street location (Robert) refused to accommodate my 10 year old's disability and was horribly rude in the process including hanging up on my wife. All we asked was for a small thin crust pizza with butter instead of tomato sauce. Not exactly an excessive demand. He could have at least been friendly about the refusal.

"Foie gras duck sausage hot dog??? Yes please! We came on a Monday afternoon and there was a line peeking out the door. I guess it's true, there's always a line. While we were in line, the people in front of us started talking and we got involved in a conversation with them, and our 30 minute wait went by a lot quicker. The outside is kind of boring looking, very unassuming, but the inside is kitschy and bright and fun. Lots of primary colors. Lots of hot dog options, and I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of them. We ordered: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel: Woah. So tasty, so decadent, so fatty, so bad for my arteries, but SO GOOD. The sausage itself reminded me of the Taiwanese style pork sausages (for those familiar with longanisa, the Filipino sausage, it's kind of similar). Slightly sweet, very rich. A must try. Crayfish and pork sausage with shrimp remoulade and creme fraiche: Yummy but the creme fraiche had a very goat cheese-y taste to it.  We had another 2 hot dogs that were a Jack Daniels fennel pork sausage with something and then the other one had something with smoked gouda. I can't quite recall and the website and menu seems to change daily, but I remember them being very tasty as well. They were a little pricey but you are getting gourmet hot dogs. We had to take the train to the California stop and then hail a tax because it would've been a 1.5 mile walk to Hot Doug's, so just as an FYI, it's not super easy to get to without a car or taxi.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was lucky enough to get a groupon for brazzaz, which worked out perfect because it was a restaurant that my husband wanted to go to for his b-day!Anyways, we got dressed up (not required but it was fun!) and we went to the restaurant. When we pulled up, we noticed that there was valet. BUT in the same building, not more then 20 feet away was a parking garage. why pay their fees and tip when I can park my own car...however...I must warn anyone who decides to park their car in there, or let them park your car....be aware of crazy valet drivers. because one hit my husband as he whipped around the corner in someones brand new lincoln town-car. he made a sudden stop and didn't hit my husband hard, but they definitely made contact. i was frozen in shock. i couldn't believe what i just witnessed. Needless to say I complained to the restaurant, and they said it was a contract account that they hire for valet. I took off a star because I feel like they just shrugged it off like it wasn't their problem. which I understand to a point, but come on...you hire these crazy people to park your customers cars....I took it upon myself to call the valet service the next morning. so I took care of it.however, enough about that, and lets get on to the review..the atmosphere was very nice...it was dark, but not too dark, they had great colors, and great decor. They have a HUGE salad bar, with much more then salad.We had a lovely waitress named Vanessa. She was a doll. Very attentive and helpful. I love the fact that they have the endless servings of meat. they really have about 50 people walking around with all types of meats. I had a full plate and it was so delicious. one piece of advice, Go there HUNGRY. We had a very good bottle of champagne to celebrate his bday. It was very nice, because we had the bottle at the table, but they would pour it for you, and when glass is almost empty, they will come back around and fill your glass back up. refold your napkins, take your finished plates and give you new ones to start eating all over again. it was great and i recommend this place to anyone wanting a great meal..","[1.0, 0.0]"

I decided to switch from my usual burger and try the Godfather meatball sandwich, and it rocked my world!

"I had to do a review on this place.... best seafood in the city and so many options. Went on a Sunday at about 4pm, brunch was over (the menu that goes only until 3pm is great) and we were told so many reservations that we could not be seated until 8pm!!!!! I was a little shocked a restaurant would reserve the whole place and annoyed, but we sat at the bar to eat.We had a wonderful fish spread for an apptizer, but it was served with Ritz Crackers, yuck. We asked for the basket of crackers and ate it with those instead. For a main course, the fish pot pie was wonderful, warm, great crust but a little small in size for the price, but once I saw how many shirmp were inside, decided it was a good deal. Other meal was pretzel encrusted fish, so good. Only thing the veggies on the side were undercooked and when I mentioned to the server behind the bar he replied, That can't be right, they cook those through all the time What, do you think I was lying? Service was very good except for that comment. Server took the food and its presentation almost too personal and was very excited over the menu, nice guy but gave out weird vibe.Things to know about this place:This was the worst experience I ever had here and still the food was awesome, so in summary, you can't go wrong, even on a bad day its great!Very small, call ahead for reservationsThe all you can eat crab is great, but good luck getting into the restaurant for a seat, outside patio is a good betGreat beer listService is good, sometimes over happy, if possibleTartar sauce is best I have ever hadPo Boy Sanwiches are great, especially the catfishNOT a place for groups, only go with 2/3 peopleA little expensive, but its season in a relaxed enviroment so enjoy","[1.0, 0.0]"

The host/manager looking guy asked several times about how we made our reso but seated us right away (nice recovery)--BTW, never told them I was celebrating a birthday. What was off-putting to me, was that as our server (finally--longer than expected) came to the table, I was opening some birthday cards at the table and I told him ""I'm opening some birthday cards"", and he said, ""are you telling me this so I'll give you a free dessert?"" Awk moment. Natch we told him no. He struck up a convo with my husband about fishing that was unusually long (ok, I can over look this), but then when he gave us dessert menus and we declined to order dessert, he said, ""Oh, is that because you expect a free dessert from the restaurant for your birthday?"" We of course said no. I thought the food was great. The restaurant was loud (which we knew it would be). We don't go out a lot, so we were looking forward to having someone take care of us and to haveing some great food. I don't care about cake. I had had several pieces earlier that day from my work mates. It was what he said and how he handled it. I've told 15+ people so far about this.

"Until we check out Brazzaz, Texas de Brazil is AS GOOD AS IT GETS!I heard many positive words floating around about Texas de Brazil. So when the opportunity came to attend via GROUPON! I jumped at the chance. We decided to go on a Wednesday after work. I assumed it would be a very slow night because who else in Chicago wants all you can eat meat on a Wednesday beside cuisine connoisseurs such as ourselves? I was wrong. While it wasn't super packed there was a constant flow of people, which lets you know this place is as great as everyone is making it out to be!The FOOD: Fantastic. I decided to opt out of the salad bar. (Hey I figure I am paying $50 per plate for meat so I am going to consume as much as possible.) Our meals turned out to be worth every penny. I had Parmesan Chicken, Parmesan Pork, BBQ Pork Ribs, Garlic Steak, Filet Mignon, Picanha Sausage, Sirloin, House Specialty Beef..... you get the picture. (I really wanted to try those beef ribs but those sucker were so big and my stomach was already so full..but don't worry mr. beef rib, I will be back for you :-)At one point in time there was so much meat on my plate I thought I would keel over! The SIDES: Our table came equipped with mash potatoes and plantains to cleanse the palate. Heather consumed a great amount of potatoes. Once again I opted to eat only a spoon full as I did not want to get full from sides and salads. Remember, this journey is all about the meat! At the very end of our meal, as I was about to call for the check, dessert was brought to the table of a lovely couple sitting in front of us, The dessert was fresh strawberries blended with vanilla ice cream. Now I know what your thinking, Just say they had strawberry ice cream! But no, it was more than that! I was full, super full. But I found away to make room in my stomach for one last hoorah and it was so worth it. This was the most refreshing dessert ever. The fresh strawberries whipped beautifully with the vanilla ice cream was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. As we ate our dessert we were privy to watch the entertainment in the winesellar. There a young lady performed acrobatic movements while selecting the wine of each patrons choice!The COST: 2 plates cost $99.99 total and the two desserts were:$15.50 total. With tax the price was $121.00 for a meal and dessert for two people. We opted not to drink so if you would like a glass or bottle, expect to pay more. As I mentioned I went on a groupon so it reduced by bill to $65! I felt like it was a total steal!!All in all I give it 5 stars. I also would like to recommend our waitress Nina! she was Fab.

Having drilled through a few cups of coffee with sugar and a pancake with white chocolate and bananas and god knows what else, I probably (happily) got a month's worth of sugar-intake. It was worth it, obviously, and the food was good, but it would be hard to keep coming back to.

"Near the el. Check! Easy to spot sign. Check! And when we sat down we were only given the drink menu. No entree menu. Hmm, did they forget? No, apparently, they want you to order drinks first. Thought it was going to be a gastropub but really dark and trendy inside. Highlights were the truffle popcorn and foie-lollypops. We liked some things on the five course tasting menu. Like the parmesan infused brioche in the deconstructed cesear salad and the skate was delicious. Chicken with carrot was ok. Dessert of chocolate with vinaigrette was so decadent. Although the food was very tasty it was small portions on a big plate. Understand this was a tasting and the portions were smaller than the normal entree portions...but I was still hungry a couple of hours later. Wished there was more food for $75. Very tasty food in every bite. Maybe that is what Chef Elliot is trying to achieve, not engorging us like in other restaurants. How did they know my husband likes Built to Spill songs?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Well I would think that ""duck fat fries"" should pretty much sum up why I love this place, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

"We were treated to a ""thank you"" dinner by some friends for dog sitting. Boy did we get the good end of the deal. We were seated outside in a corner table with padded benches and umbrella covering. The food was excellent. The appetizers, the meats/poultry and the sides.  The Chicago size portions were ample and reasonably priced. The service was spot on from the hostess to our servers, bartender and many wait staff.  I lived in the area when this was Tsunami. It is a good thing they have gutted the place and it is completely fresh and beautiful inside and out. No pressure - just a beautiful experience. I would recommend to anyone who isn't vegan.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"this was my 1st time inside an authentic greek bakery, so i was very excited about seeing their selection of pastries. unfortunately, i was too full after dinner to eat anything else, but that didn't stop me from picking up a few things for breakfast the next morning. after much deliberation, i chose: 1. galaktoboureko ($3.50) - thin phyllo dough pastry with lemon custard filling. the phyllo dough wasn't as flaky as i'd have expected, and it was slightly soggy from the honey. the lemon custard was delicious, thick and creamy and not overly sweet. 2. walnut baklava ($2.95) - rich and dense chopped walnut filling inside phyllo dough. the chopped walnuts mixed with honey were delicious, maybe a touch too sweet, but delicious. the phyllo dough shell was flaky and laced with honey. note they also serve sandwiches and american desserts. delicious, authentic greek desserts that were a tasty breakfast treat for me. this is another place that i'd visit on my return trip to chicago.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My colleague and I scoped this place out months in advance of attending a conference in Chicago, and it was one of our big food excursions while we were in town. When we arrived, the line was down the block, and it ended up being about an hour wait. Totally worth it, though. I had perused the menu online earlier that day, and I decided I wanted both a more gourmet dog (the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage, with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris) and a more simple Elvis dog (smoked Polish sausage). And duck fat fries, of course. It was really hard to decide, though, because so many of the menu items sounded so tantalizing. What really made this 5 stars was the service, believe it or not. When we finally arrived at the counter, I was worried that I didn't have enough cash to cover everything I wanted. I asked the guy at the counter how much it would be without the fries, because I wasn't sure if I had enough. He looked at me and said, don't be silly! Don't deprive yourself of duck fat fries just because of cash! We can work this out. I was like, um, OK, I guess I'll get the duck fat fries then. He didn't even use a cash register, he just eyeballed my order and said, eh, that looks like about $15. I'm sure it would have been more than that if he actually added it up, but I'm definitely not complaining. Later I found out that it was Doug Sohn, the owner himself. He also talked me down from a medium drink to a small since there were free refills. What a nice guy! As we sat down to eat, the staff was very friendly, asking us if there was anything we needed, taking our trash, etc. They run this place very efficiently and seem to manage the crowds well. The foie gras dog was decadent and perhaps even a little too over the top, because it was hard to taste the duck sausage what with everything else going on. But that simple smoked Polish dog was sheer perfection. I'm glad I ordered both, because it gave me the chance to try both sides of the coin (not to mention I wolfed both down so fast, if I had only gotten one I would still have been hungry, and that would have meant getting back in the hour-long line). The duck fat fries, as one might expect, were fries like no other. Despite the wait, I would come here again and again to try all the different flavors, which change frequently. I loved the great service!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The food was good enough and the pizza we split was delicious, however the service was among the WORST we had ever had. The waiter had an attitude from the moment we sat down and was disgruntled to see we had brought our own bottle of wine. Really? Why the attitude when you charge a $15 corkage fee? I suppose this was the reason why the waiter refused to return to our table ONCE to fill our glasses. Once the food arrived, the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes. Good thing they have much more attentive bussers who were able to assist us. Long and short, the food is not nearly great enough to overcome poor, unattentive service. Fortunately, we have many great Italian restaurants in this town to go back to!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went with a group of about 14 friends last Wednesday. We had reservations and had requested that 2 ducks be set aside for us. Service from the start was quite slow. It's a huge restaurant and they did seem to be quite busy with a large group in the back. It took them quite awhile to get to us and to take our orders. We asked to have an additional duck added to our order. After about 20 minutes (some people had food already) they came out to inform us they had no extra ducks. This would have been fine if they had told us this initially, but at this point we were all quite hungry after watching some of our friends finish their food. When the ducks did finally come out they were delicious. It was my first time with duck and I really enjoyed it - particularly the fried rice. It's BYOB but with a corkage fee as they have a full bar there. Aside from the service issues, the food was all quite good and I will go back, but with a smaller group and ensuring that we requested the exact number of ducks ordered.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Our server was super friendly and attentive, but problems arose when the tapas arrived at the table. Each person ordered for themselves but the food runner said the name of the dish and put it on the table. It would be helpful for the item to be placed with the person who ordered them to avoid a vegetarian eating a dish containing meat. Just a small change that I'm sure would help the busy brunch staff!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We dined at Anteprima for the second time last night and for the second time enjoyed the food, but were disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because we weren't ready the first time the waiter came to take our order, but after ordering and beginning to drink a bottle of wine, we waited what seemed like an eternity to order food. A similar painful would-be eternity came between the dropping off of the dessert menu and the return of the waiter.  Ok, so I sound whiney. But there's just something maddening about seeing your waiter flit across the room, cut bread at the bar, and chit chat with co-workers when you desperately want to order! On a more satisfying note, the food is delicious. We tried the octopus starter as many yelpers suggested--wonderful. The portions are sensible. So the food is great, service questionable. My final comment is on the phenomenon of small, trendy restaurants like this that pack in diners to create a very loud, claustrophobic atmosphere. Why do we flock to these places? Is the food really that great? or does the reservations-only buzz create a false sense of urgency? I mean, I'm not gonna lie--I felt somewhat special being a part of this seemingly elite room. ""We know what's up. Look at us and our delicious, expensive food."" Makes everything taste better, I guess :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If you have the means, and you are actually looking at yelp reviews to decide, stop. Just go. It's an experience. I'm only reviewing to give a word of advice on the wine pairing.

If we had known this ahead of time, I'm sure we would have asked for an abbreviated pairing without the desert wines. I bet they would have done that for us. If not, you really can't go wrong ordering a bottle of champagne to sip throughout the meal. Small sidenote: If anyone went there this fall and took pictures of their food, would you mind sending me a message?

"If I gave this place 2 stars, it would indicate that I'd try it again, and I wouldn't. This is easily the worst Thai food I've had in Chicago, and that's saying a lot because there are a lot of Thai places in Chicago and I've been to many of them. We went on a Monday in the middle of a rainstorm and were probably the only ones in the dining room, which looked nice but was uncomfortable since their wall length booth was broken and slanted. Overall I was really really dissapointed since I had heard ""best Thai food at Opart"" over and over again. The shu-mai appetizer could have come out of a Costco box, my spicy entree tasted spicy, and that's about it. Just chili, no other spices or flavors, and the beef, green beans and onions could have been presented better. His noodle dish tasted awful in a too sweet gravy that was so oily and unappetizing. The waitress/hostess didn't smile once and was sorting silverware at the counter just feet away from our table and apparently had no awareness or care to stop making such a ruckus. She was also oblivious to other details. For example, I asked for hot water and lemon: 1. She brought the hot water in a water glass, and not a mug. Too hot to hold. 2. She brought a lime, because they didn't have lemon. Really? Thai cravers, go to Roseded Thai on Leland across the street, that place is awesome.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Grand Lux is AMAZINGI've never been there for an actual meal, because it is somewhat pricey, but their desserts are fabulous. big portions make up for the big prices, and most of the desserts can be easily shared between two people, they are very heavy and rich. The decor of this place is beautiful, very classy. You can watch the chefs at work if you like, and that in itself is pretty nice. All in all it is a beautiful classy roomy place, yet it is somewhat comfortable too. They don't have a dress code so you can go in dressed up, or in jeans and a t-shirt (as several of my friends were when we went) If you go, make sure to request the round room, it looks right out over Michigan Avenue, very pretty and romantic. As far a recomendations, I got the apple crisp, which was fantastic, served warm with ice cream. Also I tried my friend's molten chocolate cake.

I guess my expectations were pretty high based on most of the glowing reviews. I was looking forward to a romantic dinner with good food.

"I want to like this place, like wanting to like a new hire with a good resume. On paper, great potential: in my hood, BYOB, a bit out of the way, homey interior, etc. But the food is just, well, not showing up for work. For starters, it's a bit on the pricey side for what is basically standard, old-school Italian. I can understand this to a point given that they need to compensate for being BYOB, but, again, to take the whole co-worker analogy and beat it like a dead horse, it's like realizing that you shouldn't have given them that lucrative package. When it comes to Italian, it all starts and ends with a red sauce. Even if I only get a taste by dipping my bread, this most simple of elements has to be right since it goes into pizzas, dipping for calamari, pastas, pizza, etc. So you know where I'm going...red sauce is bland and just off, to my tongue. In fact, everything seems to be missing that 'tastiness' factor to me that makes me crave the food. Sometimes good service can cover me sins, but even here, it's somehow not either the nice restaurant you don't even know they're there, or the friendly 'neighborhood' vibe thing. So, when the contract renewal comes up for this gig, I'm going to have to pass.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Service was okay, nothing bad happened but kind of forgettable.  I had the brisket sandwich which is open faced and came with fries for $15. The fries were surprisingly great, being that I'm more of a fan of skinny fries than the big honking ones. But these were seasoned well and weren't totally potato-ey... you know what I mean?

"The thing is, I want to love The Chicago Diner, every time I go I look at the menu and am so excited at all the choices I have to choose from. Then I order something and it's usually lacking flavor! Maybe I'd be able to give this place 5 stars if I didn't know how to cook most of the stuff on their menu, BUT I make wayyyyyy tastier dishes than they do. Being a Vegetarian/Vegan does not mean that your dishes need to be flavorless!! Is it because the cooks in the kitchen aren't Vegetarians? Do they just not care that the food lacks flavor?? I know that Jo is an amazing Chef but I'm starting to think she has no part in the restaurant anymore. It seems as though there is no quality control.To sum it up: The Chicago Diner is really a hit or miss.

I went around Texas' salad bar least 3 times just to make sure I had everything I wanted to try! :-) The Meat service was great! Again, because it was restaurant week I was fearful we would be overlooked and not have the opportunity to try everything we wanted.... I was wrong! As soon as we turned our cards over to green the servers catered to us, coming by several times throughout the night with every offering on the menu. And everything was incredible... the temperature, the taste, all perfect. Every bite I took was supremely satisfying....Towards the end of the night I motioned for one server to stop by as he was going back to get more of the house speciality and he kept walking! Thinking he ignored my request, I was a little disappointed.... UNTIL he promptly returned within minutes, directly to our table to serve us first!!! He had taken notice after all. Nice!

"Let me just start by saying that I am not from Chicago. I live in a little suburb of Dallas and I have always loved my quiet little town.

The last reservation they accept is at 1:30, and they basically keep bringing out food as long as people are eating. You don't have to worry about ""missing the good stuff"" because everything is refilled pretty quickly. We started out at the cold food table, enjoying some delicious seafood pasta, king crab, cocktail shrimp, oysters, ceviche, and sushi. Everything was amazing. I especially enjoyed the crab and the pasta, where my husband was fawning over the oysters, shrimp, and ceviche.  About this time we discovered the Bloody Mary / Mimosa station, which is an additional $5 to your meal. Another great selection of delicious beverages, definitely worth the extra bucks. Onto the next table, I had steamed snow crab legs, broc & cheese with lobster sauce, jumbo fried shrimp, and lobster penne pasta with creme sauce. Mmm... My husband also had the steak, and a few other sides... all of which he thoroughly enjoyed. Did I mention they have lobster bisque? Oh yes they do. Finally, I found some lobster bisque SO GOOD that it challenges the ""best bowl"" that was previously on my list. I think this is it, folks. It's amazing and it's on a brunch buffet. I cannot stress this enough : do not leave this building without putting bisque in your face. Finally, there is the sweet room. It is an entire room full of dessert options that you don't really have room for but must eat. So, we wandered in and painstakingly selected a variety of sweet treats to try. From the fudge to the chocolate, the mouse to the strawberries, everything was divine. It was especially fun to watch kids wander into this room unprepared, looking like little lost children in Willy Wonka's word. I watched a girl giggle madly while she plucked cotton candy down from the tree and then skipped off with a plate full of candy.  It is a beautiful world here at Shaws. It's probably a GOOD THING I do not live in Chicago, because I would gain 20lbs every Sunday.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Absolutely phenomal. I've been back twice in one week. The first time I had the seafood caldos (about $12) and it was incredible. I would've paid twice the price for this dish. The ingredients were very fresh and the broth was seasoned to perfection. We followed up with a churos and soft serve, which was excellent. Rick Bayless was also there working hard behind the counter, which was great to see. He literally tasted everything before it went out and was working just as hard as anyone in the restaurant. To say this guy is passionate about his work is an understatement. The second time I had the choriqueso sandwich and instantly fell in love. It's under $9 and is probably the best sandwich I've ever had.This place is probabaly the greatest deal in Chicago and a must-try for anyone!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Bongo Room is so good, and so dangerous. Thank god I don't live anywhere near this place because I would definitely be a regular patron of their delicious and indulgent menu. I always bring people here when they're visiting from out of town, I woo them with this brunch.   I've been here many times and the food has always been amazing. I've had some of the savory items like the breakfast burrito, croissant sandwich, and one of the best omelettes of my life (muenster, spinach, canadian bacon), but the REAL reason to come here is for their pancake options.  I've had so many different kinds and they have never disappointed. After the first bite of each new plate of pancakes, I do my hand-to-the-mouth-gesture and almost cry with joy. They change them up all the time which is both good (variety) and bad (the amazing dishes can never be ordered again). My favorites have been banana & crunch bar, pumpkin cheesecake, banana/peanut butter/chocolate, and smores. It's also a huge serving and I've never seen anyone finish an entire plate...you will earn my respect if you do.  A few things I don't love about this place: 1. The home fries/hashbrowns are covered with too many spices, I think it's overwhelming 2. There is always a long wait no matter what time you show up, expect at least 20-30 minutes 3. This is their biggest downfall and one of my BIGGEST pet peeves...they push you out before you are done with your meal. Last time we had our waitress come by 3 times in about 15 minutes and replace the check in front of us each time....we get it, you want us to leave so you can serve other people.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Lettuce Entertain You restaurants (generally) know their stuff, and Wildfire is no exception. Wildfire doesn't blow me away, but the food is good, atmosphere is pleasant, prices are reasonable, and service is great.  My husband and I went to the downtown location for a last minute Friday night dinner - we were sat right away, which was fabulous. We started with wine and the bacon wrapped scallops (very good, but had a bit of grit). He had the bone-in ribeye (medium) for an entree, I had the petit filet (medium rare)... My steak was grossly overcooked - it was medium well+. His was well done. It was so sad, I hate to waste food, especially meat. Our waiter came by and asked how we were and I told him I though my steak was a bit overdone, and he was so apologetic, totally agreed that it was severely overdone, and said that he would get another one going right away. The same for my husband. I hate sending food back, I really do, so when the waiter treated us so well I felt better about it... The second time around was much better, cooked perfectly plus he brought our sides out again. As far as sides go - mashed potatos are wonderful - creamy, flavorful, with the skins still there. The creamed spinach was just okay - I like it more at Ruth's Chris. But, they have so many sides to choose from, there's something for everyone. When the bill came he comped part of out meal - it was very refreshing and again made us feel good about being there. We'll of course be back. I mean really, you can't go wrong with Wildfire.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"There are so many reviews L&E I was on the fence about submitting one. However, it is so amazing I have to voice my most recent experience! Appetizers and Small Plates: My friend and I ordered the Bone Marrow, Meatballs, and Olives to start with a bottle of Rose'. The Bone Marrow is different than other restaraunts because they provide you with salt and a jelly on the top which makes it a different and yummy experience. The meatballs have an bold but not overpowering herbacious taste with a delicous marinara sauce and sits on top of an amazing bed of polenta. I could honestly eat entire bowel of this and be happy. The olives are a nice compliment to the heavier appetizers and have several different sizes and flavors and are marinated perfectly. They are not overpowering with flavor and are done just right. Big Plates: We split this amazing porchetta dish that just melted in your mouth. The flavor of the meat was buttery and salty and the risotto underneath was perfectly cooked with just the right sized vegetables and creaminess. Mmmmmm We also split the clam in white wine dish (sorry don't have the exact name and the menu online is not up to date). The white wine broth was extremely flavorful. The wine and the herbs everything mixed nicely. What stood out to me the most with this dish though was how perfectly the clams were cooked. They were silky and moist and flavorful. The service: Waitress was perfect hipster friendly and knew exactly when to come, food timing was solid, bus boys knew exactly when to take our plates away, and the recommendations were right on. The price: For the quality of food you get, the flavor, the service, very affordable and worth every penny Overall: A place so good you yearn to go back over and over again. It's not a fancy meal place where you enjoy it but never return. It's one of those places you can schedule dinner with your friends, have a week night excursion just cuz, a anniversary dinner, or a first date. Perfect for all!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"FINALLY decided to try this place out after driving by a dozen times and saying ""we really need to try that place out sometime"" - and all I can say is WOW - why ohhh why did I not try Irazu sooner???? We had the following items: -Veggie Burrito w/sauteed mushrooms added in - 5 stars! I'm a meat eater and this was EASILY one of the best burritos I've ever had. that should tell you how amazing it is. -Pineapple Empanada - 4 stars - sweet & tasty -Black Bean Empanada - 3 stars black bean flavor was a bit overpowering -Beef & Potato Empanada - 5 stars - yummy! -Plantain Empanada - 5 stars! This was EXCELLENT! -Spinach & Cheese Empanada - 4 stars! Cheesy yummy goodness :) -Oatmeal Shake - 5 Stars! yum yum yum yum yum! All of that and our total bill was $21... amazing value for such delicious food! do yourself a favor and give Irazu a chance next time you're looking for some place new to try! you will not be disappointed.. oh yeah - and its BYOB too! ;)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Mezz a mezz. Means ""meh"" in Italian, FYI. High end Italian cuisine, not worth the lengthy wait for a reservation. Nice patio, but in a crap neighborhood. Pretentious patrons abound. I think this is where old Hipsters dine when their Trust Fund disbursements arrive. I'm taking away the third star because it's a fairly pricey place, yet we discovered when the check arrived that two in our party that had soft drinks were charged for each refill. LOL! Very very pimpy, Piccolo Sogno. $15 for 3 fountain diet Pepsis? I know you want to be as authentic as possible, but please remember you're in a dodgy meat packing district and not *actually* in Italia. In a sentence... Food for assholes.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I agree the management is horrible. I've came here on a Sat. night when the place was busy (not to long ago) and was treated horribly by a male host only to sit an hour later after I had reservations. They simply didn't care we were on a time schedule. It was very upsetting when were leaving to find the manager leaning against the bar chatting with the host and staring at his feet. No goodbye have a good night! I probably will never be back at this location as I found Taylor Street to be very attentive.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"The first couple of times I went there, I thought that this was the best stuffed pizza I had ever had. Wonderful.  However, the need to remove the sign that says ""Pizza By The Slice"" because they hardly ever have stuffed sausage pizza anymore. ""Oh, were out and won't be another 30 minutes before..."" OR ""The kitchen is backed up and won't make any...do you want spinach instead?"" NO, I don't want spinach pizza that has been sitting there for 2 hours. I have counted 7 straight times that I went there to see if they had stuffed sausage pizza...nada. I only go to see if they can prove me wrong, which they haven't. And it's on my way home. Their new slogan needs to be ""Pizza by the slice...if we feel like making it"" OR ""Pizza by the slice if you are lucky."" I call it the Art of wasting time in line. ***Update*** I just went in and was lucky they had some fine slices of Stuffed Sausage... Next time I go in and don't have to wait will increase their rating.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Brought girlfriend here for her birthday. Note that I told the staff we were coming here for her birthday. Yet, despite the request, we were initially seated at a table by the bus station. If it's one pet peeve I possess, it's being seated next to a bus station, especially when I requested a nice, intimate table. However, after this small hiccup, the experience was wonderful and just as everyone had described from fellow Yelpers to Metromix and Chicago Magazine. Armed with 2 bottles of Otto's Dream Sauvignon Blanc (one of the finest wines I've ever tasted and a great option with sushi), we got a nice intimate table in the back after waiting an extra 15 minutes. Because of the prior inconvenience, we were given complimentary Miso. The rolls here are unlike those of generic sushi place. The ingenuity and originality that the chefs here put in is truly untouchable minus a few of the other sushi elites in the city. We tried a spider roll, which exceeded expectations, really packed a punch. Then we had the unique ""ceviche"" roll which was better than we expected. Finally, we finished with the oyster roll - also great, I had never had oysters in sushi. At the conclusion of the meal, the waitress brought a trio of complimentary ice cream scoops. Coffee, green tea, and cinnamon (I think...) - all delicious and a cap to a nice evening. This could possibly be the best BYOB in Chicago.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been hearing about Piece from a lot of my Chicago friends, so I was glad to have experienced it during my last visit to my hometown. The place was packed, which I hear it always is. We had to wait like an hour for our table. Fortunately, we're content with standing around and drinking. Unfortunately, I don't remember which brew we were drinking, but it was good. We had a group of six guys and we ordered two large pizzas, which was the perfect amount to satisfy all of us before a long night of partying. Our pizzas had a bunch of different toppings, and they were tasty. Most surprising to me was the total price... after the two pizzas and a beer or two each, the bill came out to under $80!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We were super happy we found this place. It's large, airy and had 2 large oval shaped bars among the dining spaces. We stopped in for a before dinner drink and ended up a little buzzed when we left. We both had ""flights"" which are 4 wines from the same category but from different places around the globe. I did the sparkling flight and the hubby did a Pinot flight It really gave us a chance to experience and contrast what we liked and disliked about each one. Unlike, wine tasting, there isn't somebody there telling you what to think. It's a classy clean modern bar and you can drink in whatever order you please! We ended up needing to kill a little more time before dinner and went for half pours of dessert and a crme brulee. Yummy! Fantastic place for drinks before dinner! Highly recommend a flight!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am so lucky to live around the corner from Coast! I have been going here or getting carry-out at least once a week for over a year and a half and I have converted every friend I have brought here into a Coast loving advocate of great sushi. My favorite menu items are the hamachi carpaccio (to die for!), the volcano roll, and the edamame. You may be thinking ""they are just boiled soybeans, how great could they be?"" but they are served piping hot and super fresh every single time. I have literally had everything on the menu besides the california roll (what's the point?) and anything with salmon (not a fan, sorry) and it was fresh, tasty, and satisfying. There is a 711 across the street and a liquor store at the corner of Armitage and Damen to satisfy your BYOB needs (no corkage fee!) I recommend making a reservation on the weekends or if you have more than 4, this place is always hoppin'. Groupon can send me all the half-off sushi deals in the city but I refuse to cheat on my Coast. Ok, one exception: Fresh Sushi and Noodles on Wellington, but only for the Picante maki with cilantro.

"This review is of the grocery store only and not the cafe. For years, I used to stop in here about once a week on my way home from the office. It used to be a great source for meat and fish, and had an outstanding bakery.The past year or so (and more so recently) the quality had really declined. Prices remain high, but meat and fish are barely above Jewel and definitely not on the level of Fox and Obel. Selection of meat and fish has declined. The bakery still is good, but it is tough to justify a trip just for the bakery. The selection of other stuff is often limited.It is too bad, but it is no longer worth seeking out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wow. That pretty much sums it up for me. This was such an unexpected place for us to begin our Saturday evening, but turned out to be a great choice. The byob made it even cheaper than it already was, and the portions are huge! We lugged in a few six-packs, and were delighted when they put down our names on the list, and then switched the store sign to 'Closed'. Last ones in! (and eventually out, as it turns out). The vibe is relaxed and the music festive. We started with some guac and ceviche, and once the entrees arrived, wondered if we should have. The flavors combinations are fantastic, and everyone was too busy chomping to speak for the next few minutes. I got the veggie burrito, with both mushrooms and spinach, and it was outrageously good.

I understand it's just beginning but it annoys me, especially with this place because of the gentrification that is happening with Logan Square. I hate to come off as one of the douche bags saying that kind of stuff, but it blows when you've got families from the suburbs, with their little kids, and ass wipes from Lincoln Park or Wrigleyville. The building is perfect for this place, a spot that you're not really going to find anyplace else in the city. As much as I didn't like it when Logan had nothing to do in it, I still just get annoyed that it's going to become the next Bucktown. But still, none the less, the place is great. Really fucking good. Check it out. Deal with the two hour long wait, maybe show up late afternoon. It's worth it to try it once like this.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Also, the couple sitting next to us was fighting with their sticky rice, though humorous, I'd venture to say the rice was a tad too sticky. Yes - I'll go back.

No problem, we'll just belly up to the bar for a drink! The handcrafted cocktail list was awesome, and their beer list was quite respectable. I first had some sort of hot toddy that I can no longer remember the name of. It was delicious! I followed that by a Half Acre Daisy Cutter. Yet another beer I can't find in KC and I loved it! We finally got a table (though well within the amount of time they quoted, so no complaints there) Dinner time! ***random observation*** They have super cute candle holders that I want for my home. We first ordered a small plate to share, and I immediately decided on the scallops w/ braised oxtail and gnocchi. All three are ingredients that I love individually, and having them together was astounding! Seriously, this was ""last meal on Earth"" good. I honestly cannot recall the last time I had a bite of something that made me as happy as that first bite of this dish. For dinner I had some sort of duck dish. It was good...very good actually, but after the previous course it just didn't stick in my mind. I looked on the online menu for a reminder, but it's not to be found. Maybe a nightly special? Quite good, but again....those damn scallops! I would gladly come back to Longman & Eagle if I lived in Chicago, and I will certainly be back during my next visit.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We placed an order and after 1 hour 15 minutes it hadn't arrived and we called them. They said their delivery driver got his car stolen with all the deliveries. Understandable, but did they call us to let us know? NO! So, they said they would make it for us and have it there is a few minutes. 45 minutes later, we are still waiting and trying to call. NO ONE answered the phone for 20 minutes!! It just rang and rang. When the delivery driver got here after a total waiting time of 2 hours 15 minutes, I told him the situation and asked to see what he could do. He called and they offered us $6 off. We really didn't have an option because we were hungry. Then, we opened the food. It was stone cold! I called them and they happened to pick up the phone this time. The person on the phone was snooty and basically said that if we don't like it, give the food back and we'll get our money back. Ok, we USED to order from them at least twice a week and this is how we are treated?? The guy got so much attitude and did NOTHING to make us feel like they were sorry and treated us like it was our fault and that THEY were offended for us calling in. This is a horrible way to run a business and no amount of good tasting food is an excuse. They need to learn how to treat their customers.

Speaking of pigging out, I've heard great things about the stuffed french toast: 2 pieces of challah filled with mascarpone and dipped in vanilla bean custard. I've never been so brave, but no one lives forever and what a happy way to go!I think the service is pretty great considering this is in Greek town, and, according to a friend of mine from Carpathos, Greek restaurants aren't exactly known for their hospitable service.

We started with the yummy warm bread, and the delicious beet soup. So far so great. But then, the very loud, annoying owner entered the restaurant. I kept hear him saying loudly, THEY LIKE MY FOOD! THEY LIKE MY FOOD! He was going to every table asking if they like his food. So he reaches our table. For some reason, he didn't ask us if we like his food. He asked us if we had a coupon or something. So we said, yeah, we had a groupon. So he says, did you make a reservation? (clearly annoyed) My husband told him we did not, but informed them upon entering the restaurant that we had a groupon, and if we needed to call ahead. Being a Tuesday night, and not the least bit crowded, the hostess said no problem. We informed the owner of this, and he proceeded to SCOLD us for not making a reservation. WOW!! That was a first for us. Although we thought the veal paprikash was very good, the short ribs were just average - we would never ever ever return to this man's establishment. Shame on him for treating paying customers like that. (It was still not cheap, even with the groupon. our bill for the two of us was $45 dollars additional!!

Our table couldn't contain it all. Definitely try the Greek beer... I'm not a huge beer fan, but this passed with flying colors. Not too hoppy, and not too heavy. Everything we ate was delicious. Loved the flaming cheese, the butter beans, green beans, and (surprisingly for me) the octopus. Free valet parking is also always good, and loved the interior. The staff was also very friendly, helpful, and attentive... I don't think my water glass was near empty all night. I went with my boyfriend (who is Greek) and his cousin (who is also Greek), and they gave it the official stamp of approval by comparing the food to Yiayia's. Can't get much better than that.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is expensive but we normal people always go with a free entree coupon. I love the salad bar - hearts of palm, seared ahi tuna - yum! Mushroom risotto, smoked salmon, haha - I should just go for the salad bar lunch. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a great steak, but I could eat their salad bar all day. As for the steak, well, the first few cuts I got were mouth-wateringly juicy and delicious. I guess I'm just not that big of an eater, because after awhile, it becomes too much. It's still good, but they all blend together, but I kept feeling like I had to stuff myself to the point of bursting to justify the price. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon was definitely my favorite. They didn't have lobster - when do they have the lobster? They didn't have lobster the last time I went, either.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It is a very small place and not a good environment. I had a terrible experience at Sushi-X tonight. We arrived there at 6:30pm.

"Well, I would love to give this place a 4 or 5 star because their food is pretty good. However, there service is a complete joke. My fiance and I order delivery from Sultan's frequently. They take forever and when they finally get to you, your order isn't right. Mine has been correct once or twice out of a dozen times. All I order is the Lamb Shwarma with hot sauce and tahini. They always, always, always forget the Tahini.So, tonight I decided to call. The service I received made me so mad! The phone guy begins by saying I take customer service very seriously. After I explained that I was sick of my order getting wrong, he says Well, you have to understand. We get busy and we offer cheap food. What the hell does that mean? I'm a server. I work in the industry and I think that getting someone's order right isn't a stretch. It's pretty much the foundation of eating anywhere or ordering anything.He refused to give me his name or his manager's name after he got down right insulting and mocking.Do yourself a favor and head to Greek-town... the counter staff and management makes this place a joke.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is one of my favorite places in the city to go for a casual breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The crepes are excellent. Seriously, I could eat there everyday. If we go for breakfast, we'll usually get a sweet crepe. My favorite sweet crepe is the Crepe Salem, with pineapple, walnuts, and honey. My fiance will usually gets the Crepe Perla, which has dulce de leche, bananas, and coconut. If we go for lunch or dinner, we'll usually chose a savory crepe. All of the savory crepes come with a vegetable puree soup, which is good. I particularly like the Palace Crepe or the Crepe de Roma. The Turkish coffee is good and strong and, if you are in the mood for something sweeter, the dulche de leche coffee is delicious. We've always found the service to be pretty good, if sometimes a tad bit slow. But, as we tend to enjoy lingering over our meals, we don't really mind.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Needless to say, after running 10 miles, almost anything would sound delicious. In all honesty, I was a little hesitant at first - I had serious cravings for some heavy carbs, but I acquiesced given the raving fan following Piece has. We ordered the queso de cabra - which again, I was skeptical... that's a Spanish dish... at a pizza joint? Boy, was I wrong! Delicious... so much so that we kept the marina sauce for future dipping pleasantries. Our pizza arrived shortly thereafter. I was truly disappointed... our order was wrong. The one ingredient that I dislike, was all over our pizza =( We informed our waitress and she removed the pizza. How devastating.  Now here's where Piece earns a place in my heart. Our waitress returned with the incorrect pizza and offered it to us to gnosh on while the correct pizza is made. She apologized and assured us that our right pizza was on its way. Well of course, we ate the vast majority of this onion-laced pizza - which was still delicious, by the way. Just needed to pick off those breath evil doers and I was good to go. Our waitress returned with the onion-less pizza and that was ALSO devoured... just a bit more slowly than the first. When the waitress presented our check, she told us that they took half off the cost of the ONE pizza and that she would gladly box up the remains of BOTH pizzas. So if I do my math correctly here... we consumed 2 pizzas for half the price of one... meaning we paid 25% of what we got. Talk about great customer service! I'm sorry I didn't get our waitresses name - I blame the fatigue of SF10, but kudos to her and whomever hired her!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I have been going to Superdawg ever since I was a little girl. Every time I go to Superdawg I will always get a Whoopercheesie with basically everything. Superdawg is a great drive in restaurant to go eat at night because you can go with your car and just eat in there or you can go sit out at the tables and just eat with friends and enjoy the night. I was hanging out with my boyfriend one night and I was in the mood to eat a Whoopercheesie with fries at Superdawg. When we went there that night that was his first time there and ever since that night he loves that place and he always wants to go there for a hot dog or a Whoopercheesie instead of going to Burger King and McDonald's late at night. Their service is great their so polite and they don't take forever to make your food. Also if there is room in your tummy after their sundaes are also AMAZING!!,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is good but not AS good as everyone had warned me about. I think it's because I measure how good a diner is by how good their pancakes are and I wasn't very impressed with Wishbone's cakes. The Denver Omelet I had was pretty good. Big chunks of sausage and the cheese distribution was perfect. Our waiter suggested next time to substitute the cheese with cream cheese.. it's supposed to be amazing that way. This place serves grits. Enough said there. This place does NOT serve corn beef hash. Enough said here. I really liked our server. I've actually been here twice and placed with the same server both times. He was pretty friendly, gave me free coffee.. 3 cups of free coffee. Downside of Wishbone is the long wait (especially weekends) and price. Food IS good don't get me wrong but I think I have had better for less.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is pretty good.  My sister and I decided to eat her while I was visiting, and it was a good choice. It was pretty expensive, but the gift certificate my sister had came in handy. The ambiance was nice...lights everywhere and just pretty warm. It was jam packed though, so it was kind of annoying to wait, but worth it. Food was pretty tasty...we had the special, which was three pieces of steak with different toppings on each which you could pick. The mushroom topping was great. We also treated ourselves to the key lime pie, which was also pretty dang good. The only thing I would complain about was our bus boy...he kept cleaning our stuff away before we were even done. He even sprayed some cleaning chemicals on the table while we were still eating...pretty strange...hopefully it was just this guy.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We tried to go to Nana last Sunday. We did not watch check, please on Friday night and it seemed everyone else in Chicago had. The wait was unbearable, we were told 20 minutes and we were waiting outside for about 40 when we threw in the towel. Fast forward to Friday morning and we decided to give it another go for brunch. We were seated right away. Our waitress was awesome from the start! Very friendly and attentive. My fiance had the duck biscuits and gravy and I had the steak and egg special. Both were very tasty. The biscuits and gravy are not at all traditional, I didn't try the biscuits but he said they were amazing, the gravy was loaded with duck, onions and brussel sprouts, yum! The steak and eggs was huge! I had a whole meal to take home and I was pleasantly full. It comes on a bed of lobster sweet potato hash which was amazing! I had the hollandaise sauce on the side as I am not really a fan, I tried a little and it was good, but too rich for me. We tried some of their bacon as well and it was just okay in my opinion. Definitely worth the two tries to eat here. Very good and original!","[0.0, 1.0]"

PSSS: The Other Side Bar on the other side (get it?) is pretty awesome as well. It's rather small and narrow, so getting a table can be a tough.

"I have come to Sapori several times now. Usually, it is on Monday night, overstuffing myself at Sapori before going to a neighboring bar to watch Monday Night Football. They have a gluttonous food special on Mondays. For they bring you a sushi like check list where you get to check off 2 appetizers (something with cheese, please), 2 soups, 3 entres (something stuffed, something savory, and something creamy please) and a dessert. All of this tasty goodness for just over $20 bucks.  The cuisine here at Sapori is solid, Italian-American fare. Their food is good, simple and unpretentious. Their service is good and very welcoming. As an extra bonus, they have a very nice outdoor seating.  In all honesty, I am a little overly harsh in critiquing Italian restaurants. As I find Italian food very easy, albeit very time consuming, to cook. As a result, an Italian restaurant needs to either make better food than I can at home, or have great atmosphere/service. I think Sapori's is as good as I can make at home or better and the welcoming service makes this place worth coming to. I would say never do this for 99% for restaurants out there, but sign up for their mailing list. The discounts they mail you are actually worth receiving (like 25% off your entire meal or even free meals.) Also, the chef here does a good job of making the emails seem personal and not mass marketing, (even though they are clearly mass mailing.)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went there for a saturday brunch with a gang of about 9 people which included 4 kids. I had a tough time deciding between a 3 and 4 star as you will see from my review. What was good - 1. Surprisingly good, cosy and clean interiors 2. Fresh and organic ingredients which made for great tasting food 3. Nice twist on every day items (freshly squeezed apple juices, sauces on skillet dishes etc) 4. Street metered parking was pretty easy to find What was not - 1. Service was very spotty. Restaurant was at 60% capacity when we were there. But everything was still really slow coming out, even though some other people came in later and had their good arrive sooner 2. Orders were mixed up and atleast a couple of them had to be changed. But all in all, if you go there for good tasting fresh food, you will not be disappointed. Just watch out for a confused order delivery, otherwise the place has tremendous potential. I might try it again sometime.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"http://en.wikipedia.org/Coming from NYC, I have been fortunate enough to experience a large variety of Bi Bim Bop. Not all fare is to everyone's liking which makes Crisp such an awesome spot to eat at. Their menu offers an offbeat approach to not only Korean food but also a hint of good old American eats. My favorite KFC(Korean fried chicken) is the Seoul Sassy glazed whole bird. My wife and I always get a buddha bowl to accompany the yummy chicken. The mild flavors of the cold marinated vegatables mixes perfectly with the steamy hot rice. Make sure you mix in the buddha sauce before you dig in(makes it ohh soo scrumptious). Non-KFC eaters should try out the Seoul Sensation burrito which has the Bulgogi beef and Allison's Atomic sauce on the side. The sweet beef with the fresh veggies and the spicy cream sauce makes for a stupendous lunch. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try new food venues.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I ordered the Vegetarian Special Thali as a carryout meal, and I hope I didn't get part of someone else's order, because they gave me a ton of food.

Seven 8 oz plastic deli containers containing: Paleek Paneer, Channa Masala, Kali Dal, Lentil soup, Savory yogurt with shredded carrots and cucumbers (couldn't find it on the menu), vegetable garnish (pieces of head lettuce, tomato, red onion, slivers of Jalapeno pepper, wedge of lemon) and Kheer (sweet rice milk dessert). A 6"" diameter platter of Basmati white rice and a 12"" loaf of Naan completed the meal. All that for $22.09 with tax!

"This is the 3rd time I've been here, and it's always a few years in between each visit. The reason is this: when I go, I'm never blown away like everyone else. And then I decide not to go back until enough time passes that I've heard enough people say ""oh Frontera grill? I love that place!"" and then I go back. Today was more of the same. Went there for lunch with 2 old friends. We had no problem getting a table which was great. Even though we were clearly chatting and catching up and kept telling the waitress ""we need a few minutes,"" she kept coming back and asking for our order. We asked for recommendations and she recommended the 3 specials which were all entree sized and nothing else. I thought that was a little weird, but whatever. After we were badgered to order, our food took a LONG time to arrive, during which time we were not checked on, even though the place was not very crowded. We ordered guac which was tasty, but received that before ordering our entress, so no other appetizers or anything to worry about during that long wait. I ordered one of the fish specials, which was good but not memorable. It was a moist and flavorful piece of fish in some sauce. The accompanying polenta cakes were very good. I also enjoyed my horchata. My main gripe would be the price - my friend pointed out that my fancy dish was about the same (or less) food than he had on his $10 appetizer dish. And it was also FREEZING in there. There must have been a door open. It's good but not mind blowing, and if I had to wait for this, I think I would go elsewhere. Try Nuevo Mexicano (and their straight up margarita) which is delicious and you can always get a reservation. I know it's not Rick Bayless, but they have some more interesting dishes, and I think the service is better.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We ordered the grand seafood appetizer which had some pretty tasty components as well as middle of the road components.The entrees were bad. We ordered the Carne Assada which is their signature entree and had to send it back because it was so tough. The others ordered other entrees which were good, but fell short of our expectations.

"I've heard the complaints - it's too dark, it's too cramped, you come out smelling like oil, etc... I think if you go into Geja's knowing what to expect you will have a blast. I've been dozens of times over the last ten years and have nothing but good things to say about the place. The service has always been impeccable, the food is consistently delicious and the music - oh, the music. A few things to think about if you're going. First, make a reservation. For real. The last time I called they didn't accept Friday/Saturday reservations after a certain time (7?) so just avoid it on weekends if you can. When was the last time you went on a Thursday night date? Second, request a booth. This will solve any overcrowding problems. Yes, the regular tables are close together but I have never had any problem ignoring (or making friends with!) my neighbors. Once I learned that you could request a booth I have never had a problem. They can't always honor it, of course, and you may have to wait a few extra minutes but the space and privacy are worth it. Third, you will smell like oil when you leave. There's simply no getting around it. To be honest, though, I've never understood this problem. Your date smells like oil too - what's the issue? Embrace it. It's not a foul smell, and it reminds me of Geja's the next day when I do laundry. Mmm. Finally, enjoy the music. The guitarists have always been happy to chat with us on their breaks, and they are phenomenally talented. They're interesting folks, and finding out about their backgrounds and training always makes listening to them more enjoyable. One last point: you will leave STUFFED.

I went for restaurant week so I'm not sure if it was more boisterous than usual but there were the 20-somethings who love to wine and dine and the more regal older couples who love their classy meats.

I cannot recall the name of the gin drink I tried, but it was insanely sour; reminiscent of lemonade concentrate. My boyfriend and I agreed that the drinks at Patterson House are far superior. Ah well. I'm glad we went and I absolutely loved the atmosphere. The service was also fantastic.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"this place is cool and i have to say there is really nothing like it in chicago. i ALMOST feel like it's trying a LITTLE TOO HARD, but it's worth the wait and price. the drinks are super chic and made with ALL homemade, natural, and fresh ingredients. no super sugary drinks here. even the ice cubes are freshly cut. yes cut from an ice block. wow. this place seems like it stepped right out prohibition except it's tres chic. i love the decor. and the fact that it has a plain plywood exterior makes it that much better. yes, you will wait and yes it is a little pricey, but like i said it's worth it. i love the no cell phone policy. this place is quiet so it would be super annoying if i had to listed to some suburbanite yelling to her friend on the phone about how crowded soundbar is. i love that the bouncer wears a tux and make EVERYONE wait. i think it's funny and it usually weeds out the d-bags who think they are too cool. u know the ones im talking about. the guy with the embroidered ed hardy button down and blow out. ya that guy who's girlfriend is probably wearing a bebe dress and 5 platform shoes from guess. the violet hour is not for you. please go back to soundbar or crescendo or wherever you came from. thanksi do have to say i liked this better when it first opened and only chicagoans knew about it. now there are way too many people from places like naperville and downers grove waiting in line complaining. i do wish they had more food but they still get a 5 star review b/c i adore the fresh cut ice cubs, decor, and tuxedos.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The pastries are to die for, I always bring a large fruit tart from F&O when visiting friends. They also make the best ever freshly squeezed OJ!

"A little disappointed. Ambitious menu that didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The same vinegar base seemed to run through many of the dishes and while it was tasty it ultimately lacked imagination. We sampled about 11 dishes and none of them sucked but none had any 'wow' presence. The pork liver pate was texturally perfect but a bit heavy handed. The prosciutto bread balls were uneventful and the marinara with it was bland and sweet. The biggest disappointment was the bone marrow. The bread they served it with was delicious but the butter and garlic completely overpowered the marrow which, on it's own never seemed to have absorbed any of the herbs as promised on the menu. And so it went... It really felt like a Publican knock off without Kahan's talent to give it any soul. Service was minimal - brusque and inattentive. We waited a long time trying to order courses and our server offered us nothing in the way of either recommendations or personality. Music was okay but the low fi sound system just made it annoying at the volume they set. I wouldn't refuse to go back - I'd like to try the pork shoulder - but it certainly wouldn't be high on my list.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Come here once to say you've been here and then move on... Of course, I rate them as ""A-OK"" because any spot that supports animal welfare is A-OK in my book.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My favorite sushi bar in Chicago. I keep trying to find other sushi bars that are as good but are closer to me or aren't as busy, but I can't!!Our service has always been outstanding. Our waiters always recommend something amazing. We typically order sushi rolls and make sure to always order at least one dragon roll (our favorite).We have always had to wait for table, so that's probably the biggest negative. But they have tables for people who are waiting and it's BYOB, so just bring an extra bottle for the wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a review for Shaw's Sunday brunch.  I think everything was ALMOST there but not quite hitting the mark or meeting my expectations (which I think were pretty lofty based on feedback and recommendations from friends). The cold seafood bar was where I spent most of my time. The lobster and melon salad, ceviche and lox were the champions of this station and I made sure they knew it. They also had three different sushi rolls which were nothing special. They were reminiscent of something you would get at a grocery store. I ate a ton of them anyway because they weren't terrible and it was all you can eat spicy tuna rolls. I mean, it was all you can eat ... what's a girl to do?  The most confusing thing about this area was the king crab chunks that a lot of reviewers rave about. They're one inch sections of king crab legs served cold. They were watery, flavorless and difficult to eat. It was a lot of work without much reward. Needless to say I did not go back for more. The waffle station was a pretty big hit for my 6 year old son. Everything you could put on the waffle was sugar based. He ate it up. You can also create your own omelet and have it made to order but every time I walked past the omelet chef wasn't there. When I want an omelet I expect someone to produce an omelet! It never happened. The hot food section was pretty massive. Standouts for me were the broccoli in brie sauce, lobster bisque and mini crab cakes. The first time I passed through to make my sons plate they had tiny little corned beef has patties with a perfect little sunny side up egg on top. They were so cute! I wanted to eat them all! Unfortunately they were out of it every other time I walked past so I didn't get to try them. This also made me sad. The eggs benedict would have been really good if the whites of the eggs weren't runny and undercooked. The carving station also looked really good but AGAIN there was never anyone there to carve the meat. The dessert room was super cute and obviously the kids were loving it. All of the desserts were minis so we were able to try quite a bit. I tried the tiramisu, creme brulee and key lime pie. All were good ... ish. Mostly just plain and boring. Our server was great and always on top of drink refills and questions. The mimosas were actually my favorite part of the experience. I had the blood orange and the white peach. Both were fantastic and only $5 each. The biggest issue I had was that they were constantly out of everything. We had brunch on a Sunday at noon. New Years Day no less! You would think it would be stocked. Several times I would wait in line forever to make a plate and right when I would get to the item I wanted a waiter would take it away to fill it. The killer was that they were removing trays that were half full. It was painful and it happened MANY times. I've rarely eaten at a buffet that blows me away but I had high hopes for Shaw's. The one thing that they do absolutely right is let kids eat free. However, if I'm going to spend $150 on brunch for two I think it should totally blow my mind. Sorry Shaw's but I will not be coming back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I've moved and don't make it there as often as I used to, but they still remember me. It's a family owned place, I think. I still can't believe how low their prices are. The salad bar is also really good...they have some more unusual options.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Every time I've been here (and tried to get a table here) it has been ridiculous packed. Even when we've made a reservation we've had to wait for a little bit. If you go during the week its not as bad. I enjoy their burgers and homeade chips but the salad bar is pretty darn good. They have some more unique items like chopped liver (mmm) that you don't find on every buffet so its a bit more unique. Like all salad bars it can get messy especially since everything is very compact in this space and you have to sometimes reach across 3 other bins of food to get to your selection. If you're a hygiene-freak don't eat at this salad bar. I had the chili on my most recent visit because it was cold outside and I wanted something warm to go with my salad...pretty good. The portion was huge too. I'd never gotten the cookie sundae but I do recommend it after I had it last night - chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and hot fudge or a cinnamon cookie with ice cream and caramel. Yum.

The salad bar is great, the meat is perfectly seasoned, just fantasticly cooked, could not be better.  Those little rolls are to die for and the polenta sticks are fantastc.   The great thing is that even though you get the same exact meal, you are saving yourself a few bucks by coming during lunch.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I was not sure about the freshness of my crab cake and my grilled shrimp were overdone. The food in general was not as delicious as expected based on the price.

I had to drink water, and for me, that's a rare occurrence. It's a great place to go for any event and the music and atmosphere match the food, which is always a plus. If you're hesitant to try Ethiopian food you should give this place a try. You might just get more than you could ever expect.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"What's not to love about Glenn's Diner? Not much. I've been here several times for brunch and each time has been fantastic. It's actually my go-to when I have out-of-towners to entertain. The best part is they take reservations for any party! This is a huge plus. I have a couple of favorites: 1) the classic egg sandwich (it really is a small house) and 2) the parm and chive eggs. Both come with the ""potato pancake"" which is cheesy as well. You can't really go wrong. Their portions don't skimp and the menu itself is large. The most recent trip I made here was this past weekend, and a friend of mine ordered their bloody mary. I'm not a fan of them in general myself, but hers looked like a small meal in a glass - it came with a skewer of shrimp and basically looked like a salad. She raved about it saying that this is how they're made back home (she's from Louisiana).  The short: I can't recommend this place enough. Just come hungry. As for the review below by Rita....wow. Just terrible. Although since you have grandchildren, I can only assume it's a generational thing.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Freshness abounds at this neaopolitan style pizza place. With a custom oven and promises of authentic Italian pizza (and Nutella!), I was excited to try it out. We got a pretty solid variety of pizza, and I think we chose well for our first time. But I'm going to have to go back to try the other variations on the menu... FOOD Insalata di Mare - Seafood Salad: At $10, this was a pretty good deal. Nothing too special about the bread itself, but the seafood (poached calamari, cuttlefish, and shrimp) was pretty fresh and wasn't ruined by dumping a bunch of batter all over everything and frying the whole lot. I think they can afford to put in a couple more olives, though. Funghi e Salsiccia - Mushroom, Sausage, Basil, and Fresh Mozzarella Pizza: Our server recommended that we get both a red and a white pizza to give both a try. Done. We opted to go for the mushroom and sausage pizza, and the housemade sausage was AWESOME. The sausage wasn't overseasoned with a salt-mine's worth of sodium, and it wasn't greasy. We were told that the crust is the star at Spacca Napoli (more on that later), but I don't think that's a free pass for a blander-than-expected red sauce. Maybe it's subdued on purpose to let the fresh ingredients shine through more, maybe they don't think it's bland. But it could stand to be more aggressive. I love a flavorful sauce. I had two problems with the crust; one, it was too salty, both by itself (when eating the crust) and in combination with the toppings. Two, the high moisture content of the fresh mozzarella soaks through the paper thin crust at the center and makes the pizza pretty soggy. For some reason, it still works, albeit it is a little unsettling. This was supposed to have basil on it and I'm sure you can see the pathetic attempt at it...but it was disappointing that they only included what amounted to one basil leaf. More basil = more balance. Oh well. Bianca con Bufala e Rucola - Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Arugula: The second was a white pizza made with buffalo mozzarella and topped with fresh and crispy arugula. Olive oil played the red sauce's normal role here. Buffalo mozz is a lot creamier than regular mozzarella, but retains the same high moisture content, so the same issues with the crust that I mentioned about are the same here. The extra creaminess of the cheese is definitely noticeable for a obviously heavier pizza here. Still, great flavor, and I love all of that arugula on top. But again, where's the basil? The generous heap of other greens helped with the balance issue cited above, but still...more basil please! Spumoni Ice Cream: Pistachio, rum, strawberry and chocolate ice cream with some candied fruits. Very good! I was extremely happy with the spumoni, but I can't really say that it's any better than what you could get at the store or ice cream shops. Nutella Focaccia: THIS WAS INCREDIBLE. They use the same dough that they use for the pizza and bake it til it bubble up. They cut the bubble down the middle and slather on the Nutella goodness, and it was amazing. I loved this dessert, and the salty dough went so well with the sweet and creamy Nutella. This is genius. This is a must have. SERVICE/OVERALL: Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and stopped by frequently enough to get what we wanted, but not so much so that he was overbearing. We went later on a Sunday so there was no wait so I can't speak to how busy the restaurant is at peak times, but I think they're able to get out the pizzas and appetizers pretty quickly based on what we experienced. Overall, Spacca Napoli is a great restaurant that's worth the drive to Ravenswood! Just eat the pizza there or else the fresh mozzarella might eat completely through the crust.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went here before going to see a show and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the wine to be great and the food to be OK, but it was actually the opposite. Wine: we did the bin 36 flight, I do not recommend this flight. None of the wines were bad, but there was nothing exciting about any of them. I would try a different flight or make my own next time Cheese: we did the American cheese flight and it was amazing. This is a must have in my eyes. What moved Bin 36 from 3 stars to 4 stars is the fact that they carried 2 cheeses from Zingermans, one of my favorite places in Ann Arbor. In the American cheese flight you get the Bridgewater from Zingermans which is superb. Soup & Salad: we had the market salad and shrimp bisque were both very good. I would say that the salad is a must have with great fresh pepper, brie, pears, and vinaigrette dressing. Meal: we had the marlin which which came on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with onion rings. The dish was fantastic, lots of pepper, well cooked, and a lot of flavors going on. Atmosphere: Nice open space with a very welcoming feel. The two person tables on the side are close together, but that is pretty common for the city, I feel.","[0.0, 1.0]"

If you are truly a fan of sushi steer clear of this place! Virtually all the rolls contain something fried or are drenched in mayonnaise-y sauces.

Even the miso soup is off - there is tofu and seaweed there but the broth tastes like straight up sodium.

"Caro Mio has a special place in our heart because we were engaged here. Years later, it is still amazing. We had Christmas dinner last night with my parents, and naturally will be enjoying the leftovers for days to come. Being the kind of people that make homemade pasta in our own kitchen, the only acceptable way for us to carb out away from home is...well, homemade pasta. They've done away with all the greenery in the front window, which is kind of a shame because it was so pretty, but the place is always packed. More seating just naturally won out. Entrees take a bit of time to come out, but I would not want it any other way. This is beautiful made-to-order pasta. My father had the monster of all dishes, the special chicken parmigiana with homemade rigatoni. (Incidentally, this was also the dish I chose on the magical engagement night. My husband must really love me considering he still proposed after watching me scarf down half a plate of a not-so-ladylike dish.) Hubby went with the linguine and clams Diablo - a classic, nice and spicy and garlicky. I had the angelotti with peas and prosciutto, one of my standby favorites. The perfect mix of sweet and salty. But my mom won for the night. The special pappardelle with sun dried tomatoes, chicken, spinach, and gratineed to perfection. Damn. Go early for a little romance, the later it gets, the more crowded (and noisy.) But walking home from Caro Mio, a little boozy, smelling of garlic, hand and hand with your sweetie, the other hand holding tomorrow's lunch, it doesn't really get better than that.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ok I'll be honest, at first I loved this place because the menu items reminded me so much of my favorite sushi places in LA....however, I've found that the more I eat here the more it's inconsistent.

I think because I know what the original tastes like I'm spoiled. The rice was there, but the tuna was extremely spicy. I was very disappointed. I have learned though that lunch is definitely the best time to go (try their chicken salad), but it's a condensed menu and some of my favorite rolls aren't listed.

"Medium place: it is not rare, but it certainly isn't well done. (Ok, enough Statler & Waldorf quotes.) Went on 8/27/2012, and not in a terrible rush to return. I will return for whiskey purposes. As a scotch man, their menu is fair but excels mostly in the area of American whiskeys more so than the precious whisky from that enchanted island in Atlantic Ocean. You can get just about every small batch Bourbon or Tennessee Whiskey, and they even go to the trouble of getting some of the rarer distillations. The bartender was knowledgeable as to the palate of the spirit, and when I told him I hate the sugary taste of most Bourbon (i.e. from the corn-based sugars) and of Irish Whisky (b/c of the triple distillation), he understood his customer immediately and made suggestions. Any bartender that knows her/his inventory is worth seeing again, and that's why this place gets three stars right off the bat. As to ambiance and food, well, there's a reason we didn't move off from just three stars, isn't there?  I read a previous review, and yes, this is Hipster Heaven. Each of these philistines probably listens Radiohead, is a closet Hanson/Lady Gaga/LMFAO fan, but touts Wilco as having invented Rock'n'Roll. It's as though the standard Hipster Conformist Uniform is nearly a requirement: ironic t-shirt, ironic winter hat in the hottest summer in many years, and ironic tattoo...very un-Chicago. You should resist the urge to tell these people they suck, however, because (1) the will serve you food and (2) you know these are the wiener kids that grew up with Participation Awards for playing soccer and have faux high self esteem. You would shatter their little double-pits-to-chesty world if you let them know they are way, way uncool for wearing Kurt Kobain's wardrobe and/or 1980's attire in 2012. Let it go, it's too easy, and you're better than that. Besides, we need to discuss the horrid execution they gave for the food. Firstly, the generalities included a lack of some basic fundamentals. I rolled out with a veggie friend (pescetarian, to be precise) among our group. (Pescetarians can be junior foodies because at least they understand protein.) So, we directly asked ""Skeech"" the Waiter if the two dishes she and I split had any meat whatsoever. He replied, ""No."" Being that I have an unending love of bacon, I quickly identified that there was bacon-smoked infusion in a dish my friend had already been eating. Now, if you have veggie/vegan friends, then you know your job is help them I.D. a meat taste if they lack familiarity, and then be prepared to assist with holding back their hair after you do. You also may know that one of life's guarantees for a veggie/vegan person is that they will get very sick from that most delicious of all meats: bacon. Skeech failed. Next, nearly every dish was undercooked. You expect that one out of six would be undercooked, but four of six was too many. We had a variety of plates, but the Duck several ways, the steak, and the mixed dishes all were undercooked. Only my lobster and the fish (I believe the catch that day was a sole) were served at the correct temperature. Lastly, the wine suggestion was so far beneath par that I doubt Skeech could ever discern a merlot from a Cotes^ Du Rhone' because, well, I asked for the closest thing to a Cotes^ Du Rhone' and he brought me that dog shit known as merlot. (As an aside, I hated merlot way before it was 'Sideways' chic). There is a reason, though, that I did not deduct a star for the food, which is that the lobster tail was absolutely phenomenal, having been correctly prepared in terms of temperature and managing to have a uniquely rich presentation. It was served in broda with three out-of-this world marscapone-filed tortellini. The broth itself had a seafood-vegetable blend, and the stock was fresh, leaving me to believe it was made in-house. The fish, other than the bacon-infused beat that was mischaracterized as veggie (hey, I loved the damn thing!), was amazingly fresh for Chicago, having an almost crispy sear and accompanied with fresh veggies. Dessert was truly enticing and succulent, as the ""old time sunday"" combined the best fruits with the best chocolate and a simple vanilla ice cream that will return you to your childhood. Overall, I'm going to come back when I'm bored, stay at the inn portion of the establishment, try the hoity-toity ""bar"" menu, and enjoy the whiskey. I think that might be its role, and so that's why it gets a second chance, but I'm not pacing to get back there any time soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Each and every time I visit them I'm always happy with their product, price and friendly service... it never ceases to amaze me the new items they create, they're all great! While I've tried nearly all the menu items, my staple is their DAGWOOD creation :) with extra sauce... it NEVER fails to overfill me all the time... the rest of my family too enjoys trying their new/seasonal items. Please remember if you're looking for HEALTH food, while they're meat free since '83 and non dairy is always an option, it's still a diner :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friends and I were at Boundary this afternoon and couldn't watch all the NCAA games there so we went to the new place, Fifty/50 down the street. Supposedly the owners managed Joe's Stone Crab for the past few years, so we were interested.The food and service were amazing. I had the skirt steak sandwich and I think it was the best I've ever had. The cheese fries were also better than any I've had. All my friends enjoyed their food, we watched the games, and had Mickey's 40oz beer all day long. They even give hot towel service after you eat ribs and wings.

"The Hopleaf gets 5 stars just for their mussels. Possibly the best mussels I've ever had. I would go just for them but Hopleaf also has a huge Belgian beer list. Almost all bars in Chicago now have huge craft beer lists but while most are content to settle for 75 different IPAs and 30 Stouts, Hopleaf is one of the few providers of good Belgian beers. The staff is great but there can be an occasional wait. Last time I went Popperings Hommelbier and Mussels!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After reading many of the reviews of this place and actually trying Sultan's Market, I can only assume that Chicago's population is suffering from a lack of Middle Eastern restaurant choices. I got the lamb dinner and my girlfriend got the chicken shwarma. The lamb was extremely dry and bland, while the chicken was not much better than that found at a reception of a shotgun wedding.To top it off, the guys behind the counter were really suffering from the 'cool factor', rushing everyone along and yelling at one woman taking 5 seconds too long, hey LADY, what do you want... Although the hours cater to the working crowd, the Haifa Cafe at 318 W. Adams beats this place hands down with its overall food, freshness, flavor, and attitude.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is some good pizza. My favorite in the city? No. But is it good deep dish pizza that you will definitely have enough of for leftovers the next day? Yes. We tried a meat filled one and a veggie one for Supper Club... I favored the veggie but the meats were delicious the next day. You order and pay up front at the counter, seating we'll call minimalistic. It's kind of like eating in a cafeteria but it's BYOB so if you're meeting up in the middle of the city with friends from the West Loop and Lincoln Square, it's kind of like ordering pizza and enjoying it in a really odd kitchen together.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A great place to go as a couple or with a large group of friends. It's a good place to hit at night for some cocktails - it's fun when a group of friends all try flights of wine. They're good for just wine, a whole meal, or appetizers/dessert and wine. The food has excellent presentation. You don't feel pressured at all to eat a whole meal at Bin 36. I especially like their desserts - very creative. I don't care for the very small size of their cheese plates. The environment is like a light, elegant warehouse. The waitstaff is hit or miss. And it's true - a bottle while eating can be 3X the price than if you walk ten steps and buy it in the store and take it home.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love this place!1. The pizza is amazing. As a die-hard Chicago-style fan, its hard to admit, but Fogo's tasty flat wins out over my deep dish cravings more often than not. The veg ingredients are the freshest I've seen, and the meats and cheeses are of such high quality and in such large portions that you really notice the difference.2. The service is amazing. Brad, the owner, is the friendliest guy ever, and everyone there makes an effort to know my name and what kind of pizza I like. They're fast, too.  3. The place is clean. I'm a food-industry person, and I can honestly say Fogo is among the cleanest places I've ever seen. Only issue: when they're busy, the ""no-touch"" (read: sanitary) trash bins get really full - and I feel bad leaving my trash on the counter! I recommended you shove a 32 gal bin outside the door on busy nights!4. They have 60 kinds of pizza on the menu. Even so, I am one of those people who always asks for something special. The Fogo folks are always accommodating and even make recommendations about which changes would be good. 5. I should probably eat here every day (instead of 3x per week) because I would save money. $6 for two pieces (this means about 10"" total crust-arc) and a soda!?6. I think the delivery problems that some people mentioned a couple months ago are gone - one saturday night, when we felt really lazy, my boyfriend and I ordered delivery, even tho the place is 2 blocks away. 30 minutes later, the owner showed up at our front door with the pie. And he refused a tip. 7. Their chicken is also great - I always forget about it though. Maybe some kind of lovely chicken display along with the pizzas in the window?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We go here all the time as I live super close- like above it. 1) price- I think price is pretty fair. It's reasonable and you get a good amount of food. Eggs Benedict is around $15 I think. 2) quality- as other reviews put it, the food is good. We usually get a version of eggs benedict and something sweet like waffles. 3) quantity- for the price you pay, you get a decent amount of food and this is coming from a guy that eats a lot (once ate and drank 16 lbs of food and water in a day) 4) atmosphere- cute with pictures of fried eggs all over the place 5) staff- nice Also if you go during a mad rush time be sure to listen to your name because if you leave you may get called and lose your spot.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Delicious pizza. Fast service. Friendly staff. We ordered a Stuffed Chicago Classic which was cheese, sauce, mushrooms, pepperoni, onions and green peppers. We added sausage. Savory sauce flavored with oregano, basil and pecorino. The crust was crisp on the sides and chewy on the bottom. It was not in any way soggy or under cooked. Plentiful amounts of meat and vegetables. Incredible amount of cheese, thought I'm not complaining. I love cheese. Delicious. No complaints at all.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Second time I've been to a Korean BBQ, but this was the first time cooking over charcoal. It's definitely smoky and started to bother my eyes a bit by the end of the meal, buy my peepers are pretty sensitive, so I won't count it against them. I went with two other ladies and think this is definitely a group joint. Sharing the the main thing. We got to sit at one of the tables along the edge of the restaurant where you have to take off your shoes and essentially sit on the floor level. I really liked this since it made it seem different and fun. The we got short ribs and bulgogi and I liked them both. I gotta say I enjoyed the quality of the meat at Cho Sun Ok a little more, but I really liked the flavor of the charcoal over the hot stone pots they use at Cho Sun Ok. Service was fine, nothing spectacular, but we weren't ignored or anything. The food was good and we did get more little sides than I remember getting at Cho Sun Ok, so that was really fun, trying the different things. If I have a friend who wants to head for Korean BBQ with a group, I won't hesitate in recommending San Soo Gab San. Delicious!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I don't give out 5 stars lightly - that fifth one usually has to get pried out my cold dead fingers - but I can't avoid it with this place. It is Simply It - a great place to get exotic food at reasonable prices. 6 of us went there on a Monday eve to celebrate my wife's birthday. If I mentioned which one there would be more cold dead fingers -- so I'll let it pass. Anyway - the family made the trek to Lincoln Ave for a reserved table for 6 at 7 - and it was ready and waiting for us - with a personal hello from the owner - and let's face it - who doesn't like a personal hello from the owner. Makes you feel important. They seated and watered us quickly, took our wine and had us wined up in a matter of moments as well -then the fun started. The menu is a treat just to read. Spring rolls, tempura, sticky rice cakes - we selected a few and they were all delicious. The calamari comes in a 1/2 pineapple - and the 15 yr old daughter who won't eat anything - actually ate it all. They get 5 stars just for that! Main courses consisted of clay pot catfish - excellent if you like catfish - not too bad if you just like Clay pots. We also had something wrapped in banana leaves - which gave it a taste that we couldn't identify - something like candy circus peanuts was suggested - it turned out it was banana flavor - duh! Meanwhile the wine kept flowing as the food kept coming - 6 of of us shared 4 appetizers and 5 entrees - and my poor son (literally - since he just moved in to the city) was able to take home a nice doggy bag for the dog he doesn't have. All of this at a price I usually pay for just my wife and I to celebrate at a fancy suburban restaurant with less food and overpriced wine. I have to mention the beautiful arrangement of pastries, fruit and raspberry sauce they provided to celebrate the birthday. It was a great end to a nice evening. The beauty is the menu is so vast we can back and do it again and try all new stuff. A recommended dining experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Man, what a bummer. I saw all of these great reviews and I thought this is perfect for my sister's birthday dinner of 10! However, I'm no dummy that is just going to plan a whole group dinner based on strangers reviews, so I went there tonight Friday at 6pm. We were both starving-would have thought anything was great. (let me also preface this by saying we do have good taste in food and I cook very well myself.) The bruchette which the mgr recommended was extremely full of garlic. I could pick large chunks out. Next we chose the grilled vegetables which my boyfriend believed must have been from a frozen bag since he works for a restaurant and knows the difference-however these were not bad. After that I got frutta del mar which is clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari with lunguini. Very OK-I really didn't like it much. My boyfriend (who loves pasta got spagetti-how can you mess that up. He said it was over cooked and filled with garlic. The name of the restaurant should really be garlic. No itialian music, definitely not owned by italians. I think the only reason people go there is because its BYOB. I'd rather pay for over priced wine than over priced and over hyped food.

"I did not know what to expect from this restaurant - I've heard that the restaurant itself looks like any other 'ordinary' building, without the name blazing about. They have valet, but you can find parking a few blocks away (non-permit). You enter the restaurant, and you walk down a short corridor that has purple lighting, and enter to your left. You are greeted by literally 5-7 men, dressed in suits, asking you the same question - 'How are you doing this evening?'. We were seated in the dining area on the ground level, a booth with some comfortable cushions. The waitstaff seems very particular in the placement of your beverages, and cleans up with a damp towel of any morsel or droplet of liquid that gets on the surface of the table. I tried the Green Tea/Grapefruit/Laven der, which was like a grapefruit sparking soda, with a hing of ginger. My cousin had the Ginger Citrus, which tasted literally like a strong ginger ale beverage (definitely better than the one at Wow Bao's). We had the Tasting Menu, and I expected probably a small morsel of anything, but I was actually surprised with the amount they give you for each plate. We first started off with the English Pea, and it tasted like green pea ice cream - slightly thick and creamy, and it was quite nice. The next was the Shad Roe, which tasted like a bacon tempura ball with a twig of bay leaves used as a skewer. The Distillation was a wine glass of Thai liquid, which was the least favorite of the dishes - it tasted like red pepper flakes with a hint of floral. The Pork Belly, which was my favorite of it all, was making your own spring roll with this rice paper that has beautiful little flowers within, and the restaurant presents you a glass platter of different ingredients that you build with - the braised pork was just delicious!!! The next dish we had was the Sturgeon, which were cubes of sturgeons with leek and croutons - great creamy sauce with smoked apple ribbon running across. Next was a cute little 3-part bowl with different tempered-Jonah Crab - it contained lobster mousse, king crab with crusted avocado, star anise bubble (which tasted creamy and black licorice-like). We had an offer of a glass of Sassporillo - really strong orange-colored root beer (not a fan of it). The next plate was the Filet de Boeuf, presented as a clock set-up, with little spoonfuls beef tongue (which was my absolute favorite since it was so awesome), duck was bleh, wagyu beef was kind of soft chewy, the panko too overly fried, the mushroom was just like a wet mushroom, cocksical (from the rooster) was gelatin-like - interesting experience. Next dish was the Duck, with cubes of duck with mushrooms, a cylindrical foie gras encrusted in dehydrated orange. Next was a spoonful of truffle ravioli - liquid 'explosion' of truffle inside. Next was the Earl Grey, the plate being set upon a fragrant Earl Grey pillow - the plate itself contained rounds of lemon curds with Earl Grey graham bits and a hint of rose water throughout. Next was a Chocolate dish, a trio of chocolate - chewy white bits, menthol, pudding, and several coral-like frozen chocolate at the end. As an extra treat, the restaurant gave us a ball of chocolate with melting cream (which was heavenly and good for the chocolate buffs). Our last dish was the Bubble Gum, which was a glass test tube-like filled with long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche - I liked the bubble gum-flavored tapioca balls. The whole experience took about 3 hours, and be sure to ask the waitstaff if you could take a tour of the kitchen - it's cool to see a behind-the-scenes look at each of the carefully-made dish. You get a copy of the menu with explanations of the circles at the end of your meal as a 'souvenir.' Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to experience a restaurant that's rated as one of the top restaurants in the world, and the fact that it was located in Chicago! If I had all the money in the world, I would probably dine here everyday. It's quite interesting to get an attentive service like this, and enjoying the beautifully-presente d food that actually tastes good as well!Yay for this restaurant getting 3 Michelin stars - Chef Achatz totally deserves it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Also they have great desserts that will melt in your moth.Every time my parents are in town, they want to come here, which I don't blame them.

"I seriously wonder what's wrong with people, reading all the glowing reviews of Sun-Wah and seeing how crowded it was tonight. The meal I just had there qualifies without hesitation as one of the most disgusting restaurant experiences in my entire life. The ambiance is awful, the service atrocious - rude, slow and unattentive - and the food (fried wontons and the bbq combination platter) was so bad, I've eaten better in school cafeterias. The appetizer was fatty, doughy and utterly flavorless, only edible slathered with generous amounts of soy sauce. The main course arrived very late and was obviously heated and reheated many times over, but still served cold, rubbery and hardened. Every single mouthful of so-called food had bits of bone, cartilege, sinews and fat and that goes for the rice as well. It was actually as if somebody had deliberately mixed the rice with bone shards, and cut the meat with a chain saw. Granted, prices here are affordable and servings generous - but are those really the only redeeming factors? There are so many many restaurants that are so vastly superior in the neighbourhood, I don't understand the appeal of Sun-Wah at all.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've eaten at Frontera a dozen times.Likes: The Topolo margarita. It is very good, one of my favorites. A bit on the small side for $10 bucks, but it has a great flavor.The chips and dips. Good flavor on both sauces and thick chips. $4 charge once again is a bit steep, especially when other places include them in your meal at no charge.Dislikes:The food always sounds great, the descriptions of the ingredients and plate presentations are very good. The issue I have is the food never tastes as good as it sounds or looks. Don't get me wrong, it has complex flavors and seems to be made with fresh ingredients, but all the dishes seem to lack salt (I am not a salt lover, but you need a touch to bring out flavors) and other times the sauces don't complement the protein ( a dark mole type sauce does not go with fish, even in Mexico, dark moles come from the intrior of Mexico...not much seafood there).I keep going back because I don't care for greasy tex-mex and Frontera is definately several steps above that.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I am a huge fan of Fogo de Chao but Texas de Brazil is every bit as good as Fogo. You are seated promptly by amazing looking hostess and the serving staff are friendly and efficient. The Mrs. prefers Texas de Brazils salad bar as it has sushi as well as soup and warm starters. I personally think Fogos salad bar is better as they have more dressings and everything seems more fresh but there really isn't a big difference between either salad bar. The lady spinning in the wine cave doesn't do much for me but my nephew loves it so again its whatever you are into yourself. The meat in Texas de Brazil can taste salty however the quality of the meat is very good but I do wish they would use less salt. Their Brazilian sausages are amazing and I always eat 5 or 6 at every visit. The bananas and bread are refreshed frequently and any time I have gone the servers and gauchos have all been very freindly.

The restaurant looks like it was converted from an old house- it has 1 main room which was very loud but also several other rooms father back which were much quieter. The probably allows them to cater to both louder groups and couples with a yen for quieter conversation. We signed up for the email notifications and we got a coupon for $14 off our next visit! We'll definitely be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Our story starts with me reading that Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen is an owner. Cool factor just went up a few notches. Now....we decide to pop by on a Friday night at about 7:30....we had to wait a bit....but not as long as I thought we would (45 min). It was REALLLLLY crowded and noisy....so if you want a slightly more civil atmosphere....wait for a table upstairs. This place is bursting with energy....and the wait staff was cool and edgy (girls with tats and spunky attitude)....and the service was good (especially considering how crowded it was) Now on to the stuff that really matters....the food. The pizza is NY style thin crust...and I was stoked to see how many topping options they had (many off the beaten path). We ordered a large half veggie (Banana Pepper, Spinach, Shroom and Onion) and half cheese. The crust was thin, crispy and flavorful. The ingredients were garden fresh...and it was piping hot. For NY style....this is one of the best I have tried. Note: I highly recommend BANANA PEPPERS....they are pickled with a hint of vinegar and add a nice piquant heat to your pie. Much more lively than red pepper.... For beverages I feel they fall a bit short due to their catering to the beer snob....I undestand that they are a brewery, but they are lacking a bit on the selections for those who DONT like IPA/Hope Bomb craft beeer. Call me old school...but I like a PBR, Bud, Point, etc with my pie. I wont nitpick too much....and it didnt change my overall rating. Interesting street cred side note: A coworker who is from New York said he feels Piece is better than his favorite place in Manahattan. Highly recommended....abbondanza.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Oh my goodness.Make no mistake, this is not a fine dining restaurant, this is not even a casual restaurant. It shares more in common with a Quiznos than with the former two categories. That said, it is phenomenal.If you go when it's busy, you're asked to wait in line for a table allocation before ordering. It's worth it. You then order at the counter and get your food in 15 minutes or so at your table. Everything is super fresh and made to order. I can recommend both the Pepito and the Woodland Mushroom. It's interesting to have something on a yeasted bread that tastes Mexican, but it makes me want to go to Mexico again.After our delicious dinner, we had some churros, ice cream (with a delicious praline that included bacon, yes, bacon), caf con leche, and melted chocolate mixed with almond milk. Rick Bayless may be a celebrity chef, but he's still working the details in his restaurants. He was working on the ice cream machine when we were there. Super impressed that someone of his caliber is still making sure every little thing is perfect.In summary, go here. You may have to share a table with people you've never met, but enjoy it, make some friends with both the people and the food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Good stuff! We went here last night after finding that the kitchen at our first choice restaurant was closed for two weeks while the owner is on vacation. No trashing on them yet though, because I still have high hopes. Back to Revolution! The atmosphere is fun and the dining space is very open. I'm not a beer drinker, so I opted for a Belvidere & 7, although my dining partner had one of their beers and seemed to like it. The food was fantastic! I had some burger with sauteed crimini mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese and fried onions. Best burger I've had in a while! I had the blue cheese potato salad as my side which was fantastic!! My dining partner had the fish & chips. The fries were super tasty, and they hand cut them! Also, our food came out super fast, and service was quite attentive. I'm only giving it four stars, just because I'm not ""in love"" with it, but it was a great place to go. For sure you should check it out!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Saturday, August 30, 2008Review of terribly rude service from Calo Ristorante located in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. My partner and I have patronized Calo Ristorante on many occasions. Calo Ristorante in my opinion has flavorful Italian cuisine at a reasonable price with mediocre service. However, on this particular occasion the managers' service skills were not present. My partner and I were viewing the menu posted out side of the restaurant before entering. The manager was walking into the restaurant and proceeded to hold the door open for a female patron and let the door swing shut behind him knowingly aware that my partner and I were directly behind him. We proceeded to open the door and walk in to the restaurant to be seated. The manager pretended not to notice that he had just shut the door in our faces as we were entering behind him. We ignored the incident and asked for a table for two. The manager proceeded to escort us to the loud noisy bar side were live music was playing. When I asked for a table on the other side of the restaurant he replied with all sorts of excuse's when there were clearly plenty of tables available for us to sit at. We declined the table and decided to eat else where. I am astonished at how simple it is to treat customers with dignity and respect and how difficult it is for some employees to perform this task. We have patronized Calo Ristorante many times, however, we will never consider entertaining the idea of having dinner at Calo Ristorante ever again. There are too many restaurants in the Chicago area to choose from with much better service and food for us to spend our money at.I thought you should know,Edgewater resident","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have been to India House many times. The food and service have always been supurb. However, recently I took a friend who was visiting from out of town and was very disappointed. The service was good but not great. The worst was the chilli chicken masala. The dish while very tasty was barely edible because the chicken itself was extremly tough, chewy and dry. We informed the server when he finally returned to our table. He could see that we couldn't even cut the pieces on my plate, so he offered to remake the dish, but at that point we had already waited a very long time for our food in the first place, and then again for the server to come back by our table. We took home the left overs but ended up tossing all the chicken. I think for the caliber of restaurant this is and with the prices it charges it can do a much better job of using better quality ingredients.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Simply It is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to get take out. The food is delicious, fairly healthy (lots of choices for vegetables and rice and not everything is fried) and the staff is extremely friendly. I highly recommend the Pho Bo (beef noodle soup), Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles, and Simply it's Beef (Bo Luc Lac). These have all been great! The Pho Bo is a main staple though- reason enough to order!Also they always give you complimentary fruit on the side (for take out at least) and again the staff is so nice. If you pick up, you will certainly meet the owner who will offer you tea or water and cater to your every need (even if you don't have any). He's great! Go to Simply It!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was really excited to go to Frontera. After realizing that reservations are made 3 months in advance and booked up solid, we waited 2 hours and finally made it to a nice spot outside of Frontera (even the fact that it was 9pm by then). Just be wary trying to ""walk-in"" for dinner here. We started off with the chips and salsa ($3 is a good value, but I'd pass here, the salsas are very normal bottle water like). Then came the Shredded Beef over Corn boats with avocado and a out of control sauce. I would order 3 more orders of this. Then the trio ceviche (tuna with mango, scallops, and calamari). All three were light, well seasoned, and perfect. I only wish I ordered bowls of it. Lastly came the enchilada mole. Ok, so I may not be a Mexican expert, but I grew up in California, and have had my fair share of Mexican food. I found the mole to be a bit underseasoned, and not as robust as I would expect a mole that has been cooking for hours. The chicken seemed a bit dried out, actually, a lot dried out. I found the beans to actually be the best part of the dish. Seriously I was a bit underwhelmed by the dish. But, overall, given the prices, the decent service, and the idea behind the restaurant, I really enjoyed Frontera Grill. I would try it again, with a different combination of foods, but hopefully with reservations.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"In a town based partially on the beef industry and with a storied history of excellent steak houses, Mastros stepped up to the plate and proved it could play with the big boys. Indeed in the same breath, I will now say, ""Smith & Wolinski, Gene & Georgetti's, Chicago Chop House,... Mastros."" This is my first review, but it details my second visit here. ""Cutting to the chase"" (pun intended), the chef seared the entire exterior of the chop with a butter/oil combination of some sort that locked the flavor into it. The sear did not overpower the beef flavor at all. Importantly, I ordered medium, and I got medium; my friends ordered medium rare, and they got medium rare. These people know how to cook. These people also know how to select a cut. With an eye for detail, my NY Strip had enough marble to cook correctly and taste correctly. It did not have just any old marbling, but rather the cut was thinly marbled so that the bites just melted in your mouth and did not resist a single chew.  Finally, the place knew how to pair, prepare and cook the sides. I wanted grilled asparagus with a very light medium, and I received perfectly grilled asparagus with a slight bit of butter. Their renowned lobster mashed and wasabi mashed potatoes never disappoint and have their own draw. The lobster mashed are not greasy at all, and have the right amount of fat so as not to be overly rich. The wasabi mashed have the best flavor to them of any mashed potatoes I've ever had, and I eat mashed potatoes (and thus go to the gym) about 4 times per week. The sides are the specialty. The wine list is partially professional. If you know your wine, then you'll love it; if you don't know your wine, then the staff will help you love it. I had a Bordeaux, and I went out and bought half a case of the same because it was that good! Furthermore on the staff, professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and accomodating without compromising. They won't let some philistine come into the place and throw down some ketchup, but I also felt that they would not reprimand you obnoxiously for some social or dining misstep. Our waiter made our experience better. The ambiance is classic yet modern, with a sort of cleanliness to it that still makes the warm rather than sterile. You have a traditional, awesome piano bar where they keep booked an outstanding trio of a drummer, piano player, and vocalist. The lights are very, very dim, as they should be. The walls are dark wood, the accents are hard marble and other woods, with a tasteful and plush carpet in the dining rooms. The place embodies simple elegance. Returning to the piano bar, you get a lively but refined crowd of younger to middle-aged socialites, but no trashiness overall. You get all walks of life, older couples, girls/guys on the town, people just grabbing a bite, and those doing a quick business dinner in a really nice bar. Business professionals and classy average joes/janes as well frequented that day. The place has a great vibe. I only saw two hipsters, and both of them were bro's in what you could tell was their finest piece of ironic flannel clothing. Kudos to them for trying to exhibit some sort of manners by wearing some sort of collar and at least partially showering and partially covering their ironic tattoos, and not talking about going ""double-pits-to-chesty"" while INSIDE of the restaurant. Maybe these guys are the refined version of that awful manager at Owen & Wilson (a.k.a Owen & Engine)... but I digress. At the risk of just sounding as though I merely received exactly what I requested and hence was pleased upon delivery, I offer you this: consistency makes champions. However, I'll add that I have never been more impressed with the side dishes at any other steak house, which is what put Mastros into the big leagues. You should go there just to have the lobster or wasabi mashed potatoes some time! They're that good. Regrettably, I need to dock it one star because technically it is a chain, albeit on the higher end of chains. The common threat of a chain is always the stifling of creativity, and though the head chef may be creating in his main kitchen somewhere and have excellent monitoring at the locations, the formula approach always discounts as to the specialness of the location. Let's not hang our hats on that one downside, thought. This place is outstanding. Mastros, my hat is off to you, and I salute you for your excellence. I will be back next week!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Tasty Thai cuisine in a location near the bars of Lincoln Square. It's a nice place to dine in and if you're lazy like me, they'll deliver to your house on time.  The staff is very helpful and you get full control over the level of spice. With three rooms of dining, any size party is nicely accommodated and the bathrooms are clean. The appetizers are tasty; I recommend as the Satays and the Moo Ping. As for main courses, I usually go with the Eggplant in Oyster sauce. Their Pad Thais and Panang Curries are full of flavor and the soups are served in unique Thai bowls that may or may not double as trophies.  It all leads to a nice dinner where you'll feel full but not busted. Good times? Yes!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is swanky!!! After our anniversary dinner (and dessert) I suggested that we go check this place out. My boyfriend was on board so we walked down by Big Star and couldn't find anything! Well after crossing the street we noticed that people were entering a mural (yes, a mural). The doorman was wearing all black and we had to stand in a hallway with a velvet curtain with another couple while they found space for us. The house rules are hilarious, you can't use your cell phone inside. You must have proper attire, no flip flops please! The last one is definitely the best; don't bring anyone that you wouldn't bring to your mother's house for Sunday dinner. I haven't seen them enforce any of these rules, but everyone was generally well behaved on a Thursday night. We waited about 5 minutes and then were escorted to a table with two giant (tall) green leather chairs with a tiny circular table. The chairs are set up to be private (so for just the two of us) but there are little pods and all of the chairs are connected. They also have a bar area to sit at as well as booths for parties of more than two. The chairs aren't all that comfortable and it is dark and dim in the place, but that goes with the whole speakeasy feel. It's loud inside. People are chatting, couples are romancing, and the indie music is blaring. Everything in this place screams ""trying too hard"" but it wasn't as if I didn't enjoy the extravagance. I asked for something ""fruity and light"" and our server made the perfect suggestion, the Vodka Cobbler. I could drink this drink all night and my buzz snuck up on me fast. My boyfriend ordered something with root beer liquor. I am not a fan on root beer so I passed but he raved and raved. The service is a bit slow and expect to wait 10-15 minutes or more for your drink to come after you have ordered, especially on a busy night. Since the drinks are so involved (and there are a ton of options) it takes awhile to get your drink. We didn't have any food but the menu was short and to the point. My boyfriend and I both agreed that we LOVE this place and now we just need some classy friends to bring!","[0.0, 1.0]"

The barista was generally unpleasant - not outright rude, but ignored me for several minutes then took my order without much in the way of eye contact or interest. The cafe is in a separate room, but to get there you have to go outside, meaning you have to deal with two doors - not easy with a pastry in one hand and a cappuccino in ceramic in the other (I spilled half of it). The cafe itself was dirty, the tables crowded together cafeteria style, and the chairs uncomfortable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am not a tasting menu girl. I am a ""give me a plate of my favorite pasta and let me stuff my face with it girl."" (I know, classy.) I like to know what I am getting, which is usually the same thing I got last time if I loved it. But boy, am I glad I got to have this experience. Getting here for the earliest reservation of the night can be a little uncomfortable... you are greeted by 3 or 4 people standing around in a very spare and modern room... in silence. Where's the music? But once the space starts filling up, and you're onto your 2 or 3rd pairing of wine (which I highly recommend you get! Its unbelievable!), this incredibly special experience becomes truly exceptional. Every dish was amazing. But the ones I loved the most were a pork belly DIY asian spring roll type thing. I am glad I've had some model airplane building experience in my youth, because this one required some assembling and disassembling of the place setting. (Probably also helped that it was one of the earlier dishes, before the buzz of the wine set in!) Also fantastic was the most amazing piece of beef I've ever had... incredibly marbled (was it wagyu, perhaps?). I don't think I can ever go back to having a normal slab of steak.  Like going to your favorite band's concert... when dinner ended, I felt a bit misty, because it will be far too long before I get to have this kind of an experience again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My company had its annual dinner here several months back, and I have to say it was absurdly good as all-around tasty meatfests go. The various meats were spiced effectively and never dry, and while some are in rotation less frequently than others, the point is to enjoy at your own pace, so take your time, and sample the entire spread. The wine list was comprehensive, the salad bar both essential as a palate-cleanser and supremely well-stocked. The service is attentive, as the gimmick with the tokens effectively demands of them. I'd go back, but certainly it's not something you can fit easily within a normal diet without making allowances for the absolutely fabulous amount of protein you'll have ingested.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It was obvious that they were crowded and overbooked. We ended up not being seated until 9:30 pm. We were asking the hosts for updates on timing when the manager decided to lie to us and tell us that they were running 15 mins late and our reservation was at 9:15 not at 9:30. This was a complete lie as I even looked over his shoulder and saw that it said 9 pm. Finally we were seated with no apology, no complimentary appetizer for our delay but fine, I let it.

"LOOOVE Pequod's. The only reason I cannot give this place five stars is because the pizza tastes slightly different each time. Having been here over 10 times, this past experience was the best it prompted me to finally write a review. The sauce was perfectly tart with the right amount of cheese and toppings: half pepp/half sausage being my favorite. The crust is unbelievable and I have no idea where they found the crust caramelizing wizard. They probably lock him in a cage to never see the light of day as this sets it apart from all other pizza places I have been to, and is what keeps me returning for more. The Medium is perfect for 2 as you get a great balance of crust and toppings. My ultimate favorite is the $4.95 lunch deal with pop/beer not only for the outrageous value, but for the balance of crust and the rest. Pequod's doesn't skimp on toppings for the personal size which fosters its loyal following. i dream of Pequod's on a daily basis and am really bummed I can't go here tonight, despite having been this past Saturday. It's that good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I just got back to my hotel following dinner at schwa. My ears are ringing. They're ringing loud and nonstop. My voice is raspy from having to shout to be heard during dinner. 80% of what the food runners said to describe a particular dish couldn't be deciphered above the roar of their music. Talk about high stress dining.... 3 hours of deafening music, helter skelter service, and quite frankly, surroundings befitting a bomb shelter. Further, the music makes no sense. It's blaring for the benefit of the line cooks yet it's directed toward the customers. I'm not sure if there is much truth to their reservation inadequacies. I called the restaurant this afternoon. The phone was answered promptly by a pleasant young lady. I asked about a reservation for the same evening and she asked if I preferred 6, 6:30 or, 8:30. I selected 8:30 and that was that. The host and busboy for our meal was the head cook's brother. A very nice guy. Wired pretty tight, but nice all the same You can read a dozen other reviews for details on the succession of courses. A few of them were very good. A few of them were forgettable. All of them are miniscule. Too many of them have some sort of foam or dried out sauce streaked across the dish. One of the foams actually tasted like soap suds. That which stood out, on each of the 2 or 3 times it occurred, was when something was served that offered some substance. Something to actually bite and chew, rather than just slurp and swallow. Most of their food is baby food soft. When something finally comes along that has some body, sadly, it's just a bite in size. Even their lamb, for example, was served in miniature. 4 slices, maybe 1/8"" thick and smaller than 1"" x 3/4"". BYO. No soft drinks offered. No bread offered. No coffee or tea offered. Overall- I have to give Schwa 1 star- based on the simple truth that I would never return. Not even as somebody's guest. Life's too short.","[0.0, 1.0]"

In sum total, it was THE best restaurant opening I've ever had the pleasure to be invited to.

Oh yeah...superb wine, desserts (warm butter cake!), service, and overall ambiance as well. Did I mention that the soft opening was all you can eat? Yowzer!!

Simply put, I think it may turn out to be the best that Chicago has to offer....in my humble, yet correct opinion. :DFunny aside: A guy in his late 20's was standing in the lobster line ahead of me, and flippantly said that he'd been to Mastro's in Vegas, and that it was the best restaurant he'd ever been to in his life. Of course, I promptly gave him my best yeah, whatever look of condescension. Turns out the joke was on me, since it really was that good. Look out Gibson's....there's a new sheriff in town!*Somebody mentioned the dark lighting. I'd have to agree that it is indeed a teeny tiny bit too dark, but definitely not a deal killer. It's part of the overall ambiance, although one shouldn't need a flashlight to read the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went here for a girls night out! It is always hard to order sushi with a large group and for the waiter to organize everything. Coast did a great job taking our order, splitting our checks, and helping us have a fun night. They also recommended so great rolls for us to try and made sure all food allergies were addressed. Sushi - delicious, unique rolls but the only complaint is they are a bit small. I thought the price was a bit high considering how much we got for our money Atmosphere - Great decor, nice waiting area in front! BYOB - makes this an affordable night on the town! I understand they only let you have so many bottles on the table though so we hid them in our purses. haha.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"As I walked in, I saw a sign on the wall for a chicken breast milk shake (I think it was called the Gizzard Blizzard). Haha, uhm really? Anyways, I barely looked at the menu and decided on the $19.99 combo deal. This came with a whole fried chicken, in 2 different sauces, with 2 sides, and 2 drinks. Pretty sweet deal. The chicken had a nice crunch, which stayed crispy while covered in sauce, and the chicken was juicy. The Seoul Sassy sauce was sweet and ginger-garlicky. It's not your typical Korean wing sauce, but it was still tasty. The Crisp BBQ sauce was good with a nice kick. The fries weren't anything special, but the fried mushrooms were great.  They also have chicken strips as well as varioius Korean style rice bowls. I love me some Korean fried chicken and Crisp definitely satisified. I still wonder if that Gizzard Blizzard was for real.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went for a business lunch today at the restaurant. I give the place 5 stars for decor and ambiance, what I enjoyed was the several photos of topless women which I thought was very tasteful. In the interest of an orderly meeting we were offered a set menu. The presentation was beautiful but the taste was par not sensational. This restaurant loses a star because many people wanted to go boxes but they refused to give any which I thought was just ridiculous.

"I have no idea why this doesn't get a full 5 stars. Let's face it, unless I get done dirty, if I post a review on Yelp, it's because I LOVE it! And Gino's is no exception. Now, as far as deep dish or pan pizzas go, Domino's deep dish is my sole experience. Anyway, I'm gonna make this a short review because the mere thought of Gino's crust makes me salivate, and being nearly 2000 miles away, it's not helping me! My buddy and I had two small pizzas, and that was A LOT to eat for the two of us. So much so that one big slice made it back home with us. We had Gino's Supreme with patty sausage and pepperonis. I was a bit disappointed by the sausage patty. It was otherwise pretty damn good! The other one was the Meaty Legend, was seen in Man vs Food, and wow it was sooooo good! But the main attraction was the crust. That big slab of crust that borders the pan is just pure heaven! It's unlike ANYTHING else you've ever had. It's a bit buttermilk and a bit corn bread, but it's a whole lot of goodness! Anyway, if you're a Chicago first timer and a deep dish pizza novice like I was, Gino's East is a definitive stop! BEWARE: The lines are crazy on a Friday night. If you're staying at a hotel, hit up your friendly concierge and they'll hook you up with a ""head of the line"" pass that lets you bypass the line (and enables your concierge to get a little kickback I'm sure).

"So, you know how awkward it is to go to an old fashioned record store, walking in and looking around and awkwardly thumbing through the first shelf you come to in an effort to fervently divert your eyes from the scornful gazes of a half dozen snotty and ticked off for no reason hipster clerks? And then you discover that you're in front of a bunch of metal albums and you don't really listen to metal, you really want to find this old folk album from the 1990's and you don't know where the folk section is, and you get really nervous because those surly hipsters are still casting frown rays onto you and you suddenly feel like the stupidest, lamest person on the planet, and so you either leave without buying anything or grab the first thing that you see and take it home and never open it?This place is just like that record store, except it's a restaurant.

"Anteprima helped my boyfriend and I celebrate our 5 year anniversary together. With reservations, we got a saturday evening table. Our server was friendly, attentive and helped us make some great menu decisions. We had grilled octopus and pork sausage with white beans to start - both were 10s. My boyfriend has homemade bowtie pasta with duck, I had butternut squash ravioli - again both excellent. The smaller portions were a perfect size. They gave us a free lemon panna cotta with a candle in honor of our date! It was my favorite part of the meal - totally out of this world. I wish there was a 4.75 button!

My ONLY critique of this place is that they seemed to spice our food for an american pallet.

"Amazing. The most perfect slice of deep dish I've ever had. And I've tried hundreds of pizza places. There is something about the way the crust is flaky but still kind of melts in your mouth.

Now we just go for the best stuff - the appetizers are almost all really great. For entrees, the BF gets the Bandeja Paisa (and eats the whole thing). I get the Entrana, or the combinacion, with baby octopus and the steak (same steak as the Entrana), which comes with potato, yuca and fried sweet plaintain. Oh, add a margarita to that - their bartender shakes the HELL out of them and it somehow makes it even more tasty.  Delicious!

Everything was great until I found 2 cockroaches next to me. One was on the wall and the other one was on the table. Everybody felt so disgusted and we called the server out to show him the evidence (my husband killed them with the napkin).

It wasn't smoked like one might expect from a BBQ joint, but it was very tasty. The description mentioned that it came with fresh fruit. I was expecting an orange wedge and perhaps a few bits of melon. What I got was orange slices, two good sized chunks of fresh pineapple, a big chunk of melon, and a handful of grapes.

"Jim has been talking about this place for quite a while, so when his birthday dinner loomed, we weren't surprised when he chose Carnivale for the festivities. We were seated relatively quickly, and the staff was very attentive. Drinks arrived fast as did our appetizers -- guacamole (Excellent, chunky and tasty) and Flores y Camarones (SO delicious we all agreed that they could just keep them and the drinks coming and we'd be happy.) both of which we split three ways. After overdoing it the previous week at Maya del Sol, I was determined to take it easier on the cocktails so I only had one, but it was a coconut mojito, and if you think that sounds good you should try it. In fact, try drinking only one! It was heavenly. Just a perfect cocktail. Jim's margarita was delicious, too, but it could not steal my heart away from my mojito. The birthday boy had the costilla des res. Again, not a surprise because he is a serious fan of the short rib. I love them, too, but I saw gnocci with ramps, mushrooms and peas and simply could not resist. I snarfed them down in spite of preferring my dumplings to be heavier. These were like clouds and I still loved them because the sauce was so exceptional. Glinda had the Peruvian-style chicken and I was blown away by how moist and tender it was.  Desserts were the farmers' market special which was a mixed berry cobbler, chocolate cake with almond ice cream and the banana cream pie. With candied macadamia nuts. They took out one of my crowns. Actually I found it kind of funny; it was an old crown and s**t happens. No big. I told the waitress that but she kept apologizing. Then the hostess came by and apologized and comped the pie, which I thought was pretty nice of them. But then I'm kind of easy-going about stuff.  (Which is one reason why, when I give a one-star review, pay attention to it. I am HARD to piss off.) I have to admit that along with excellent food and service the people-watching is fantastic at Carnivale. A couple got engaged while we were there, and the outfits that flowed past the table ranged from ""That looks nice and cool"" to ""Oh dear, mutton dressed as lamb."" to ""What is that guy wearing?"" to ""What DO you think you LOOK like?"" But in the end, the place has such a laid back vibe that almost everything worked. It was fun. It was what its name implied, a kind of carnivale atmosphere year-round. Well done to the owners; they've created a winner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Wow... can't believe how many reviews Wakamono has already! It makes sense though- this place is always packed whenever I walk past.I finally stopped in here the other night with a friend to see what all the fuss was about. Well, there's a reason for the fuss. This place is great! Talking about the atmosphere sounds kind of lame, but the design really is calming and beautiful. Even if you sit outside, you still get a really calming experience.Ok, so to the good part- the food! We ordered the crab rangoon (has a slightly different name- but that's what it is) and it was delicious. The edges were crispy but the center was moist and yummy.We aren't big sushi people, so we played it a bit safe with our selection. We ordered a regular tuna and avocado maki (my fav), the sweet potato maki, and a spicy trio roll. I wanted to compare the tuna to other places I usually get sushi (Whole Foods... yeah, I know). I can safely say the basic tuna roll at Wakamono is the best tuna I've had. The sweet potato was pretty unique, and definitely was a good choice for breaking up all the fish. I recommend it if you're unsure about getting a bunch of fish.They also had a special on house wine, $4 for a glass was not too bad. Overall, I had a very enjoyable dinner at Wakamono and recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable yet great sushi experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I told myself I wouldn't write this review if it happened to me. After LITERALLY months of calling daily I scored a reservation for my husband's 50th Birthday. I was in Chicago for that week - I flew in wine for our dinner (you have to check it!) and purchased stems locally.  The day before the dinner I got a call confirming my reservation. 4 hours before dinner I received a voice mail telling me the restaurant was not going to be open that day. REALLY - 4 hours before?? I really don't know if they actually were closed but I do know that I was in a position where I had little time or access to the internet to find another restaurant on such short notice for my husbands birthday. Oh - in the message they said I could call back and reschedule - IT TOOK ME OVER A MONTH TO GET THROUGH TO THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE!

"Geja's is quite hidden but is often crowded. I personally don't like it when a restaurant and people filled with it from wall to wall, but this place was nice. Geja's does have a very relaxed ambient romantic feel to it. My waiter was super friendly, nice, and accommodating. The fondue was great and the bar was good too.

I love to eat vanilla ice cream with smashed up pretzels marinating in the softening ice cream. The longer those salty pretzels linger the better the blend of sweet meets salt. The white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes always satisfies this craving. The presentation of white chocolate drizzled across the pancake creates excitement for the eyes awaiting that first bite. The taste was divine. Perfection of blend of textures awakening my taste buds. It was such a pleasure to dine at the Bongo Room. We were a party of 4. Each of us ordered a different selection and each of us was again quite pleased with our dining experience.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I honestly didn't think i was going to like this place. Seafood places always seem to disappoint me, but i have to say that Shaw's was freegin' phenom. We had a party of 4 and EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing! APPS: Calamari:  Crunchy goodness. But it tasted fresh, if that is possible with something that is deep fried. yummy. Crab Leg Bites:  sweet, juicy leg bites that'll make you weep. Clam Chowder:  rich, creamy goodness MAIN: OvenRoasted Whitefish: moist yet crispy. Big portion and awesome Lobster:  we had 2 whole lobsters and they were what you'd expect if you're a lobster lover.  Bone-in Filet Mignon:  As good as any cow you'd get from a high end steakhouse. SIDES: Creamed spinach, mac and Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin: ALL of these sides were spectacular.  Well, probably not amazing for my ass, but amazing for my mouth. Very naughty, but comfort food at it's absolute best. DESSERT: Raspberry Pie, Key lime Pie. The Raspberry pie adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream was pure HEAVEN on a plate. I could've eaten a whole pie of this. I personally am not a key lime pie lover, but those who were, raved about it. Overall: i'd come back to this place in a heartbeat. Yes, it's a bit on the pricier side, but i've been to so many pricey seafood places and left sorely disappointed. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been here several times on various trips to Chicago so I figured now was the time to write about it. They have two things that make this place worth 4 stars, without these two things the restaurant would be a 3 star place.1. The cheese plate menu- The Fat Cat is probably the best but others are really amazing as well.2. The truffle honey that the cheese puffs are dipped in. Both of those things elevate this place to a higher level. The service is entirely dependent on how busy the restaurant is. On nights that are less busy the service can be excellent. However, on nights where things are a little more crowded I have found the services slipping quickly. Otherwise, the food is general good and the wine list is extensive. If you have never been I would suggest you go.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First impression: Beautiful and vibrant decor. I went here for lunch with a friend. The cubano sandwich was good, big enough that I had to take half home. It came with mixed greens. Excellent raspberry mojito. I ordered it then almost had buyer's remorse, thinking they may add some razmatazz or something...but was pleasantly relieved to see that they muddled fresh raspberries into the drink. The harmony of lime, mint, and flecks of fresh berry were a great combination. I think this restaurant is in the building that housed The Drink years ago. I bet the lounge area is nice at night. $5 valet. Eh. Well that area is parking challenged.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"so glad i got to try this place! it was a lot of fun even though my friend and i embarrassingly had a hard time finding the actual entrance. oops. anyway! the place is hip as hell - way too hip for me actually. very very dark, tiny tables, and high-backed chairs. we were in time for the summer menu and the cocktails were really great! i got to try the old & young and the public purse (both gin) and well as the midnight stinger and their sazerac. the best drink was definitely the public purse. they did a great job with the egg white. mmm foamy. the old and young was a typical fruity cocktail, which was good, but not very complex, so i don't think i'd get it again, at least not here. i liked the sazerac, but sadly, i could think of two better sazeracs i'd had in my life, both for cheaper. overall i really like this place and think it'd be a really great place for a date (not a first date though since there's so much pressure to be hip) or a quiet drinking night out with friends. the food menu didn't look that interesting but i think it'd be worth trying if i came back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Calo Ristorante is definitely worth the Trip! You won't regret it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm perplexed with the large amount of good ratings with Revolution Brewing. I'm in Logan Square a lot so I was very excited for this place. The hordes of people who descended on RevBrew wasn't a big surprise and the wait usually wasn't too bad assuming you didn't go specifically for a table during peak times. Outside of the interior, which I love, everything about this place is average. The beer, which I was looking forward to the most because I'm a beer snob, was a huge disappointment. The beers are by no means bad but they fail to distinguish themselves. The Workingman Mild tasted too watered down, the Coup d'etat started off interesting but stopped there and the Bottom Up Wit was merely passable. I must admit, however, that the Eugene porter was pretty good. When I had the RevBrew beers they didn't distinguish themselves from other stalwart wits, milds or saisons. The food (only appetizers so far, will return for main courses) were somehow more bland than the beer, an impressive feat which the cooks should be commended for. The spicy sweet potato cakes weren't spicy at all and lacked any complexity, the bruschetta (goat cheese + beats, traditional) was simply awful and the beer cheese soup tasted like something I could have concocted in 15 minutes. In each of these appetizers what was apparent was that the ingredients were subpar. The beets with the bruschetta lacked flavor and the cheese used in the soup was boring. I really, really wanted to like this place. It's a damn shame that the owner decided to play it safe and produce mediocrity because this place could have been amazing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"On a long weekend to Chicago, with a late Sunday flight home, were looking for a good place for brunch/lunch that would see us through the day. This was it ! It's similar to a Brazilian steakhouse with food served directly at the table and a salad bar ( Harvest Tables) that you can visit as much as you like. Personally I found the Harvest Table fare a little disappointing as many items were too sweet, but this was brunch so that was to be expected. The table service food, however was excellent. Rib roast, turkey breast, ham, linguisa and salmon (though I don't usually eat farmed salmon) were all perfectly cooked and served freshly cooked from the kitchen. There were also more brunch-like egg based dishes - a poached egg on spinach and a frittata-like dish with corned beef. The servers will keep coming until you throw in the towel - or rock in this case. We definitely ate enough not to be hungry the rest of the day. $24 per person was a very reasonable price for the food offered, though we spent double that as we had a bottle of wine in addition to a sangria and a flight of wine ( 3 x 2oz for $12). Actually the wine selection was reasonably priced in comparison to some of the other Chicago menus I had seen.  All the staff were friendly and very attentive - we arrived at 1pm, there were only a few tables occupied, so I don't know if that applies during busier times. Unfortunately, I probably won't get back to Chicago for years, so I won't be able to check out the dinner at this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The environment was pretty nice too, I was surprised at how big the space is inside. The high ceilings help to alleviate the roaring of hockey-ees. Also, Piece is the kind of place you'll most likely see other people you know there. I don't know why...and I've only been once! Anyways, the food was darn good too.

My girlfriend and i went there on a friday night at 8pm. we had to wait 15 min which wasn't that bad. We had the Prosciutto and mozzarella to start. probably some of the best fresh mozzarella that i've had in Chicago, the prosciutto was just ok. as for pizza we tried the mushroom pizza with black truffles and truffle oil and the sausage with basil. the truffle pizza didn't have any truffles on it, but the price wasn't $30 as most black truffle pizzas i've had. it was fair probably 2stars out of 5. the sausage was much better but both pizzas the crust was soggy. it wasn't under cooked or at least i don't think it was bc i saw some black charring on the crust.  so not sure why it wasn't crispy.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Date: March 24, 2006 Location: 676 North Saint Clair Corkage: not allowed Cost: $550 - Market Collection Menu & Wine Pairing (includes t & t) Phone: 312.202.0001 Had a 9:45pm reservation at TRU on the Friday I arrived in Chicago. As Crystal and I checked in, we were directed to the bar as the staff gets our table ready. We ordered two glasses of the 2004 K Vintners Viognier to start off the evening. About half way through the glass, we were informed the table is ready and offered a tour of the kitchen before sitting down. The kitchen tour wasn't too interesting, just a standard quick walk-by. The dinner menu was presented to us, one side listing the pre-fixe menu with choices and the other listing the Collection options. Unfortunately the Seafood Collection wasn't available, which was what I wanted to try, but we made do with the Market Collection for the both of us. A different approach to the wine pairing aspect, nothing listed, offered if asked and kind of go on a whim based on the $$ one wants to spend. Not exactly how I would of done if if I owned a restaurant, but that's a different topic. The Market Collection is a nine course menu as listed below, course three through seven were prepared two ways with each of us having a different preparation of the same main ingredient. *** Grand Amuse-Bouche ~Scallop Ceviche, Avocado Puree, Lime Segments ~Tuna, Marinated Trevio, Orange Italian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Chilled Cauliflower Creme, Lemon Confit 2002 Selbach-Oste Zetlinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Kabinett New Zealand Langoustine ~Fresh New Zealand Langoustine, Thai Chili, Lemon Zest, Watercress ~Roasted New Zealand Langoustine, Baby Carrots, Turnips, Fennel, Langoustine Jus 2003 Hirsch Gruner Veltinger Kammener Heiligenstein Duck ~Duck Bouillon, Duck Prosciutto ~Veloute of Duck, Duck Confit NV Rare Wine Company Charleston Sericial Madeira Special Reserve Nova Scotia Halibut ~Nova Scotia Halibut ""a la plancha"", Sea Urchin, Preserved Lemon, Citrus Jus ~Roasted Nova Scotia Halibut, Razor Clams Casino, Bacon, Clam & Spinache Sauce 2003 William Fevre Chablis Montmains Pasta Course ~House-made Farfalle, Chicken Wing Confit, Bayonne Ham & Foie Gras Glaze ~Spaghettini, Carbonara Sauce, Parmesan Reggiano, Raw Amish Egg NV Henri Billiot Rose Brut Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye ~Roasted Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye, Braised Beef Short Rib, Glazed Pearl Onions, Crispy Bacon Lardons ~Grilled Prime Midwestern Beef Rib Eye, Fondant Potatoes, Bearnaise Reduction 2003 Yann Chave Crozes-Hermitage Tete de Cuvee TRU Collection of Cow, Goat and Sheeps' Milk Cheeses Cherry Mint Soup Duet of Desserts 1999 Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 5 Puttonyos Mignardises and Lollipops *** While the food was good overall and we got to try two different preparations, not one single dish gave me the wow factor. As usual, the final meat course failed me once again, although good to see it was ribeye rather than the standard filet mignon, but that's about the only compliment I can give the course. The wine pairing choices were nice for the price they charged, but the word pairing should be crossed out as none of the wine paired well with the food. Not saying the pairing was awful, but definitely more thoughts could be put into the process. The service was attentive, prompt and precise, but WAY TOO mechanical and stuffy. Small talk with the Sommelier didn't go anywhere, seem disinterested. None of the staff at the restaurant had a smile on them except for one person. Same type of service as French Laundry, but not what I would enojy as a dining experience. TRU is not a place I would return, just from the food standpoint, French Laundry, LaToque and Cyrus all out performs TRU. I can certainly name a few other places of different type of cuisine that out shine TRU as well, not a difficult task. Perhaps I am a bit spoiled and too critical, but a restaurant of this level should still show better.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Love nice BYOB restaurants! We came here for an anniversary dinner (last year was Tru and we decided to go for good food with a more chill atmosphere this year (and a slightly lower price point). The boyfriend and I both loved 6 of 8 courses. The quail starter (amazing), the motoyaki, the pork two ways (I wanted to lick the miso sake broth), and the chocolate hazelnut creme brulee were amazing!!!! Neither of us were fans of the loaded baked potato as it was far to smokey tasting (I was sad about this as the concept is so scrumptious), or the reverse cheese and crackers. I appreciate that with a wheat allergy, I could eat almost everything. The service was slow to start (i.e. no one came up to us for a good 10 mins), but was great by the end of the night. The restaurant could use a sign out front, or at least something to display that it's actually a restaurant. But I do love the simple decor and presentation. If you go to BonSoiree you're there for the food and not for any other distractions. I want to give 5 stars because those 6 of 8 were so good, but the baked potato was difficult to eat because the smoke flavor was so strong, and the initial lack of service was a bit odd. I wish I could do 4.5 stars yelp! That said, I can't wait to go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The extraordinarily high backs on the Queen Anne wing back chairs feel sort of Alice in Wonderland. The lighting is very dim. I like it. This can not be overstated. THE BEST DARK & STORMY I HAVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE!! It is unreal how good this is. I have had them at many other high end establishments and no comparison.

The place was packed but it was easy to get a drink at the bar as the bartenders were on top of their game and alert. We were behind another group next to the bar and the bartender noticed that we needed drinks.If I can make one recommendation it is to get the mussels! So good! I also ended up getting french onion soup which was to die for and the tilapia sandwich, also good. Overall great time with my friends and the bill was reasonable as well. I will definitely be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Our Best outing here yet. Fathers Day, went early 5:30. Our waiter was very good and attentive. Pop's and I had the ribs. Flavorful, fall off the bone, they were excellent. The girls had fish. A crispy Caesar's salad with 2 pieces of Salmon resting on top. The wife just loved it. Topped it off with carrot cake, spumoni ice cream, and a very tasty creamy gelato. mmm! mmm! We couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. Oh, did I mention that they have ""validated"" parking? Yes","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went to Irazu for dinner with a friend last week. There was a bit of a wait, but we just made ourselves comfortable outside and after about 15 minutes, the hostess came and got us and brought us to our table. BYOB we brought a few beers that we hoped would go well with our authentic Costa Rican meal, and were pleasantly surprised when our hostess complimented our choice. Having never been to Costa Rica I had no idea what to expect so we deferred to our server who was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Each of us ordered one of the more traditional Costa Rican meals and were more than satisfied with the quality, quantity, and flavor! I became lost in finding all the best parts of my meal, and before I knew it, it was gone! I had heard such great things about the oatmeal shake, but there was no way I had any room - Next time I will have to push back my plate and take home some leftovers!Would definitely go back. The only tips is that it is Cash Only, though it looked like there was an ATM!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Really? Everyone really loves their pizza that much? Is it maybe because they are OD'ed on cheesy gooey deep dish pizza in Chicago? To be honest, I haven't been to Napoli recently, but let me say that I had better Italian wood-fired pizza in Kathmandu (really, I did. Oh, how I wish that I could review restaurants in Nepal on yelp...). My funghi pizza was so soggy that I didn't want to finish my pizza. And that's just unheard of. The service wasn't so great either. Yes, they were nice enough to seat us before our party was complete (granted, the restaurant was empty at 5pm) but our server didn't know his pizzas very well. You see, I *hate* sliced California olives that come out of a can and he was not able to assure me that they were not of that type. So, 2 stars for the pizza but one extra star for the hostess.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I have been getting sushi X delivery for years but there is one dish that stands out for me and its the spicy tuna salad. I love that its basically the inside of a spicy tuna roll on a salad of greens topped with avocado. The best thing is that it is an entire meal for $9 there is soo much tuna on top.

"Chicago is a hot dog town! And hot dog-it (!!!), I love Hot Doug's!!! If you were from out of town like me and have no car, your best bet is a nice long bus ride. You get dropped off right across the street, which in my opinion isn't so bad, especially since I got to have a nice look at the neighborhood and so forth. Anyway, let's get to the FOOD. So many choices up on the wall, but what you should really aim for is getting The Dog, which is just Chicago style and that foie gras dog. The fries in duck fat were only available on Friday and Saturday, so my Thursday visit was less eventful. Although those two dogs were the best I have ever had in my life. Chicago doesn't mess around when it comes to hot dogs. Also, I'm sure this place has had a lot of people come ever since it was featured on TV ... but it still feels like a regular corner joint. The guy at the front was really calm and nice and didn't seem to look down on the two fatties before him who ordered more than two hot dogs (yes, it was us). Hot dogs came up quick and tasted good. That was what we loved. I'm definitely coming back to Chicago so I can tear into this menu a little bit more. Plus I'm sure my mom would love this place because they have an Elvis dog!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This was my first time trying this restaurant since I had heard good things. When I explored the online ordering, I was impressed with the ease of ordering and what appeared to be an accurate representation of when the food would be ready (over an hour since we ordered chicken). I think the food was ready much earlier than the time on the website since it was barely warm when we picked it up 10 minutes BEFORE the time noted. Also, they forgot the drink that was included with one item so I had to remind them. The worst part was that when we got home I noticed we didn't get the all white meat on the quarter chicken (and paid an extra $1 for) and they didn't include the extra side of corn that we paid for. When I called in to complain the first response was ""whoever took the order didn't make that note so you weren't charged."" Of course, I had to explain that I had submitted the order online and the confirmation and bill included those items. The response back was an offer to credit free corn the next time I ordered from them and when I pushed for an adjustment on the credit card charge, I was told they didn't know how to do that and would ""leave a note for the owner.""To be fair, the next the owners contacted me and apologized with a full credit and encouraged me to return and a big reason why I will definitely give them another chance. Its nice to see that they care about the client experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Placing your order at the counter was a bit strange and different, but really worked out and I can see why they do it.

"My best man picked Shaw's for the bachelor party, and I was impressed by the service and tasty food.

I have tried pretty much everything on the menu; even the tamales and I haven't been disappointed once. I have been going here probably since the womb, so that is a magnificent feat. Opening up that box of holiness stuffed with your food and a crisp delicious pickle is like Christmas in July. Superdawg reminds me of summer and what it's like to be young without a care in the world. The perfect summer night activity is to jump in the car with the windows down and cruise on over to Superdawg. Order some grub and a milk shake from the classic DriveIn. Throttle that food down your throat and bask in the glory if only for a moment of what it's like to eat like a kid.

"YOU DON'T NEED TO GET TWO CREPES! As long as you know that, this is a 5 star experience.  The waitress told my friend and me that the crepes were made smaller to encourage mixing flavors, and I heard her tell a few other tables the same, but seriously- these crepes are equally filling as before but maybe they've been folded smaller. All I know is, they fill me up hard core, and when presented with two, they are too delicious not to consume entirely.  I had the Marrekech? which had olive tampanade, cream cheese, mint, and a ton of deliciousness inside. I genuinely don't like olives but the blend was so perfect with everything else inside I wouldn't recommend eliminating it for other olive nay-sayers. Trust the combo! I also had the Salim? which was just honey walnuts and pineapple. Holy mother. The pineapple was so fresh! In December! How is that possible?

We have been here many times. Not as pricey as some other fondue places. The atmosphere is very romantic and making your food is a lot of fun.

"Was very lucky to be invited to Revolution's soft opening!! The interior looks great! Warm and welcoming with a touch of modern melding well with the traditional. Re-use of beer barrels is creative and cool in the decorating. I tried many things on the menu and they were all great. Without exception. So I'm impressed. The deconstructed beef stew is super-delish, the brick oven pizzas were authentic and tasty, the mussels with mint were to die-for, and the fish and chips were very solid, although the side of slaw with honey and jalepeno stole the show on that dish. And, oh yeah! the beer. Okay, so I'm a girl and found the piney Iron Fist Ale to be a bit too much, but the Eugene Porter, the Cross of Gold and the Workingman's Ale were all really tasty. Rumors have it that carbonation has been a bit vexing due to the equipement automation, so I think they are running the machines more manually now and are working toward perfection. An overall very enjoyable experience with excellent food and drink and great service.Long live the Revolution!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Its just ok. If I were out shopping and wanted a small bite and wine I'd pop in. I will not go out of my way to eat here again. It was perhaps the worst martini I've ever had. I know this place is a wine bar but c'mon! We weren't asked gin or vodka or what kind.  Yes the salted beets are yummy. That was the star. The cheese is good but no fruit! The fried deviled egg is better on paper. We had some cheese rice balls that were good too. Then some potato fish spread that needed S&P or something. It was boring. The staff was just ok. It did get crowded and there were some really rude people there. I'm sure it affected my experience. However there was either the owner or the manager that came to both tables next to us.

"Four and a half stars is spot on. Okay. Yes. the commute is a b*tch and a half... but it's worth it. One might argue that there isn't much you can do with a hot dog to make it ""great,"" and one might be right. You can grill it or you can boil it, and when all is said and done, there just isn't as much room for culinary creativity as say, a rack of lamb. Like the Shake Shack phenomenon in Manhattan, you go to Hot Dougs for the experience. Part of that experience, to the dismay of some who just want to fill their bellies with meat and relish, involves waiting in line. You have to go to Hot Dougs with an open mind (and an empty stomach). I won't deny it, the hot dogs themselves are delicious, as tasty and satisfying as any hot dog I've ever had, but a they are still just wieners on buns, good for 3, maybe 4 bites. The wait in line with other tourists and eager first-timers, the descriptions on the wall menus, and the excitement of finally seeing Doug's smiling face waiting for you at the counter, are what make this a great place to check out at least once. We showed up at 930am (the place opens at 1030) on a sunny, chilly, Saturday morning to find a dozen people already patiently standing outside. By 1030, when the doors opened, the line went back about three blocks. Compared to Shake Shack this is not a long line, but the difference is Doug himself takes your order, and also some spends some time chatting with each customer (and posing for pictures in our case), so the line doesn't move nearly as fast. No problem, you can take this time to read the descriptions of the various hot dogs for sale, as well as a menu of Daily Specials. I went with the Kiera Knightley and the standard hot dog, grilled and boiled, respectively. My girlfriend opted for the standard hot dog, with everything, and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli (I still have no idea what Aioli is), Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. We also got orders of the Duck Fat Fries (which tasted exactly like regular fries). My standard hot dog was very good, well cooked, juicy, and pretty filling. I don't really know how else to describe a hot dog... the Kiera Knightley had a spicy tinge to it, but nothing mouth numbing (I guess she isn't as hot as she used to be). If I'm ever here again I'll try the extra hot ""Selma Hayek"" (too bad they don't offer the Penelope Cruz... cuz DAAAMN). I had a bite of the Foie Gras, which was delicious, but I estimate that one bite was worth roughly $3, which could've gotten me another Kiera/Selma. The staff here is very friendly, and they make sure you don't grab tables until you've gotten your food. The space isn't huge, but you don't feel cramped either, even with a few dozen customers inside and a hundred more out the door.  I'd return here again if I am in Chicago, but only if I have nothing else on my schedule. If you are just craving a Chicago style hot dog, then Portillo's in the city is a much quicker bet. One last bit of advice--find someone to drive you, or call a cab for pick-up 15 to 20 minutes in advance. We ended up walking 20 blocks to the subway stop to get back to downtown, since the area is entire devoid of taxis.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So...My fiance wanted to take me out for desert. Although I'm a native of Chicago, I've never been to this place. He figured the ambiance would be fabulous and have an overall inviting atmosphere. SIKE! Let me tell you the story...We walked in and was quickly seated. The waitress came over and asked had we been there before, and if not would we like her to give a description of the meals etc. My fiance says sure.. So as she begins to tell us what they had to offer, he realized that we wanted to stick with what we originally went there for. He says I think we'll just go with the flaming chocolate fondue. Waitress says, Yes, I figured you all would say that. Eyebrows raised but I said nothing. Then we ordered drinks that we had to remind the waitress to get 10 mins. later. The couple sitting next to us commenced leaving and the waiter took all of the items on that table and placed them on ours, although we were still there EATING! Ugh the nerve. Then another group came in to eat and the waiter walking pass and tried not to bump into them and in doing so his butt swiped our table on the same side as our food! We then began to call making reservations for another place, (Devon Seafood) and asked for the check. She took sooo long to bring it, I had to get up and go looking for her.I will never go there or recommend this place to my friends unless they are of the European descent. When I told a coworker, who was European, he was not surprised and said that's just the type of establishment they are and the area you're in and apologized for what took place. All in all, as an African American person, if you want to be spoken to in a rude manner, ignored and generally disrespected, please go to this establishment!!

"This place came highly recommended but with a warning that the wait times could be long. This was true on both ends. With a group of 7, we knew it'd be a while wait on a Saturday night with the line curling outside the door. Having not made reservations anywhere, we figured that we may as well just stick it out, especially once they offered that we could sip beer or wine as we waited. The food was well worth the wait. We got the chips and guac and I think I can say that it was the best, most flavorful guacamole I have ever had. And it wasn't even close. The tortas were amazing. Packed with flavor and so satisfying. It was a ton of food and I couldn't finish. We topped it off with the churros and chocolate shot. The food was just fantastic.

I have tried the thin crust and don't think it's anything super special, but I am willing to endure a 45 minute train ride + 15-20 minute walk completely out of my way for this deep dish and I think that says a lot. On the odd occasion when I do drive, parking can be a hassle. But it's worth it for this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I think this place is hit or miss. I've gotten food here twice. I went once with the father-in-law and we got the Hot Pot. It was delicious. We got half and half on broth. I wish we would have gotten the regular. The spicy was extra spicy. I like spicy and I ate it, but I think I will take it easy the next time. The last time I got food from here it just ok. I got take out. I think it helps to eat it there. I'll probably return, at least give it anther shot.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"in a neighborhood filled with good food options, this humble cafe on the corner often gets overlooked. personally, it took me a few years of living in the hood to finally try this place out. boy, was i missing out on something!my boyfriend and i went on a sunday morning, and there was no wait - perfect. we had the amazing turkish coffee and then split a bowl of seasonal fruit, complete with sliced almonds and mango chutney. now, as someone who eats fruit on a daily basis, it takes a lot to make fruit stand out, but this was the best fruit bowl i have ever tasted - literally!! i've been thinking about it ever since....for our meal, we each turned one of their crepes into an omelette and we were both delighted by the yumminess. the ratio of ingredients to egg was superb, which is not always the case at other restaurants. no full bites of only egg here - all bites contained goodies!all in all, this is a great place to have breakfast, and i can't wait to go back a try a dessert crepe (and get another bowl of fruit!!) also of note, the service was quick and pleasant, which is always a plus. way to go icosium!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I can't believe after years of driving past this place, I finally got to check it our after my cousin from out of town invited me to meet them. The place is pretty cool....they have their own beers which I usually question all the time, but the first one I tried was very light looking but heavy...I tried a darker beer and it was lighter with more hops. The Pizza was yummy....spinach and goat cheese was the bomb. the sausage pepperoni was a lil salty but fresh. I definitely would like to go back again and try more of the pizzas out and try more of the micro beers also. The guy singing karaoke wasn't bad either. Lots of girls for a Thursday nite.

"We stopped in at about 2 pm on a Saturday, and the comfortable but somewhat cozy dining area was pretty full. This was my 2nd visit, so I had a bit of an idea of what to expect. I would give the food 3 1/2 stars, but a few other aspects of our visit bring down my rating. The oatmeal-banana shake I had was outstanding. My fiancee had the mango-banana which was tasty, but the texture was a bit grainy. Hers was soy-based, which I noticed cost more. When we ordered it, we were informed that the soy shake was also smaller. Wouldn't you think that the price increase would compensate enough? Pick one or the other, but don't charge me more AND reduce the size. I had the Arroz con Huevos, a mix of rice and scrambled eggs, served with avocado and plaintains. Excellent dish. She had the potato stuffed tacos, which came out much more similar to chimichangas. They were good but not great. In the middle of our meal, it also got very drafty in there. Seems like there might be ventilation issues or something, perhaps someone was opening a door to let fresh air in. Overall, it was a good experience, and the staff were nice enough, but it turned out to be a little pricey for everything we got, imo. I'll go back, and would recommend it for the oatmeal shake, plantains and Arroz con Huevos.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My first Cuban experience and it was a good one. Went to a birthday party with a party of 18 and 90 Miles delivered. There was a slight wait for our table and we waited in a large waiting area with tables and chairs and started enjoy our BYOB selections. Once we were seated Buck was huge help and kept the empanadas and amazing food coming. I rocked the Churrasco which was amazing and not a single one of the 18 of us had a bad meal.  The place was packed and they have I love Lucy reruns playing constantly. Took me a second to figure out the Ricky Ricardo connection! First and definitely not last trip to 90 Miles.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Rumor has it that Pequod himself/herself/itself placed a large deep dish with pepperonis in front of a pre-hibernation Grizzly. The Grizzly ate three slices, stared at the rest for 10 minutes, then slunk away in shame and died of carbohydrate poisoning. The rumor is true, for what Pequod's offers is an unparalleled deep dish gut bomb of death experience. The motto here: One slice is a meal, two a mistake, three a nightmare. And while the pizza is good enough to rocket Pequod himself/herself/itself to Chicago pizza infamy, the restaurant has chosen to forgo commercialized tackiness in favor of the modest and timeless feel of a 1980s family restaurant. The kind of place where you'd eat a nice pie before losing your virginity in high school or watching Ronald Reagan get shot or whatever they did.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We started with an appetizer special of potatoes/pepper, and although it tasted fresh it was underseasoned and uninteresting. We didn't even finish it. Ordered three pizzas, margherita, a daily special (rapini, sausage), and another special (pecorino, proscuitto). What surprised me was how soggy the crust was. The edge was crispy upon arrival but it progressively got soggier minute by minute. All were tasty but not notable. The best was the margherita because of the very tasty tomato sauce. VERY little basil though, disappointing. Bill was $100 for three ind pizzas, one app, one beer, two glasses of wine. Way overpriced, especially when they're dealing with such a volume of people.

"Only 5 star Chicago, but I have a few coming up, just haven't visited them yet, Five Stars For Sure, Innovated creative and one experience that you will be grateful to be a part of our restaurant progression towards excellence.  There is nothing that is holding this restaurant from being over the top. If you and friends are so lucky to sit at one of the few tables you know your in for a real experience. I had the pleasure to work for Michael when he was a chef at Trio, he stays calm in stressful environments and always has his humor.  I told him on the way out ""I knew that this was going to be a no BS restaurant. No employees are standing around and no over pretentious waiter can be found here. This type of service creates a personal relationship with Michael his staff and the food as you take a journey through an amazing multi course meal that will leave you savoring and talking about what just happened.  I also would like to add that Michael constructed a one of a kind style and progression towards an amazing restaurant that earns its five stars over and over again from top chefs to simple yelp reviewers.

"Three and a half. Good: The chips. The sweet plantains--and I don't even like plantains. The yellow rice--and the potatoes in the yellow rice. The guacamole--it wasn't necessarily the best in the world, but it had great flavor. The beans--refried? I don't know, but they were goooood. The shake--my boyfriend had a strawberry-banana shake, and I don't like banana and I thought this was good. The bad: The salsas are really, really spicy. I mean, on-fire spicy. The empanada--it was okay. Just not great. Sam's tacos--very, very chunky chicken. Not to his liking. Cash only--sucks. My potato tacos--they just didn't have quite enough flavor. The cabbage salad--this could have been so good had it not been so heavily cilantro'd. We will probably go back every once in a while, and esp. if we're near, because it's very different from what you're normally eating.

"Today I came in and met Doug, who I presume to be an owner or at least a half-owner. I start my review by saying this because I think it's significant; your first impression of Crisp will be that it's a trendy type of place but is run by a very down-to-earth owner. He will ask you for your name and then for your order.I came in for the chicken wings, which were delicious. They're fried and covered in several sauces. Out of the sauces I had, the Seoul Sassy was tasty and on the milder side, while the Crisp BBQ was a lot spicier and bolder. The latter had much of the same spicy flavor you would find in kimchi (without the fermented taste, of course), but also had a sweet component like a BBQ sauce. I may have liked them a bit spicier, even, to balance out the sweet, but I think fans of BBQ wings will like these a lot. My fries were a little soggy by the time they got to my place, but that's just what happens to fried foods in transit. All in all, really great wings with inventive sauces. You can have a half or whole chicken done this way too.I think what Crisp has done well is pander to the crowd without losing its roots. The food is definitely Am-Asian, but the flavors which are put into their burritos and wings are those which are very reminiscnet of a typical Korean meal (at least from what I've had of that cuisine.) You can even get a bibimbap bowl (there called a 'buddha bowl') with their own twist.The combo of trendy modern with down-to-earth people and of traditional Korean flavors with familiar American cuisine is why this restaurant is such a success. The food is unique and different, yet still comforting. If you're in the area, this is a place to check out, especially if you're tired of eating pre-frozen wings in soul-less sports bars.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"this business has declined in customer service!! i have been a faithful customer to this restaurant for many years even before they had remolded it. i went to garcias with my family and as soon as we arrived the waitress saw us and didn't acknowledge us! a waiter who was taking a order from another table saw us and apologized on her behalf, he said she had just finished arguing with another coworker. how unprofessional was that!, i was still listening to them argue in spanish, and to make matters worse she ended up being our waitress. she had such a horrible attitude, and got our orders mixed up. the worst part is i went to talk to the manager about the experience and it was this young guy which i don't think he was the manager, and he said was ""i'll talk to her"". so unprofessional, the food really isn't worth the horrible customer service. i have visited a restaurant called quinta de los reyes located in ber wyn il after this experience, and wow!! , what a difference authentic food and the best part is fresh guacamole and salsa prepared at your table!!, and not to mention amazing customer service!","[1.0, 0.0]"

After a great meal, we were presented with the check which was off by $5......I ordered the Surf and Turf.....3 small shrimp and a skirt steak which is offered in the menu at $24.95. The bill came and the meal was priced at $29.95. We asked our waitress about the mistake and we were informed that $24.95 is the lowest that the meal ""could cost"" but that due to ""market conditions"", mine was priced higher. I reviewed the menu from front to back and there is absolutely no mention of ""market pricing or that the bill would be subject to inaccuracies and fluctuations at the management's discretion.

"I am sad to say that we have left Chicago for Atlanta and that Glenn's Diner will be my most missed restaurant in Chicago. My wife and I visited it twice, both times leaving extremely full and pleasantly happy.  Our first visit was for lunch. I ordered the Catfish Poboy. Great bread, perfect amount of batter and the fish was fresh. My wife ordered the Reuben sandwich and said it was very good. We met the owner and the waiting staff was extremely attentive. Our second and last visit was for dinner and it was, in my opinion, the best seafood that we had in Chicago. I had the Crustacean Pot Pie. It was a pot pie with lumps of Blue Crab, shrimp, scallops and veggies. Trust me when I say, these were huge lumps of everything. You could differentiate between each seafood in the pot pit. I topped the pot pie off with a Dog Fish Head beer. My wife had the scallop dish. There were 12 scallops on her plate. Perfectly pan seared, with carmelization on the outside but could cut through it with a plastic spoon.  Almost forgot, I ordered their clam chowder for an appetizer. I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a little pricey but what do you expect? The food portions were huge, fresh and perfectly cooked. When I visit Chicago, it will be at the top of my list of restaurants to go back to.  Make reservations if going for dinner.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There is a reason that this place has won the James Beard Foundation Award. The food and service is superb. We ate outdoors on a beautiful June day and found it much to our liking.

"We celebrated our wedding anniversary with dinner at Sunda and had a wonderful experience. The service and food were exceptional. Sunda has a lot of energy, which only served to heighten our positive experience. Our server was talented in his service, and engaging on a personal level--he made our evening special. We were encouraged by our server to try some items on the menu that were unfamiliar to us, based on his personal experience and recommendation, and we we enjoyed each new item. The server took the time to ask/get to know our preferences, and made recommendations based on our preferences, together with his personal experience. In looking around the restaurant, it was clear to us that the customers were all enjoying themselves and also that Sunda had made sure that they hired the best and brightest for their team. We enjoyed every moment of our evening and can hardly wait to return. It was a wonderful anniversary dinner!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was expecting more. That's basically my summed-up experience. One thing I will say, is that half the fun is the surprise element of the food, so reading all the reviews is not the best idea. I did it- because I wanted to know what that price tag was going towards- but it definitely took away from the experience and if there's one thing I'd recommend is STOP READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD. and STOP LOOKING AT THE PICTURES! STOP! RIGHT NOW!! For that much money, I expect the things I eat to be REALLY DELICIOUS. Not just ""good, and cool presentation!"" but REALLY DELICIOUS. Overall I would say maybe 3 courses I would say that, the rest were... pretty good. Like I said, I expected more. Also, I made the reservation for a special occasion (first wedding anniversary) but nobody asked me if there was an occasion when I made the reservation. Most nice places do- even a Morton's will ask you, and then print ""happy anniversary!"" on your menu. Nothing here. Like I said, I expected more. GT Fish and Oyster wished my husband a happy birthday when we arrived, and when we were seated, and then gave him a birthday gift before we left. THAT is service. Alinea could learn a thing or two. However as far as service goes, I was pretty pleased. I didn't have any of the issues I saw other people comment on. My husband and I don't drink, and nobody pressured us to order something we didn't want. We did several of the house sodas which were tasty. The bottom line is that it really is an event to dine here- my husband liked it way more than I did- partly, I think, because he hadn't read all the info on the courses and was genuinely impressed by what came out. I thought it was all pretty good. A couple of courses (everyone mentions the same ones, for good reason) were amazing, and the rest- pretty good. I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad we tried it once. **Side note: funniest part of the night was when one of our courses that comes... well, sort of balanced on other stuff, slipped off onto the table. The servers all froze, and I swear, the guy who dropped the stuff looked like he was going to go do hara kiri in the kitchen in the back. I think I laughed and said something like ""man overboard!"" because I was trying to ease the tension but I don't think it worked. Poor guy.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I finally made my way to Frontera Grill one Friday afternoon with two California guests. Since this place doesn't take reservations, I knew it would be key to visit the restaurant on a weekday right when they open. We got there about 11:45 and were able to find seats in the bar. Seating setup is unfriendly for odd-numbered groups (seats were in twos and fours), but the staff let us push two tables together - saving the three of us from huddling around a table meant for two. What dismayed us was the LONG wait we had to endure for our food! I think they were understaffed, because the lunch crowd seemed manageable, yet we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got our appetizers. I split the Entrems Surtido appetizer platter and pork tacos with my friend. I HIGHLY recommend the appetizer platter. It lets you try mini portions of their quesadillas, chicken taquitos, ceviche tostadas and jcama salad. Because I was thinking of ordering each of these items for my entree, the appetizer platter let me try all the dishes and still try something else! My favorite was the jicama salad - it had mangoes and the tangy dressing provided a nice complement to the sweet mangoes and crunchy jicama. Even though we had to wait again for our entrees, it was definitely worth it! The pork was marinated to perfection. Featuring notes of red chile, pineapple, bacon and onion, it was a fiesta in my mouth. Each ingredient balanced the others. Seriously, it was friggin' awesome. I'm not a big meat eater, but I will gladly eat a whole bowl of this stuff everyday if I could. We were also served six tortillas so it's perfect to split. I will be back to Frontera Grill. I have to dock one star for the slow service, but seriously - five star food. Give me pork!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

She asked some questions about our likes and dislikes and did her thing. It was such a fun and interesting experience to have someone do this for us. She hit the nail on the head. She made us feel comfortable and taken care of. I highly recommend giving this place a try.

"Went here for the first time w/ a group for brunch yesterday, it was my first time dining at mercat but it was a pretty enjoyable experience. The ambience of the restaurant is very cute & mod... the food & decor are both very colorful. We had the brunch special where u choose 4 tapas plus one botomless specialty cocktail (bloody mary, mimosas, red/white sangria) for $25. There was a wide variety of choices for the tapas, however the menu was a bit confusing at first because it says ""choose 5 tapas & a signature cocktail, however if you order a cocktail w/ the special then you only get to choose 4 tapas. For the bloody mary they had a bar where u can mix in all the ingredients...the ""yellow gazpacho"" was very tasty. We also ordered the paella negra which was large enough to serve our group of 6. It had lobster, octopus, calamari & shrimp..it was very flavorful and if you've never had paella don't let the black squid ink scare you away because you won't want to miss out on this dish! Also the manchego bacon biscuits are really good too. For the tapas I recommend: the gambas (garlic shrimp), the crab omelette, skirt steak sandwich, shrimp & grits..there's plenty of choices to satisfy your tastebuds.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been by Spacca Napoli several times when the patio and dining room has been packed. I was able to go with a friend yesterday before the dinner rush. It was raining out, so the patio wasn't open. We were seated right in the window. I will say that our server, I can't remember her name was void of personality. Never a smile, just flat affect the whole time. However, the food outweighed all of that. We shared a bottle of wine that was spicy and dry and wonderful. We chose the fried zucchini appetizer that was marinated in white balsamic with mint and basil. It was not the fried zucchini that I was expecting. It was served cold along side fresh french bread drizzled in olive oil. Despite being not at all what I expected, it was a beautiful appetizer. The balsamic wasn't overpowering and you got a mouthful of basil flavor followed by fresh mint. It was fantastic. For our dinner, we shared the Diavola. It was with a red sauce, fresh mozzarella, red pepper flakes and spicy salami. The flavors were amazing. The sauce was slightly chunky, which is my favorite. And the crust was chewy and perfect. I wish the crust had been a bit crispy, but it was still soooooooo good! The prices are affordable here. The ambiance is comforting and welcoming. I plan on coming back. I love a local little pizza joint like this.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am going to start off by saying I lived in England for a year. Once you have had enough greasy bland and disgusting British food, Indian cuisine becomes a hard and fast staple in your diet. England has great Indian food and a great selection of restaurants and India House can hold its ground with those. This place is better than Devon Avenue . I have been here countless times for the lunch buffet. In general I am not a buffet fan but this one is really good. My only complaint is they don't have a curry dish, but I will let that slide. There are a few real stars on the buffet that deserve real attention. The Chicken Tiki Masala is great. So good that we joke that their is crack in it, because we can never get enough.  Then the other real star is the mango ice cream.. I cannot say enough about how tasty that is. The dinner is about just as good as their lunch buffet, but costs three times as much. Also, veteran tip, get here at 1100-1130am, this way it is not that crowded and the food on the buffet is extremely fresh.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went to XOCO yesterday and was seriously underwhelmed. We waited in line for about 30 minutes having arrived at about 7pm or so. They will not take your order until there is a table available for you, fair enough. We had chips and salsa, the milanesa, cubana, a lemonade and a bohemia beer, and a few churros, total came to $40. A little steep for a Corner Bakery type experience. We got seats at a little bar on high chairs and tucked into the chips and salsa. Ok, nothing special, can get the same at Jewel. The sandwiches were tasty, but not special, about the level of a Corner Bakery club panini :) The churros were super gross, greasy and hard, I totally have no clue why people are raving. It looks like they were under the heat lamp for a long time because the minute they were pulled out from under it and put on a plate in front of me they hardened right up and could have chipped a tooth.

I had one of the specials I had read about on Yelp with asparagus and prosciutto, as well as asparagus and cheese stuffed into the crust. It came out fast, hot, had the perfect amount of crispness to the thin crust, and was quite tasty. My friend ordered another special with truffles and fried egg on top. I was disappointed with this one, the truffles were pretty sparse and the egg was under-fried (the whites were very runny). For dessert I had a delicious (and big!) serving of tartufo.  The space is tiny, so be prepared for a lot of neighbor/waiter contact. While it took a while to get our waiter's attention, once he came over he was very helpful explaining ingredients and flavors, and the food came out lightning fast.  I really enjoyed that I received 30% off my bill thanks to booking with Savored http://svrd.co/pHAC19. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood, and I'm sure I'll come back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Great place. Really good food. Friendly and generally competent waitstaff.  Unlike SOME Yelp reviewers who have been to this location a few times and dis it for being family friendly -- I don't mind that one bit. They give kids crayons and something to keep them distracted and quiet until their food arrives, and they have an extensive kids' menu. This is to the advantage of everyone in the place, with the possible exception of people who don't like kids.  So if you don't care for the family-friendly atmosphere, don't like kids and continue to go to this Wishbone location, leave it to a dummy to get on the roller coaster knowing it'll make them throw up and all the while expecting a good time.  Wishbone likes families. You want to be undistirbed on a date, go to a singles bar. Hold your business meetings where they should be held -- at your office. Wishbone's not the place for that. Keep up he awesome job, Wishbone!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I dined at RJ Grunts after the Zoo Lights and it was great! We had a party of 11, which is really big for such a small restaurant, so we put our name in and then wandered through the lights. About an hour later they were able to fit us at two separate tables, which was fine since we had an adult table and kids table. Everyone loved their food and the portions are HUGE so come hungry! They also have a fantastic salad bar, I am not usually one for ordering salads at restaurants, but it looked too good to resist! Service was great, food was great, and atmosphere is fun for the family!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yay! Even though it took me 8 years to make it to this place, I""m so glad that I finally did. I came here with a large group and they were so accomodating. They were about 30 minutes late seating us which wasn't a problem since a few of our party were about 30 minutes late. They ushered back through the restaurant through the courtyard and into a small backroom that only had one unsuspecting couple finishing up their meal. Lucky for them they were leaving soon as we were quite the boisterous crowd.  To make up for seating us late, they sent out some comped appetizers that were delicious. My friend and I split the pasta with mussels and the mushroom and cheese stuffed pasta with mushroom sauce. I think we agreed that the sauce on the mushroom dish was amazing but the pasta itself wasn't. Not that it was bad but it was just eh. However, the mussels and the spicy marinara sauce was so good. I ended up taking home the leftovers of both along with my friend's dish and ate for a few more days. The only thing that concerned me was the oil that set up in my leftovers that you know is there but you don't want to see. Then you have the dilemna of whether you should pour it out or mix it back in when you reheat it.  The service was fantastic throughout the entire meal. All in all, it was a great experience and I will definitely be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Relish it here along with a million little plates of unknown condiments and sides. Also helps to love kim chee.

"wow, what a dinner, so many delicious items. The lobster mac and cheese was incredible as was the truffle gnocchi. The bone-in steaks which are their signature was also extremely well done. The chocolate sin cake was also one of the best desserts I have had in a while. This combined with a very strong wine selection makes for a very very nice dinner out. Only downside that I could really mention was that the piano singer from the bar area could be heard throughout the main dining room and he really should not have been singing at all. A great dining experience and although a little pricey, the quality of everything makes it extremely worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm not a vegetarian, but I used to be, so when my vegetarian sister suggested we hit up The Chicago Diner for brunch yesterday I was a bit excited since she'd been telling me nothing but good things about the place since she moved downtown.We arrived as they opened and we were the only ones there.That being said I was a little disappointed in the service, they were prompt with the food, however 5 or 6 people, all employees, were lounging at the counter as we ate talking and joking (some of it rather crude, which is unprofessional to me but maybe I'm making too much out of it). That being said, the food was spectacular. We split the BBQ Wings which were out of this world. I never would have thought that meatless BBQ Wings would taste better than the real thing. I had the Biscuits and Gravy, and while the biscuits were a little tough it was still delicious and I ate every last bite.I also stole a sip of my sister's pumpkin chocolate milkshake and it was to die for, tasted just like pumpkin pie, but better.The food at The Chicago Diner makes me want to give up meat again, if I could eat there everyday something tells me it wouldn't be so difficult.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Finally, FINALLY, I was able to try this amazing place. First of let me tell you that I've gone 2 days in a row. Yup, you read right, 2 days in a row....less than 24 hours even. I had a late dinner with my friend there last night and felt the need to return for lunch because I didn't get to try the amazing tortas. And let me tell you I'm SO glad I did. When my friend and I went for dinner I had the hardest time making a decision of what to order. The tortas looked amazing, but the soups smelled delicious. It was about a 45 minute wait so I had time to decide, but I could have eaten everything on the menu and by the time we got up to the counter it was a game time decision. I ended up ordering the Carnitas soup, which was just incredible! Chunks of avocado, chiyote, corn/potato dumplings, and shredded carnitas topped with arugala....what's not to love??? The serving size was just right and trust me there's was nothing left to eat from that bowl once I was through with it. My friend and I also shared a basket of chips and guacamole which was great...but my only complaint is I wish the guac portion was a little bit bigger. The chip to guac ratio was like 10:1. It was actually smart for me to order the soup for dinner because they're not available until after 3pm, so after I had been bragging about this soup to my husband, we decided to go there for lunch today. Since we were early it was only a 10 minute wait, but because it was before noon, soup was not ready. Luckily XOCO's menu is set to please everyone. I ended up finally trying a grilled Milanese torta which was breaded crispy chicken, pickled jalepeno, black beans and cheese on bread served with a tomatillo salsa. The portion was HUGE, but honestly it was too good to stop eating. My stomach was saying no, but my mind kept saying hell yes. My husband ended up ordering the Carnitas wood fire torta which not only was delicious, but the presentation was gorgeous. Served on a baguette, there were chunks of shredded carnitas, pickled onions and a chile sauce, served dipped into a bowl of salsa. Much like you dunk grilled cheese into a bowl of tomato soup, the sandwich was crispy, but had absorbed the wonderful sauce. It was a mouth full of heaven. We topped off this last visit with one of the many hot chocolate options and let me tell you....this alone could be the reason why I give this place 5 stars. I have grown up with spanish and mexican hot chocolate, but have found it hard to find in places unless I have it shipped. Rick Bayless, culinary god, serves a long list of different hot chocolate options from the Authentic which is ground chocolate and water to the Barcelona which is pure, thick and rich chocolate. My husband ordered the Barcelona and I had the Ultra which is a shot of hot chocolate with almond milk...and both were AMAZING. Honestly, I know that I went 2 days in a row, but if XOCO was open on a Sunday I would round it out by trying breakfast there tomorrow, but unfortunately I'll have to wait until Tuesday. Don't miss out, this place is truly one of the best in town!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This pizza is delicious! You can order mashed potatoes on a pizza, it sounds weird, but is totally awesome. I love that you can make your own pizza with different crusts/sauces/toppings, etc. They have fun events sometimes too, like live band karaoke. Great beer selection also!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So, I gave it a couple more tries just to see if maybe our chef was having a bad day, but the carne asada is always burnt, chorizo always much saltier than it should be. I actually took my sister here because I wanted to know if I was just being biased based on my first couple bad experiences, but... She actually got sick off her food. She prefers her tacos with just onions and cilantro, and lime... Which she had to ask multiple times for. It's hard to mess that up. so confirmed, they're NOT the best tacos in the city. I did order breakfast once, and the huevos divorciados was actually ok. But I wish I knew it was that large because i wasn't in the mood for such a large breakfast. Still super loud, service is slower each time we come back. Did they memorize my face from my yelp reviews!?!? Jk. My friends can go for their ""awesome tacos"" without me. Pass.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My wife and I went for the first time just a few days ago. Of all the Thai places in Lincoln Square I would have to rate this as the best. The food was very good and the cost was very reasonable. We had the Tiger Cry beef and Steamed Dumplings for starters. Both dishes were fresh and the Crying Tiger had an excellent sauce.  For the main course I had the Peanut Sauce Lover dish with chicken and my wife had the Lard Nar Talay. The Peanut Sauce dish was quite good, I asked for spicy and it was spicy without being overbearing. My wife thought the Lard Nar was okay. It is BYOB so we brought a bottle of white wine. Total cost including tip (and bottle of wine) was $45.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"By far my favorite restaurant in Greektown, Artopolis makes the best soup I've ever tasted. Notice I didn't say soups - only order the good soup, lemon chicken - if you refer to the lemon chicken soup simply as the good soup they will know what you mean. The alternative is usually dreadful. If you find yourself trying to decide between the Artopita or pizza, always go Artopita.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A friend recommended Sunda to my girlfriend and me a few weeks ago, and, given that we hadn't had a fancy dinner in a while, we decided to go.My first impression of the place was that both the dining room and bar were very well done. It is certainly a modern, stylish place, but not to the extent that it feels cold or unromantic at all. Additionally, the service staff at the front of the restaurant was incredibly welcoming.Unable to pick just a few items from the menu, we wound up getting cocktails, three appetizers, two main courses, and a dessert between the two of us. The cocktails were solid, but the food was delicious. In particular, the duck/daikon/egg salad appetizer was incredible. It had very strong Asian flavors, but it was not overdone at all. The duck (and there was an incredible amount of it for the price) was ridiculously soft, and the daikon was prepared to perfection. The chef's signature sushi (I forget what exactly he calls it) was the perfect mixture of textures and temperatures. The only small dish I would not wholeheartedly recommend were the oxtail pot stickers, which seemed slightly underflavored. Perhaps if I hadn't had the incredibly rich duck first, however, this wouldn't have been an issue.Among the main courses, the sea bass was truly sublime. My West Coast friends always complain that it's hard to get good fish in Chicago, but Sunda has certainly proven them wrong. The beef ribs were good too, though, for the price, not exactly anything to write home about. For dessert, we got the ""Ridiculous,"" which is essentially tempura-ed ice cream. It was definitely tasty, though perhaps more of a novelty than anything else.All in all, it was a great experience. In addition to the great atmosphere and food, we had an incredibly helpful waitress who put up with our flip flopping ordering tendencies way more than she should have had to. I would definitely recommend Sunda for a date or for a classy night out with a group of friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Just had a great 'first time' at Sapori. The restaurant was really nice and really crowded. The four of us got there about 30 minutes prior to our reservation but the host Recardo was able to find us a table right away. We started with the Cozze Scoppiate in the red sauce, it was very good, even my wife who doesn't eat mussels loved it. The sauce was perfect for dunking bread. Then we split a couple salads, the Insalata Stella and the Cesare. My mom kept commenting on how fresh all the ingredients were in the Stella and the Caesar was one of the best I've had. The dressing was nice and light, not heavy like some Caesars, the parmesan had a great flavor too. My dad and I both had the Zuppa di Pesce. It was huge, and had a ton of fish. The homemade linguini was excellent. Well worth the very modest $30, we've paid a lot more for a lot less at other restaurants. The girls split the Vitello Paesana and left nothing on the plate. The Executive Chef Anthony came out and introduced himself and we talked for a bit. He was very nice and shared a few stories with us. We then ordered a couple desserts, Tiramisu and Bread Pudding. We were so full by that time that we could barely eat anymore but we got about half of it down. Also, very good. We'll definitely be back there.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I would have to agree with another reviewer, that it is odd to encourage customers to go home.

"Piece is my boyfriend's FAVORITE, and definitely his go-to pizza. Thanks to him, I've experienced it in many forms - his leftovers, takeout, and dine in. The leftovers were of the cheese-less kind, which I thought was gross. I'm sorry, I just love cheese too much. Pizza without cheese is just soggy bread with random crap on it that falls off when you pick it up. Then we had their standard pizza (sauce, toppings, cheese) for takeout. Once again, I was somewhat unimpressed, when comparing it with the multitude of standard pizza's I've consumed. BUT THEN, we dined in. The wait was forever long, but worth it. We had the white pizza. Not gross white pizza with alfredo sauce or ranch or something, but just the most garlicky, cheesy masterpiece, made with olive oil in place of sauce. Now, I should mention I was a bit tipsy from the 9% alcohol beer I had while waiting for my table, but I'm pretty certain that pizza was a slice of heaven. That white pizza will keep me coming back over and over again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The burgers here give Kuma's a serious run for their money. I came here, was seated right away, and the next thing I know there was a delicious juicy burger I had just ordered in front of me. I ordered the Lockdown Warden, a certified Angus beef patty infused with bacon, leeks, garlic, shallots, stuffed with Merkt's Cheddar, then topped with fried leeks & shallots tossed in TRUFFLE OIL. Any burger with Merkt's Cheddar is a winner in my book. Pretzel rolls come standard. I substituted the fries for a side of mac'n cheese. I told the waitress I wanted bacon and green onions on my m&c....she told me that was standard unless otherwise ordered. I was even provided with Sriracha to drizzle on my m&c. Goddamn it was good....all of it....every morsel. You can customize your m&c order with tons of options to choose from...I even saw foie gras on the menu as a topping option. Also worth trying here is the ""Prison Yard""...one pound of mussels braised in coconut curry sauce. It came with some nice garlic bread wedges, which was perfect for dipping in the curry sauce. The curry sauce was delicious. I have returned here for the mussels alone. They had several different craft brews to choose from. Hell yes. On a couple of my visits they had Left Hand Brewing Co's MILK STOUT on tap. Probably one of my favorite stout beers in the history of mankind. The ambiance: Metal. Though I am not a huge metal fan, I have a feeling I will be with the way Lockdown is operating!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Full of flavors, and many of them. I've had vegetarian messob and meat and vegetarian messob on my visits. Every item has an individual flavor. Almost all of them are excellent, and none are bad. I love the soft, sour injeera. A messob for two gives each person a huge portion of food. It's rich and a little oily in a way where you can tell you're getting plenty of calories, but the taste is worth it. What we had last week: doro wot - chicken drumsticks in sauce with crumbly cheese and hardboiled egg: This was one of my favorites. It was tender, with a unique herbal flavor, almost minty. ye-beg alicha - lamb in a mild thick sauce: One of my friend's favorites. I think I would like it but I haven't completely warmed up to the gamey flavor of lamb yet. If you like lamb, you'll like it. michetabish - sauce of cardamom beef: If I'm remembering correctly this was another favorite, with lots of flavor. ye-misir wot - red lentil stew: good, spicy kik alicha - split yellow peas: our least favorite, kind of boring shiro - mixed legumes: good. It's possible I'm confusing the michetabish for this, in which case this was one of my favorites. The messob prices seemed reasonable. However this is the only Ethiopian food I've had; my friend informs me that it's usually very inexpensive for good quality Ethiopian food, and that Demera is too expensive.

I hardly ate my pollo (chicken) because I felt like it was loaded with salt, and our waitress (Christina) never asked us how the food was so I didn't have the opportunity to even think about sending it back. The portion sizes are way too big as well. I hope that somehow this feedback gets to the chef, who needs to make some changes if this restaurant is going to survive.","[1.0, 0.0]"

There is a glass wine room where the host take turns going in there and...twirl around and grab some wine if it's needed. pretty cool if you get someone that does more then somersaults for 20 min. When we got seated it took a bit for our server to come over and greet us and my friend and I were starving so we wanted to get our eating on.... he eventually came over and we ordered a bottle of wine...again took a bit to bring it to us but depending on where it was in the restaurant it's understandable. but we got nice a situated and was happily on our way to enjoying meat heaven. Their cold buffet selection had a wide variety or items and they are pretty fresh. I tend to stop- there once and go straight for the meat so if you're looking to see how the salad bar is...I'm not your girl and neither is the other girl I went with...sorry. The meat on the other hand I am a pro!! =) The cuts are about the same as everywhere else, they were cooked very well and the gauchos knew where to cut depending on your desired temperature, the best part they remember how my friend and I liked our steaks cooked which was pretty amazing considering it was quite busy. As soon as we flipped it to green we were swarming with gauchos offering lamb, chicken, steak...oh my!! we skipped the chicken because let's be honest... chicken is chicken and stayed mostly on the beef, lamb and snuck in some pork. yum yum and YUM!! Our server was attentive after the little hiccup in the beginning he was all over us replacing our plates and making sure we had clean ones, also he made sure we had every cut we wanted and he would ask them to bring our request over. The side dishes were delicious but the cheese bread was a bit denser then others I've had and a bit more saltier but you can't get bread like this anywhere but Brazilian steak houses so still awesome. ended our night...2 hours later with the papaya cream... it's supposed to help with digestion and honestly needed all the help i can get...I mean I was eating almost nonstop for 2 hours...but I was happy. By this time our server and became pretty good friends..we were joking around and he never once gave us the rushing feeling...he just let us enjoy ourselves and out-eat every table in that particular area.. yea us =) Texas was a great brazilian steak house and people would have a great time but dunno with so many other brazilian steakhouses....i dunno if i would go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I had the pleasure of eating here a few months ago when I passed through Chicago. The next time I'm in town I'll be stopping here again. Everything my friends and I tried was seriously tasty but I'd have trouble ordering anything other than the pork belly and cod dish. Scrumptious. The apple cider donuts for desert were as delicious as I expected. The service was excellent. Our waitress was cool and knowledgeable, and especially helpful with the wine pairings. This place had everything I need in a meal, great food, great service and a reasonable price.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great place for a date or with your girlfriends. Apart from the salad bar, they also had hot side options to choose from, like scalloped potatoes and warm pastas. There was also a soup, lobster bisque I think? The place is huge! Two floors, but restroom only upstairs. There's a huge wine selection where a girl gets swung up and down to retrieve bottles, what an fun job. Service was great! Their special house cut of meat (looks like a C) was probably the best cut in the house.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My second visit to Greektown in Chicago. Excellent food. Started off with the melitzanosalata, which was eggplant blended with garlic, olive oil, and other spices. Put it on their house bread, it was excellent. I even had a spoonful or two without the bread. For my dinner, I ordered half Vegetarian Moussaka, and half chicken riganati. The moussaka was an eggplant casserole, with potatoes, bechemel sauce, and also olive oil and other herbs and spices. The eggplant was roasted, and it was AMAZING! It complemented the chicken, which was baked with olive oil and herbs and spices. very succulent chicken! complemented the moussaka very well. One of the best parts actually was the baked vegetables that came with the meal. green beans, zucchini, onion and other veggies were drizzled in a tomato sauce. This was a top tier dining experience as well. everytime my water was not filled to the top, the busboy was there to give me a refill. same with my brothers coffee and my mothers wine and soda. I would recommend this place to anyone! they even have valet parking, so that is another plus. Probably one of the best meals I've had in the past 12 months. OPA!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have to write the review - there seems to be some serious confusion on these reviews about the vegetarian sandwiches. Just because there's no meat on the mushroom sandwich (and soup) doesn't mean it's vegetarian! It's not. The beans at Xoco are cooked in pork. That said, the person at the counter was super accomodating, adding extra avocado instead of the beans for the sandwich. It is simply not possible to get the soup made without the beans. Therefore, the soup is not vegetarian. The sandwich was amazing. Simply wonderful. But I have to take a star off for not having a dedicated vegetarian sandwich, and for misleading all the eaters and reviewers on yelp who are calling the mushroom options at xoco vegetarian.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Mastro's is probably one of the most gluttonous restaurants in Chicago. I can't decide whether their specialty is steak, or whether it's the butter cake. Or both? Jordan D (who unfortunately now lives in DC, maybe a blessing in disguise for my heart and arteries) and I started going here shortly after they opened, and in total, I've probably been here 6-7 times. Off the bat, I was pretty impressed. I actually disagree with anyone who says this place is ""too swanky"" or ""a place to see/be seen."" Mastro's is about the food and service, in my opinion. The steaks are...perfect, in my opinion. I really don't know anything about deciphering between different cuts of beef, or whether the have good wagyu/kobe (often overpriced and I am not sure I'd enjoy it)...I just know that I really enjoyed my petite filet there. It just tasted damned good. My most favorite part meal, though, hands down, was the butter cake. Fucking...just...the definition of gluttony in the best way possible. Sweet and also savoury and almost overwhelming, but not quite. This thing is pure amazing. It's basically sponge cake that has some cream cheese in the batter, and it's been soaked in butter twice throughout the baking. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, and some fruit on the plate too, just to make you feel like you're still being reasonable in some fashion.  Basically, I would go here for coffee and butter cake and drinks afterwords---but that's by no means intended to mitigate the awesomeness of their steak. I also like their ""philosophy on plates"" as I'd call it. The steaks do come out on plates that are 440 degrees, so the steak continues to cook for a minute after they put it in front of you. On the converse, the salads come out on plates that are like 32 degrees. I like that. That's awesome. Steaks should be hot, salads should be cold. That's compartmentalizing and delivering dishes how they are to be delivered if I've ever heard of it. The atmosphere is dark and sexy but not over the top. It's an oasis in the middle of downtown chicago. It's well kept. It's not classy because of artwork or expensive light fixtures or a vintage piano or some celebrity/business figure frequents it...in fact...it has NONE of that. It's classy because it's clean, it's dark, and inside it's rather subdued. The service is just stellar. They explain the menu, they make recommendations, they answer questions, they make you feel acquainted. Never rushed, always willing to chat, they will surely find something in common to chat with you about. If you like the pretzel bread as much as I did, and ask nicely, they might even let you take a half a dozen of them home for no charge... I will say that most people were fairly dressed up the times I've gone here. At the very least, slacks and a shirt for a gentleman, and a dress for a lady. If you want to fit in that is. I still go in jeans and a button up shirt with rolled up sleeves. At the end of the day, Mastro's is probably the best candidate if you have a meat craving and you want to go to a steakhouse in the traditional sense of the word. That is what this place is good for. I feel like the gentleman with the cocktail that is part of their....logo?...accurately represents this place, too. Hard to beat, easy to enjoy, and subdued classiness with obvious gluttony is a nice combination.","[0.0, 1.0]"

But what really sets this burger joint apart is the atmosphere. Our waitress was so nice, I could not believe it. There was no death metal playing on full blast, and their outside patio was nicely set away from the noisy Western Ave in the shade of some big trees. Overall, this will be a definite come-back experience for me when those juicy burgers call me back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

On top of the food, the service and great and it's a very romantic and cozy atmosphere. But that's not all....the best part is that at the end of our meal our waiter presented us with a contact card that asks for our name, email, mailing address and birthday.

"I was really tempted to return to Spacca Napoli tonight, even though I just ate dinner their last night; it's that good. But let's get the ""why this isn't a five-star review"" tidbits out of the way first, though, shall we? It's always much better to end with a bang. First of all, climate control, or lack there of. I know that it was really friggin' cold last night, especially for the end of May, but the restaurant had this arctic draft blowing across it, except for two brief moments when the brick oven's 900 degree heat wave became way too apparent, and the air smelled burnt. Hours later, when I was still relishing the prosciutto, the tiramisu, the crust, my core body temperature was still below normal. Secondly, the waitstaff was brusque; our server did not smile once. I guess I expect at least a little warmth from Italian restaurants. But, ah, there is so much to love about this place, even if my druthers require a sweater and a smile! Walking into the space is like walking into Naples. I have never even been to Italy, much less Naples, but Spacca Napoli has a downright foreign feeling to it. I have never gotten the ""we're not in the U.S. anymore"" vibe from non-Devon Avenue restaurant before. With a great deal of the menu in Italian , red wine served in juice-like glasses, and four Italian bieres and espresso only, this place smacks of Euro-authenticity. The ""Vero Pizza"" banner sealed the deal. Apparently, this is the only restaurant in the United States to belong to this exclusive Italian restaurant association, in addition to winning the ""True Pizza"" award at a competition which is held each year in May. And perhaps our server's cool attitude was really one of genuine jejune. After all, who among us has had an enthusiastic server over on the Continent? Pas moi! The service was precise and punctual, which is what really matters anyway. We began our meal with the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto platter. When the astronomer Galileo sent his daughter, who was living in a convent, mozzarella cheese, he called it a ""buffalo's egg."" The mozzarella that arrived on our platter was accurately the size of an egg, if buffaloes actually laid them! It was artfully cut into so that a slice of prosciutto bloomed from its center. Two large slices of prosciutto framed the ball of mozzarella, and the whole arrangement was drizzled with olive oil and garnished with pungent basil leaves. It was accompanied by five thin slices of baguette, also drizzled with olive oil. The cheese was so creamy and fresh, the prosciutto was perfectly salty and smoky...it was heavenly. Next came our pizza. Spacca Napoli offers about 12 pizzas and 3 special pizzas, all with simple, variation on a theme-type toppings. For the neophytes: 'bianca' pizza does not have any tomatoes. The pizzas that include tomatoes still do not have a true sauce, more like juicy pockets of tomato goodness. My boyfriend and I decided upon the Funghi e Salsicca, mushroom and sausage. I'm guessing that 'fior di latte mozzarella is not made from water buffalo milk, but it was still delicious. While the toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was the real showstopper. ""The charred bits taste like those I would expect from a steak,"" my boyfriend declared. Next came our dessert, a creamy, appropriately rich, marsala-wined moistened but not too sweet tiramisu. Mmm! Washed down with thimbles full of sharp espresso, and the evening was a success. A bitterly cold one, but still a success. I mean, where in this city can two enjoy wine, antipasti, pizza, dessert, and espresso for $50? As the Carter Family sang, ""Keep on the Sunny Side, always on the Sunny Side."" When I can enjoy my meal in the warmth of the summer night in their outdoor seating, I will certainly return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We had a plantain and beef appetizer, that we didn't order, but OOPS, Gabby misheard our entire order. We were scared to say the least. Gabby was so polite and actually had the right order out in a matter of moment (props to the kitchen) It was all amazing.

"The best, repeat, THE BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO. We will get to the pizza in a moment, but first, everything else... Great local beer selection, great menu (outside of the pizza), fun atmosphere and a very nice staff. The pizza...life changing. For me, anytime you can say that the last bite you have of a meal is the best, well, you have yourself a good meal. It says something of a place when each bite gets better and better. Eat your meat loaded pizzas with a knife and fork, then save the crust and a tiny bit of sauce that escapes from your pie for dipping. The crust is the...freaking...best. The restaurant has been using the same deep dish pans since the dawn of man and all of those little garlic, cheese, oil and meat juices from the pans are seared right into the crust for the climax. I find it amazing that I can say that the best part of this pizza is the crust. Everything else is great...the cheese, the meats, the sauces...but the crust. Wow. If you are visiting Chicago and want some authentic deep dish, this is the spot where the locals go. And, it's never as insanely busy as the other touristy places that serve deep dish.

This place absolutely did NOT disappoint! I read that it gets crowded and to be prepared for a wait, so we arrived about 30 minutes after opening. The line was already out the door and starting to form along the side of the building, which appears to be the norm. By the time we got to the counter to order we were hungry and ready to go! I tend to expect big hotspots like this to have a snooty, stuck up way about them - like how some philly cheesesteak places in philly yell at you for asking for ketchup - but Hot Doug's was the opposite. The man taking our order (Doug?) took his time with us first-timers, explaining the menu and how to order exactly what we wanted. He also answered all my dad's questions about the meat. And to top it all off, the three of us were stuffed for a mere $20 bill, which included 3 really tasty root beers.

"I'd been wanting to try the original Urban Vegan on Montrose, but hadn't gotten around to it. When I heard they opened up a new spot a bit closer to me, I got excited (good Thai food is seriously lacking in Logan Square/Bucktown) and took the opportunity to get some take-out. This first time I was boring, but just wanted a simple pad thai with soy chicken. After years of only ever ordering Thai food with tofu (and worrying that they wouldn't keep the fish/oyster sauce out), this was a nice change. I got the lunch combo, which came with a little salad (w/ a delicious dressing) and the best egg rolls (eggless, of course) that I have ever had. Warning, they are thinner than your typical egg roll, but well worth it. Next time I'll try something more interesting, like one of the mock-fish dishes (the sweet chili fish sounds too good).

"A month or so back, I went to the Purple Pig with a group of six of my closest friends from high school to have our yearly reunion. After 8 years of having these reunion dinners, we have finally found a home. Instantly, the atmosphere, ambiance, music, and full house (on a MONDAY!) struck a chord with us that we had chosen the perfect restaurant. Instantly, we could feel that we were going to have a great time. Not being big wine connoisseurs, the extensive wine list could have been a little intimidating; however, it was quite easy to follow. I was personally happy to find a wine from my grandparents' small hometown in Italy, for a very reasonable price. Even better, the bottle was great and we all ended up sharing many bottles over the course of the night. As for the food, all I can say is that it was unreal. Being in a decent sized group, we all chose something that we wanted to try and passed the plates around to share. We were able to enjoy a large chunk of the menu from the Salt-Roasted Beets, Corn and Tomato in an Arugula Pesto for starters; to the in house cured meats; followed by a lengthy stop in the Smears section which included the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio, Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese (table favorite), Whipped Feta with Cucumbers, and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs; over to the Fried Items where we had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and Prosciutto Balls; and ending with Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (table favorite) and Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki for our entrees. As you can see, we thoroughly enjoyed the food and just kept eating and eating. We ended the night with some grappa. Once more, this was personally appeasing to me since I have not had the chance to enjoy some since my grandfather passed, along with his homemade wines and grappa. The night was perfect; we had the perfect setting in that the place was lively, and us being single guys, was filled with attractive women that the communal seating allowed us to mingle and interact with. I've already been back to the Pig and so have many of my friends. On top of the exceptional food and wine that is readily available, it also provides a multiple array of social settings, be it a place to have a nice romantic date or family dinner, go out with a group of friends and enjoy new foods, or have a small bite to eat and a glass of wine while meeting new people. One last thing is that the service was exceptional. Our waitress was very helpful with any questions we had regarding the wine list and menu. We had to wait a little which was expected with how busy the place was, but we were able to get some wine while we waited for a table. The chef, who is around our age, came over and talked with us for a bite. He was very modest and a nice guy. He went over to other tables as well and I found that to be a nice touch. Having been back there, he and some of the staff have remembered who I am and always find time to say hello.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It's the kind of restaurant that once you sit down you're really in no rush to leave. I would suggest sitting at the bar if you can.

"Typical diner fair, but instead of the food being made with chickens, pigs and cows, it instead comes from helpless soys, seitans and tofurkys. And sometimes actual vegetables. The food is for the most part good, sometimes really good, but is overpriced. I've been here a few times and always like the food, but the prices (and frequently the wait times for a table) are almost always sure to keep me away for the next year or so, sending me to Veggie Bite when I want a vegetarian version of a fast food sandwich. Because this is a vegetarian restaurant, they have real eggs, cheese and other dairy in some of the items, which is awesome. Especially when that cheese is all over fake chorizo nachos. Mmmm....seitanrizo....The sweet potato fries are delicious. I had a spicy cocoa cupcake with cinnamon frosting and a margarita flavored cake with lime frosting - both were delicious and would happify anyone, but I dislike that the cakes were served cold instead of being brought to room temperature first, cause cold frosting sucks. Portions of what I got were tiny, but I saw some massive platters of food going to other people, so I'd have to say that portions are somewhat inconsistent. But veggie or not veggie, diner food is meant to be served in ginormous sizes meant for glutenous overindulgence. But the prices, oy! My veg inclined friends are always telling me how much money I could save by not eating meat - they must not eat here all the time. Vegetarian food - especially sandwiches - should not cost more than meat versions, unless truffles are involved. Good truffles, too. Or maybe unless vegetables from other parts of the world that had to be imported are involved. Maybe. 10 chips, a dollop of salsa and a little glop of guacamole? Like $9 with one refill of chips. They have a children's menu (yea!) but charged me $4 for an tiny apple juice for a 2-year-old (boooo!). Veggie enchiladas for $11? I could see the $5 for the (yummy) sweet potato fries, if only the portion was not like as if it was a part of the kids' menu - you should never be able to count the fries on your plate. I want that number un-fricking-countable. The bill for four people was almost $100 - and two of us only shared veggie nachos, fries and cake... That is not what I'm talking about for diner food - that's my freaking grocery bill. I guess I want more than diner ambiance for those kind of prices. When I go back again, I'm going to be absolutely sure to go before 3:30 pm on a Sunday for brunch - the prices looked to be 25-50% lower than the lunch/dinner menu. And I like their breakfast food better anyway.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We just happened to wonder into Garcia's since it was in walking distance of our place. The drinks were great=strong, and the food was wonderful for the price. I brought my family to the location in LIncoln Square and it was the same. Quick service, great margaritas!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"YUM. We did the large tasting menu and everything was creative and delicious. I did become rather full about halfway through, so I would recommend going on a VERY empty stomach and pacing yourself somewhat. The environment is chill, but still nice. All of the employees are laid back and tons of fun. I love that we can BYOB and bring our favorite bottle(s) of wine. As for reservations, we actually haven't had that hard of a time. We left a message in the end of March for April reservations and were contacted within a couple of weeks. Recently, we called for September reservations and someone actually answered! We have decided that we'll go once a season. It's that good.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"How can you treat people like trash and still exist?Build your clientele of desperate, approval-seeking lonely folks who have a masochistic streak? That's the only way I can see someone justifying patronage to this BAD JOKE of a bar.Ok, ok, we get it. The bouncer is an a**hole who won't make eye contact or acknowledge anyone. I get it, the bartenders/servers are WAY too busy serving their 2 other, much more important customers. Waiting 35 minutes to order once you're in is the norm! YOU'RE LUCKY TO JUST BE THERE, RIGHT?Seriously. If I had self-esteem issues I'd love this place. But I would rather just drink in a nice quiet place with friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came here on a weekday around 11 and it wasn't crowded at all. It was so good, I couldn't stop eating. The menu almost has too much to choose from. The pancakes were not out of this world, but they were good. I'd say average to a little above. The potatoes could use more seasoning. But the omelette we got with avocado and sour cream was SO yummy. They have different creamer flavors from International Delight that were a nice touch on every table. I was very surprised at how moderately priced everything was for the high quality. I'd go back if I lived there!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"First time at Shaw's last night to celebrate 2 birthdays. We started off the evening with a bloody mary and pometini, and both were delicious. The Lobster bisque was outstanding - creamy with fresh tender lobster. We ordered Alaskan King Crab and a Crab combination dinner. Both entrees were abundant and delicious- we were unable to finish the Alaskan King Crab dinner. I absolutely recommend this place for dinner, and don't forget to ask for Luke - he was a spectacular server. We will definitely be going back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is my FAVORITE place for pizza. Hands down, the most delicious pizza you will find in Chicago. I'm a big fan of the salsiccia - Italian sausage, mozzarella, basil.

"I never yelp, however this place was amazing! My friends and I showed up at 8:30 on a Thursday night and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. Normally, we would be scared off by such a wait but there is a bar and a large enough waiting area that it seemed fine. We were originally a party of 8 however became a party of 13 as the time went on. The wonderful host was so accommodating, as a hostess myself I would say that he deserves five stars alone! The staff was friendly and prompt and the food was out of this world! Because we had vegetarians at our table we ordered the basil, goat cheese, and garlic pizza...one word...DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The beer they brew there is delicious, try the moose knuckle brew on tap. Over all Piece was friendly staff, great atmosphere, delicious food and beer. I would say to anyone that this place is worth the time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been wanting to come here for the longest and I had high expectations, but they did fall a little short. I had lunch with a friend on the patio. Her 1 year old son was with us and I must say they were very kid friendly. High chair, crayons, and sippy cup. We ordered the trio of empanadas with beef, ropa vieja, & chorizo. The ropa vieja was pretty good, but the chorizo was disgusting. It tasted like chorizo paste. I had the cuban sandwich and it was not the best I've had. The bread was way too hard. My friend had the steak sandwich. I enjoyed it except for the fact that it was way too greasy. I'm guessing it was all that oil in the chimichurri sauce. The sandwiches came with plaintain chips which i didn't care for. The service was slow at first. It took about 15 minutes for our server to first show up. The service did get better after that. I will give 90 miles another shot, but I will order a dinner plate the next time around.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Really enjoyed the ambiance at Zed. I was there with a party of 8 for a girlfriends birthday. We enjoyed cocktails, wine and a great selection of appetizers. The portions were perfect for sharing. We had the samosas, calamari, duck flat bread (which was amazing) and a delicious cheese plate. Our server however was a bit goofy and did not explain the cheese plate presentation. Other than that, I really enjoyed Zed451 and would go back for a relaxing evening of wine and flavorful food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow, Lao, I like your style! Your food is bangin'. The twenty-minute wait, not so much. I'm not saying a wait is not to be expected at a delicious restaurant, but there is nowhere to sit so you have to stand there smashed up against some other starving waitee and have nothing to do but stare at everyone's food. But, I digress. On to the food. I had been craving hot and sour soup all day, and was delighted when I ordered a cup and it didn't have UFO's (Unidentified Floating Objects) like many a H&S soups I've experienced before. This hot and sour was straight to the point- hot, sour and tofu/mushroom-laden. And vegetarian to boot! Much like the chips and salsa placed on the table at a Mexican restaurant, Lao Sze Chuan's version of this is the spicy cabbage dish served once you've been seated. Slightly vinegar-y, this chili-oil dressed slaw with flecks of chili pepper sucked the sinus issues right out of me! For an appetizer, my roomie and I ordered the green beans in black bean sauce. Chopped green beans with a hint of soy sauce and fermented black beans- absolutely delicious, and not over-powering and filling (ahem...eggroll). My only complaint is the apparent Carpel Tunnel Syndrome I developed from picking up tiny beans one at a time with chopsticks. Oh, I'm just complaining because I didn't want to be the only person using a fork in the entire restaurant. Anyway... For the main event, we decided to get two different entrees and split them after much debate about getting the Hotpot (which we will most certainly explore next time). So, we went with the staple Orange Chicken- crispy and flavorful, and they even asked if we wanted it spicy! Yeah! Also, the Sze Chuan Beef, which was good but the beef was a little soft and strangely textured. The sauce was spicy and flavorful though, and the veggies crunchy and fresh. I think I might just go with vegetarian options next time. To all the vegetarians out there- check this place out. There are TONS of veggie options! Overall...a very satisfying experience. I can't wait to get back there and try some other dishes (all 900 of them).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I really wanted to love Wilde. It's pretty, it's close to my job, etc. But I have been there several times now and every time I leave disappointed. Today we ordered carry out and when we got it back to work it was missing the side sauces we had asked for as well as the coleslaw. I don't like cole slaw so I didn't really miss it, but damn it, it should have been there.  We had a burger and a chicken sandwich. They both tasted the same-bland bland bland. When you can barely taste the difference between beef and poultry you are in trouble. Other visits were hit or miss. I like the little cod brittles appetizer, but the fish and chips entree isn't very good. The Reuben is tasty at first but gets boring fast. The Irish BLT is so salty that I spent the rest of my day chugging water to make up for eating it.  I think this place has great decor, a fabulous location but until they learn how to season their food they are going to be off my list.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Talk about OVER RATED! The food was good, the staff, for the most part is so stuck up and they want to turn those tables FAST. It is very expensive for what you get. The hostess was so unkind! AManda out waitress was a total sweet heart!I like the communal table setting, fun and met some fun people, it is so loud you can't really have a good conversation with your friends on the other side of the table.As they bring your small plates they just slam it down on the table and in front of one of the people in your party and quickly mumble what it is. The pace is so frenetic it is not a place to go and and enjoy yourself and spend any quality time. I am sure this atmosphere is created that way so you get in, eat and get out so they can flip the tables. It is way over priced for the food and the amount that you get.If I ever go again, it will be too soon. $400.00 for dinner?? There are a ton of amazing places in Chicago to spend that kind of money.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Dined here compliments of the BF for VDay and had the the privilege of enjoy a 6-course, rock-ballade inspired meal filled with love, flavor, and exceptionally creative food combos. Yam gnocchi just oozed goodness, foi gra paired with cherry preserves was like a modern, twisted delicious cherry pie, and the Pillow Talk cocktail was my favorite of all St. Germain drinks thus far. Staff was fantastic and so well-versed with each dish that I felt I was in a Top Chef episode when being explained each one. Luckily, no one got sent home. And if they did can they please come to my home and cook the same meal over again. And of course, the infamous Graham Elliot popcorn that I will never get enough of. Graham Elliot knows how to rock my taste buds.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Meh. I've been to Spacca three times, and each time it is simply OK. On the most recent visit, our pizza came out straight up burned (and still soggy in the middle).  The owner gave us a lecture about how all pizza will have ""some scorch on it."" That's nice, but our entire crust and bottom was BLACK. That's not ""some scorch."" We did get another pizza, but it was only half-baked and extremely soggy. It was also very bland. Wine list is decent, but overall this place is overhyped and overpriced. I'll save my pizza eating for Sapori di Napoli and Pizza DOC.","[0.0, 1.0]"
