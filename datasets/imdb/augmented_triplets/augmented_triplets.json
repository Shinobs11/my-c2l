place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia, going through most of europe - italy, bulgaria, croatia, slovenia, turkey, before arriving in the middle east. but this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights. < br / > < br / > reda's father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the haj. however, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to mecca by car. he can't drive, and therefore enlists the help of reda, to his son's protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle. < br / > < br / > but reda doesn't see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand. and hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals. < br / > < br / > the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water. through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences. < br / > < br / > it's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj. the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too

relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside ( rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v. browne's eye - catching cinematography ), though annan's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one ( or both ) of these doe - eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and'left'under mysterious circumstances. stokes'unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. there's an extraordinary, multi - layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to'emasculate'their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, though stokes'alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery. < br / > < br / > in the early scenes, at least, the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and [MASK], but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd - pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner. the closing sequences are ( quite literally ) gut - wrenching, especially annan's final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored ( what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!

despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of [MASK] action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. it

europe with italy's neo - realist movement. during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, france's new wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. but in 1971, luchino visconti brought the art - form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work * death in venice *, which might as well be called * the death of europoean cinema *. after the sixties wound down, so did the great european filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats ( coppola, scorsese, & co. ). this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing - up, not just of visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. and rest assured, you will find no sterner task - master than the visconti revealed here. he's not playing to the crowd, folks : either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. the pacing is a challenge : slow, but never without emotional weight. \" incidents \" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm - und - drang cosmos. < br / > < br / > we will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies : one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale ( thomas mann ), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it ( visconti ), one of the greatest actors in the lead role ( dirk bogarde ), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, gustav mahler's 5th symphony. taking full advantage of mahler's ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast, visconti changes the main character, aschenbach, into

movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion ( and its analog of viral invasion of a body ), romance and few other things as well. it's a film that has almost too much on its mind. the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature, in this case emile zola's \" therese raquin \". it's an odd mix that doesn't always gel, but none the less has an incredible power. here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center ( with a post film discussion by the director ) and i find my cage is [MASK] rattled. its not so much what happens is bothersome, its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect. < br / > < br / > the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies, but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood ( its not explained ) he actually survives. hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick.

i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble??? nahhhh no problem. didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber - geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. this movie is so contrived and [MASK] it's nauseating, and why at the end is everybody ( the alpo girls included ) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her????

into a taut, [MASK] drama with any number of off - kilter twists. the hero, skip mccoy, is a three - time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end. the girl in the caper, candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined. one of the most appealing characters, moe williams, is a stoolie. and in an unusual approach to hollywood's battle against commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears ; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling. he just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming... at least for now... a good guy. < br / > < br / > plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio. he had to make do. richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but jean peters is a surprise. she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends... or her clients... want her to be. and richard kiley, who later would become a two - time tony award winning star on broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly. it's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, i mean introduced to us, \"

love, and how to handle it. is it a good thing to be totally in love? cher and cage, at the end, seem to think so, but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy ( and cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too, when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme ). is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death. dukakis believes so, and ( oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced ) aiello. chance reveals infidelity - dukakis realizes early that gardenia's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness, and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera ( but gardenia also stumbles onto cher's similar unfaithfulness to aiello ). but chance also causes misunderstandings : fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair. < br / > < br / > there are lovely little moments in the film too. cher's observation about flowers leading to receiving
