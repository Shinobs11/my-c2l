killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. it's a clever scheme where a driver, greaves ( gunter meisner ) meets the convicts (.. who hide in a barrel ) who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. under suspicion are girls'dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the bannister. some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. the ending features multiple twists. < br / > < br / > out of the krimi films i've seen, the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit (.. which isn't used ),","[0, 1]",True
