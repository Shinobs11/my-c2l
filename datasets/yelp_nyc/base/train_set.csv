"I do love Lomzynianka. I am even going to go as far as to say that it is my favorite restaurant in the city because it's so consistent, close to my home, wonderfully cheap, and charmingly casual. Oh, and it's also just good. I have yet to find a better Polish restaurant in the 'hood, though I've tried. Yelp's right on this one. I recommend for the vegetarians the vegetable borscht, the potato & cheese pierogies, and the sauerkraut. My carnivorous friends swear by the Hungarian pie.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow ! Best Curry ever! I had a customized lamb curry and my friend had a beef curry, my lamb curry was not as spicy but it's so distinct it had raisin and almond.  The garlic Nan was fresh and great too! Lastly, a mango sorbet was given to us as a gift !","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Overall quite good; service was excellent. They don't seat before 5:30, so it's the bar until then (we showed up ten minutes before our res time; plenty of other people did, too, so the bar gets a bit crowded). The restaurant is packed with tables, and it is popular; I don't think, though, that there is anything such as a 'best' seat; everywhere I saw diners get bumped and sidestepped by wait staff moving around. They're experts at it, but still, if you want a little space, this is not the restaurant for you. My sister and I had the bone marrow (very good), I had the Tavern steak with french fries (fine, not special), my sister had the mussels (she loved them), and we had a soufflé for dessert that they encourage you to order early because they have to make it. It was fine, also not super special, but it's big; it's meant for two. One nitpicky criticism I have of Minetta Tavern is that I made the reservation on OpenTable, and then they (the Tavern) called me three times to confirm it. I understand they want my assurance, but they really can't have it, even by harassing me, unless they're going to require a credit card to hold it. So back off, a little, Minetta Tavern; your restaurant was hopping, so you're clearly not hurting for business. No need to keep calling me!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tucked away under the Brooklyn Bridge not far from the hubbub of south street seaport is this nondescript Tex-Mex seafood joint. Went with a party of six and had a great time. Bacon wrapped poppers were sensational. Crab cake burgers were delicious. Cocktails were good and fairly priced. Apparently the po boys are great too. All this for under $40 a head. Great value. Oh, and the music pumps in here creating quite a raucous vibe. Will definitely go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The worst delivery experience ever. Waited for an hour and half. I live 3 blocks away. I was repeatedly called from their charming delivery man who was yelling at me... I then proceeded to call Zutto. I spoke with some Host who said "" I will take care of it. Then he hung up. I couldn't believe it. He never asked who I was or where I lived. I had been waiting for 1hr and 45 minutes for 3 rolls. I mean really? I called back and asked them to cancel my order. I will never ever order from this place again.

"There's been quite a bit of hype surrounding L'Artusi since it opened (I have literally overheard people talking about this place on multiple occasions), and I decided to make a reservation for my wife's birthday.  When we arrived, the restaurant was absolutely packed.  With chic decor, a bustling local crowd, and a reputation that preceded it, L'Artusi has everything it needs to be successful going for it. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of the one thing that matters the most: the food.  The hamachi tartare was decidedly average -- it really isn't even in the same league as Le Bernardin's version.  The pasta was quite bland, and the roasted chicken was a bit overcooked.  If there was one redeeming quality, it would be the sides.  Both the crispy potatoes and the Brussels sprouts were quite fantastic.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend wanted a French bistro for her birthday dinner, and La Sirene didn't disappoint.  The food was good, the fish fresh, and everything was done nicely.  It didn't blow me away, but it was a good meal.  We had the French onion soup, which was superb, and a salad to start, and each had a different fish special.  The service was excellent, attentive without being intrusive.","[1.0, 0.0]"

A complimentary shot of Jameson rounded out the meal perfectly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Almost certainly the best pizza I've ever had in Manhattan, and this is very odd because I had never heard of this place before I went there last night.

"We were almost 30 min late for out 8 pm reservation at Cuba, but fortunately they have kept our table. We had delicious coctails. For starter I had Tiradito de Pargo; Marinated red snapper, lemon citrus, red onions, jalapens, cilantroand fresh mango, and for main course Pounded sirloin steak, sauteed onions and delicious chimichurri. My friend had Bacalatios Cubanos; Cod fish fritters with chipotle mayo and Red snapper, green plantain crust, sofrito sauce. Everything was really good, I especially enjoyed the chimichurri. With coffee our waiter recommended old Metusalem rhum. I normally don´t like strong liquors straight up, but this was delicious and very smooth!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came to Queens Comfort on a weekend afternoon with an empty stomach and some serious jonesing for brunch food, and it really it the spot. I started with an appetizer, the fireballs, which are fried balls of macaroni and cheese with sri acha sauce. They're nicely fried on the outside, moist on the inside, and spicy. My main was the crab cakes benedict. The cake is rather tall, very moist, and lightly fried. Atop it is a poached egg and some well-considered hollandaise. Underneath, are some greens and tomato. The plate has a lot of flavor, especially the hollandaise, which I was beginning to think was a lost art. The only bit of mediocrity was the $4.50 orange juice, that while tasting fresh, was not fresh squeezed. Service was good, and it's surprisingly comfortable given the communal tables and loud atmosphere. If you're reading this, go. Go to Queens Comfort now, and have a great brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Sweet Afton was a little difficult to find when I went especially in this chilly dark weather. But once inside, the decor was great! The host was really nice. My boyfriend were looking for cozy seats to catch up on, and this place has a variety of seating for groups, couples, and for singles. We ended up going ALLLLLLLLL the way to the back, in a booth which was very cozy. We ordered a couple specialty cocktails, mac and cheese, and grilled cheese. It was all great! The food tasted really good together. Maybe it was our choices, I dont know. The professionalism, the cutlery, the food, the service, was all very well thought out. I appreciate it. Especially since the entire time I was looking for something wrong. Oh, wait, I did find something wrong. There was a cob-web like 6 feet above me, in the corner of the ceiling. Once the alcohol was running, I wasn't worried about it anymore. Overall, we had a pleasant time. I kind of wished that I tried their specialty dish, maybe net time. I would consider this place the next time I want a cozy dinner in Astoria on 30th/31st Ave.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Grimaldis is another classic historic NY pizza joint.  I remember being blown away when I was younger by their pizza.  I thought that it was not as good as Patsy's, but definitely better than anything I could get in my home town.   I went back recently, as I have been revisiting all of my favorite childhood pizzerias.  Sadly, I was underwhelmed.  The sauce was the best part of the pizza.  The crust was flavorless, and the cheese was rubbery.  It looked like the same cheese that Patsy's uses.   They seem to always have a line of customers, but if they are like me, and went there as a kid, then the lines wont be around for long.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Grilled Corn with the cheese, lime, butter and chili flakes. This is great stuff for around $2. Five Stars for the corn. I am not a big corn person...but I do dream about this corn sometimes...lucky for me that I live near by now. Have had the steak burrito there as well and it is a bit above average. Hence the overall 4 stars for now. I look forward to eating at the restuarant again and trying echiladas or the steak sandwhich. The restuarant itself is always busy at night with people waiting outside. They do have a little to go shop around the corner. Easy way to just get the grilled corn if that is all you are after.

"better than trellis, but thats not saying much the menu is ameture. you can tell it was created by a hobbyist, and not a chef. it has no congruity or flow, too much variety with not enough total items available. the food tends to be either really unhealthy (fatty, salty, fried, cheesed, gravy'd, etc), or bland and unpalletable. there is not a single healthy option on the menu besides a side of carrots and celery (mind you, it comes with blue cheese dressing). i have purchased several different meals from here, both dine-in and take-out, and have yet to be pleased with anything. add to this the fact that the food is priced as if it is balducci or cittorella quality, yet delivered closer to mcdonalds quality and this place is not for the hungry. the drink selection is reasonable, prices are reasonable during happy hour. besides the drinks, the only thing this place has going for it are the cute girls that work there (they cant wait tables, but they are friendly and nice to look at), hiring young cuties seems to be the only good business decision the owner has made. my advice is to eat a sandwich at home and hit this 2nd rate hooters for cheap_o pitchers of coors light. then jump on the tram and hit the strip club for a nite-cap. my advice for the owner is to firre the chef, hire a professional, write a real ""grown up"" menu, and feature 3 distinct healthy entree options. also establish a complete prix fixed brunch menu that includes a morning drink and coffee, AND CHOICES OF DECENT OPTIONS, for under $17 and youll get my business back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Mary had a little lamb, and why does Mary love the lamb so...? Because this lamb is regoddamndiculous! These succulent morsels of shaved, twice cooked infant sheep is how the Greeks created an empire. One bite, and you'd fight and die for it too.   The line is usually insanely long. But moves fast, so don't let it discourage you. The tzatziki, which is the best I've ever had. Is made more of sour cream rather than the usual bland no fat, no calorie, dribble. Have a splash of their spicy hot sauce if you like a punch. Mix it all up and put that in your gullet, and you'll be spartan warrior with a belly full of deliciousness. Even the fries are amazing, crispy with a hint of olive oil and spices. The kicker... A Gyro platter (which is accurately pronounced ""Yee-roh""), a drink, and order of fries for $12! Take my money sir! I'd happily pay $30 for the best gyro this side of the Mediterranean. Glory to the gods it's good!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Awesome little spot! Had the chicken kabob sandwich, and though disappointed they didn't have any sauces, the owner (very nice guy btw) insisted that the chicken was marinated and the sauce would only serve to distract.

"So the first night that my roommates and I arrived in New York, we went to Artichoke for pizza because we heard it was simply amazing New York pizza. I have to say that I was slightly disappointed that this wasn't really ""New York"" pizza since the slices were fairly thick. Nevertheless, I was still excited because the aroma from this pizza joint was just out of this world and the lines was pretty long at 10pm, so it must have been good pizza. They had a crab pizza that I really wanted to try but were out and I would have had to wait, which I wasn't willing to do because I was so damn hungry from the 4hr. bus ride. So I opted to get the Margaritta pizza and it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm used to Margaritta pizzas that have basil and tomatos with a thin coating of mozzarella cheese. So what did I get from this place? A slice of pizza LAYERED with pounds of cheese...ok, maybe I'm exaggerating but it felt that way since I'm lactose intolerant. Anywho, it turns out...I really liked it! The taste of really strong cheese usually disgusts me but I actually enjoyed it this time around. Even though my roommates and I loved the pizza here, don't come here if you want thin crust pizza..you won't find any.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So glad Go! Go! Curry! is walking distance from where I work. Love coming here for lunch! Cheap for the amount of food that you get. Basically a hole in the wall type of place, and there is a $10 minimum for credit card use. It's always packed but a seat usually always opens up by the time you get your food. This is solid Japanese curry. It's just the right consistency and flavor. Always served with shredded cabbage and a heaping mound of rice. There's 4 options for the amount of rice that you get. Their katsu is perfectly fried. Crispy exterior with a tender interior. My favorite has been the pork katsu. Getting radish as a topping is a nice addition.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had a wonderful experience at Lulu & Me Gastrobar last night.  The staff could not have been more charming, accommodating and attentive.  Every single dish that we ordered was delicious.  The shrimp and cod that we had were fresh, perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The way that the chef seasons her dishes is subtle yet spectacular and allows the ingredients to shine.  Everything we ordered tasted so fresh and light but had really complex flavor profiles.  This is definitely the way that I love my food!  I would give this place the very highest recommendation.  Prices are also extremely low for the high level of quality and great service.  Not one disappointing note from soup to nuts, as they say.  Bravo!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Trading Post has a restaurant and bar upstairs and what they bill as a 'whiskey den' downstairs... Honestly though, it's all the same, a 2-story bar-restaurant with exposed brick walls and candle lighting making it a sexy enclave for a date spot, or a flirtatious happy hour with co-workers.  The food menu is small and consists mostly of artisan flatbreads, which were delicious, and small shareable plates.  Located in the still Sandy recovering South Street Seaport I'm definitely a big fan of Trading Post and bringing business back to this neighborhood.  Due to it's size this is a great spot for a big group happy hour or dinner.  Staff is very accommodating and the cocktails are great.  Now go check it out for yourself...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you really want to impress a girl, a client or a fancypants friend, take them to a Japanese speakeasy eatery, whose deliciously douchy reservation system involves knowing the owner's cell phone number, and some conversational Japanese. The small space is pretty special; the single well-lit, minimalistic room is an ostensible living room: the bar lords over five coffee tables (the largest of which seats up to five) flanked by upholstered chaises and easy chairs. There's a single bathroom (complete with Asian bidet), and a couple of bonsai trees. The kitchen's no-where to be seen. You may also eat here if you want a slightly upscale meal with a small group of good friends. The genius of Boheman is that it's a comfortable ambiance that doesn't steal thunder from the meal, and a comfortable meal that doesn't steal thunder from the company (or your wallet). You'll not necessarily find yourself filling conversational void with talk of food, but you WILL enjoy what you're eating and drinking while being able to carry on a good conversation. $48 buys the tight and consistent five course tasting menu. The food for the price point is very nice, and presented to encourage a pretty intimate, non-too-pretentious experience (e.g., the raw vegetable fondue and baked branzino are served family style; the wagyu burger and sake flan are sizable and feel a little bit like junk food.) The loser to my mind was the mushroom croquette, but everything else was of good quality, and demure. Decent sake / wine list to boot (read: no longer BYOB).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It's the ~exact~ same thing as Chipotle except with less stuff and rice/beans that are strictly inferior and less flavorful. Everything was prepared well. Nothing under cooked or missing. Actually, I take that back. Their cheese is %^&*ing gross. It's some pale white slab that they put on the tortilla. It had no flavor and looked like crap. What's up with that? But besides that. A-ok. I must admit the green sauce was delicious with a good amount of heat and flavor, but that was the only thing special about this. Place is small. A few tables for 2 and some stools.

Came here for my bday with my bf and we had a great view of the sun setting. Decor: trendy and chic but simple, plenty of nice outdoor seating but ur over the fdr so it's loud, I liked it inside by the window. Food: oh the food! I was hesitant as I recently went to craftbar and was sooooo disappointed with TC, but this was amazing! The ill bugetes of bread were lovely, the bread guy was my BFF by the end bc I kept asking for more! The salad with marinated veggies was ok but the dressing was to vinegary for me. I ordered smoked gnocchi which were served with morels in lovely cheesy sauce and the pillowy goodness of the dumplings had me feeling like I was in heaven. Bf had lamb rib and tbone which was cooked to perfection and complemented well by whimsical sauces, roasted asparagus, and lovely lil potatoes , excellent! Too full for desert but I had the rum and strawberry cocktail which was refreshing n perfect for the summery weather!

"I went on my birthday to celebrate on May 31, 2013 at the Upper West Side location.  I heard so many great things only to be extremely disappointed. I will not be returning.  The service was terrible. I had made reservations with a party of 7 and because one person was missing, I was not seated. Meanwhile a caucasion man came in with so many people and his entire party was not there and he was seated rather quickly.  Not my place, noisy, the staff is rude.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This was my first time eating Austrian food, and I will definitely be going back for more! The restaurant has a great ambiance: very intimate, cozy, and dimly lit. The staff is extremely friendly; the owner introduced himself to us, and upon learning that my friend is Austrian, stayed to chat. Even though we had to wait to get a table (15-20 minutes), we were able to get seats at the bar, and were encouraged to order our meal there so that it would be ready once we got a table. My friend and I shared our main courses: we ordered trout mullerin and cheese spatzle. I am still dreaming about them: the trout has a delicious crust of toasted almonds, is sitting on a bed of spinach with potatoes on the side, and it is covered in a buttery sauce that beautifully brings the dish together. The cheese spatzle I also highly recommend-- it is like an upscale comfort food; they use an excellent cheese! The food is also reasonably priced for its quality. Enjoy!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So. freaking. good. Came here to celebrate a birthday dinner a couple weekends back. It was my first time at the restaurant...aaand I will def be back. Highlights of the meal include the brussel sprouts (holy crap), the hummus, and the batata harra (potato dish). In fact, those three flavors combined yields the perfect bite. I kid you not. The baba ghanouj was good, too. As was the cauliflower dish, and the fattoush. Yum scrum. Didn't try the meat dishes but heard they were very good. Ilili got a stamp of approval from our Lebanese friend, who said it's one of the best Lebanese restaurant he has tried in the U.S. yet (the guy knows his food). Also loved the ambiance -- dim lighting, high ceilings, and a large space, so great for big and small groups alike.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I decided to take myself out for a nice lunch and chose Lupa.  Problems began as soon as I sat down on the just-too-small-enough bar stool, which was just a little too small for me.  But that was not the problem.  As I arrived, the bar tender was engaging with a customer who was ordering, and it was a full three minutes before he paid me any attention.  Neither did anyone offer me some water.  In short, I did not feel welcomed, especially as a new customer.  Let the record show that I was given an ameuse geule, a small crostini with a fava mash on it, but it was handed to me nervously and I had to ask what it was.  Finally, BT slid the menu my way, but not quite in front of me.  I had overheard him recommend the head cheese to the other customer, so I ordered that, pasta carbonara, and brussel sprouts.  I won't bore you with every detail, but the head cheese, though delicious, was like a thick puddle and had no real texture, the pasta was almost not quite done, that is, too al dente, and had good buy odd flavor, and  the pancetta portion was not generous.  The brussel sprouts were good.  so was the table focaccia, though it would have been much better a little warmed; it is heavenly at Batali's Tarry Inn in Eastchester.  Though the place was by no means full when I arrived, I felt i waited far too long for each course and no one noticed me looking at my watch after 15 minutes.   Come on, people, notice and anticipate...tend to your customers -- some water, some more bread, some love.  And yes, waiters should read Thomas Jefferson, who wrote that when at someone's else's table, out of common sense and respect to the chef, he never salted food before tasting it...after seeing my pasta arrive, BT asked me if I wanted some grated cheese on it, to which I replied, ""I'll let you know after I taste it.""   The wine.  Lupa sells only sparkling wine by the glass.  All ofher wines come in a small carrafe and it seems that I got a good 2.5 glasses out of it.  I ordered the Lachryma Christi Monte Alberdino, a very nice wine, indeed.  Trouble was, I never drink that much at lunch, and who wants to waste wine?  It was just too much, which would not be a criticism at dinner.  If I ever go there again, I will order a beer, thank you very much.  Oh...when i asked the waiter what grape the delicious wine came from, he kind of panicked.  i heard him nervously ask another member of the wait staff, who kind of freaked out about it.  So, while they were coming up short, I just Googled it and showed the BT the answer.  Today's BT should know how to Google such questions and make it a moment of shared interest with the customer.  It is corda di volpe, wolf's tail.  Va bene? From what I could feel and ascertain from the faces during a conversation between the BT and what looked like the manager, all was not well in Lupa that day. No one looked happy or content and/or eager to please.  I hope I am right, because I don't want to think that this was normal service.   You might think I am a finicky restaurant goer.  I am not, really, but when i pay $65 for lunch, I want to feel welcomed and to be treated with good service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
The beer selection is good.  But really? $9 average price for bottled beer?   That is pretty over the top.  Food is ok and not overpriced but I just cannot get past $9 for a 12 ounce beer (range is 7-12).

"Small, cozy place, but very good find if you're in the South Street Seaport area. Went here today with a couple of coworkers for a quick lunch. We started out with an order of the artichoke dip, which was creamy, melty and delicious. It barely tasted like artichoke, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. One of my coworkers and I got the roast pork sandwich, which comes with melted Swiss, avocado and some spicy pepper mix. The flavors worked very well with each other, resulting in a tasty, satisfying sammie. I had the potato salad as a side dish, which wasn't anything to call home about; my coworkers mac and cheese side looked amazing though. The other coworker got one of the quiche and salad specials, which looks great for anybody trying to stay on the lighter side. That pork sandwich might become a habit soon...","[1.0, 0.0]"

Please fix this so we can keep coming back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Every time I go to the Lemon Ice Kind of Carona, or the farmer's market at the Hall of Science, I think I want to go there.  Today we stopped. Took a while to get the food, but I guess fresh can't be rushed, right?  I had the broccoli and cheese, plantain and mozzarella cheese, and I passed on the meat ones.  I liked them both very much.  The hot sauce is unique and interesting, I liked it. Cori V said:  The hot sauce wasn't very hot and they didn't give you enough.  The organic one was good, the crust was good, filling was chorizo and potato.  She wasn't crazy about the plantain and mozzarella.  She wasn't impressed with the pork one.  The broccoli and cheese was probably the best she's ever had.  Cori says the women who work there are really sweet.  They have a lot of variety. Inside they have 2 tables and a bar, so it's cozy, 10 total seats.  It was nice and cold in there on a hot day.  The kitchen is huge.  You can buy them premade, and cook them, and put them in your freezer.  You can also buy them cooked and put them in your microwave. So I have this crazy vegetarian struggle.  On the one hand, I feel there are three reasons to not eat meat.  One is that animals are subjects with feelings and it sucks to be raised for food for the dominant species (ethical & spiritual).  There are many books that chart the parallels between sexual abuse and meat eating, slavery and meat eating.  Things I'm against.  Meat takes up more resources, I don't want to burn down the rainforest for cheap burgers (environmental).  I am over weight, and cutting out food options doesn't make me lose weight, but in the end, I think vegetarian is healthier than carnivore (nutritional).  On the other hand, I don't really feel like going to a new restaurant and restricting myself.  I think the best argument for meat eating is, ""I want to and I can.""  After that, there's really nothing to say.  But I'm not in control of myself.  Today I won the vegetarian struggle (in part because the vegetarian ones were good).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is UNBELIEVABLE. True authentic mediterranean cuisine for incredible prices. The portions are huge and everything on the menu is delicious. I have been coming here for some years now and I think I've tried everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed. The place is unpretentious, friendly, romantic and fun. I came with a date the other night and we had the best time. The wine was delicious and we shared almost 15 appetizers and when the bill came I literally thought they had calculated it wrong because it was so inexpensive. This place used to be a hidden treasure, tucked away in China town, and now people are starting to appreciate what is going on there. A true gem and not to be missed. Brunch is incredible and you can have breakfast and coffee for under 10 bucks. The staff is attentive and fun.

But when we get the bill and say that they placed a 22% gratuity on the bill, we were fathomed on why they would do that. We asked the manager and he gave us an answer saying that we reserved through someone...so 2% to that person...nope i don't think you dictate on the amount of gratuity you take when your service is horrible.

"This review is so overdue... Like months... But I did write most of that months ago too, and it has been sitting in my draft folder. For reference, here's what I had: Fish and chips Soshitos Cucumber soup Bones slugs and hominy I'd go back for the food and the value but may not because due to the service, which was so comically absent. Not that funny really. It was really the most poorly organized service I've experienced in a long time. Never were offered to order another round of drinks, I did anyway, and 15 minutes later the server returned to tell me they didn't have the beer I ordered. In retrospect 15 minutes is nothing: we waited about a half hour after our entrees were cleared before anyone offered us dessert. (They really don't have dessert.) The signature fish and chips was good, but not cheap for what it was, not the best thing ever by any means. Most of the dishes were just ok. This shishitos were good, but the only thing special about them was the salts they serve them witth and they didn't justify the price. Ultimately, if I lived close by, I may return, but it really wasn't worth a trip.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This noodle bistro is cool for ambiance, but not the best for food.   The wait to be seated was easily soaked up by an ice cold Sapporo and my warm company at the bar.   If you are a small party (2), they seat you side by side with strangers on long benches.  Not private, but it's a ramen house after all.   For a minuscule portion of noodles and only enough pork to be bowl decoration, the price is laughably insulting.  One has to purchase a separate dish of extra noodles ($2) and they come out cold, stuck together, and much later than your  original bowl.  The noodles are unusually thin for fresh ramen and contributes to their lack of texture.  A bit too soft, like they have been sitting in soup a little too long.  Speaking of soup, notice how no one mentions much about the soup/broth?  Enough said.  Or perhaps all Yelpers mother's taught them well: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. Although nearby Minca's is smaller and less fancy, it's a superior bowl of ramen and you'll probably be seated by yourselves so you won't be speaking to your date while some stranger is putting on lipstick across from you =P","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to Freemans a hand-full of times now and have always had an incredible experience. You'd think that people would pass it up, searching for a cute spot and passing the alleyway over and over. We did the first time. I'm a sucker for their aesthetic--hunting lodge meets Brooklyn meets my scary taxidermist uncle (OK I don't have an uncle who stuffs his kill, but I wish I did). Our devils on horseback were delicious, as was the waffle special (which we ordered for the table), but the bloody wasn't spicy and the French 75 barely had any champagne in it. Our waiter could not have been sweeter and more attentive (although I accidentally spilled scalding hot coffee on him). My inner fat kid pointed to the pulled pork sandwich, which was the winner of the day! The pickled veggies and lack of sauce to mask the perfectly prepared meat was the best combination at the table. I found myself finishing the entire thing, although so full I thought my button would pop. We were so cozy by the end, I asked our waiter if I could take a nap in the corner under the antlers...he said no. I'll forgive that and give them 4 stars anyhow.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The waitress  (Zoey)  was so occupy with her co-workers she never came back to the table once after taking our order, we had to get up twice and have the busboy bring us our food , coffee and check.  We are in the industry as owners of 5 different restaurants, the chair I was sitting on was so old and weak , the leg broke on it , sending me crashing to the ground, the staff looked over and did not even come over to see if I was ok,  disgraceful. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone , the lack of pride and service is inexcusable. All the hype of what this restaurant is suppose to be , is false.  Will never go back, the way Penelope is managed , and the staff on hand , it is amazing that they are still in business.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I really feel this place is overhyped. TimeOut NY listed this under their $15 or less cheap eats & it has two dollar signs at Yelp, but you will need to spend over $45 to feel full. Everything is tiny & not necessarily delicious. Okay - decor is cute. It feels kind of old country but cuter. My waitress wore some kind of bandana over her hair like a young milk maid who should be dancing in the meadows with moutains for a backdrop, a la The Sound of Music. Sweet touch, I liked it. But when I say everything is tiny... I mean it. The tables, the seats, even the entire menu was maybe a bit larger than a postcard. I'm petite at 5'3"" & around 100lbs, if the tables next to us were filled, I wouldve felt far too confined. When all our dishes came out, we had to use the empty table next to us as well, b/c they wouldn't all fit on one tiny table. The food...is lackluster. We ordered a glass of champagne each, I had the Une Cerise with sour cherries & my friend had the Kir Royale; for $12 a glass, not worth it. If you want to try it, I'd say the Une Cerise over the Kir Royale b/c the cherries were good. I ordered the Brandade (salt cod with garlic) & the octopus salad, $10/ea. I wish I knew that brandade is whipped cod, I expected actual fish but got a small pot of what looked & tasted like light mashed potatoes. Not that it was inedible, just not what I was expecting & not very filling either. The octopus salad was very flavorful but they overdid it with the olives & dressing. I love olives but the overall dish was far too salty. I only picked at the octopus legs, as eating it was the rest of the salad made it overwhelming. My friend ordered 3 dishes from the back of the menu, which is the formages/charcuterie choice of 3.The one dish I really recommend is the oxtail, it was tender and perfectly tasty. She also ordered the spiced pork & goose (or duck? I forget) & the rabbit confit. These dishes were the least liked. One came out in a small pot like the brandade & the other was on a small plate between slices of bread. Both had really poor texture, as if they tried to make it into chunky baby food. Pass. Oh & all the bread they serve is really hard & crunchy, which I didn't like. Dessert - their saving grace. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dense and sweet, the whipped cream on top is airy & light. My friend had some kind of apple pie or tart, which was also pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again for a full meal, b/c it just wasn't worth ~$50 for enough mediocre pots of food to get me SORT OF full. Maybe I'd drop by again for some dessert & coffee.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I usually write much more detailed and elaborate reviews but I'm going to keep this one short and sweet, just like BarBossa and the time I spent in it.  Went here with two lovely girlfriends prior to a concert/open bar @ the John Varvatos store on Bowery.  My two girlfriends were waiting for me at the tiny little bar area and we were seated immediately.  One of the first things that I noticed was how small the resto is; we're talking miniature (I think my apartment's kitchen and living room combo is bigger than the entire bar and front room of the place).  However, I was comfortable in my little seat and there is another big picnic-type table in the back past the kitchens, near the bathrooms (which, FYI, don't have a mirror). Food was good.  I had the tomato and basil bruschetta and I got the pao de queijo basket to share with the girls.  Both were very tasty.  My friends each got a dessert (the Guinness cake and the Romeo, Julieta and the Lover), each of which I took a bite at their insistence.  The Guinness cake basically tasted like a regular chocolate cake, albeit rich, and the RJL, which looked like three little blobs on a plate (to put it bluntly), was pretty good - especially when a touch of all three was combined on a fork. Service was great.  Our waitress was absolutely lovely - very sweet and attentive.  Drinks did take a bit but that wasn't her fault at all; said drinks were very strong, so much so that I wouldn't describe as tasty (don't get me wrong, everyone loves a strong pour but a mojito shouldn't taste like rum poured in a cup with just a hint of mint). Definitely would go again if I'm in the area but I don't think I'd make a special trip just to go there!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I pass this place every day after work and went in for happy hour that began at 4pm. Got there, saw a wheel and spun!

Was told we couldn't order from dinner menu till after 5 because kitchen crew was on break but we could order from happy hour menu. We started with dry flavorless chicken meatballs and sauteed mushrooms and was onto our 3rd glass of wine before we able to finally order the BJ burger which was served with chopsticks??? Service was really crappy from 4pm all the way till we got our bill at 8. It was confusing as to who was servicing our table, one person took food orders, another one took drink orders then they disappear and then they switched it up on us.

When I moved from LA to NYC I was psyched to eat lots of pizza, but bummed I would be missing out on the west coast's Japanese food. I love Izakayas, but had to say a sad farewell to my usual haunt in LA. However, I am happy to report that I have discovered a different, but equally delicious Izakaya in TriBeCa. Zutto is a modern take on a traditional izakaya, mixing together korean and japanese flavors in a delicious American soup. Speaking of soup (wink) Zutto's ramen is amazing! I know I'm not the first to mention it, but the ramen here is ridonkulous! Wifey and I tried the seafood and the tonkotsu hokkaido classic ramens. Both were meals unto themselves, very filling, hearty and full of depth. Plus, the seafood one had a head-on prawn (one of my favorite things to rip apart and devour during a meal). I'm a glutton, so I of course ordered more food and went for the kobe beef and pork belly hirata buns. First of all 3 buns per order made me very happy. The kobe beef bun is Zutto's version of a burger, and now one of my favorite alternative burgers in the city. The pork belly was savory and sweet and tasty. I had to fight wifey for the last one. The beer selection here looks darn good, so I'll be back for drinks and more eats. But next time I'll need to bring more friends so I can steal their food, ugh I mean, sample more of the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Woorijip brims with a myriad of freshy, inexpensive, tasty Korean dishes; available hot and fast. I figured this place would be really good and authentic since almost every person in the restaurant was Korean. Huge selection of finger food to eat with a good amount of different kinds of soju, sake, and beer as well as yummy korean drinks. Food I tried and loved: Spicy noodles Bulgogi Mook/Acorn Jelly (MY FAV BANCHAN OF ALL TIME!) Kimchee fried rice. The atmosphere isn't anything to brag about, but this place is for the cheap good food, not the decor. Definitely come here if you need a quick bite of good food to grab.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been going to di fara's for as long as I can remember and nothing has changed except for additions of di fara's daughter helping out the front.  The pizza is a perfectly made thin crust pie with just the right amount of sauce, cheese and basil proportions.  Maybe seeing Mr. DiFara make it makes the pizza taste better?  Some type of visual tastebuds?  I don't know but I love it!  The wait can sometimes be long but watching a family run pizzaria is facinating.  Definitely worth the trip!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've had my eye on this space since last summer b/c I'm always interested in supporting vegan enterprises.  The dining room is composed of 4 large community tables which are a means for encouraging people to interact. It seems that they really want this to be a melting pot much the way that Brooklyn is. Two Brooklyn Bridge like arches separate the dining room from the open kitchen. Perhaps the lighting from the kitchen can be toned down a touch so as not to glare into the dining room. It was nice to see that they didn't use the standard florescent tube fixtures in the kitchen. Rather, they used individual stemmed lights suspended from the high ceiling. Nearly one whole wall in the dining room is covered in an artistic rendition of the stars & stripes (US flag) & a giant thrown-like chair graces the wall at one end of the room.  Each place setting is equipped w/ a drawer that contains flatware and napkins. A really nice touch. Two very large unusual speakers (everything is unusual; by the way) pump out hip hop music but not too loud to be in the way. To be fair, I was probably the 3rd or 4th customer to eat here. We shared some conversation w/ the one other person at our table who was interested in what we had ordered.  We started w/ the fennel & sage saucisson which was served w/ aioli & whole grain toast. This sausage is a home run; full flavored & perfect texture. The salad of baby lettuces w/ Sherry vinaigrette was light, well dressed & garnished w/ watermelon radish. For entrees, we ordered the Iron Man ""MOB"" & the Belly Charmer ""MOB."" MOB stands for  Maimonide Of Brooklyn (in case you hadn't guessed). All the entrees are served in a Brooklyn Bridge arch shaped bread-like tart shell that arrive to the table on a custom made cast aluminum tray that perfectly cradles the concoction. If that's not a mouth full, read on! The Belly Charmer consisted of tagine of eggplant, zucchini, carrot, Moroccan spices, pistachio, mint & cilantro. Personally, I would have preferred if the eggplant had been cooked much more (crispy & creamy) but it was cooked through. The flavors were balanced & the pistachios added just the right accent. The Iron Man was our favorite of the two entrees. It too is served in the bread shell (as are all of the entrees). It consisted of shiitake mushrooms (nicely browned), sauteed kale, horseradish aioli & parsley. The aioli was the perfect balance to the nutty shiitakes. These entrees are almost like getting a large designer slice of pizza made w/ healthful ingredients. I might suggest that they offer a gluten-free option once they get settled. We also sampled their olive oil roasted yucca fries. They were nice & crispy and toothsome as you would expect from yucca. We were pleased to have been offered some spicy ketchup that they had been experimenting with. It definitely rounded out the fries. Although we only drank sparkling water, it was nice to see that they offered fresh fruit juices as well as Fizzy Lizzy sparkling fruit drinks. The waitstaff is warm & eager to please. Nobody was beyond answering questions & are on their way to knowing the in & outs of the menu. The menu is very reasonably priced & accessible to many. I believe that this is their intention. Two of us had everything that I mentioned & spent $41.00 including a 20% tip.  I'm confident that they are off to a great start & will win the hearts of Brooklynites & non-Brooklynites alike in no time. I'll be back to eat my way through the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I just recently dined here last Thursday. Our dinner wait staff was very kind and the food was good. The mussels appetizer was perfect and the turkey burger was a nice finish. I would like to say that the upstairs bar service was downright rude and displayed poor craftsmanship when preparing my drink. A gin and tonic is not a hard drink to make, especially when it's only two ingredients; however, this particular afternoon proved challenging for my bartender. Upon greeting me with a casual ""what do you want?"", he proceeded to cram all of the ice in his rack into my improperly procured high-ball glass while completely washing out the flavor of the top-shelf liquor I had implicitly ordered with less ice and more fruit. Cafeteria your food is good, but like any restauranteur would prefer--check your attitude at the door--in this case, at the bar. I recommend this place for small groups on a quiet afternoon or spring evening. Don't get there too late because its poppy and crowded--but if you get a seat, you will not be disappointed by the food in the least bit.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"An intimate space, eating here makes you feel like you're a guest in someone's home. There are only about twelve tables so it's a squeeze, and apparently reservations are hard to come by. I walk by this restaurant all the time, and no matter what day of the week it is, there are people inside. A woman who I think must have been the owner was smiley and nice. She brought out complimentary appetizers- tiny goblets of potato-leek soup and also potato croquettes- which we were pleasantly surprised by. It was fun to have a taste of something new. Our waiter was really nice, and service was wonderful. The menu was a bit pricey, and the food was typical American fare but it was prepared very well. We got an appetizer of grilled squid stuffed with shrimp, which was very good. For my meal, I had slow-roasted duck breast that came with spinach on the side. It was tender, juicy, and very tasty. I think this is a nice place for simple, well-prepared American fare. Because of the price, it's not somewhere I'd go regularly, but for a low-key fine dining experience it's probably one of the best options on Smith Street. Definitely worth trying.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I used to love this restaurant and would go back there every now and then until I was treated very rudely 2 weeks ago.   As you may already know (or maybe not) that this restaurant has a strict policy that they will not seat you until everyone arrives.  I thought I was having lunch by myself on 8/13/08 around 2:15pm, so I asked for a table for one as I approached the host.  I ordered as soon as I sat down.  The waiter brought over the bread and water.  Shortly after, my friend called and decided to join me for lunch.  I figured I should informed the host.  I'd like to point out the fact that there were at least 8-10 tables available at that time and it was 2:20 in the afternoon (which was passed prime lunch time), and there was no one waiting for a table.  In addition, whether if it's party of one or two still uses only 1 table.  I informed the host and his response was: ""We cannot seat you until all parties arrive"".  Then, I responded: ""Yes, I understand that but I had already ordered.  Do you want me to stand outside while my pasta is sitting on the table nice and cold?  And besides, my friend is only 5 mins away from here"".  He gave me that look as if I didn't understand the restaurant policy and pointed at the sign where it says ""WE CANNOT SEAT YOU UNTIL ALL PARTIES ARRIVE"".   Shortly after, my friend arrived and she asked the host for a menu.  The host did not give her a menu and informed her that she cannot sit at the same table as me because I told him that I was eating by myself previously.  The host also informed my friend that if she wants to eat at this restaurant, she'd have to sit at a different table by herself. I can understand how they wouldn't want me to hold up a table if it was prime lunch/dinner time and there were people waiting for a table, but it was like 2:20 in the afternoon and no one was waiting for a table.   The staffs at this restaurant obviously do not understand customer retention.  They just want to profit off of you and not care about your satisfaction.  This is just POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! The food and price are good at this restaurant but the service is horrible.  They treat their customers like you're going to rob their place.  They are also very stingy with providing you small plates for bread.  All in all, if you just want to eat and not care about the service then give this restaurant a try, but if you value service in addition to quality of food then definitely try a different restaurant (SINCE THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN NYC).  I'd recommend Angel's Ristorante located on 1st Avenue between E62nd and E63rd Street (angelsnyc.com/index.htm).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is THE Grimaldi's as Patsy is back. The wait to get in was bearable even at 30 mins. In spite of the packed house the service was great. I wasn't sure of which craft beer to order so the waiter kindly brought over a sampler of 3 bers gratis. The arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts was delicious. Maybe a bit small for the price ($12) so we ordered two. No problem we were here for the pizza anyway. Went with the Margarita in a purist attempt to sample. Without a doubt the Margarita pizza was literally a slice of heaven. Sauce was fresh and robust, cheese was not greasy but stringy and yummy, and the crust was just the right thickness with almost a buttery note to it. Pizza perfection! To end our meal we tried the cannoli. Without hesitation these were some of the best we've ever had. Shells were fresh and the filling was light and airy. Not the typical heavy filling.

"I came here last weekend hoping for a cozy and delicious brunch, and that is exactly what I got! The cozy wooden booths and white brick walls filled the large restaurant with warmth and comfort. Each table was lined with two tall poles in which we hung our coats. We were treated with care and friendliness from the waitress and could feel the happiness from other employees while they worked. For starters, we ordered the breakfast bread basket, which displayed three distinct types of bread with sweet and tangy creams and jams. The Smithfield Mangalista was a pleasant twist on the usual eggs benedict. The eggs cracked open perfectly over the flavorful and hearty potato pancakes underneath. The French Toast was deliciously sweet and satisfying. I wish I was more of a Bloody Mary fan, because they had a beautifully displayed Bloody Mary bar that looked pretty exciting. The bathrooms are worth checking out. The staircase will take you down to a peaceful room with a large central bowl filled with bright red potpourri. Turn, and you will be led to your choice of your own private bathroom suite. I've seen restaurants smaller than the space they have for this.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Music wasn't loud (ie. could actually hear the person across the table) The wait staff was extremely helpful and courteous. As soon as we sat down, we were each individually given an in-house made bread roll 2 of us had the Buttermilk fried chicken (not going say much other than, TRY IT) 1 of us had the Lemon Pappardelle The chicken batter was rich tasting, and crunchy. The chicken itself was moist. The cornbread was moist, and salad was great. I think the entrees are a wee bit on the pricey side for what you get, not extremely overpriced, jus a wee bit, especially since the portions are pretty big. Right before leaving we were given individually wrapped homemade oatmeal choc chip cookies, which were yum yum. Not sure it's a place I'll be coming over and over. Don't want to break the bank.

"BORICUA!!!! no, no wait.  boqueria.  i've been living in new york for too long.   this always happens to me.  i go somewhere with a good wine list, find something that i like, then proceed to drink so much of it that i can't remember what it was.  oh well, just one of those things. that said, i'm a sucker for tapas.  something about telling everyone you ate some tasty morsels at a tapas (slurr word here) bar really makes me giggle.  now if i could only find one that served venetian nipples.....

"Finally got to try Cafe Habana after hearing all the hype from my friends who have gone. It was probably a mistake to go for bunch on a Saturday afternoon but I was only in NYC for a couple of days so I didn't have much of a choice. Not to mention it was a gorgeous day and there was a 45 min wait when we got there. It's in a pretty cramped space so we got seated in the back by the restrooms, but let's talk about the food! Mexican-style grilled corn ($3.75 for 2) - I died and went to grilled corn heaven...this was sooo mouth-watering and delicious! I'm not sure what kind of cheese was on it but that was my favorite part. The chili powder added some spice and the optional lime juice just made it perfect! I think we stopped talking altogether when the corn came. =P (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2…) chilaquiles verdes con pollo ($7.95) - This was my main dish since it seemed intriguing. It was a shredded tortilla and chicken casserole cooked in green salsa and topped with cheese. It also came with a side of beans which I wasn't expecting. One bite and I was hooked! The spiciness of the salsa, the mushiness of the tortilla, the flavor from the chicken and cheese just meshed together really well. I kept eating it even though I was full since it was so addicting. (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2…) cuban sandwich ($8.95) - Apparently one of their renowned items, it disappointed a bit. It's just a roast pork and ham sandwich with cheese and pickles on a roll. I sampled this from my bf...the pork was a little dry and wasn't anything too exciting in terms of flavor. It was a pretty hefty-sized sandwich though. (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2…) fried plantains ($2.95) - This wasn't on the brunch menu but you can still order it. It added some variety to our meal and tasted like how fried plantains should...browned and slightly crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. I kept going back for more...yum! (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2…) Now, on to the service. This is where they lost a star from me. The hostess was running around being a waitress when she should have been greeting customers and taking names down at the door. It just ended up very chaotic and unorganized...I think we also waited longer for a table than we were supposed to. When we finally were seated, our waitress was in a bad mood since we got a bit of an attitude from her whenever we asked for something. At the same time, I could understand the hustle and bustle of working there. Either way, the food here is amazing and don't leave without getting some corn! It's not too expensive either and will keep you begging for more, like it did with me. P.S. There is the Habana To-Go takeout spot right next door if you don't need to sit down. Also, the Stoli screwdriver ($5.25) will get you tipsy for cheap!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Emporio used to be my favorite go to spot for brunch, lunch, dinner or any special occasion. The food is delicious but to me service and food must work in conjunction. Yesterday,  Wednesday May 15 at around 1:00pm, I decided to treat my mother for lunch at Emporio. We entered the restaurant and were rudely greeted by the server or hostess., not quite sure of her position.  We thought that she might have been having a bad day so we didn't pay much attention to it. With more than half the restaurant empty, she gave us the worst table right next to the door. When I politely requested another table,  she again gave me a rude attitude telling me that it was either that table or the bar. To be honest, it is not my mothers fault or my to be Hispanic. We live in a city which has become very diverse and staff at public restaurants should not judge people because of their looks. I have worked in the restaurant business as well and know how to tip, if that was the issue. Management should definitely educate their staff on not judging other based on looks because you never know who might walk through that door. I am highly offended and will never recommend this place ever again because what this employee did was just unacceptable.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"One star loss for the rude service and two more for the ""eh"" food. The broth only tasted good with the two slices of pork that we were given. When those were gone so was all the flavor and then the broth was mostly just water. Watched as the chef grabbed pre-packaged noodles from a cardboard box and throw it in some water which turned out to be extremely chewy. The menu doesn't explain what's in the food. Waitress kept plopping water into the cups and spilling it all over. The bill came to 24 and the tip section read 2 dollars. We paid the 26. As we were leaving she comes up to us and tells us we haven't given her a tip. States the two dollars were tax and as my bf pulls out his wallet she requests a $4 tip which may be a reasonable tip for someone who wasn't spilling water everywhere and forgetting the sides we asked for. Tried to eat ramen somewhere that wasn't Totto Ramen. Went in expecting Totto Ramen quality and we were of course let down. Our bad...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I don't understand why everyone makes such a big deal about this place. I came here for a late breakfast/early lunch with my girlfriend...WHAT A MISTAKE. You would think that ordering something as simple as pancakes with eggs and bacon and a cheeseburger deluxe would taste fine but NOOOOOO. To start off, my girlfriend's pankcakes were gooey on the inside and burnt on the outside, the eggs were cold and the bacon tasted like cardboard....not to mention that's pretty much what it looked like. I asked for my cheeseburger to be cooked medium, and got something that looked like a piece of charcoal. The lettuce was brown around the edges and the french fries were soggy...they must have been sitting out for too long. I would rather eat at McDonald's. The server was so unfriendly and I felt like I was bothering him when I asked for a refill on my soda, which by they way, he never came by to see if we needed anything else. To top of this terribleeeee expirience, this place is so closterphobic and they don't accept credit cards....ummm, last time i checked the year was 2012. If youre really looking for a good dining expirience try hitting some other place up in the neighborhood because this place blows.","[0.0, 1.0]"
After reading all the great reviews on Yelp. I decided to try this restaurant with my best friend last week. This place is absolutely amazing and satisfying. You walk into the dining room and it is another world.  Time flows slowly and leisurely.  The glass of Bordeaux blanc recommended by the staff set the wonderful tone.  The bread was perfect.  I had Porcini Flan to start with.  The crab was so tender and the dashi broth went perfectly with the crab.  I could not have enough of it.  For entree I had the duck.  It was the most tender and soft duck I ever had.  The source was refined and I loved the hint of yuzu flavor.  After the entree was complimentary ricotta cheese sorbet in melon juice.  The combination of the cold and mild ricotta cheese and the room temperature melon juice was absolutely heavenly.  Everything about the meal was simply perfect. It was definitely one of the best dining experience.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"After countless bowls of noodles, ma la tangs, and cold dish take outs, I finally got around to the hot pot that I salivate at every time I see someone else eating here. $20/person all you can eat includes drinks and cold dishes from their front display. Not a bad deal since all those plates of raw deliciousness can add up. They had a decent selection of your meats, veggies, tofus, starches, etc. Maybe 30 choices total. Not much seafood or any creative selections of pot base other than spicy and non-spicy though. I never care much for the non-spicy (boring!), but that fountain of magical spicy liquid always causes me to again, salivate on sight. Unfortunately, the taste itself, this time, was disappointing. Just lacked that ma-la spicy punch that should permeate anything that is cooked in the broth. Their sauce table located in the back had the standard stripped down fare, but the barbecue was extremely greasy. Combined with the overabundant oil sitting on top of the spicy pot base, my entire meal seemed to be coated with the stuff. Still, the pricing makes this a good deal for a first hot pot experience, as it allowed my roommate to explore this side of Chinese cuisine that few lao wei are bold enough to venture into, without having to worry about racking up the bill with things she would hate. Their cold dishes (fu qi fei pian, pig ears, seaweed, tofu noodles, shredded potatoes, plus 4 or so more) are all amazing and appropriately doused in fresh garlic. Probably won't be back for the hot pot, but will definitely be squeezing in as many bowls of noodles as possible before moving away from the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What is going on here?  Despite having a reservation, waited 40 + minutes to be seated for brunch. Absolutely nuts with more than 50-60 people waiting outside on the sidewalk.  They double booked all reservations was one of the stories?  It was a big hot sardine can  disorganized mess with no apology; no organization; no attempt to make it better; no management.   Regardless of what is being served - even if $100 bills - who cares.  This was inexcusable. If you like a stuffy warm disoragnized mess and like to wait for a very long time even with a reservation and have crowds of people hanging over your table and deafening noise - then this is your place.  if you like to dine (or even eat) skip it.  One of the worst restaurant experiences ever.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I recently has dinner here with a good friend and had a really bad experience. The food is okay, but a good restaurant is not just about the food. The waitress was really bad and really unprofessional. This place just opened a few months ago, so I'm guessing they'd assume each person is a first time customer. I said I hadn't been here before and the waitress said ""Oh, really?"" I was surprised by her, well, surprise, but also by the unfriendliness of it. I think something like, ""Welcome,"" or ""Glad you're joining us tonight"" would have been more appropriate. I'm not glad we spent money at this restaurant. It seems this waitress and my friend have a mutual friend in common, from college, from 5 yrs ago, and the waitress couldn't stop bothering us. We were having an important talk, some catch-up, and time without a stranger interrupting. She wasn't exactly asking if the food was good (not bad, but nothing I couldn't make at home), and she couldn't remember the daily specials. But she could remember all the good time at Yale and blah blah blah. I hate to say it, but I felt ignored and disrespected. My body language and frowns indicated I wasn't happy and instead of asking open ended questions, she continued to bother my friend (who didn't have as much of a problem with her), and she continued to assume that her behavior was alright. I realize I could have said something that night, to her or to the manager. I'm a little uptight, I have high standards for customer service because I also work in customer service, and I work my ass off, and I treat my visitors with respect, and so I guess I decided not to say anything, and let it go. Not sure why I changed my mind, though I went back a few days later to share my concerns. I spoke with a supervisor, though when I asked to speak with a supervisor, she said, ""I guessed that'd be me,"" so I'm not sure what that means. She listened attentively and seemed to agree that my standards of customer service...ya know, wanting respect and courtesy etc etc, are valid and should be in place. I also think this neighborhood, that I'm proud to live in, has high standards and deserves restaurants that meet and exceed those standards. This matters. I'm not spending my money just anywhere...and neither should you. The curiosity for a new place on Franklin ave, isn't reason enough to have dinner there. I appreciate the supervisor's time although I would have liked to speak with a manager. She said he was out. She wrote down my email address and I spelled it out for her, and no one has contacted me. I don't really care, but then why ask for my email address for someone to contact me? There are many options for good places in the neighborhood. I'm sure you already know of them & can decide for yourself where to have dinner. Make a smart decision.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Got their budae-jjigae for $8.95 lunch.  The soup came in a quart, rice in a styrofoam pint container and got 2 small side dishes.  Food portion is big and definitely was in a food coma afterwards.  The soup itself was very flavorful and spiced just right.  The rice was good, soft and somewhat sticky.  The side dishes were also very good.   All in all, great food at a good price.  I will be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A burger and taco joint in Chinatown definitely got my attention and had to try it.  The menu was simple and the prices unbeatable ($3.45 for a fish taco).  My husband had the Breakroom Burger, I the Fish Taco and we shared the Tempura Onion Rings.  I gave up eating beef but my husband found the burger perfectly cooked and juicy.  He felt it was comparable to a shake shack burger.  My fish taco had a large piece of fish which was unexpected given the price.  It was fresh, flaky and lightly battered, topped with a slice of avo, some red slaw and their yummy specialty sauce.  They gave two soft tacos and I only needed one.  The onion ring was battered perfectly and not oily.  A staff member suggested their lemon mint ice tea which was delicious.  I will def be back to try other items on the menu.  A big thumbs up!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My first visit was with tough customers: my parents, who had gotten the word from a waiter elsewhere in the neighborhood and had given it a try. Since they had enjoyed their first visit, I joined them the second time around. Food was outstanding; not a 'just okay' dish in the bunch. More noticeable, however, was the smart and artful way that the front of house is run. Our waiter took cocktail orders immediately, but as he was managing two large parties, another server picked up our table in a seamless fashion. Water glasses stayed filled, plates were cleared promptly, courses were never rushed. All of the little things were attended to, and that makes all the difference. Another visit last night confirmed the first impression. Basso 56 is a gem.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"On my way to Great Jones Cafe, I spotted so many cute sidewalk cafes and was tempted to go. My temptation grew once I walked into Great Jones Cafe to find a tiny place with no patio and scarce sunlight to enjoy the beautiful day while we brunched. However, with an open table and a rumbling tummy, I brushed my worries aside and instead sat down at a table for two, hoping the food would make up for it. Thankfully, it wasn't too bad and we were in and out within 40 minutes, free to enjoy the nice weather elsewhere. The brunch menu isn't big so it's best to scope it out beforehand to make sure you can find something appealing. That's what we did, so we wasted very little time once we got there deciding what we wanted. I went with the huevos rancheros with cornbread and home fries, while my boyfriend went with the biscuits topped with scrambled eggs and gravy, with cheddar grits on the side. Not in the mood for a drink quite yet, we welcomed the complimentary (and pulpy) OJ. The food came out fast and was quite satisfying, especially with the addition of the super spicy hot sauce already waiting on the table. Our dishes looked so good, the chicks eating at the table next (ok, uncomfortably close) to us asked what we were having and got the same thing. For about $15 a plate, it was a pretty good brunch deal in our eyes as we left full and relatively happy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The ambience, service, food, and wine selection of Amélie are top-notch. Made a 9pm reservation for 3 people. They didn't have a table for us when we got there, but the staff made up for this by giving us each a flute of champagne. (I think we got the better end of the deal!) Once seated, my friends and I decided to share a cheese plate, along with a bottle of wine. The cheese plate came with three different types of cheese, honey, jam, grapes, and delicious bread. As soon as we went through the first basket, the waiter brought out a second. After the cheese, I ordered the salad Amélie, and another friend had the octopus salad. Both were delicious. Also, the wine was delicious! We shared a delicious bottle of cabernet-sauvignon. It disappeared all-to-quickly. I wouldn't recommend coming here with any more than a group of 4. It's a very intimate setting. Everything is in tones of red, with romantic mood lighting. Finally, the waiter brought the bill in tucked into a French novel. Was a cute way to add to the ambiance. Can't wait to go back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I live only a couple blocks from the place, and although my friends and I are regular Manhattan diners, it's such a pleasure having a place like this so close to home.  I've taken my out-of-town family and friends here on a couple occasions and they always have a great experience.   The atmosphere is great... I don't think there's a single object in the place that is younger 50 years old.  Everyone I take here for the first time say they feel like they're in a movie or something (think Gangs of NY meets Edward Scissor Hands, meets Amélie).  It's definitely got a vibe, but it doesn't feel like one of those super contrived atmospheres.  The music is always nice (though sometimes a bit too loud for conversation) and is complemented with the Subway noise overhead which gives it a real old-NY kind of feel.   Dishes to try:  I've been here for both brunch and dinner on numerous occasions.  For brunch, my roommate and I always share the grilled doughnuts to start out with cappuccinos, then the baked eggs in ham is a must.. so delicious.  For dinner, the seasonal artichoke with saffron aioli is usually amazing (though I did once have a tough artichoke there), herbed chicken is great, as well as the mac and cheese.  For dessert the bread budding with toffee drizzle (i think that's right?) is wonderful! Service is usually pretty good.. friendly, not too in your face, but sometimes a little absent.  It's not one of those places to go to if you're in a rush.  But, if you're looking for a delicious, slow dinner with some close friends, good music and cool atmosphere, I highly recommend it!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I always order the same thing - naked (no bread) steak burrito with mushrooms and avocado. I come from a family of chefs and am extremely picky. All the ingredients are of gourmet quality.

The mushrooms are definitely gourmet with a smoky flavor you know they just came off the grill. Avacodos are fresh and taste as if they were just cut. No advanced prep and microwaving here.

"This is one of my favorite places to come to for lunch, brunch and dinner, whether you are buying art at the near galleries or just shopping for cute clothes at Comme des Garçons and Balenciaga. A nice girl deserves a very nice meal! Brunch: It gets a little loud when it is busy, and you should definitely make a reservation ahead of time, or waste your time waiting like the little people who woke up a little too late... I love all the organic and market offerings the always carry. The brunch cocktails are A+, the skillet eggs are always good. watch out for the Huevos rancheros portion, it tends to be too filling and large, not a bad thing but, a lady should eat like a lady. Lunch: Lovely, quieter, service is more streamlined, although i have never had an issue here with service, the wine list could use a little boost. The Chilled asparagus soup is phenomenal. Dinner: it can be romantic, upbeat or jovial. It depends on your company and how much you care about where you are sitting. There are opportunities for large parties too be too loud and too close to your table. Service is nice but you can see how busy the servers are as they clearly show it in their faces are describing specials... overall, it is still one of my top choices in the city when i'm in Chelsea.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Best soup dumplings I have ever had. Yes you have to eat with strangers but it is oddly not that awkward and not an environment where conversation is forced.

Biggest downside is the only alcohol they serve is imported Chinese beer and rice wine.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Maitre D refused to believe I had a reservation for lunchtime -- and kept interrupting me as I tried to give the name of the party I was there to meet.

The sushi was fresh, portions small and the slew of wait staff, while much better than maitre d, were intrusive and did constantly interrupt the flow of conversation. I am from the West Coast and used to fresh sushi, so am not willing to put up with this attitude for some fresh fish. I was wondering if they are chauvinistic towards women. There were two women behind me without reservations who only got slightly better treatment. When the Maitre D finally looked up my reservation, I was only able to say my party's first name -- then I got cut off and was then told there was no reservation under that name. I finally blurted out my party's last name, had to spell it for them, and they finally found the reservation. When I was finally shown to the table, they did not hang my coat, even though most of the other patrons were offered this option.

I didn't care but I'd be pissed since I hate banana bread pudding and it's so gross out, I wouldn't have walked back. Moving on to the food, the tater tots were delicious and my chicken club on multi grain toast with thick cuts of grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato. 'Twas delicious though the avocado on it was over ripe and definitely had the black spots on it everywhere - I eat that at home but, at a restaurant you'd think they would pay a little more attention to presentation. I'm also a stickler so hey. The side salad that comes with sandwiches instead of fries was so fresh and so green green. High five on that. Love, love, love the market sides concept. We went with the quinoa, tomato and feta salad the and the deep fried cheesy croutons. To be honest, they were both good but, nothing mind blowing though my friend thoroughly enjoyed both so, there you go.

"Cocoron offers up quite a variety of cold, hot and dipped soba dishes, as well as an assortment of homemade tofu appetizers and desserts. I really like the concept and don't mind the small tight space as long as their is not a long wait. This location is not as busy as the original, and you will have better luck in terms of wait time. The homemade silken tofu is very bland unless you douse it in soy sauce and seasoning, but it does have a really nice texture. I'm not a fan of the cold noodles, maybe I need to come in on an exceptionally hot day to enjoy these more?   The hot noodles haven't blown me away either, I think they tend to rely on bonito flakes and bacon to season up a lot of their dishes, so the vegetarian sobas & broths end up coming out VERY BLAND. I've had a lot of very flavorful, savory vegetarian broths, unfortunately cocoron is way off the mark for vegetarians. Also, with the portions being small and the fare being lighter, I tend to leave here HUNGRY, despite paying more than I am used to for soba. Like most of their portions, the desserts are tiny. I liked the coconut milk sago but it was small and light, and I didn't really feel like it was worth the price. The green tea affogato is amazing though and I would come back just for this, as well as to try the black sesame cheesecake & apricot panna cotta . All in all, if your date likes soba and is not a vegetarian, I think this could be a really cute casual date spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Both times I went there for brunch and had a bit of a wait but both times were not planned ahead of time and were without the luxury of a reservation.  However, I've left both times thoroughly satisfied with my experience and the food.  I might mention that both times I had the buttermilk pancakes and the spiced fries.  Lastly, I didn't foot the entire bill for both times so I have not felt the pricy edge. But moving on to the three dense buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon butter, and some sort of compote with caramelized bananas...  The middle of the last pancake was actually not cooked all the way through but the batter was delectable anyway.  Just sweet enough, creamy goodness.  I tried convincing my date that it was intentional on the cook's part.  Then I nibbled on some of the salad and the biscuit that came with the Cookshop Scramble and was amazed at how sweet the carrots(?) and radishes(?) were and how divinely savory the biscuit was.  I would've eaten all of it but alas, I couldn't even finish my 3rd pancake.  My coffee came out way later than my friend's OJ but our server assured us many times it was on its way without my having to remind her.  (Love the small metal cup that the milk comes in!)  Lastly, the spiced fries are a winner.  Normally I don't like mayo but I found myself dipping more into it than the ketchup, which tasted a bit too sharp with the spice on the fries. In general I love places that make everyday dishes with fresh ingredients and know how to add simple tweaks that redefine expectations.  Cookshop does just that.  On top of that, like several previous reviewers noted, the ambience of the place is refreshingly airy due to the high ceilings and the natural sunlight that easily filters through the floor-to-ceiling glass walls.  I haven't tried too many but so far, this would have to be my fav brunch spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was overjoyed to find cheap, delicious, authentic Mexican food within delivery range of my apartment in the East 90s.  The first time I ate there was on location, snagging of the 3-4 tables at this teeny tiny restaurant. They were clearly doing a brisk delivery business, but going there was fun. It's BYOB and four of us got a few things to share. Definitely try the Cemita (we got the spicy pork) which is a kind of Mexican sandwich. Outrageously delicious. We also tried the chicken enchiladas which were my 2nd favorite. The owner was in the back cooking, and his son came out to chat with us. The son was very proud of the enchiladas and the fresh salsas, which he personally made. His dad was responsible for the rest of the menu, made up of recipes he got from a cook friend and his mother. I can't wait to go back and eat my way through the menu!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We had greatly anticpated our evening at Scarpetta, but left disappointed.  Once seated we were met with a waiter (Russel) who didn't seem like he had the time of day for us.  In our party of 2, one of us wanted the Chef's tasting menu, we were told, with some degree of gruff, absolutely not, it's for the entire table or not at all.  Since I personally was the one not having it, I said, ""I am completely fine with enjoying my wine while he is served"", we were still told NO!  So, what I want you to take away from this is that we were told we could not order what we wanted!  UMMMM.  This, just by the way, is not our first experience in an upscale place, but unlike this place, other places we have enjoyed made us fill like we were their special guests for the evening, not here, we were made to fill uncomfortable.  There are too many options out there for great Italian, with great atmosphere and enjoyable service, so my recommendation would be to try another place, not Scarpetta!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I recently had lunch at this less than stellar establishment.  I have frequented just about every BBQ restaurant and steakhouse in the NYC and LI area so I had to check out Butcher Bar.  Butcher Bar was a terrible disappointment.  The portions, especially the sandwiches, are way too small for a BBQ spot.  The meat was chewy, flavorless and dry.  The BBQ sauces are not impressive and the bread was stale.  The prices are way too high for the small portions. I don't mind spending money on food, but the food better be good and the portions a decent size, especially for BBQ.  I would never go back and was still hungry at the end of the meal.  The patrons I went with were extremely disappointed as well.  There are many other BBQ options in Queens and NYC that are much better than this sinkhole.  If you're eating in the Astoria area, skip BBQ and walk down 30th Ave for some better restaurant choices.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I realize that most folks that watched Top Chef probably came here because of the owner/chef - Harold Dieterle. I didn't watch that season and didn't realize this was his restaurant until after I made the reservation and saw him leaving for the night. So, i guess you can say I'm way late to the party on this one... The restaurant itself is small, but charming. I would describe it as ""typical NYC size."" You aren't crammed in, but you aren't completely swimming with space. I usually do my research to find out what the popular/best dishes are and this was not different. I had planned to order the Duck meatballs and the artic char.  But instead went with the scallops and the duck breast -- per the waitresses recommendation. She was not wrong. The scallops were prepared well and the concord grape sauce was an unexpected delight. The duck was a large portion of sliced duck breast, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Overcooked meat, duck in particular, is a crime, so I'm glad they nailed it. My wife had the tasting of pumpkin, the vegetarian option. It wasn't off the charts, but it wasn't bad either. My only complaint or annoyance came when I ordered an old fashioned. They didn't have bulleit rye or bourbon, so I said they could just go with what they recommended. It turned out they used the most expensive variety (which was incredible) which made my drink about $16.50  -- and i had 2. I suppose this was my own doing, but they had overholt rye, which is tasty and not overpriced. I would definitely recommend this place, but not for the vegetarians. They really dont have much aside from the tasting of X platter -- now sweet potato.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I finally made it there, after trying twice. We went in for dinner on Tuesday, and I figured that it would be pretty mellow, but it was a mad house - the hostess announced that it would be an hour wait. We were ready for it and went to the bar where I felt I'm in a Times Square bar full of tourists. The drink was pretty good and the  hostess miraculously got a table for us within half an hour. We ordered lobster risotto, half chicken and duck confit. The risotto was delicious, but the chicken and duck were mediocre. They weren't bad, but I expected so much more. Maybe we got the wrong thing because every table around us got the seafood plate, and after reading the reviews it seems to be a great brunch spot. I expected more from a famous Balthazar, and kind of see why this place might be over hyped. The best part of the meal was dessert!

"WOW! My family and I went for dinner on a Monday at 6pm and there was a wait.. not a long one but we were surprised to see a constant flow of people coming in and waiting to be served.  The waiter came to the table for our orders pretty much as we sat, but graciously gave us a few extra minutes. Once the order was placed they brought out the Greek salad rather expeditiously...and I must say it was the best Greek salad EVER! They give you two huge blocks of feta cheese so that you could basically toss it in the salad yourself. We ordered three different dishes and they were all exquisite! The lemon potatoes were also yummy.. by the time the desert (which is on the house) came along we were completely stuffed but ate it anyway. The only thing that I would like to point out is that it is really loud and not the best place to hold a conversation.. truthfully I was stuffing my mouth the entire time so this was a none issue for me.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"PiO PiO! First of all, the name itself is freaking awesome. I'm not much of a Spanish speaker (so I'm not sure if Pio Pio means anything) but the restaurant title itself already give them a 1 star advantage! Anyway, an old friend of mine is interning in the city this summer so we decided to catch up. We both decided Hell's kitchen is the area we want to be in so after I did some research, I decide to try this spot out. (Hello, again the title is awesome and how many PERUVIAN food places there is in the city?!) When we first walked in, there's a pretty adorable younger hostess greeted us. They asked if we made reservation and we didn't. (#1 rule, always just make a reservation so you can make sure you have a nice table reserve for you!). Basically, all the tables are full and reserved, so we have to settle for high tops table by the bar instead. We reluctantly said yes since that's the only option and we honestly have no desire to look elsewhere. Plus we really wanted to eat something different! So we sat down and the high top table is really not that bad for a party of 2. Cute candle light and honestly we felt like we were on a cute date in Spain. (SO YES, CUTE DATE SPOT TOO.) We looked at the menu and most of the name are in Spanish but the waiter is nice enough to explain everything to us so it made the process of selection so much easier. Also, don't be scared by the pricing (for all you college, post grad students or just anyone who doesn't feel like spending more than 20 on a dinner), the entree they have is TOTALLY shareable. So we went with the standard Peruvian ""whole chicken"" and picked flavor rice as the sides. Since we were also getting drinks after dinner, we just had ice water instead. 10 - 15mins passed by and the food are already on our table! The wait is NOT long at all. So for all you HUNGRY diner, this place is great. They also gave us this green spicy sauce that will goes with the chicken. Once we had a piece of that Peruvian chicken in our mouth, we lost all sort of cuteness and DEVOURED the chicken. Yes, we ate the WHOLE chicken like a champ. It was THAT good. LITERALLY THE BEST CHICKEN I HAD IN AWHILE. And the flavor rice is just ICING ON THE CAKE. When you know the WHOLE CHICKEN is gone by the end of our dinner experience, you know it is a damn good meal. Plus we had a great time catching up too. So yea, amazing time. And the whole bill only come out to less than $25 for a meal of 2! So next time you are looking for a CUTE, GREAT, AFFORDABLE, TASTY, DIFFERENT dinner place in Hell's Kitchen. Look no further. I promise you it will be an amazing dining experience. Grab that $20 in your drawer and let's come out here for a feast with great friends or date. Hope this help guys! Happy dining!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The decor is modern as the Rchard Meirs builing that houses it, as is the cuisine. Had their fried chicken and it was sublime. My sashimi appetizer was excellent; fresh and tagny. The servie was as attentive to detail as the decor and the food. Most memorable of all was the rhubarb and lychee trifle which was unbelievably good - sadly a Special for only another week or so as apparently the chef insists on the freshest market ingredients.

"This restaurant definitely rates a very solid four stars.  My dinner partner and I actually walked in after a mix-up with a reservation at a nearby restaurant.  We didn't have a reservation, but were lucky enough to get seated right away.  The restaurant staff was friendly and attentive, and made the experience really enjoyable and fun.  We shared a salad that was deliciously prepared and generous.  The bread was good as well.  For entrees, I had the pasta dish of the day, which included shrimp.  It was delicious.  I actually asked the waitress to repeat what it was right before I ordered (she had told us the specials shortly after we sat down).  She obliged and I told her it was just to make my mouth water until its arrival because it sounded so good.  It was every bit as good in reality as it sounded.  My friend wanted a specific pasta dish, but really wanted some kind of protein on it.  The waitress was easily to accommodate the request to add Italian sausage.  We didn't have room for dessert, but several sounded tempting.  All in all, great food, great service, great atmosphere....a real little gem.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I dined at Locanda Verde for dinner last year and would have given it 3 stars at the time.  The service was horrible and my lamb was extremely fatty.  There were two things that made me want to give this hot spot another try: (1) the Sheep's Milk Ricotta and and (2) The amazing atmosphere.  The Sheep's Milk Ricotta is a five-star bread and spread starter.  The fond memories I have with it have stuck to my taste buds and never let me let go.  You can even say that their Sheep's Milk Ricotta and I have been in a serious long distance relationship.  Ok, you get the point. I dined at Locanda Verde for brunch this past Saturday with a girlfriend of mine.  Brunch completely whopped dinner in the ass and I would 100% recommend their brunch to anyone and everyone.  Again, I LOVED the atmosphere at this restaurant at dinner and i LOVED LOVED LOVED it even more at brunch.  I was very excited to try their brunch version of the Sheep's Milk Ricotta with truffle honey and burnt orange toast.  I took a slice of toasted bread that glistened with an orange glaze and spread a 2:1 ratio of the smooth and creamy Sheep's Milk Ricotta on top.  With one bite, I knew I wasn't going to put the toast down until it all went down my throat.  The Ricotta spread is just TO DIE FOR and the unique orange toast made it even more glorious!  We dug into this starter throughout our entire meal.   Onto le main course... I had the Uovo Modenese with cotechino hash, spinach and tomato hollandaise.  Every bite of this dish was rich and delicious- I couldn't have been more pleased with my choice.  Piling all the components of the meal onto toasted bread and biting into this pile of gold with egg yolk oozing down my chin was just the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  My friend ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and was very content as well. I'm so glad I gave Locanda Verde another try, and I will definitely be coming back for another brunch!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had the pleasure dining and exploring the brunch menu at Drunken Munkey NYC (DM) on the UES.  While this is far from my regular hood, I am definitely making this spot a regular pit stop for brunch and drinks.  I was with a group of friends, so we had the opportunity to sample almost all of their brunch menu along with some excellent libations to wash it all down.  We started with masala tea, infused with cardamom which was an excellent way to start the brunch.  We started with the classic chilli cheese toast which was excellent and instantly brought me back to my childhood when I used to look forward to this treat, now I get to have it in NYC!  We shared a bunch of entrees, the chilli cheese omlette, the lamb burger, the unda kaati roll, the pav bhaji burger and the butter chicken.  The sides of ""Bombay Aaloo"" and ""Cripsy Okra"" was a great change from the traditional brunch sides and we ended up ordering more of the crispy okra on the side.  We also ventured and got some desserts and the ""cricket"" rum ball and the carrot ""halwa"" were outstanding.  We got a second order of the Carrot ""halwa"".  In terms of taste and portion size, everything was top notch and I could not decide what I would get the next time I came to eat here!  The libation of choice for our table was an innovative take on the traditional Bloody Mary and an excellent multi ingredient and refreshing Punch.  The bar looks great and I look forward to being here to try their cocktail menu which was extensive and versatile.  The DM did not miss a beat despite their brand new brunch menu.  The staff was excellent with an attentive front of the house and a knowledgeable bar keep.  I could not recommend this place more and I wish them continued success and I expect to be back there very soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Small space commensurate with the vast majority of establishments in the (far) East Village.   Our group of four came here for dinner based on the accolades given to this chef duo's Miami restaurant, Yardbird.   The highlight of the experience was easily the service.  Each and every member of the waitstaff was extremely friendly, outgoing and very attentive. However, the food, although good, just did not measure up to the hype.   The cornbread served with clotted cream and apricot preserves was dry and flat (literally and in taste) for a cornbread.  The only thing saving it was the clotted cream accompaniment. The fried chicken was moist, but parts of the batter on certain pieces was soggy and the seasoning was lacking.  Also, the batter to meat ratio skewed heavily towards over-battering. The accompanying waffles again were fine, but the melted cheddar cheese on top hardened almost immediately and was not very appetizing after sitting for five minutes. The deviled eggs were akin to those found at many a family BBQ.   The ricotta gundi was bland and served with too much sauce. The macaroni and cheese was second runner up for best food choice, which our group voted to be the waffle fries seasoned with fresh dill and accompanied by a whole grain mustard aioli with some underlying spice. Of course, as my husband pointed out, it's not hard to serve a good french fry....fried potatoes are inherently delicious....and if that's the best thing on the menu, maybe reevaluate the dining choice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This was a great place for a few hours in Brooklyn. The very large beer hall was quite crowded and lively. Everyone was having a good time, and there were different games that people were playing and would share with groups around them -- we had a lot of fun with the Jenga. Despite being a beer hall, I was more interested in their seasonal drinks which were fun to try and quite strong. There were different fireplaces, which I very much appreciated and added to the rustic feel and cheery, comfortable atmosphere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

However, as a frequent meal eater(as many as 3 times daily!)I feel it is my duty to inform the public about the indigestible aspects of the Westville experience. The dining experience at Westville can be summed up with the slogan ""The discomforts of comfort food."" For the record, I am a longtime Westville patron. Each bite holds the flavors and nostalgia of a home-cooked meal where you always earn your dessert by eating every last vegetable. I have been to both Westville in the West Village and Westville East several times over. Both places (especially the West Village location)are a wee bit larger than your average paper bag, and usually you end up with people loitering around you eye balling your table as you choke down your broccoli rabe with a swig of your freshly uncorked bottle of wine. Tonight I decided to give the 18th street location a whirl, the newest addition to the Westville family tree. Size wise it is definitely the papa bear of the family. Unfortunately, while trying to enjoy the delicious meals in front of us, the waitstaff were constantly afoot, clearing plates with vegetables so new they practically were still coming out of the ground. Before even puncturing the first bite with our forks the waitress had returned, asking how the food was as her eyes darted around for anything to clear. I had the displeasure of facing the main sprawl, so I could see all the huffy workers whispering about how long we had been eating there and how much joy we seemed to possess in our souls. There were about 6 people trying to push us along so that they could seat a new crop of anxious diners that had arrived. I am sorry but congratulations for having a delicious AND popular restaurant! With 3 constantly crammed locations! I feel very bad for you in this booming economy. As a passionate eater and appreciator of all things local, I find it more than irritating to be treated like dirt while being a seated, paying customer. We ordered appetizers, a bottle of wine, entrees, dessert, and coffee and were literally scoffed at for wanting to finish our bottle of wine. We overheard one bitchy waiter sneer to another "" They've been here a f-ing hour!"" I have not felt so rejected during a dining experience since I sneaked a pack of junior mints into the school library in sixth grade. And that was because they feared chocolate smears would ruin the books! Westville, what's your excuse?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Best risotto I've ever had. It has a genuine Italian vibe, and when I go there it makes me want to travel to Italy. The food comes very quickly, and the bread/rice cakes they bring out for the table is delicious. The risotto itself is perfect; not too salty, not too dry, JUST the right amount of flavor and texture. I love this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Thanksgiving out is always a crap shoot.  Too often timed settings impinge on usual quality. Yesterday a group of nine of us headed to Northern Spy for the first time and were far more than pleasantly surprised.  Turkey was moist and tasty served with a wild rice and parsnip dressing, sides were a crisp stuffing, whipped potatoes and a cranberry relish.  Dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding topped with a dollop of ice cream for two if us, everyone else opted for the apple pie. Eating out on Thanksgiving means no leftovers the next day but we took home memories of a great meal. We will be back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the hostess who showed me to my table soon after. The server was very knowledgable about the menu and kindly explained their no substitutions rule. While we were still deciding, he get us glasses of water. I went for the Truffle Royale and sweet potato fries. My friend had the Manly and truffle fries. The food was so delicious! I appreciate good buns on a burger. I was a little iffy about such an expensive burger, but after taking one bite I realized that it was worth it. We had to ask for sauces, but the bussers were helpful and got them to us quickly. They gave us three sauces, which were explained by the bussers. I was impressed that even the bussers knew about the menu! Service overall was great. Everyone I came in contact with was so friendly!

"This little gem is tucked away in the heart of the lower east side and for anyone who loves anonymity along with great food and cool vibes this is the place to go.  My wife and I were visiting NYC when we heard a local speak about a place that not too many tourists would ever hear about.  We wanted to do more of the ""local-scene"" so we spent the better part of two hours trying to find this little gem.  Needless to say we got on the right train going the wrong direction and ended up in Queens only to FINALLY make it for lunch at 3:45 in the afternoon.  All I can say is I am sure glad we didn't give up.  This place was well worth it!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"AMAZING experience. First off, we didn't have a reservation for Sunday brunch, and not only did the gracious host and hostess seat us, but even let us move tables when my aunt wasn't happy. Our waitress, Jack, was lovely, so helpful, and patient. We started with their house made sodas which were beautiful, the savory crab toast with aioli, split the shrimp salad, which had an amazing vinaigrette, and finished it off with the orgasmic mushroom and parmesan pizza with a cracked egg in the middle. It took a while for our pizza to come out, but Jack over heard that we were thinking about the roasted brussels sprouts and sent them out on the house. She also over heard it was my birthday that past weekend and sent out an adorable cupcake with a candle. Fantastic service with an incredible eye for detail. DEFINITELY come back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Two reasons why I knew this place had to be good before even sitting down: 1) People were exiting the restaurant sweating with soup stains splattered all over their shirt. 2) The people waiting outside for a seat started clapping each time someone finished their meal and left the restaurant. THIS WAS THE BEST RAMEN I HAVE EVER HAD. Granted, I've never been to Japan, but I am a ramen lover and I know good ramen when I taste it. Totto makes you wait. My bf and I went on a Friday night around dinnertime and had to wait over an hour for a seat. The wait was well worth it and you don't even care that this place is tiny and really hot and poorly ventilated inside. The broth is thick and almost gravy like, the pork is super soft with amazing fat. I ordered the Spicy Ramen and I usually douse my soup with sriracha, pepper, lime juice and fish sauce for extra flavor but did not add a single thing to my Totto ramen. It's perfect. I took pictures of it on my phone just to remember how perfect it was. If I lived in NY, I'd be a regular.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating.  And that is what we did. Discovered this gem a few years ago and loved it ever since.  My first experience that sold me was their monk fish liver.  After that time, we came here on several more occasions, but no luck and no liver :( UNTIL LAST NIGHT!! SCORE! I was so ecstatic that I was contemplating ordering a 2nd one. Sake Bar Hagi has always lived up to the reviews and hype. Although their fried squid legs (on the specials menu) were not up to par, all others were on point. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the fried gizzards. Mind you, I'm not usually a fan, the texture was always too crunchy for me. But that night, it was lightly salted, battered and the texture was perfect. Slightly tender, really delish. Another must get is their ramen on a cold night. Pork base broth with thin slices of pork, bean sprouts and this greens (bitters?). Ramen was al dente and everything married well together. And what better way to seal the night than green tea crepe and ice cream! The layers on the cake tasted similar to the Lady M's crepe. Light and fluffy, so addicting. Great company, yummy food, awesome night. But be forewarned, prices have gone up. Sigh. Guess that's what happened when a place gets this popular :(","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I know this place gets great reviews from everyday patrons.  Let me tell you - I had a slice of their artichoke pizza on the very first week they opened.  2 bucks.  While I waited for my slice, they offered me bread and a beverage.  The slice was 1/8 of the entire pie. These days, there are virtually NO artichokes on their famed pizzas...the slices are now 1/10 of the pie and 2 dollars more.  So you're gonna pay $4 for a slice of pizza that is just dough, cheese and cream. Oh - and they will not admit that they use cream in their ""topping/sauce"" for the artichoke pizza. Has anyone called the health department on them?  They're supposed to list the calories!  I'm sure once they do, they won't be doing as well.  And for $4 a slice, PA-LEASE - I'd rather go to Ray's. They also keep some rude guy at the counter, taking orders - and holding up the line so as to keep up the ""long line"" outdoors.  Meanwhile, there are pizza slices ready to go!!  If they had a clue, they would make their customers happy, give them their slices and get MORE business through the door! Amateurs!! THis place is a joke.  I can throw some salt and cream on some dough and bake it and call it an artichoke pizza. Where's the artichoke?!!?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Delicious pizza! I've heard mixed reviews as to whether or not this pizza is ACTUALLY the best pizza in NY. While I'm not willing to commit to calling it ""the best"" I will say it was absolutely delicious and did not disappoint.

"I love oysters. They have a wonderful and fresh selection. Unfortunately they are about 1.5 the price as they should be and they do not list prices on the menu. My friend and I ordered what at any comparable place in the City would have cost $50, here they cost well over $70. My trout was tasty without a doubt, but far too simple and common to cost $22. The presentation or the ""side"" of capers (the fish came with nothing but was drenched in capers) should have taken away from the price not added to it. The other food was good, but not worth the amount we paid in ingredients, taste, , ingenuity, or presentation. The service was a little sassy for my taste, but it was a busy time so you can't fault them too much. Basically this isn't superbly expensive, but you are by no means getting what you pay for. Who would have thought that you can be charged $100+ a person at a restaurant overlooking a highway. Well you can, welcome to Brooklyn, folks.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Dinner was great. Two types of fresh breads were offered as we waited for our main dishes.  The chicken rollatini and lobster ravioli was cooked perfectly.

"Made reservations easily through Yelp and came here on a Friday night. It was a little packed when I got there which was expected (after work hour on a Friday). Got seated quickly after I told the guy I made reservations even if my friend wasn't there yet. The servers were really nice and attentive. The decor of the restaurant was great which gave it a good atmosphere. The crowd definitely wasn't too loud. We got the Margherita pizza with prosciutto and it was really, really good. It had the right amount of crust and it didn't leave me feeling heavy. They have a great wine selection too, you can either buy by the glass/bottle. We got a bottle that we really enjoyed. The servers were helpful with the menu. Both items were priced reasonably, and we'll definitely come back. We also got a dessert of course (Panna Cotta Frangelico Fragole). It was so yummy. I would definitely recommend this place for a relaxed dinner out with friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One word, butter. If you like butter then you will love Balthazar. I just went back to Balthazar after about ten years and I have to say, it hasn't changed much in the last ten years, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  We started the night with a few oysters with great recommendations from our waiter. I had the Balthazar salad (haricot vert, truffle oil) and the classic steak au poivre finished with the creme fraiche panna cotta. The food was delicious but extremely rich. The steak was also slightly over cooked for my taste but still tasty as hell. My table mates were all equally pleased with their meals, mussels, organic salmon and the burger. The fries in this place are cooked to perfection. The waiter was incredible, friendly and attentive even on a busy Friday night. Overall it was a great dining experience but more of the occasional splurge type of place. I'm sure I'll be back again in another ten years.

"Let me just start off by saying, for me out of all people to give one star is NOT a good thing. On halloween I came here around 4am with a friend of mine. We went out late that night because we got off of work at 1am so when we got here we were both sober and hungry.  We have been here before together a few years ago and absolutly loved it. We were craving their macaroni and cheese spring rolls which we remember to be out of this world. However, this experience was not even close to meeting our expectations at all. When we arrived, we took a look inside through the glass window to seeif there were any seats inside. There were quite a few empty tables and we were excited. We went to the door and the guy at the door stopped us and said it was going to be a 30 min wait. We thought whatever no big deal and went behind these two other men who were also waiting. About twenty minutes passed and a larger line was starting to form behind us. My friend and I noticed two people went up to the man at the door (they were obviously friends) and asked how long it would be and said there was no wait at all and let them in. Ten more minutes passed and the same thing happened again with a new set of three people. I asked the guy nicely why he was letting those people in and not attending to the line and he said one of them is an NBA player or something (obviously a lie because all three of the guys were literally scrawny and my height). He gave me a huge attitude and I was taken aback by it. A few more minutes passed and 4 (really pretty girls) asked him how long it would be for a table, I overheard him tell them the first time to get to the back of the line, however, they stood there and talked to him for awhile and  he let all of them in! By this time the whole line was getting pretty furious. Like bro, seriously, this isn't a nightclub! I asked him again why he did that and once again gave me a major attitude. The two guys who were waiting infront of us were finally able to get inside. We waited about an hour before we were finally able to get inside. The hostess came  outside and said she had a table for two people available. I asked her if that was us and she responded (also with a huge attitude) ""yea chill"" . Like what hostess says that!? I was so fed up and I wanted to walk away right then but we already waited so long to get into this friggen place. When we were seated we looked around and saw so many empty tables. We were just flawed! Our server came up to us and he was Veryyyyy nice. He took our order and got us drinks. When we finally received our Mac and cheese rolls that we were waiting so long for we were very upset because they were cold. The served said he would get us a new order and took them back to the kitchen. About ten minutes later our spring rolls returned, with our previous bite marks in them not a new set (our waiter was not the one who returned them). We figured they heated them up more. Only the outside was warm still and the inside was still cold. The waiter came back and was also surprised we didn't get new ones. He took them away and told us he would take them off the bill. That night we also split a cheeseburger and truffle French fries. The fries only has a tiny bit of cheese and hardly  any ""truffles"" on them, the burger was also cold however at the point we just didn't care and ate it. The bill turned out to be $25's ( with the Mac and cheese rolls removed). We gave the waiter a good tip because it was not his fault and he was the nicest person to us throughout the whole night. I can not see myself ever going back to this place unless I was forced to. Maybe this was just a horrible night but it left a really bad impression. I do not remember this place being this horrible. This place does not deserve your money. If you want a burger and fries with better service, nicer employees and hot food at a cheaper price i would suggest going to Mc Donald's over this place. Both the hostess and the the restaurants ""body guard"" should be fired.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cuban food delivered fast and fresh. They have daily as well as everyday specials. Just remembered to ask for extra green crack sauce. I put it on everything. Cuban sandwiches are yummy. My favorite is the roasted pork that is super juicy and tender shredded. This is a perfect lunch spot if you need to dine in or take out. They have Tina's all over the city, and Sophie's on the other half. They are 99% the same thing, only difference I have found is Tina's has yuca and Sophie's does not. Not sure the reason, but that's basically the difference. Both are worth the trip. If you get here after the Noon hour then you'll probably see a bit of a line. Don't be afraid, if you are going to take it to go - the line moves very quickly and you can be in and out in under 5 minutes. They are super quick! Tip: The sandwich line is at the very end and splits off from the hot food platter line. Don't sit in one line just to have to jump on another if you want a sandwich. Move your way all the way to the back and get on the sandwich line. This is the slowest line since each sandwich is made to order. No difference, everyone knows what they are doing so they bang these things out pretty quick. When your done jump the line and walk up to the register.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My boyfriend and I stopped by here last thursday night. We were looking for a new local watering hole. We asked the bartender what her favorite cocktail was and she mentioned the Barnyard dance....WOW. Spicy and delicious! We asked her for a follow up drink to that which my boyfriend and I thought how can another drink top that!  She indeed recommended another great drink... Green eggs and hash, certainly not with a power punch kick, but flavorful with a tang. It doesn't end there. She mentioned the charcuterie plates where on happy hour. My boyfriend and I said why stop there and let her pick out some cheeses for us. Again, all the cheese she picked out were amazingly paired. She gave us great descriptions of them upon serving. Then to top it off. $1 oysters!! Here's the catch, you have to order them by the half dozen or a dozen. The bartender said we can start with half a dozen and if we enjoyed them we can always order another half dozen. We went ahead and ordered a half dozen. Superb. She mentioned they were local from long island. My boyfriend and I did not pick out a single thing for ourselves. We were so happy to have a bartender with such great taste. Our whole experience was great due to letting go of expectations.  We will return!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Red Hook Lobster Pound Pros: Great service and delicious food. Cons: Didn't have enough cups for me to try their organic limeade and their price. Food Experience: We were at the Smorgasbar event in NYC near South St. back in July 24th. So all these restaurants had a booth with their logo and menu. So when I saw that Red Hook was there and saw their prices I was HIGHLY hesitant so I shared a $16 Lobster Roll Connecticut Style with my friend. That was literally the only way I was going to afford that. hahaha However it was so delicious and warm but I wish they did something with the bun, maybe toasted it or added a little butter too. I don't know but the lobster was definetly the hero and made that roll work. Conclusion: I wouldn't mind tasting that lobster roll again! I wish I got to try that organic limeade they had as well. I do recommend this place if their food is anything like that lobster roll.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a great neighborhood spot in Prospect Heights. I love the food here. It's all veggie, delicious and healthy. And they make some awesome smoothies too. I've tried the curry (fake) chicken over quinoa, and it's delicious. The lo-mein noodles are really good too. And way healthier than your typical Chinese place. I've also tried the vegan escoveitch fish, and I wasn't a fan. The vegan lasagna was just okay. Get the curry chicken - it's the best thing on the menu. And get it over quinoa. Really good. I also loved the smoothie with pineapple, papaya and yogurt, and the smoothie with peanut butter and sea moss. They also have great vegan baked goods - try the coconut bread. So good. Also, everything is very affordable. A small portion is enough if you get a smoothie or slice of banana/pumpkin/lemon/coconut bread as a side. I end up going here for take-out quite often.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After a 2 hour wait to be seated I expected this place to be the most amazing brunch food that I would ever experience and be left with an undying need to always return. That wasn't the case. It's a typical brunch spot. Nothing is so extraordinary that would ever make me wait 2 hours for again. I had french toast and it was just that - french toast. There wasn't anything that made it stand out. I will give them this though...the pancakes with warm maple butter was to die for!. But in all honesty, I think it was just the maple butter that did that. It was as if they created their own secret drug and disguised it in the form of this warm maple butter. The pancakes were cood though. Full of blueberries, nice and fluffy. I'm not going to say they were just pancakes - they were good pancakes. But the maple butter stole the show for me.

"Had a reunion of friends here, and we had an excellent time even though the other half complained about being dragged to some obscure corner of the Village (she's a convert...and always was, but that's her story). The decor is great, the noise level very acceptable even when full to bursting during brunch, and service never rushed. I can highly recommend the salmon tartar, the avocado toast (ignore the price point for a single piece of toast), the baked eggs with merguez, and absolutely the salmon pot pie.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had this for my last dinner in NY. I didn't really know what NY pizza is all about (like how Chicago pizza is to deep dish), but I guess it's their thin crust? Anyway, we were seated promptly as soon as everyone in our party arrived. There were seven of us, so we got two large pizzas: one customized with sweet Italian sausage, sauteed garlic spinach, and mushrooms, and the white pizza that had a variety of cheeses but no red . Food came out fairly quickly, about ten to fifteen minutes after ordering. The sausage pizza was pretty darn good! I don't know if it was cause I was starving at the time but that pizza tasted amazing. I usually don't eat crust, but I devoured the whole slice! (Maybe I was hungry...) The only problem with that pizza was that it was a bit watery from the spinach and mushrooms, I assume they didn't drain out the water from washing it. Still good nonetheless, esp with lots of crushed red pepper. I wish I had some ranch handy.. The white pizza, on the other hand, didn't really do it for me. Ricotta cheese was one of the many cheese toppings, which made my teeth feel sticky and gross afterwards. I wanted to brush my teeth immediately. After a couple of bites, I gave it to my sister and opted for the last slice of sausage pizza. Bill came out to be only $52, and we were all super stuffed! Overall, four stars for that sausage pizza, friendly service, and low price.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wednesday night at around 8:30pm and the line are still long with about 30 people waiting to enter the restaurant. No reservations waited about 30 minutes and most tables are communion and shared with others. Only cash. It is all worth it.

"Huge fan of the truck, so when i heard they opened a restaurant I had to go check it out. First off, i should clarify that this isn't a really sit down and eat place ( they have a couple of tables, but no service) The place is small and 70% of it is devoted to the kitchen ( now I know where they make the taco truck goodness)   But in the end its about the food right? And the food is as good if not better than the truck. The spicy korean ""Gnocchi"" is great, perfect blend od sweet and spicy. The chicken fried taco ( which is often offered by the truck )  is good but not the usual home run from the truck. Didn't offer anything taste wise that you would want more of.   The burritos are always great especially me personal favorite the short rib. so do yourself a favor, if you can't make it to the truck, check out there permanent ( hopefully) location.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The only reason its not five stars is because of the comfort space of the restaurant.  You are packed in like sardines and you have to move your entire table to let the person sitting inside to get up.  So its best to hit up the restroom before you take your seat (or even better before you get to the restaurant, there's only one toilet)!   That was basically the only negative thing you have to know about the restaurant.  The food was excellent.  We started with two appetizers: the mussels and the grilled shrimp and calamari.  The broth the mussels are cooked in is delicious.  Ask for bread to dip into the soup, it is fantastic.  The grilled seafood was really good.  I don't even know what seasoning they sprinkle on it, but it leaves a pleasant taste in your mouth while waiting for your entree. My wife ordered the Tagliolini ai Frutti di Mare.  It is a mound of seafood over a bed of noodles in tomato/garlic sauce.  She really enjoyed it and I was able to steal a few scoops of noodles and mussels from here, but there was so much, we still had leftovers at the end of dinner. I ordered the Cotechino  con Purea di  Patate (sausage with mash potatoes).  It had five medallions of sausage and a plate full of mash potatoes.  At first the mash potatoes looked like mash potatoes, but extra mushy.  But when you taste it, omg it was really really good.  Most places overwhelm the potatoes with butter or cheese, but they made it fantastic, you can really enjoy the potato.  The sausage was also very delicious. We were full, so did not get to enjoy any dessert.  Perhaps next time.  Too bad the place doesn't take credit card, but for the prices, you don't mind carrying $60-$70 for a dinner for two.  We had an early dinner at 5:15, so there were plenty of open tables.  But come 6:30-7:00 the place gets packed.  When we left, the people coming in were told the wait is 30-40 minutes.  Try to get there early and enjoy a great dinner and wake around the NOHO area afterwards to burn off all the calories!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner because a friend wanted some xiao long bao (soup dumplings). She claims it was better than Joe's Shanghai, and less crowded. When we got there at 7:30 there was a wait of 20 minutes, nothing crazy. This place is pretty new, so the inside decor nice, new, and clean. Oh and people do speak English here, ha. The food was pretty delicious. We ordered a scallion pancake wrapped with beef, xiao long bao, a spicy chicken dish and some fried rice. All the dishes were great and came out really fast too. Now the xiao long bao here were pretty good. They were hot and had a lot of soup in them. They were however pricier than Joe's Shanghai or in Chinatown. Here it was $8 for 6! And that's just for the pork, not crab. I believe in Chinatown it's $6-7 for 8. I guess you pay for the location, and decor. Personally I'd rather pay less and eat more at a little hole in the wall place, I'm classy like that. Overall this place is pretty good.

Hands down one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We had a few small plates to share with the group. The standouts were the meatballs and the fried artichokes. By the time our entrees came out I didn't think I could eat another thing. But the black truffle gnocchi was so good I managed to make it through about half of it. My fiance ordered the chocolate salami and he thought it was fab. You should ask about it if you are considering ordering dessert. Better than the food was the ambiance of the restaurant.

"I don't live in Greenpoint. I live in Fort Greene. So Adelina's isn't a place I can walk down the street to. I have to take the train to get there. The G train. Which is more like a caboose. Anyway. My girlfriend and I got off the G at Greenpoint and were bummed to find our friends had mixed up a dinner plan. We were stuck in Greenpoint with nowhere to go and we were arguing. I saw the chalk board outside Adelina's and steered us in to switch up the environment and I'm not going to say that Adelina's is why I drunkenly proposed to her later in the night and why we are getting married - but I'm not going to not say it either. First of all it's dark and nice. You sit on stools like you live there. The bathroom has nice stuff hanging on the wall and yes, I'm the kind of person who judges a place based on their bathroom. My girlfriend - er - fiancee - got a pizza and I had the white bean spread which comes with homemade bread. Amazing. Tangy and nutty. I ate all the bread up and secreted two slices into my bad just like my Dad does so I could eat it on the train for later. The wine comes in these amazing glasses. And by glasses I mean juice glasses. The lady had rose, I had red. A Rhone blend. Such a deal and so delicious. If you know about wine you'll feel stroked, if you don't know about wine you'll feel like you are getting away with it. Then we shared a salad. I had some of her pizza, which is like funnel cake, if funnel cake were pizza. I can't say enough about it. It's a little heavy because it's fried, but when you drink as much wine as we did, it's good to lay a little grease down there. Plus it tastes fresh and the cheese on it isn't heavy like on most pizzas. It's the real stuff. To make a long story short, Adelina's is the kind of place that heals squabbles. The food is great, the bathroom rocks and the people who work there are kind. The place where you look across the bar at the red headed capuchin monkey sitting on the stool in her blue denim dress laughing with her mouth full and you realize that man, you are lucky. You are really lucky. In this dirty city, what more can you ask for? My one complaint is that the thing that closes the bathroom door is a little hard to fasten.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Am I the first vegan/vegetarian review?!  Super.  This place is a vegan dream.   I spoke with the waitstaff and owner and they pointed out more options than I'm used to--plus they offered to modify the few dishes that just have a meat component that can be easily left out.  (No beef broth in the ""vegetarian"" dishes here.) The imperial roles are amazing and the papaya salad (without shrimp) was incredibly flavorful, crisp and refreshing on a sweltering day.  I had leftovers and ate them for breakfast the next day, and they were still bright and fresh. The lemongrass tofu was fantastic...I'm still dreaming about it.  I would marry the Eggplant.  It has an incredible flavor profile and is everything I miss about Vietnamese food in the SF bay area (sob, sigh). My meat-eating and okra-loving boyfriend loved the spicy shrimp satay and okra.  Okra can go so many different directions...we hate it in the west african place near my house, but crave it from Falansai.  They made me a vegan okra sample.  :) Overall I love this restaurant...if there are 3 things I point to, to remind myself how much I love Bushwick, it's this new addition to the Roberta's/Momo triangle, Goodbye Blue Monday, and the apartment I've loved for years.  :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

Most people at the table ordered an entree item. I was lucky enough to get a bite of my boyfriend's swordfish kebab which was very good.

"I work pretty close to South St. Seaport. That doesn't put me too far from this location, but it's too far to get a meal in the allotted lunch hour, and that makes me sad. However, it was totally worth getting back to work late. I arrived here around 12:30, and there was a line, which is to be expected anyway. I was handed a menu while I waited and told the wait shouldn't be longer than 30 minutes. Bring something to do while you wait, or go with someone. You might want to bring headphones, in case you're stuck in front of some idiots like I was. Tangent: he was pretentiously stating to his friend, that if a shack ever opened in NJ, it would be a full-fledged chain and he wouldn't go. Well then, you should know that there are already locations in other states, and even a spot in Dubai according to the location page on their site. You may leave now. I decided to go for a double shack burger. It's 50 cents more than a standard double cheese burger, and I'm assuming that is for the special shack sauce, because you can get lettuce and tomato on any burger free of charge. It was a good burger as always, but the next time I go I'll save the 50 cents and just load up on mustard and ketchup, which are also free of charge. It was pretty warm out, so I decided to get something from the concrete menu. I don't remember the name of what I had, but it was their twist on rocky road, pretty much. It wasn't bad, but maybe frozen custard doesn't hold its consistency for long, because it melted really quickly. In 10 minutes I had soup. I'll come back, but never again during my lunch hour. I was half an hour late coming back, so I'd prefer to go again when I'll have time to savor what I'm eating.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"one of the few times when my high expectations were actually met. I was definitely blown away and super impressed with my dining experience at Perilla. Amazing doesn't even come close to describing the food! For the most part, 4 very happy, and satisfied girls were dining mostly in silence, savoring the wonderful food. Between 4 girls (3 of which are yelpers!) we opted to share two appetizers and 3 entrees. The appetizers were good, but nothing really stood out - The entrees were unbelievable. We ordered the prime rib (for two) and the colorado lamb. Never have I had lamb that was juicy and tender, the meat melts in your mouth, and the seasoning is absolutely perfect, highlighting and enhancing the lamb's flavor. The prime rib came with two sides - gnocchi and asparagus. Both were delicious, I loved how the chef chose to pan fry the gnocchi, it was something different and unexpected. The portion of the prime rib was huge, and the meat was cooked to perfection. Every bite was tender and juicy, not at all tough or difficult to chew. I enjoyed it even though I'm not usually a big meat lover. Finally, a souffle as the finish to our wonderful meal. Stellar restaurant - too bad the wait was so long!

"Not particularly impressed by the food or the service.   I was prepared to be wowed after our Som Tum Muar Zuar (Papaya Salad) came out.  It was spicy, sour and had all the crispy deep fried goodness that should be present in a good papaya salad.  Unfortunately that experience was short lived. Order the Moo Krab Larb, because you have to right?  It has Larb in the name of the restaurant. It must be one of its specialities? I do not see the appeal in this dish or any larb dish for that matter.  It just deep fried crispy pork, with lots of salt and chillies.  I'm not a fan. Also ordered the Kor Moo Yang (Grilled Pork).  The pork was lightly flavored, the sauce was spicy and sour but nothing that got me pouring the little steel container full of it onto my pork. Service was very spotty.  There were still a one or two tables left when we got seated, but shortly after taking our order, they got too busy for their own good.  Ask the waitress to remove the plate leftover from our papaya salad to make room for the new dishes, she didn't comprehend at first cause she was running around.  Ordered a thai ice tea later on in the meal, it took reminding all three servers, until the last one who happened to be the one making drinks got the order.  The table next to us asked for new plates like four times before someone brought clean plates for them. I read in some reviews that the chef was the former chef at  Zabb Elee?  Not sure if there is any truth to it, but there is a reason I stopped going to Zabb Elee...  The food tastes pretty much the same, with the highlight being the papaya salad and the disappointment in the larb.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food here was good. I felt like I was sampling or taste testing, rather than eating an actual meal, but I guess this is their take on pseudo-fine dining. My friend and I ordered 4 plates, I can't really remember what we ate, but I do know that everything was quite good except for the shaved fois gras. The fois gras comes as a shaved ornament for clementines, but before you know it, the juices of the clementines make the fois gras into a paste. I'm not a fan of fois gras to begin with, so this was really hard to eat without gagging. Anyway, a gem right smack center of Sunnyside. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Walked in for an order to go and the staff was super nice. We got the Philly beef brisket cheesesteak sandwich and chef's combo which comes with a 1/4 pound of  your choice of three meats (we ordered ribs, chicken breast and double smoked burnt ends) and 2 sides ( mac'n cheese and cole slaw).  The cheesesteak was melt in your mouth delicious!!! The ribs and burnt ends we're excellent and the chicken was awesome with their house BBQ sauce. Their BBQ sauce is kinda sweet,  slightly spicy and probably one of the best bbq sauces I've ever had.  The cole slaw was yummy and Mac n cheese was also really good it just needed a little salt. What we ordered was not listed on their regular menu it was their chef's specials located on the table tents. If you are in Astoria and want BBQ this is definitely a great place to go. It's clean and the food is good quality.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went there due to the words of mouth ""best Cuban food in town"". Sure, very noticeably, you get this attitude of ""hey we are so popular, I don't care if you come back or not"". The service here was slow, inefficient (while keeping a million ppl waiting), and essentially bad. The only thing they do was to fill your water. But honestly at such cheap price (~10bucks per entree), this place is of pretty good value. With that said, I got the grilled corn, which was very yummy (and fatty with lots of butter, a bit cheesy, and a bit spice at some portion). The grilled shrimp taco was amazing; the chicken enchiladas was a thorough letdown - avoid even if you are normally a fan of the dish like myself. We also got a side dish of plantain - pretty standard. Honestly whether you love or hate this place, it's basically equivalent to if you like to eat their SAUCE. The flavors all came from the generous portion of sauce. Don't get me wrong, after all it's a diner spot. You might as well set the expectation low...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tight space and popularity makes this place perpetually crowded during lunch and dinner. I usually do take out from the resturant (vs. the actual take out area) because there are more options.

"I'm a Portland raised lobster freak and have been eating RHLP lobster rolls every Sunday since day one at Dumbo. They do rock and in my own New England redneck opinion, they are the best  thing I've eaten outside my home state. I'm not a hater but the yapping lobster lady  under the bridge was testing my patience and loyalty and I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who feels that way. I was happy to see the tent today in my barrio of Ft. Greene and was even happier not to see lady langosta holding up the line. But I guess she left her son in charge which was painfully obvious because he was her, only in the form of a twenty-something year old boy who was working at half the speed of her chefs who are always on point with a genuine smile and an educated answer.

"Delicious gluten-free food, but pizza base is not dairy-free! Whaaaat??? My husband is coeliac and I have never encountered a gf pizza base that is not also dairy free - until now. It would seem that if you set up an entire restaurant around a food allergy that if at all possible one would include other big allergens too - but that's just me. That fairly major hiccup aside (my poor husband was SO looking forward to having pizza), the food really was excellent. I had the tortellini with roasted butternut squash - well balanced, savory and satisfying - he had the gf cavatelli with sausage and marinara sauce - which he proclaimed was also very yummy. Nice gf desserts on offer but only the sorbettis were dairy free too. All in all, great if you're simply allergic/intolerant to gluten. Feels like a special meal out. Add a dairy allergy on top of that and you might want to consider other options.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Very limited menu with unappealing combinations of ingredients . One hour wait at six o'clock on a Saturday. I wouldn't ever consider giving it a second chance.

"Kefi certainly has a reputation for good food and it's nice to know it really lives up to the hype. My UWS friends brought me here yesterday for an early dinner at around 6:30pm.  It's a large space and were thrilled to be seated without issue.  I had no idea there was so much room, be sure to check out the downstairs. Our server was extremely helpful, cheerful and knowledgable with the food and wines being offered.  He recommended a delicious, refreshing and affordable ($30 per bottle) white wine. We skipped appetizers in hopes of enjoying dessert - which we didn't because we were far too full from dinner.  Will have to come back since the desserts looked divine. I ordered the Chicken Thigh Souvlaki special, which was unbelievably delicious. Tender, perfectly grilled chunks of chicken thigh were presented on wooden skewers.  It was a very hearty portion and each bite was pure bliss with the accompanying pita bread, Greek salad (which they were kind enough to present without feta cheese) and a delicious rice.   The salad was fresh and flavorful with lots of olives, tomatoes, onions and peppers.  Loved the salad dressing! The rice was amazing with a butter flavor and spinach.  I literally couldn't stop eating... and ended up cleaning my plate.  If you could have seen the food baby!   I could have easily taken home about a third of the dish but opted to pigging out while the food was fresh.   My friends also thoroughly enjoyed the dinners, ordered the same as me.  We were thrilled with Kefi and will definitely return in the near future.  Yum!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

My guy friends were getting annoyed and told me they needed something to fill them up before all their money was gone. So I looked on the menu trying to find a meal that they can't possibly size down and that wasn't too expensive. I ordered the salmon+roe rice and a chicken+burdock rice (kamanabe). The salmon and roe was really good. but the chicken and burdock should have been more flavored. Maybe if the chicken was a hen(has stronger dark meat taste) instead it would have been better. the service was ok. decor+atmosphere was nice. if u have money to blow, want to see cute waitresses in yukatas, and u have a really small stomach then this place is for u.","[0.0, 1.0]"

They had a sandwich board outside advertising a pre fixed 15 dollar lunch. However, upon arrival they said they switch to dinner at 4. REALLY?

A small, nicely but simply decorated restaurant in Astoria - about 12 or so blocks from the Museum of the Moving Image were we had visited earlier. Malagueta serves excellent Brazilian food with some classics (including the Saturday only feijoada completo), a stunningly good Acaraje (patties made of mashed black eyed peas with classic Brazilian sauce of fish and dried shrimp known as vatapa. My wife and a friend had an excellent salad of fresh spinach with mango, cashew nuts and Gorgonzola cheese. This received high praise. My main dish was another classic the Moqueca de Camarao, a shrimp stew served with rice. The mango mousse for desert was delicious.

"Yeah, it damn well better be five stars. We waited for a YEAR to eat here. We had to order two drinks apiece... one to chug, one to sip, just to get over the waiting (in 45-degree weather) part. Seriously, though, by ""year"" I really mean ""about an hour, give or take"" and it was well worth it. Don't go to Grimaldi's if you're claustrophobic, because you're going to be shoved into a booth next to someone you've never seen before in your life, and your butt will actually touch them when you're squeezing in and out of your seat. It's also important to know that this place is CASH ONLY (read: shady). Unfortunately, we didn't realize this until we'd already waited through about 80% of the line. Thankfully, our hostess had some cash with her. None of us really did. And honestly, by the end of that wait, I'd have just gone ahead and eaten anyway and worried about settling up with them later. A girl doesn't wait for an hour + for nothing. Grimaldi's is charming. It's nestled underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, just a block or so from Fulton Ferry Landing (wonderful views of the Manhattan skyline from here) and a stones-throw from a lovely little ice cream shop.

"I love it, I love it, I love it! Seriously... BYOB, cheap food, friendly staff... what is there not to love about this place? Oh yeah... not to mention, their AH-MAZING food. No, they do not make substitutions... but requesting a substitution is just being plain rude. Especially when the chef makes such delicious food for such a reasonable price. Last time I came to Gaia (which was also my first, but definitely not last), we were in a bit of a time crunch so I ordered the most *ahem* diet-friendly meal (beans and spicy sausage) and I went to TOWN on that platter. But, having said that, next time I am definitely ordering for everyone so that I can get to try all of what they have to offer. I can't wait to try the pesto lasagna. I don't know if it's the diet or the food, but I am salivating at the very thought of pesto lasagna. Mmmmmm... pesto lasagna.....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been here over 100 times since they opened in March 2008.   Sure they had growing pains (erratic hours at first, inconsistent crust) -- but when you make what is unequivocally SPIRITUAL PIZZA (yep, I'm borrowing big words from Michael F., just sayin'), and what this native Manhattanite considers the best trio of slices in NYC, you deserve to be forgiven for minor faux pas....you can't rush quality! I'm still dreaming of the Neopolitan/""Regulur"", Sicilian and their signature Artichoke special slice (the first in Manhattan).   Game over aficionados of New York Pizza -- better start updating your Best Slice lists, there's no need to take the subway to Avenue J anymore....the crown for best slice in NYC is back in Manhattan (via Staten Island)!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"5 star rating because this is the best lobster roll in NYC. The Red Hook Lobster Pound is awesome! They offer 3 styles of rolls. First is the Maine style ($16), which is the cold mayo filled lobster roll, second is CT style($16), warm and buttery and third is the lobster BLT($10), good but served with a smaller amount of lobster. All lobster rolls are stuffed with a lot of lobster meat! The New England Chowder is pretty good as well. Rich and full of meaty pieces of seafood. They also offer lobster mac and cheese($10) and a lobster dinner ($25). The lobster dinner is $20 on Wednesday nights. First buy your roll then take it next door to the picnic tables and enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After my first visit from early on, experiencing what I considered ""slow service"" we made a second trip this past Monday night.   For a Monday at 9pm they were pretty much full and vibe was very Soho scene.   Wife and I split a Truffle Burger that we had read so much about and loved it.   Not sure how they only charge $45 given the amount of shaved truffle on top but let's hope they don't jack up the price now.   Also shared a chopped salad and the tuna tartare as we were not that hungry and sampled the wine on tap, which was decent, especially for only $8.   I see from the Yelper below he was upset because they would not take a rez but they would not take ours either.  It's a walk-in restaurant not a burger joint a la Shake Shack or BLT Burger.   Sounds like you got a bad phone girl but my bet is you might be surprised if you saw it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I love that they char their pork belly! makes it extra tasty. The most I've ever waited here was 20 minutes but I always try to come close to their closing time. I think they have a pretty fair system except the guy who manages the list has a bit of AF (if you know what that means). I always catch him ogling the Japanese girls. So I love the broth here, the tonkotsu is porky goodness. The spicy is FIRE BREATHINGLY HOT. Last time I had it, I couldn't really taste anything else. I don't knw how people get the extra spicy. I don't love their noodles, they are the squishy, thick and wavy type. The mega bowl is not that intimidating. I was able to finish it even when I wasn't that hungry. But the extra pork is NOT charred - it comes in big chunks, which makes it a bit unappetizing. And the extra scallions and garlic paste are unnecessary, as it overpowers the porkiness of the broth. This place is tiny (though not as tiny as Rai Rai Ken) and a bit dingy, so don't be surprised if you're asked to share a table or sit at the bar, which gets pretty claustrophobic.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We are loyal customers who have always loved Tavern on Jane, especially for its ability to create an absolutely delicious dinner at anytime of the night. The ambiance, the waitstaff and menu turned us into regular customers who easily visited over 50 times in the past two years. In the last few weeks, the renovation of both the space and the menu have left us bewildered. It appears that Tavern prefers bar patrons to diners and new customers to devoted regulars. I'm not adverse to change, but when the entire menu and wine list is thrown out, we feel unwelcome. And frankly, the waitstaff, who we know well, are equally mystified. Please include your loyal regulars in your future plans. Ask what items kept us coming back (i.e. NO PASTA and several burgers)?

"In short, horrible. They are always out of something because the new chef is ""perfecting"" his recipe. The pork ribs are dry and tasteless, although fatty at the ends. Burned on the outside, too pink on part of the inside. ZERO flavor. The mack and cheese is mush and flavorless. The cornbread, averge at best and cold. The chili--ugh! Even the pecan pie was mush topped with pecans. The best thing on the menu was coleslaw. Wost was the corn. I think it soaked in hot water for an hour and had a spice sprinkled on it. Truly AWFUL! Who can't do spicy corn? Go to Cuba Cabana if you want good food. Their corn is FAB! And skip that ""Caribbean"" place a few blocks up on flatbush, on the corner by Carlton. Seems these new places in Park Slope are for those rich yuppies who want to eat ""ethnic"" or BBQ, but want it bland. If you like real BBQ, do not go near this place.  The waitresses are nice though.

"I LOVE Vino Levantino. Great intimate, inviting atmosphere. You feel welcome right away. Delicious food that actually fills you up (vs some of the other wine bars that just have small bites). The food is worthy of its own attention and coupled with the outstanding wine selection and the ambiance, this place is a solid choice and a welcome addition to the neighborhood. They have been open for months but we feel like we just ""discovered"" it when we came out of hibernation. We found it just in time to host an amazing birthday party there for 30-40 guests. Working with the owner Haim, we filled the place for a few hours before they opened it up to the public. The party was perfect. On a beautiful summer evening with the doors open and sangria and wine flowing, our friends and family were so taken with the space and the delicious food that just kept coming. Save room for the dessert as the chocolate sampler is homemade and the perfect crunch to finish the evening. Other favorites were the shish kebab, chicken kebabs, eggplant burekas, falafel and hummus plate. We would wholeheartedly recommend this place for anything from date night, big dinner party with friends, casual glass of wine on your way home. They are open and inviting and all the people who work there are so nice and knowledgable. They are happy to be there and everyone who arrives smiles and relaxes into the atmosphere.

"Good brisket. I still like Hill Country better for that, though. I went with my mouth salivating over the thought of bbq'd pork belly and I was not disappointed when I saw it on the list of meats for the day. However, when I bit into the pork belly it was so SALTY. The fat was excellent, the meat (what little there was) was quite succulent. I had to stuff bread in my mouth to counteract the salty. I'm sad. As a lover of almost all piggy bits I wish they'd lower the salt on the belly. Maybe I just got an extra salty batch. My boyfriend had a few pork ribs, some brisket and a sausage. I had a 1/2 pound of pork belly, a sausage and some brisket with the half sour pickles. Half of what I had is in the fridge at work waiting for a lovely lunch time treat. I also picked up a small beans to see what all the fuss was about. It wasn't all that expensive because we didn't get very much.  It probably came out to $40-45 for the both of us with his  beer and my cream soda. While I went up to get to-go bags and the beans he ate my roll. The glare on my face was epic for all of 4 seconds. :P Luckily I asked for bread with the beans. Brisket: Good, but not as moist as Hill Country Sausage: Nice and flavorful, sort of reminded me of an italian sausage to my dismay. I still like the Elgin sausages (both from the source and those you can get at Dinosaur BBQ) Pork Belly: Deliciously fatty, but much too salty Pickles: Yum Cream soda: Meh The sweetish red sauce in the tallest container: awesome in small doses The chipotle (at least I think that's what it was) whatever red sauce in the smaller container: PASS. They really need some sides I'd spend money on. Boyfriend got the potato chips. Even just another potato side without ""salad"" in the name would be awesome.. or some greens (mustard, collared, kale, turnip, I'm not picky.. hell even some non krauted cabbage)","[1.0, 0.0]"

Ordered the artichoke and spinach slice and also shared a slice of marguerita.  The artichoke and spinach was definitely tasty, warm, very rich and cheesy (almost buttery??) but a little TOO rich for me.  The marguerita was yummy, but a little too much sauce and not enough cheese for me.  Nice touch with the sprinkle of parmesan on top, though. Tiny, hole-in-the-wall, place with no seating that only serves a few types of pizza: artichoke and spinach, marguerita, and crabmeat.  I'll be back to sample their crabmeat.  We ordered our's to go an d got ourslices in a box, then we decided to eat IN there while balancing our box on the 5-inches wide ""counter""...","[1.0, 0.0]"
Loved the refreshing non-alcoholic drinks they offered at lunch. Mine was grapefruit-infused and loved it. Had the hommus which was the smoothest and tastiest I have ever had. The Brussels Sprouts dish was delicious. The Lentil Soup was good but just a bit too salty. Would definitely dine here again.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have to admit... I must have walked by Larb Ubol a bunch of times. I mean, it's just another Thai place on 9th Avenue, right? Just another one out of 200 on the strip. Well, after a closer examination, I noticed that Larb Ubol flaunted that it was a Northern Thai place. That definitely piqued my interest so.. it was on! Strike 1: The waitress was not Thai. (I literally almost stopped there but I gave them one more try. So glad I did.) Not bad, Larb Ubol. Not bad at all. We ended up ordering a mess of dishes ranging from larb to yums to fish. The Som Tum (papaya salad) was amazing and lit me on fire. (Scott T. are you reading this?) The papaya was crisp, the flavors were balanced, and the heat was like Thailand during the summer months. Perfect. The puk boong (water spinach and pork) was okay... more pork than water spinach (the reverse of what I expected). The red snapper with chili sauce (plaa rad prik) was probably my favorite dish. A nice sized fish (not too small, not a mutant) fried to a perfect crispness and drenched in a very well balanced chili sauce. Definitely, not what I expected. Definitely more impressed that I expected to be. Nice job, Larb Ubol! See you next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Over rated. Then again, I didnt get the spaghetti or polenta that everyone was raving about--but it's pretty sad if nothing else on the menu list is outstanding. Dont get me wrong, the ambiance is exactly what you should expect from the MP District, the service was extremely helpful, the meal definitely enjoyable, but just so over rated. Ive definitely had better. We started off with the 3 choices of cheeses with fruit that complement the flavors: fig honey, beets and grapes. Very good. Best part of meal. Glad to finally be eating with someone that can have cheese! Had the otoro-tuna appetizer with uni. I love uni. But this was not good. The tuna is supposed to be the best fattiest part of the tuna...but maybe it was the combination of the uni that made this taste very fishy...yuck. For pastas we had the sweet breads and the stuffed mushroom. We finished it--just too salty and saucy for me. Dessert was pretty good--Im glad we did get the almond cake with the whip cream and cherries. Put a smile on our face. Over all experience was just 'meh' after reading all the reviews. Didnt ruin our night, but didnt leave us with a bang. Lower your expectations...it might turn our better for you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Finally made it here --  Surprisingly this restaurant has an awesome candlelit atmosphere inside that doesn't look like anything from the outside.  The type of atmosphere that makes you want to hang out there for hours. Ordered a regular and a the pie with meatballs, mushroom and golden raisins.  Raisins on a pizza?  Much to my surprise it was incredibly good. Didn't care for the meatballs.  The mushrooms were good and this was the best pie out of both of them.  The sauce was good but it needed more and the cheese was excellent. I didn't flip over the crust- I think that's why I give the 2 pizzas an a-okay rating-- it was good but I wouldn't go back to Brooklyn for it.  My guess is some of the more gourmet pies on their menu are probably more flavorful. I have a feeling my bf might make me return to this place.. I do have to add he says it is 5 stars,  although he thought the meatballs weren't to his liking!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Amazing, inventive food and great drinks served by the attentive staff.  Among the best chicken wings in town, oh yes!  From the simplest (popcorn dusted with brewer's yeast and cayenne pepper) to the more complex (aforementioned chicken wings; scallops over slices of duck), the fare here is sumptuous, surprising, and full of flavor.  They do both meat and vegetables incredibly well. And I also appreciated that in such a lively place, the noise level remains pretty low.  Rare in this city. In short: GO!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm a waffle eater. And the waffles here are amazing. As weird as it may sound to some, I think I would have preferred mine plain. The added toppings, ice cream, fruits, etc. seems to take away from the crisp subtle flavor of the waffle. But maybe that's just me. My boyfriend got one of the omelettes. I apologize I do not remember the exact one. Except that there was bacon in it. He liked it; he's a picky eater so I guess that means something. Go for it if you like eggs. Drinks: there is a huge blackboard with the drinks (alcoholic) menu written beautifully. And while I did not try any due to health reasons, this decor/marketing technique really works for me. The mochaccino on the other hand was amazing. (See? I got a drink! even though I normally just cheap out and drink water.) My only complaint would be the cramped space. I'm really paranoid about knocking stuff over when squeezing between table spaces. But good things come in small packages, I would  definitely recommend it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This was the first stop for my friends from Chicago when they got off the plane. We needed a hearty meal with a modern twist. The Brooklyn Star did not fail to deliver. First - you must order the cornbread. It will take some time to reach the table, because they are always made fresh - but your patience will be rewarded. Secondly - with mixology, and drinks being the current big thing in Brooklyn, you will appreciate the breadth of the bar options. For those who prefer lighter fair: The beer list is small, but compliments most preferences. Lastly, the ambiance is top notch. The Motown tunes play at the perfect level, and add that little extra something to the meal. I will be returning here sooner rather than later.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So the story starts with we few, we happy few, we band of brothers, barhopping in Hell's Kitchen. Following some vile pickle juice shots at Valhalla Bar, I, with bravado, declared, ""He who sheds his blood with me shall be my brothers!"" Seeing how my call to arms were falling on deaf, drunken ears, I then decided to charge on alone, while the rest of my crew called it a night by making their offerings by bowing before their porcelain god. Against my life partner's wishes, I did a lap around Central Park in the dark of night, and like the moon steering the grunions to shore, I slithered over to Halal Guys. I ordered the Chicken and Rice Platter, and dredged it with the White Sauce. Being drunk, I couldn't have legally consented to it, but my alter ego decided to add some Red Sauce to the plate against my sphincter's wishes (I paid for it the day after). My alter ego also had a conversation with Cuba Gooding Jr (""Hey, YOU were in that Disney Klondike Dog Movie and the Navy movie where the chain cuts off your legs!""), who seemed to appear out of nowhere, to ask me what was good to order.

"Nawlins joint on Staten Island.  Could either be amazing, or horribly wrong.  After all, Statnoylanders are known for flippin a nice piece of dough, not so much frying alligator meat.  So I went to investigate the matter with some cynical family members who think muffaletta is a dessert, and who could not pronounce ""etouffee"" if their lives depended on it.  Ahh, smh. The alligator bites were pretty good, but not great - but the sauces that they were served with were delicious.   The jambalaya was absolutely on point as the sausage was well seasoned and not toooo chewy, and we finished off with a layered chocolate dessert. Not typically New Orlean-ian, but delicious nonetheless.  When I took my fork out of my plate (and everyone else's) I could say with certainty that though my expectations weren't high, they were exceeded... so I guess that means it was good. A little more Staten Island than Nawlins, but I'm not complaining - for now, I'm just grateful that I can get sausage gumbo a few stops from the ferry.  Definitely recommended.","[1.0, 0.0]"

OMG... heaven! i don't even like waffles- but we all shared a huge one w/ strawberry sauce, strawberries and whipped cream. delicious. my overall experience was totally enjoyable. the server was adorable and attentive- our drinks were always refilled accordingly. we never waited for anything too long and checked up on regularly. i like that kind of service. i think the bathroom is peachy. very cute and french accents are memorable. my favorite part of the whole meal was just sitting under the glass skylight- letting the early afternoon's sunshine bathe my face. the fact that i'm in New York and i feel like i've escaped for a moment from that craziness really put a smile on my face. it was absolutely wonderful.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Full disclosure: I watched Harold's run through Top Chef and have been following his trails to get here since that season ended. So we came here for a birthday dinner (it was at 6pm, I got reservations way to close to the day, but that is my fault), it was a nice day outside so the front doors were open and the fans were on, it was very comfortable inside.  There are only about 20 tables in the restaurant, with a few of them being 'booths'.  There is no fu-fu garnish in any of the dishes, your plates should go back totally empty. The menu is very refined (8 first courses and 8 main courses), and everything was very well presented.  The waiter was very good, attentive and laid back.  On previous recommendations we got the spicy duck meatballs and the sea scallops, they knew we were sharing them, so they brought them out on 2 plates which was nice.  The meatballs were fantastic, and the scallops cooked very well, the meatballs win though.  Maybe because there were more, maybe because I have been talking about them since I left, not sure. For the main courses there was a John Dory special that was very nice, and a wild boar chop.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauces was delightful, and the portions were very good.  The wild boar was roughly 10"" circle of boar on the bone.  There was a very good breading, panko and good flavor, with greens on the top.  The vinegarette soaked into the boar and made it even better.  This is a hard choice, but I go with the boar, no the fish, I can not decide, they were both good. Now there are carnivores, omnivores, but I think that I am a desertavore myself.  I really do love desert.  So we had the apple and raisin crisp, served in the pan, and the dark chocolate tart.  The tart was good, rich, deep, refreshing, very easy to eat despite the amount already consumed; but the apple crisp was amazing.  I don't know how something that simple could be that good.  We really enjoyed it.  A lot.  The peppermint ice cream was divine, as well as the vanilla, very strong flavors in a small little package. This was a very good birthday meal, I would give it my full endorsement.  I watched as everybody's food as it came out, and it all looked good.  It is expensive, but what do you expect. The restrooms are two little private rooms in the back, decor carried through them, clean and stocked.  Sinks difficult to use a bit, but an overall good experience, 4.25 Flushes","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai is well worth whatever wait is required at the door.  The soup dumplings are the main attraction of this place. When you first go in, you have to give your name/# of party to the woman at the front with a clipboard.  (Note: you have to go back to her after a few minutes to confirm that you are still there and haven't left in order to secure your spot.  Otherwise, your name gets crossed off apparently) When you finally make it in, they seat you at one of the big round tables.  You WILL sit with other people you don't know.  Could make for an interesting story or two (: When I come with my friends, we always get a few orders of the pork dumplings and a lo-mein dish.  I also tried the kung pao chicken here, which is pretty good.  The dish portions are generous, but they charge extra for rice, fyi. Be careful of the hot soup dumplings! There's a certain finesse to eating these not-so-little (perfectly sized actually) morsels of delight. Poke a hole in the top to let out some of the heat/steam.  I like biting the whole top layer off and sipping some of the hot soup out and then devouring the rest once it's cooled down.  Yum!

"Lovely food, AMAZING cocktails. The Classic Old Fashioned is the best version I've had, period, and others we tried weren't far behind. The kitchen has a sure hand with fish as well as with heavier, meatier dishes, and careful thought seems to go into even the smallest choices. The housemade pickles that frequently pop up as a foil to some of the richer menu items are a delicious example of this attention to detail. The overall feel is similar to Marlow & Sons, but the prices are a bit gentler and the menu choice is wider. And yeah - the drinks are better.

"Came here for lunch on a Sunday around 1:00pm.  If you come in a small group you'll find seating relatively easily, but in a large group you'll have to wait a while.  Ambiance is good, and service is great.  The food, first of all, for a nyc midtown restaurant, is very reasonably priced (especially since they have lunch menu on Sundays as well!).  I boringly ordered the Pad Thai ($8) and it tasted great.  One thing I like about this place is that they're very versatile.  Anything you order you can put any protein into it or make it vegetarian.  They'll work with you, and I appreciate that.  So good ambiance, service, price, and food - why only 4 stars?  Because my friends ordered the fried rice with lump crab meat ($10) and some other dish I don't remember.  While I didn't get to try these two dishes, they looked so boring and plain that I have reservations about giving this place 5 stars.  But overall from what I have personally seen and tasted, it's a great place to have lunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I just got off the phone with a surprisingly rude delivery rep. I have Celiac disease, which means I can't eat gluten and I just found out that a couple of Mexican restaurants in the area have corn tortillas that contain gluten (which is news to me), so I called to ask if Guerro's tortillas were or were not gluten free. The first person I spoke to was male and was extremely unhelpful. I asked him if the tortillas were gluten-free and he told me he assumed so. I asked if he could make sure. He left and  came back on the lines shortly and told me they were gluten-free. I asked if he was sure. He said I had asked him to find out and he had asked someone and he didn't know what else there was that he could do. I said it is as simple as reading the package. He said oh, okay, in a sarcastic tone of voice, put me on hold, and a few minutes later a woman came on the line who told me the tortillas were gluten free. She was quite pleasant about this, until I asked her if she was sure and she also got defensive, saying that there was nothing on the ingredients list about flour so unless the ingredients list was wrong there should be no problem with the tortillas. I apologized for my overly-cautiousness but explained that it's a very serious allergy and I just wanted to make sure. I then proceeded to ask if I could place an order for delivery and in the middle of this sentence she hung up on me. I work at a restaurant that takes customer reviews and satisfaction extremely seriously, and I am really frustrated at the treatment that I just received. I understand it's Saturday night and it's busy, but representatives of restaurants need to be capable of dealing professionally with all customers, including those who have food allergies that are out of their control.

"Visited this place with a glowing recommendation of a friend.  I've had ramen at a few different places in the city but have never been to Japan so I don't have that to compare it to, but this is good stuff.   We started with the pork buns.  Amazing and probably the best part about this place.  I could have eaten 10 of them.  We also had a salad constructed of tofu, avocado and some type of roe on a bed of glass noodles with a balsamic & black sugar dressing.  I don't see it on the menu online so it may have been a special.  If it's available when you're there, it's very interesting and well worth it.   The ramen:  tried the miso ramen & the spicy pork ramen (extra spicy).  Both very good but I have to say the extra spicy, spicy pork was not extra spicy.  I would consider it mild.  The broth is extremely rich & the homemade noodles are good but halfway through, I was done.  It's so rich! It's true that the wait it about 45 minutes.  I went on a Sunday at about 1 in the afternoon.  The price is definitely more than some places but it's not unreasonable.  The service is excellent, the atmosphere is pretty inviting to conversation and the food is good. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that it wasn't as 5-star worthy as it could have been.  It is very good though.  I would definitely go back to try some of their other items. As a side note, if you have a chance, go to the basement.  Near the restroom, you can see a small (6 inch tall) window where you can see them making the noodles from scratch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"How I love to brunch at Balthzy. I've never been disappointed, whether eating their puffed pastry filled with yummy goodness, french toast that is outta this world, or their dreamy eggs benedict.

"I'm shocked to see the four stars here. For anyone who's ever eaten in Belgium, there's a big difference in the food quality. The French onion soup was just a bowl of cream without onion or real taste. The dame Blanche ordered looked and tasted nothing like a real one. The chocolate sauce didn't have real chocolate and when we explained about what a real dame Blanche was about (as friendly as possible) the waitress replied: ""Do I look like the cook? I'm not the cook!"" It was a feedback, and I hope it will somehow come through. Food was really not good, esp. For that price (60 usd per person).","[0.0, 1.0]"

Chef Yasuda's sashimi pick for us: blue fin tuna (I'm in total love with this), white fish, spanish mackeral Soup of the day (King Salmon) felt like chicken soup for the soul.

"You have to go here with a very specific frame of mind. That you want a change of pace from the pizza you usually get and that you CRAVE awesome Spumoni, and you are cool with fighting for the almost non-existent parking in the lot, and the guidos triple parked outside. Dont go there for glamour, or for a sit down gourmet meal inside (did that once and NOT worth it at all) Go there to sit on a metal bench, enjoy some tasty pizza (ya gotta order a least a full pie and share, or bring some home) and look around and take in the characters that go there, it is a specticle, but in a good way. Oh yeah...I did not see many flowers in this 'garden' but it is always a memorable experience if you go for the Sicilian pizza and spumoni desert, PERIOD.   (TASTES even better when you reheat the next day...so buy extra and bring home........NOT the spumoni,,the pizza!!!)","[1.0, 0.0]"
I went here with my cousin last month and it was packed so we had a drink and waited to get seats to eat at the bar. The food was all delicious. We had the ricotta app to split and it was awesome.

"Came here after the Yelp event last night and once again, it was a huge disappointment (although thankfully there was no line this time). It was still soggy and extremely salty. So much so that I couldn't eat part of it. Plus, the house red wine sucks. Boooo Grimaldi's, boooo. I'm bitter.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"How I heard of this place: In February of 2008, on my way to NYC for Fashion Week, someone on the flight from Los Angeles, California mentioned Grimaldi's. He said it's the place to go for pizza in the northeast. It came up again, while looking through a friends pictures (mobile uploads) on Facebook and coming across a steamy, bubbling, thin-crust pizza and learning that it, too, was from Grimaldi's. Type of cuisine: One antipasto, four pizzas (either small or large, regular or white), two calzones (small or large), a limited list of toppings and beverages, including sodas, juice, Snapple, still or sparkling water, beer or wine. And four desserts from which to choose, washing it all down with one of four hot beverages. Simple. Easy. But not mainstream.Ambiance: Their list of don'ts says it all: ""No credit cards. No reservations. No slices. No delivery."" Apparently less is more at Grimaldi's. Walk through the glass door at the front,only after being invited in by your host, an elderly gentleman wearing a pin-striped, dark grey button-up shirt with charcoal slacks, white suspenders and an almost-black fedora. The doors lead into a small lobby, which immediately opens onto the cramped quarters of what is Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn Bridge. Red- and white-checked tableclothes cover each table, but can hardly be seen among the dozens of patrons, loudly conversing and making ordering decisions. Metallic lamp-shades make their way down, over the tables, from the ceiling, resembling lights you might see in a dark room where mobsters gather to play poker. The white walls are covered in framed photographs of celebrities, politicians and other famous types who have dined at Grimaldi's over the years. Wait staff hustle and bustle through the mini-aisles created between tables and chairs to bring 18-inch pizzas to drooling, hungry patrons. Windows facing street-side at the front of the establishment give way to natural lighting, though the back still feels dimly lit. The wall to your far right and towards the back of the establishment, from where you enter, is full of boxes and supplies on garage-style shelving units. The kitchen, open to the restaurant, is blocked only by a marble-slab counter top and plexiglass, through which one can see the large containers of fresh vegetables, pepperoni and cheese. The coal-fire oven just behind, exude heat and flames, which light up the kitchen, as workers smile and toss pizza dough into the air until it is cardboard-thin. Pizza and calzones are placed on cubed stands  to allow for a bit of dining space, on plates, underneath. Two trays covering the entire table for four.   What I ordered: My husband, good friend from Queens and I decided to meet at Grimaldi's after a weekend in Brooklyn - me, for a conference, my husband, to hang out and take in the street festivals and sites - we could not leave without having finally sampled Grimaldi's pizza. I skipped the afternoon session of my conference to get lost on the subway and wait in a 33-minute line, underneath some construction scaffolding, along Old Fulton, before being called in by the old man wearing a fedora, and pin-striped suit with grey slacks, held together by white suspenders. The simplicity of the menu made it easy to decide: one, large, regular pizza ($14), which comes with fresh mozzarella, crushed tomatoes and basil, and the addition of pepperoni, Italian sausage, sliced onions, mushrooms and fresh garlic (additional $2 each). We also had to sample the large (18-inch) calzone ($16) with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, ricotta cheese, pepperoni and onions (additional $2 per topping applied here, too). To sip on, we had one Coke ($2) and two Olde Brooklyn Sodas ($2 each) in the Cream variety. When in Brooklyn...Right? What I loved: I loved the thin crust, the huge size of the calzone, the very fresh ingredients - from the soft and stringy mozzarella to the mushrooms and the basil, from the sausage that looked to have been rolled in house, to the crunchy, transparent onion slices...and, of course, the crunch of fresh chopped garlic, heaped to generous proportions on our pizza. Why I loved it: I love the simplicity of the menu and the bustling feeling of the space. I love the smallness of the interior and the greatness of the food. I love that there are nearly as many employees - from kitchen-staff to wait-staff as there are customers in the establishment. I love that we were squeezed in, between two other tables, and no one seemed to think anything of it. Cost: Average to high ($12-$16 per pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil or crushed garlic; additional toppings $2 each)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Been there 3 times and enjoyed every visit. First I came by myself and was so impressed that next time I invited my family and than couple of our friends. Here is my normal breakdown of my rating: -Food: so far we tried falafels, beef gyro, chicken shawarma, taboon, hummus, salads, Spanish eggplants, Moroccan beans, bourekas and dessert. Everything is handmade to order, so fresh, taste health and delicious. I love home made pitas and laffas, hot and tasty. Every time I bought extra to bring them home for my household enjoyment. Food is very fresh and consistent. I think they have best hummus and shawarma in town. -Décor: very tasteful, cozy, clean and charming. Great inviting atmosphere. It was a real pleasure to have our meal there. -Service: efficient and very hospitable. People are helpful and the manager kept checking up if everything is OK. I found great energy at this new place. -Price point: price is cheap for this variety and quality of food, especially in the city. On behalf of myself, my friends and my family I want to say Thank you, 'Hummus and Pita Co'. Great job! I would recommend going to this restaurant hands down. It is authentic, nice, has fresh, healthy food, grate selection of Mediterranean dishes and every aspect to become one of the most popular places in Chelsea. Try their baklava and almond cookies!

"Couldn't leave NY without trying David Chang's highly acclaimed pork buns..  So we came, we ate, and decided it was good.   The pork belly was prepared exactly how you would find it in a Korean dish called Bo Saam, which you can find in alot of Korean restaurants.  It was fatty, tender, and perfectly moist..  Think peking duck wrap but replace it with pork. We also tried the tendon plate and it wasn't very good.  Overally, It was very gelatinous and the only flavor was from the cilantro that they threw on top.  Not recommended! So yeah, while the pork buns are the talk of the town, I think having tried them once is enough.  I'll stick with my tradition Bo Saam, but congrats to Momofuku for doing a great job fusion-ing it!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

A high end surprise experience when we expected a 'grille'-like casual restaurant. Service extremely professional and knowledgeable on menu and wine list. Oysters and a truly al dente pasta app made for tasty starters. I had the whole branzino- grilled and flavored to perfection and the wife had the lobster which she thought was excellent. Milk choc malted cake seemingly deconstructed along with a brioche bread pudding closed out our meal. Comfortably full and extremely satisfied albeit for some big$$$- but felt it was completely worth it.

"So what can I possibly add to the 138th review of this place that hasn't already been said?

Mmmm wait! Don't forget to order the hot artichoke dip, the sausage w/ asparagus entree and the mac & cheese. Oh and for dessert we had the fruit crisp which was very good, light almost but yeah, not really. It was just 3 girls and man, we beasted! ...And if you're really lucky maybe your aesthetically pleasing (but oh so young) waiter will rub your back and flash a flirty grin atcha a few times during the course of the meal. Might that have been compensation for the patchy service? Well whatever, I'll be back a few more times - even if its just for the back rubs.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ippudo is cool.  I've walked by it a bunch of times before I was actually able to try it out because I love ramen.  And in case you need me to qualify how much l love ramen, I've been known to beeline to ramen shops in the middle of a sweltering and humid Tokyo summer. Ippudo is a busy and bustling place.  There is a wait but there's also a bar right by the entrance so you can have a few drinks before being seated.   The ramen is good (not great) but the interiors are cool.  Ippudo feels more like a hip bar that happens to serve ramen instead of a proper ramen house.  An authentic ramen shop would be a small space specializing in one thing -- ramen.   More than 3/4 or the staff weren't even Japanese which isn't a deal breaker but the authenticity of a Japanese restaurant has more cred when you see an older Japanese man behind the counter who has been making (and perfecting) his ramen broth over a few decades. I love a ramen house where the owner will cook one (or a few) pots of broth for the entire day and when that's finished he closes shop for the day.  Instead I see NYU kids serving up bowls of soup in a trendy restaurant. Is the food good?  Yes.  Does it feel authentic?  Not so much.  Would I go back.  Absolutely but  Ippudo is a place where you want to go when you don't want to trek all the way uptown to Totto Ramen.  Ippudo is a place where you want to go when you've got a ramen craving but you want to take someone to ""a nice/trendy place."" The communal style seating is cool.  The crowd is hip.  The interiors are stylish and in a very contemporary Japanese way.  Ippudo is a popular spot so my 3 stars isn't probably going to have much affect on it's street cred.  If you're downtown and on the east side with a craving for ramen -- hands down go to Ippudo.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Breakdown: Nuggets were bland and dipping sauce was just mustard Iron Man was an undercooked flatbread with vegan mayo and steamed kale with a few undercooked shitakes tossed on top Tapoica was good but the sugar cookie in it was stale and soggy.

"Overdue review! When travelling back to NY this past May I was excited to see my friend and when she asked what I wanted to have for dinner I told her ramen. There seems to not be any slamming ramen restaurants in the Pacific Northwest so I was hoping to be impressed and Ippudo definitely lived up to the hype! I've been told that this place is notorious for the dreaded 1.5 hrs+ wait regardless of what day of the week it is (in fact the friend I was with had walked over to another restaurant, ate some soba, walked back to Ippudo and still waited a bit for her table) but we only had to wait maybe 20 minutes! Lucky! Get the buns with the shrimp omg! And whatever ramen is their special of the day. Seriously, you won't regret it.

"Heard the place had opened and dropped in for brunch this past Sunday (10.5). We ate outside and then decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar just to get the feel of the bar/dining room. The outdoor space is really pleasant. Shady, spacious, and the smell of the smoker gets this Texan tummy rumbling. Inside had a cozy vibe, with the fireplace and all. They've created plenty of seating around the edges of the room, but there's lots of space between seating and the large, horseshoe-shaped bar, so it seems like on busy nights they'll be able to accommodate a large crowd without being crowded. There's also a front room, which is quite large and very nicely decorated, but I'm having trouble figuring out exactly what they've got in mind for that room. There's not a lot of seating, and I didn't notice a stage/music area... guess we'll wait and see. Overall, though, the place is well put together and inviting, and its large windows keep it beautifully bright and well lit, so there's finally a spot nearabouts for a couple of beverages in the afternoon that don't have you stepping outside dazed and blinded (ahem, Lincoln Tavern). So in terms of atmosphere, it's a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. The food, considering we were there for 1st brunch, was quite good. We had the wings to start, and they were cooked perfectly, juicy with crisped skin. The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, I always tend to spicy, but that's just a matter of preference. That said, I would *prefer* it if there was a spicy sauce as good as the sweet sauce. I had the caponata sandwich, which was delicious, and my wife loved her omelette. Then we had the stone-fruit pie that they'd brought in from a local bakery and it was super-good. Had a great experience with service as well. Our waiter was nice and attentive, despite having quite a crowd on his hands and a brand new menu to work with. The bartender was very friendly, chatty without being intrusive, and worked hard to be welcoming. TL;DR- Extremely happy to have this place in the neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went here last night and the food is amazing:) Here is a breakdown for my rating: 4 starts because: 1) The food was amazing. 2) The place is a cute place in the west village. 3) The manager gave us a second plate of dessert on the house. 4) The eggplant parmesan and the pasta with garlic / olive oil are amazing. The reason for not giving the extra star for the 5 stars: 1) The place is extremely small and when you are sitting there, the waiters are struggling to get through the aisles because the seats are packed together in a tight, confined place. 2) The place is a bit loud and noisy, which is fine (not a big deal). 3) When we arrived, it took a good 10 minutes to get a waiter to help us with drinks, even though we asked about 3-4 times to get someone to help us - I get it...the place is busy and is very, very good. But, they could certainly have some more waiters on staff to accommodate the large crowd, relative to the small place. Overall, this is a hidden gem and I will definitely be going back,.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went to Jane yesterday for Brunch after hearing so many good things about it for so long. Although the menu didn't exactly intrigue me from the get-go, the long lines and great feedback was enough to lure me in. And so the hubby and I went, and all I can say is... Eh. We ordered the pasty basket, the portabello scramble and the benedict johnny with a coffee and green tea each. All I can say is the pasty basket was the saving grace because everything else was unremarkable. The portabello scramble (which I had) was good, but nothing that would make me come back again. It also came with rosti (similar to a thin hash brown patty) which was very unsatisfying. I would've rather had the side of potatoes that came with most of the rest of the brunch dishes. The benedict johnny (which is supposed to be popular) didn't exactly amaze my husband either. The pasty basket, however, was definitely a keeper. I loved every single pasty that came in the basket. The blueberry muffin was really moist, as was the cherry scone, the biscuit was nice and buttery without being too overwhelming, and the donut was just the right texture and sweetness (again without being too overwhelming). I'd go back there just for that, and probably just to take out. Also, the decor was very unappealing. I didn't find it cozy, chic or interesting. It was pretty much a room that could've been designed for almost anything, even a hotel lobby -- very generic and pretty boring. Overall, I can't say that I'd go back on my own. If a friend asked, I'd go just b/c it was fine enough. As with almost anywhere though, I'd be willing to give it a second try if only to try their well-received challah french toast.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here twice now. Both time have been for eggs and bacon. The eggs come with home fries and salad. Servers are nice, atmosphere is pretty and even though the dining area isn't tremendous, they do a nice job of making it feel open and spacious. I wish the home fries were a bit more crisp and less seasoned with rosemary. My pop ordered french toast that he liked but he wished they gave him butter in addition to syrup. We were too lazy to ask for any. And we didn't get why they served homefries with french toast maybe it should be replaced with extra fruit salad or a small green salad. The chocolate froid is DELICIOUS. Highly recommend it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Upon my trip to the Big Apple, I did a little (a lot) of research on places that were good to visit for food. On the top of that list was a place for banh mi, as where I live (London, UK) leaves me feeling ripped off and disappointed every time. I fell head over heels with these sandwiches when I was a kid and was visiting my family in Canada. Anyway, I digress. Banh Mi Saigon was relatively easy to find from my hotel in the Financial District, we walked in with just 15 mins to spare before closing (7pm), resisted the urge to buy jewellery and walked straight to the back counter and ordered 2 number 4's (banh mi pate cha, $4.25 each), both spicy. We took our sandwiches to go and devoured them back at the hotel at 5am (jet lagged)  and it didn't disappoint. Amazed to see how packed the sandwiches were (compared to the meagre portions you get back home) we chomped our way through the crunchy, slightly sweet and sour 'do chua', merge with the meaty, livery pate, headed with the corriander herb (you say cilantro) and a surprise wake up with the slice of jalapeno hidden well inside. Between each bite we would utter the words ""mmm so good"" to each other, that was the extent of our conversation. Maybe we wasn't quite used to the portions but we couldn't finish the second half and decided to save it for later. Needless to say, I wish I could smuggle a few back home.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I devirginized her! Oh yes. Ki G didn't know what was coming. Unfortunately, it was underwhelming. We rolled into Lombardi's at a quarter past 12 and were seated promptly. A small margahrita pie, please. And that's when we realized... Just because something is the first, it doesn't mean it's the best. I'm a cheese lover. And not so much of a sauce lover. I know the mozzerella is supposed to be fresh. That's awesome. I'd just like to see more of it on my pie. A pizza is dough, sauce and cheese. I really shouldn't be looking for one of the ingredients. Why call it a pizza? Just call it Saucy Dough or something. Speaking of sauce, if you're going to hand make the sauce, make it right. Ki complained that it was bland. I complained that it was too sweet but that's about the only thing I tasted since there was no complexity. It may as well have been from a jar. It may have tasted better. Maybe it was something special back in the day but it's nothing outstanding today. That's for sure. And for cheese lovers like me, you'll be disappointed. Overall taste is just average. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So tonight we decided to give the place a second chance.  We live in the neighborhood and were coming home from a movie.  The place we though would have a lively ""bar"" or ""nightcap"" scene.  We entered the door and walked up to the bar to be greeted by an awestruck bartender with a hipster mustache who had to ask the hostess if the restaurant was still open or not.  Clearly it must not have been as two tables were sat, and 6 other people were having drinks at the bar.  It must have been closed.  So the two of us as well as the three behind us left in a embarassed fury and happened to walk right past the owner.  Maybe hipsters should stick to EMO and Music and stop opening restaurants.  Who TRAINS these people. Terrible Terrible Terrible.  We are going to give it one more shot, after all, they did just opened....and it is Greenpoint.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The hand pulled/knife cut noodles are authentic, however, and unique. I asked for tea, and she just poured two cup fulls on these tacky styrofoam cups (same with water-they just leave a pitcher of water without ice on each table, for you to serve yourself.  At least make it cold!). It's cheap, however.  $15 was enough for me and my boo, including tax 'n tip.  Oh, and this joint isn't fancy or anything, and be prepared to share tables meant for 4 when it gets crowded (meaning 15+ people in the room).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"i can understand why people complain so much about price.... you get what you pay for! This place is truly one of a kind, from the moment i walk in to the moment i am walking out the staff is attentive and wonderful.

The food is so fresh and is full of taste along with elegant preparations. My favorite dishes are the rigatoni bolanese which is fresh grounded veal (not like other places that give you frozen beef that was bought at the supermarket next door), the shrimp scampi is so good and fresh, the shrimp are a wonderful size for the price, the porterhouse steak for two is truly enough for me and my fiancee to eat and we love to eat. i have to add the chicken parmigiana  which is sooooo good i cant believe how big the portion is, and the chicken Marsala (mmmmm) The waiter always recommends a wonderful bottle of wine to go along with my dish at the time and he hits it right on the spot every time (we also get complimentary grapa). you have to go there yourself to experience it honestly.

"I was never big on Italian food until I met my boyfriend last year. He's polish but his blood practically runs on marinara. He LOVES Italian food. Last night I took him out for his birthday to this well known Italian joint. He's been there once but it was my first time. We've been to quite a few Italian restaurants in the city but he always referred Trattoria L'incontro as being one of the best.   I gave this place 4 stars because I too, am a sucker for ol' authentic Italian restaurants and  because the service here is impeccable. The waiters are extremely attentive and are give very good suggestions if you're indecisive of the menu. They change your plates like ninjas. Seriously, after I took the last bite of my calamari, I glanced back down and had a new clean plate for the second appetizer. It took 5 minutes for the waiter to recite all the specials for the night. Literally. I was so impressed. I think I might of applauded. We ordered the fried calamari, ravioli stuffed with mushrooms, venison meatballs (I think?) , the baked salmon and had tiramisu for dessert. I kind of regret not ordering from the specials menu. This is where I feel like we took a wrong turn. Though all the dishes were good and plentiful, they did not blow us away. The breading of the fried calamari had a nice texture, but the calamari itself was pretty generic. I really liked the ravioli. The mushrooms were packed with flavor. The meatballs and salmon were cooked well and had a good taste but like I said, nothing out of the ordinary. The tiramisu was also good but  had more of a bitter/tart taste than I would of preferred. When it comes to Italian food, this place is the real deal however I don't feel like we got the best out of the restaurant based on the selections we made.

"Stone Park being a fancy place and all, we decided to stop in for brunch.  It was quite frenzied, but because it was raining, we were able to find a seat  outside under a large awning.  The hostess warned us that she couldn't move us inside if we decided we didn't want to sit out there, but it was perfectly dry.  So we got a table immediately instead of waiting for forty-five minutes, which was nice.  I had the cheese grits, which are mixed with scallions and topped by a poached egg.  The cheese had a fine crust on the top and the flavor was almost perfect.  The only thing that kept them from being the best cheese grits I've had in the city is that they had a very slight metallic tang.  It may be the iron ramekin they were served in.  Maybe they should go with ceramic.   Also, I would've liked at least a piece of toast on the side.  It's a pretty small dish.  The hubs had the rib meat hash, or whatever it's called.  I stole one of his pieces of toast, which was really tasty and buttery.  The food was definitely good, and because of the rain and the death metal band playing at the street fair on the corner, we were left to our leisure.  However, I wouldn't wait around in the rain to eat here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Amazzzing BBQ brisket was had at Mighty Quinn's @ Smorgasburg in DUMBO today.  $5 got us a small brisket sandwich (the large is $9) and each bite was heavenly goodness.  We saw they had the longest line of all the food vendors so we got in line and waited, curiosity getting the best of us.   Each bite was filled with mouthwatering, tender, juicy cuts of brisket that is so well smoked and marinated, you wonder if they put drugs into the marinade.  I love how enthusiastic the workers were too - they were incredibly proud of their procedures and the final products they produce, telling me it was going to be the best thing I ate for the day (it was).  Thumbs-up all around :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food is GREAT and I have always loved coming here, BUT last Saturday 3/1/14 was the last time I ever step foot in this place. We got there at 11pm and were seated right away, but the bouncer who asked us how many, would turn to the hostess, who would look at you and your party and if you didn't fit her criteria, you were denied. Never once, over the next hour of letting people in and denying others, did she look at her manifest to see what tables were free. The only way she  decided whether people could get in was based on their look. For them to be so openly discriminatory towards paying patrons who just want a good meal I cant rock with.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Unfortunately this is not a review about the food... it's about their customer service.   They obviously have gotten to the point where they get so many customers they don't care about the new ones they could gain.  We made reservations for 7 pm for 2 people.  I had another friend joining.. so we decided, we'll just go before the rush  at 6:30 pm and try to eat dinner for 3 people. Hostess was incredibly rude.. said she could not accomodate us.  The restaurant wasn't full at all.  The place is small so I suspect that's the reason why it's hard to score reservations at this spot... she pointed a spot at the bar where our reservations were for.  There was plenty of space to fit another person. Dissapointed they wouldn't even try to accomodate us.. like I said, I guess they have made so much money that they don't try with customers.  I'll try to come again next time.. but really horrified how mean they are.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You only have two damn pies, ever. How hard is it to make even a decent pie? It's not! Jello pudding in a pillsbury crust would be better than this nonsense.

"5 stars mostly because I did not have to wait on a line. Go on a weekday and get there by 12:00pm sharp for an unforgettable lunch. By scanning the reviews, it looks like there are long lines for this popular place, so take off on a Monday if you're working and check it out. They were SO nice and accommodating. It's visible when people enjoy their job, or at least are good at it. Bartender was really nice while I waited for my friend. They do things right and the food tastes great.

"We got lucky. Senario: Sunday night we walked in at 10:30 pm, people were standing in the door way waiting for tables. My date has very good eyes and spotted 2 chairs at the bar. Sat down right away. Bar tender quickly gets you waters and asks for your drinks. Had pacifico with lime, awesome. The tacos were great for New York. This place is a good fix if you really need mexican food. Their guacamole was good, but I've had better in New York and it's kind of expensive $10. The tortilla chips served with the guacamole were pretty good, I can tell they were home made, not from scratch but fried and salted. This place gets kind of expensive, but I guess it's not so bad considering the area it's in. Would I like this place if I had to wait for 20-40 minutes for a table, probably not. The immediate bar seating definitely helped me like this place. Nice concept, Mexican restaurant with Chinese decor hence Chino. Would I go again? Yes, IF there is no line.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"i have no idea why ppl say this place has the best pizza in the NYC. me and my boyfriend have been there once, after dumbo dance festival, and we waited about 30 minutes (we went there around 6pm). waiting is okay, cuz i know this place is really famous. and a small boy with restaurant t-shirts and doing host, was pretty impressive. haha anyways we ordered pizza, tomato sauce, italian sausage, and mushroom,, and ricotta cheese. and two lemonade juice or something. first, the juice was terrible. was sooo artificial and i've never heard of that brand. second, the pizza was wet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why it was wet?????????????/ they said if you add ricotta cheese, it gets little wet but our pizza was totally soaked!!!! damn. the process making pizza was pretty interesting so while i was waiting for bathroom, i was standing near them and watched them. but the pizza was just big. not good at all. if you are really pizza person, go to waldy's pizza. cheese is better, everything is fresh, it's wood oven(not coal oven like here). i think it's much better just get some pizza from any deli than waiting 1 hour here.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The food was disappointing, I was expecting better because of the rave reviews =\ I also felt pretty ripped off because you're forced to order from their prix fix menu for brunch. $19/person! So this becomes a pretty pricey brunch for Brooklyn. However, if you account for the unlimited bloody marys and mimosas... then this is a pretty good deal. I had the poached pear and spinach salad to start. The poached pairs were definitely canned :( my baked eggs on polenta were unevenly baked. One egg was still runny while the other was cooked through all the way. It was also quite bland. I never add salt to my dishes but I had to add a pretty hefty shake of salt to make this edible.

"I finally went to sushi Yasuda for lunch before we plan a festive dinner in the near future and it was highly disappointing. Actually I have never had this terrible sushi for a long time even in NYC. It was worse than refrigerated take-out sushi. I know Monday is the worst day of the week for sushi and the prefix lunch would be much worse than omakase at the sushi counter, but the sushi restaurant with such a reputation should not serve that crappy sushi at that price. The decor is simple but clean; the service is swift and nice (They gave us numerous cups of tea without noticing it). But the most important thing: sushi was terrible, which I cannot believe they thought the customers would not complain about. It was unforgivably insulting to Japanese sushi connoisseurs. I ordered prefix sushi and my friends chirashi. Sushi rice was not cooked and seasoned well. It was al dente in a bad sense. It should not be soggy but it should not be too firm either. We even suspected they are using some old rice. And it was salty!!  Seafood smelt fishy and tasted too soft and salty. I wanted to use soy sauce to erase the fishiness but I could not, because it is already too salty without soy sauce. Again, we suspected they are using old seafood and sprinkle some salt to fake freshness. My friends had chirashi and the waitress told us that they have soy sauce on it. It is a bad idea and we could not understand the reason why they did that. Soy sauce was even on the rice and nevertheless to say, chirashi was also too salty. We mentioned that to the waitress. She said she would escalated that, but there was no feedback from chefs. No explanation, no apology. They don't seem to care about the customer feedback. Maybe they stop making efforts because they already have a good reputation. But they will fail sooner or later, unless they change their attitude and improve the quality. I already started to spread the bad word about this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hagi is awesome! Great Izakaya-style restaurant with some amazing dishes (the wagyu beef was great, should have ordered more) that my other favorite Japanese restaurants don't serve, or do them differently. I would advise, however, against going right after work on a Friday night. The wait can be brutal. But if you do, you'll find that it's worth it. The place is downstairs of Iroha, another Japanese restaurant right next door to Sapporo (my favorite Friday afternoon Japanese spot). Each of the three has its own focus, with Iroha for sushi lovers, and Sapporo for ramen. But if you're looking for real food, Hagi is the place. I would characterize the atmosphere as loud and crowded. You're packed in pretty tight, and because of the close proximity to other diners, there's competition to be heard at your own table. Nevertheless, it's pretty typical of NY and Tokyo, as well. The staff is excellent and the food comes pretty quickly. About $40 - $45 per person with tip.  But that included a bottle of sake, we ate a sh*t-load of stuff (all good), and it's Midtown / Times Square. Despite the location, I like that it's not very touristy. There were two items we contemplated, but didn't try - tempura pizza and mini corn dogs - so I'm sure to return soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The main thing is that we trust Applewood.  What I mean is that there are loads of restaurants who have jumped on the ""farm to table"" bandwagon and they may use an organic item or two.  Applewood's the real deal though.  They don't go out of their way to promote their local sourcing, but if you ask anyone there anything about the menu items, they always know where things came from and how they were grown or raised.  That is completely unusual and, for us, totally appreciated. Did I mention that the food rocks?  Well...the food rocks.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The food was excellent and if I was rating the restaurant on food alone, i would give it top ranking. The service was unfortunately poor - wine not being poured; our wine with main course arrived as I ate my last mouthful of my dish; a dessert was delivered that wasn't ordered; despite informing staff of an allergy petits-fours arrived containing the offending item without any warning. The sommelier when asked for wine recommendations did indeed offer suggestions however on the more expensive side. He didn't check budget or offer a selection against different price bands which again was disappointing.

"This review is for Lillie's incredibly bad events coordination/coordinator.   I called two months ago requesting if they close down their restaurant for weddings/parties/receptions.   They said they did.  I was later contacted by their events coordinator/specialist - we'll call her 'C.'   C took down my information, what I was looking to do and said she would get back to me with cost estimates for our wedding reception.   We both agreed she would get quotes for a Saturday, Sunday or Monday reception.   I waited a week for her to call, nothing, and then called her.  I got her on the phone and she said she was still working on it because the owners were out of town.  I waited another 5 days, nothing, I called back.   The woman on the phone said C was busy and she would have to call me back.   I waited another 5 days.  Nothing.  I called back on the 5th day and finally got C on the phone.  She didn't apologize for never getting back to me and said ""Saturday would cost X amount.""  I replied: ""Ok great, and what are the estimates for Sunday and Monday like we discussed?""  She responded that she didn't ask and would get back to me. That was 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard from her.   I don't get it.  We have 45K to spend (which is actually more than you asked for) and we want to give you our business because we like your restaurant but apparently C doesn't seem to think you guys need our money.   If you guys can't handle a simple call-back/cost estimate - I doubt you would be able to give your customers the attention they would need in order to host an event.  We won't be dining at your establishment anymore.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I live in the neighborhood and have been going to this spot since they opened. It has become my all time favorite restaurant. Sure it's a long wait but it's well worth it. The host are always more then accommodating. Julian one of the owners is more then jolly and handles the hectic night crowd with such grace he makes it look easy. So the service to me is good, though I wouldn't mind being able to walk right up and have a seat to sit at the wait is the price I will pay to have a lovely fresh meal. I also love coming here for breakfast during the week or lunch, you can pretty much always get a seat and its a good deal for quality. The chicken is my favorite, their pasta is always on point, and all the veggies are fresh and in season. The chefs cheese and anti pasta starter is amazing, I'm addicted to the fennel and I am smitten with the cocktail The New Rider. Desserts are a treat as well! Hurray for Rucola!

"I'm one of those ""haven't eaten here yet"" reviews that I find so annoying, but I think most people have been burying the NO ALCOHOL thing and I feel like that's pretty essential to dinner planning. I researched the place and missed that. Showed up on a Friday night to find it essentially empty and immediately knew they didn't have a liquor license. Why else would such a highly rated joint be empty on a Friday? Not only was the no drinks thing a drawback but I enjoy the vibrancy of a full restaurant. And you can't even bring your own. They've been waiting 6 months for a license so for the sake of the restaurant, and what sounds to be amazing food, I will go back and support them. And I will update accordingly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stopped by for lunch here this Saturday and was not disappointed. I ordered the breakfast burrito.  Couple of things: 1) They should serve more salsa with the burrito. They also served fries with the burrito, which I thought was a bit strange.  I'm a fan of fries, though, so it worked for me.  The homefries that came with the omelettes looked delish, I think I may ask for those next time.  The breakfast burrito itself was pretty great, it wasn't obnoxiously large but the perfect size and the tortillas were solid.  Tortillas MAKE a burrito, let's be real, so that is important.  I'm also skeptical of black beans in a burrito but they tasted like home-cooked beans so it worked for me. 2) the bread basket that came immediately as we sat down was good but nothing spectacular.  One person I was with raved about the butter that came with the bread, but I didn't find anything to be great about it OR the accompanying fruit bread. 3) The mimosas were light on the alcohol, but good.  It's pretty darn hard to mess up a mimosa. 4) Undecided if I will go back.  The ambiance was nice, the decor lacked a bit of character.  There's so many great places and I can't say that the burrito was something I probably couldn't get at another brunch joints, so no, probably won't go back until I've eaten everywhere in this city.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After my curiosity was peaked by Anthony Bordain's praise of the Bahn Mi sandwich on ""No Reservations"" I decided to check out yelp and find a decent place somewhere in the city to grab one. Luckily They had a highly rated place near Sunset Park.  A friend and myself traveled to ""Brooklyns Chinatown"" on 8th avenue to Ba Xuyen after seeing such high ratings on Yelp. The place is a ""neighborhood joint"". Nothing fancy. But I have to admit, the Bahn Mi sandwich was pretty good and so was the Durian Shake. The roast pork sandwich was a bit disappointing due to its lack of meat. Giving this place 5 stars is way to much than it deserves IMO. As far as price goes, It was pretty good for what you get, but not what the menu on this site states. The sandwich used to be $3.75 and is now $4.50 and the Durian shake used to be $2.75 and is now $3.25.

"The first time I came here I painstakingly had to dip after about an hour of waiting due to a non believer. So be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait.  I know, awesome, right! I got turned on to BuzzTable here, which doesn't make it any less of a wait, but gives you a vague idea of when your table might be ready. And waiting this visit gave me an idea of how I'm going to approach it next time.  And there will be a next time. Go in, they check you in on their Ipads.  Go to the bar, order drinks and appetizers. Stay calm and carry on.  The bartender has a tattoo on her tricep of an avocado that says ""Made in California"".. hahaaaaaaaaaa.  The best.  I love this place.  We did the pork buns, the other 6 million people who raved about them in their reviews wernt lying. When buzztable texts you and tells you you're table is ready, go stand by the mirror wall and don't harass the kid flying back and forth with people into the dining room, he'll either ask you your name or call it out.  And when he does, it's on, buckle up. You walk into the dining area and everyone is screaming something or other in Japanese, even the white kids.  I couldn't help but laugh, to me that's fun. You may need to sit at a communal table, also fun.  I've been to Japan, it felt like I was in a dream about it. I had the classic, she had the wasabi... both of these ramen bowls were incredible. Great place to bring a group, you get a great big booth table, but not a good place to linger, the pace in this place is fast (Just like most noodle places in Tokyo). Just dipped my toe into the pond of this menu, can't wait to go back. If you have them, don't bring your kids.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Let's be clear -  if you come into The Spotted Pig expecting the style and quality of any old pub, you're going to be disappointed. It is an extremely high quality restaurant, with a carefully and very well done casual atmosphere that resembles a crowded and homey pub. That doesn't mean you won't wait forty minutes to get a table. That doesn't mean you won't be spending 8 dollars on draft beer. And that certainly doesn't mean that you'll be getting your typical cheeseburger. This isn't classic pub food. Its a modern, expensive, and a little more... fancy version of it. Don't be surprised when you get blue cheese on your burger, try to have an open mind towards some well-done experimentation. The fritters were perfection. The oysters were fresh, cold, and came with a great tangy dip sauce. The artichoke salad was light with an incredibly flavorful dressing. I ordered the burger and it was cooked a perfect medium rare. although my recommendation would definitely be the lamb-chops. They are tender and juicy, and come with an incredible fried potato that defies explanation and two intensely flavored pork sausages. By far my best eating experience thus far in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Strictly food speaking, the place was only A-OK. I know everyone else recommended the catfish burrito, but honestly, I did NOT like it!! The fishiness just permeated the burrito and so it didn't taste good at all. However, the CUBANO on a SANDWICH is highly recommended. It's savory, like a nice Philly cheese steak, but somewhat....different (in a great way). I seriously never tasted anything quite like it, and I am amazed at its novelty. The corn is not like anything I've ever had before. It tasted pretty good, but I felt like it was bit forced in that they added so much seasoning on it that I could barely taste the corn itself. I still recommend it, though, because after all, it IS one of their specialties. I have to admit that they did a great job of not overcooking it though. Nothing's worse than trying to nibble soggy, squishy kernels off the cob. Overall, the portions are a bit small, but it's enough to keep you satisfied. More than anything, I loved the milieu. It's a very cute place, full of vibrant colors. The outdoor seating is self-seated and family-style arrangement. I could see it being a great bar scene at night, so perhaps I will return for it's nightlife. As for now, I won't be coming back for the food any time soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"There was a point in my life when I was ADDICTED to these tacos...I would come here at least 3 times a week.  SO SO GOOD. They're VERY generous with their meat, rice, beans, gauc, and condiments....LOVE them for that! (unlike Chipotle's dinky portions for each) As for the hot sauce, I always opt for the extra hot sauce which is insanely hot because it's made with habanero peppers!  They should seriously bottle this stuff up and sell it, I'd buy it by the gallons!  Sometimes it make me cry and brings me too much pain to finish my tacos, but I make it through and am always satisfied. I also like how they sell each taco individually so you can mix and match...I like getting two steak and one carnitas....or if you're not very hungry, you can always just get one taco, but getting just one taco is just silly!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The ambiance is utterly appealing to those who favor eclecticism in a 19th century cozy mode, which includes me.  I loved it.  We came in for late night dessert and drinks.  The desserts were OK but the apple crisp should have used tart apples, especially in NY State in mid-October when they are at their peak and readily available.  The bartender, a white female perhaps in her 30's, had one of the worst attitudes I have encountered in the service industry.  The term ""bitch face,"" which I have never applied to anyone, fit her perfectly.  It seemed a pain for her to serve us, before we even had opened our mouths.  The three of us, two with extensive  restaurant and bar tending experience, would have ordered more had she not been so off-putting.  I would hate to live in her head.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I just came back from dinner there tonight... it was my first time!  We arrived just before 8pm and it was packed.  We were told the wait time would be 1 hour and 20 minutes, but we were seated at 8:45pm.  The decor is really nice.... its kind of loud, but its a really unique/cute spot.  We were seated in this really cool booth, which faced the open kitchen.  But, it looked like there were other long tables that were shared by multiple parties, so I think that if you wanted a spot with some privacy, request the booth!   We ordered the pork buns as an appetizer and they were really good.  I've never had pork buns like these- they were assembled sandwich style, had mayo, and good spicy kick!  We each ordered ramen, which was beautifully presented.  But, I think that of the three types of ramen we had, all three soups were a little on the salty side.  This is unfortunate because I would be more inclined to go there more often if I didn't feel like I would get high blood pressure or something...

I was able to enjoy a tofu and mixed vegetable plate that was delicious and the shallot pancakes came with a sweet dipping sauce and were definitely my favorite part of the meal. The bean curd and spinach dish that I ordered was greasy and weird and I wouldn't recommend it.

"Came here with 2 buddies and I tried their equivalent of Banh Mi Nem Nuong grilled minced pork with sweet glaze from Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli.  I had also tried their Banh Mi Pate pate supreme. pork liver pate, vn salami, vn ham equivalent a few days prior.   The reason for the 4 stars is because they were more consistent with delivering excellent sandwiches on 2 different occasions. Banh Mi Nem Nuong grilled minced pork with sweet glaze: I have to preface that I've never tried this type of sandwich back in CA so I can't compare it to back home but according to my friend, it's much better back at home.  In any case, I liked this a lot.  Everything was well balanced.  The glaze wasn't too sweet and I had no issue with the seasoning or pork.  I think mincing up the pork allows for more of the flavor to come through. Banh Mi Pate pate supreme. pork liver pate, vn salami, vn ham: The pate here is really good!!  However, I definitely prefer Saigon Vietnamese' pate more.  The pate here is less flavorful and feels like it's missing a component.  I think the Saigon Vietnamese pate adds 2 different types of pate together.  If they do it here, it wasn't strong enough and one pate overpowered the other. The store is really nice.  Spacious and lots of bar stool seating.  From the outside, you would expect the place to be air conditioned, but boy was I wrong.  I was deceived!!  I wish this store had AC, would make the experience more enjoyable.

"When one of my fellow neighbors and Vermont ski bums announced he'd be celebrating his birthday here, I was immediately intrigued by the ""Vermont-Style Pizza"" they boast.  I mean, c'mon, we're in NEW YORK here...how's this place going to hold up in the middle of TriBeCa?!  Well it turns out I was delightfully satisfied and admittedly wrong in that negative assumption! With three existing locations in Vermont and an assortment of flatbreads in grocers' frozen aisles, this is American Flatbread's first NYC restaurant.  They've got a spacious setting and high ceilings, with traditional wait-serviced tables to the left, a bar area to the right, and a huge clay oven surrounded by sushi bar-style seating right smack in the middle of all the action!  This is where all the magic happens, but I'll get back to that in a sec.  The birthday crew was assembled over by the side bar, where there were plenty of seats and a handful of small high-top tables to rest your drinks.  An additional ledge partially surrounding the space serves to ""contain"" bar patrons and keep them from sprawling out towards the more formal dining areas. Once settled at the bar, I snagged a pint of Shed Mountain Ale, a tasty 7.4% ABV brewed in Stowe, VT.  After that came a pint of Ommegang's Rare Vos, a delicious amber from Cooperstown, and finally, a potent 12oz dose of Founders 10K, a 9.1% ABV IPA brewed in Grand Rapids.  Needless to say, all were tasty, and there were about 5-6 other beers that I'd have been happy to try as well...there's always next time!  Bartenders are well-versed on the craft beers and happy to dish out samples when asked, so don't be shy in requesting a taste. Of course, we had to try out these allegedly legendary pizzas, so a friend and I split two small specialty pies, sampling half of each.  Smalls are priced between $12-$16 depending on toppings - we ordered the New Vermont Sausage and the Mopsy's Kalua Pork.  Normally, I'd throw a brief description in, but there are WAAAAY too many ingredients to list here, so I'll just link to the lengthy menu descriptions instead americanflatbread.com/re… . THIS PIZZA IS AMAZING!  Toppings are evenly and generously distributed and bursting with flavor, cheese is gooey and plentiful, and the flatbread crust had a nice crunch to it.  Most of the listed ingredients are organic, hormone-free, all-natural, or house-made, which, while lengthy to read in the menu, provides an explanation as to why these pies are so damn good! When it came time to pay our part of the bill, the manager was very apologetic that the computers were temporarily down, and offered to take care of our bill.  Feeling bad, I reached for what cash I had and threw that in.  Food and drinks would have been worth every penny regardless, and I'll definitely be back to try some more pizzas and beers! Welcome to New York City, American Flatbread!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Every now and then, through sheer luck, you find an amazing restaurant that you otherwise would never have experienced. Cascalote Latin Bistro is one such restaurant. My girlfriend and I were walking through Spanish Harlem, looking for a place to eat, when we noticed a cute and cozy 20 seat Latin restaurant with a very appealing menu.   I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 12 years and I can honestly say that our first visit produced nothing less than exceptional results. My girlfriend ordered the the jalapeno marinated pork chop with smoked bacon and sauteed onions. The pork chop was perfectly tender with just the right amount of heat. The bacon added a hint of smoke and the carm onions brought out a sweet crunch that brought the whole dish together. I'm normally a gentleman on a date, but I have to admit that I stole an extra piece while she wasn't looking. It was that good. I had the slow roasted short ribs with the crispy potato croqueta topped with a shaved radish salad. The short ribs were flaky and delicious with a hint of beer in the marinade brought out a nutty aftertaste. The croqueta was a perfect addition in that it added body, texture, and crunch to the dish; not to mention that it soaked up the delicious sauce the coated the short ribs. And the crispy radishes were an ideal match with the soft moist short ribs. Unfortunately we had no room left for dessert but we both agreed that, after we told everyone we knew about this place, we would certainly go back. I advice anyone reading this who is looking for unique and perfectly executed Latin cuisine to take a trip up to SpaHa and experience this absolute gem of a restaurant.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Having a husband from Austria, we decided to try Steinhof for our anniversary. The consommé soup was pretty tasteless (needed salt and chives, but only had floating parsley bits instead) and the schnitzels, just so-so...Veal would have been better..Everything needed salt. They put the weiner schnitzel on top of a pile of pickles (cucumber salad?) so it got a bit soggy on the bottom.  Bigger plates would have helped in that case. They have those little oval diner plates. The potatoes were dried out. The rice bland. The farmer's cheese appetizer was good, but not very authentic. Tasted more like veg cream cheese and the salad had ranch dressing:( I think the cook was Mexican? The waitress was nice, and the space cozy. But yea, there is bad rock/pop music a bit too loud as someone else mentioned. I can see it being appealing on a winter evening, esp on the $6 goulash nights.

"Honestly, I have been going here for years, but lately on weekend nights (when it is really busy) the staff has been unbearably rude. It's as if we are all so lucky to even be eating there we should tolerate the mood swings of the staff. I mean the food is good, but it doesn't deserve a cult like status. I tried last night to get a table, was given a 45 minute wait time, then the hostess added 20 minutes on, which then became 30 and by 1:15 we left. After I expressed a little frustration with the inaccurate wait time, she told me that ""there were still people in front of you"" as if i don't know how a list works at a restaurant. When I told her might be better to give people a more accurate time so they could go have a drink and plan better her response was ""thanks for the tip."" It just seems completely odd to me that even if a restaurant is busy and popular being rude would be an acceptable business practice. I am not expecting sunshine on a slammed, Saturday night, but really? The last straw was when the barista bumped into me and then groaned.

They don't take RSVP's for brunch so you'll have to take a chance that there won't be a long wait when you and your fellow brunchers arrive. My friend and I were quoted a time of 20-30 minutes and we were able to sit outside on their front deck area on cushy couches while we waited. Within our quoted time, we were soon seated on the banquette in the bar area. The interior is totally gush-worthy - with a modern, sleek, yet industrial feel with exposed brick, high ceilings (and a skylight), beautiful bar yelp.com/biz_photos/LWk_… , an open garage door to the terrace yelp.com/biz_photos/LWk_… and a separate lowlit dining room. yelp.com/biz_photos/LWk_… Gush gush gush.   There's a good mix of dishes on their reasonably priced brunch menu yelp.com/biz_photos/LWk_… but as true carnivores, my dining partner and I both opted for the one with crispy pork belly. After devouring our apricot scones, plates with poached eggs, crisp pork belly, potato hash, roasted spinach and tomato and a harissa hollandaise arrived. Joy overcame my senses as my fork plunged the fatty, yet tender pork belly, scooped up some egg and hollandaise and danced on my tastebuds. Yeah, it was that good that even though I should be embarrassed about that last sentence, I'm not. Our server was nice but felt distant. She barely checked on us and when we were ready to pay, she disappeared and it became rather difficult to flag her down just to get the check. While we waited to pay, I took the opportunity to check out their bathrooms which were fully stocked with soap bars that we could take home. Brunch was everything that I expected from a Michelin-star awarded restaurant. I will happily suggest (by suggest, I mean push!)  Public for future NYC brunching whenever I'm in the city visiting friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had heard good things about this place.  We had friends coming into NYC for their honeymoon, and we decided to take them there for a celebratory dinner, since we weren't able to make the wedding.  We made a reservation that morning and reconfirmed it a few hours before, requesting (not expecting) a decent table since it was a special occasion. When we arrived, promptly at 8pm, we were told it would be a few minutes.  There's no where to wait except in the doorway.  About 15 minutes into waiting, we asked the host how much longer.  He told us we were next, and that he was just waiting for a table to finish up.  We watch that table finish, leave, be reset, and sit empty for a good five minutes why the host stood and talked to the bartender.  At 8:30pm, a half hour of standing at the door with a supposed 8pm reservation, I ask him if we can sit at our table.  He then tells me that the table is for someone else.  I tell him he told us 15 minutes ago we were next.  He said, ""No, there's other people in front of you.""  I remind him we had an 8pm reservation, it is now 8:30pm.  He tells me they don't take reservations for parties of 4.  I am really confused at this point.  I tell him not only did the restaurant take our reservation, they reconfirmed it just a few hours ago.  He insists no reservations for parties of four.  He says all this with complete indifference, unapologetic, almost belligerent.   He then continues, ""Besides you were late.""  I can assure you we got there at 8pm, not a minute later, in fact we made a joke about our promptness when we arrived.   I insisted we weren't, he insisted we were.  Trying to avoid a heated debate at this point, I tried to reason with him and say, ""I don't want to fight with you, but you can see why I'd be frustrated right now.  We made a reservation, it's a special occasion for us, we have been waiting a half hour at the door, you tell us we are next, and now we are not.""  His response, no joke, ""Sometimes life's a bitch.""   At this point I ask for a manager, he says he is the manager, his name is Piedro.  If I wasn't there with my friends and celebrating, that would have been my cue to walk out, but I did not want to ruin the night.  ""When will our table be ready,"" I ask.  ""It's ready,"" he says, and motions to the table that had been sitting empty all along.  I am baffled at the game he is playing at this point.  I call my friends over and we go sit, a table by the kitchen. It gets worse.   We order our food, and as my appetizer is placed in front of me and I pick up my fork, one of the assistant cooks comes out of the kitchen, eyes completely focused on me and my food with a smirk.  I am waiting for him to look somewhere else, but he is completely focused on me and my plate, no one else at my table.  It was completely awkward.  I finally take a bite, and he laughs and walks back in.  You can read into that however you want, but I waitered in restaurants for 8 years, and my instincts were telling me to put the fork down.  I'm not a paranoid person, I don't usually jump to conclusions, and I was starving.  But it was just way too obvious, this guy.  I pushed my plate away from me, and watch the manager walk back and forth, looking at my plate and me, and only me, waiting for me to bite into it.   Again, at this point I would have stormed out, but with friends in from town celebrating their week-old marriage I sat there quietly, boiling inside.  I was pretty sure my friends dishes were fine, as they served by table and seat number, and knew exactly who was getting what.  And there seemed to be no focus on them and their plates.  I quietly asked the waitress to cancel my entree.  I shared my boyfriend's. It's a shame one or two people can spoil not only a significant night, but a great restaurant.  The food I did taste from the other plates was really good.  And our waitress, who was completely oblivious to what was going on, was phenomenal.  Toward the end, she started realizing something was up, and did her best to diffuse the situation.  But it was too late. My Advice to Noodle Pudding:  The guy greeting patrons and playing host should  not have the grace and people skills of a DMV desk clerk.  And the tricks seemingly pulled by a few bad eggs could bring down your entire establishment.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My ramen experience here was sublime! My date and I got here about 10 minutes before it opened on a weeknight (I want to say it was a Monday night), so we didn't have to wait. We weren't the only ones waiting outside for this delicious ramen, though. By the time my date and I were done with our meal, the place started filling up. If you don't like waiting or crowded places, I'd definitely come here for an early weeknight dinner. The interior is simple, and the lighting is pretty flattering (for both the food and people lol). The staff is so polite and professional, and everyone clearly takes pride in what they do. I want to slap myself for forgetting which ramen I ordered, but it was amazing. I'm not a ramen connoisseur, but I think most people will agree that Ippudo's ramen is delicious.  When the bowl was set down in front of me, I started drooling. The smell alone is incredible. The broth was milky, the pork was tender and the noodles were perfect. Portions here are also pretty sufficient. I felt so bad when I left almost half the broth in the bowl, but I was stuffed! My bowl of ramen was priced between $16 to $18.50. Not bad for the service and taste! I would definitely recommend trying this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The pizza here taste really good, better than patsy but not better than Lombardi's. The crust is thin and the pizza sauce taste just right.

"Can't beat the prices here, but more importantly - the flavor of the pork/chive dumplings are tasty...well seasoned and the dumpling dough wasn't too thick making a delicate bite into a plentiful filled dumpling.  I also enjoyed the sesame pancake -- crispy, chewy and soft -- a great place for a quick bite, an afternoon snack or a cheap date.  $1 for 4 dumplings -- can't beat that.  I had tried Vanessa's dumplings earlier and have to say that Prosperity's are much better -- Vanessa's dough was a little too thick and the filling was not flavorful and under filled.   Go to prosperity == this place has basically the same items/prices.  More importantly the dumplings are delicious!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The servers lack competency and have barely a clue of the food served in this restaurant.  The wait time is standard, and they try to keep you entertained with Alice in Wonderland style complimentary cups of soup. I ordered the Brussels sprouts with grapes, puffed rice, cherry tomatoes, etc.  My first bite tasted like a bad acid trip.   There was an explosion of repulsive flavors and tastes which I couldn't stomach.  When the waitress asked how I was doing, I told her that everything but the Brussels sprouts were edible.  She addressed my concern and insisted on taking the food back.  Once reviewed by the manager the waitress returned to tell me that the brussels sprouts were cooked fine and that if I wanted my dish she could bring it back to me.  WTF. I told her to bring the dish back, and ate everything but the Brussels sprouts.  I've never been quite as disgusted or embarrassed, all at the same time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Been there 3 times for dinner and the best combination was starting with beet orange(must have for salad lover),having special lamb(which is absolutely stunning) as a main And finishing off with the rich chocolate pudding. :') In total,a great place to visit with family,friends and obviously with a date :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friends and I (one Japanese and two Vietnamese) came here three times over the weekend. Every time we spent less than $15 per person. Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY.  We had: - Chao Long (Congee): For $6, it was a big bowl for my friend and I although we came with big appetite. The ""huyet"" (pork blood) was good, but the congee itself didn't tast like home-cooked rice to me. The ginger, fried onion, parsley and scallion made the whole dish complete with all the decorations and flavor. - Com Suon Bi Cha (Grilled pork chop, shredded pork/pork skin and crab patty on rice): I don't know why they call it crab patty while it is actually omelette with pieces of pork here and there. The pork chop was well-season with lemongrass smell. The broken rice (Com Tam) was not too dry and everything went great with the fish sauce. - Bun Ca Ri Ga (Chicken curry with rice vermicelli): This was too spicy for my friend. It might not be that spicy for those who eat really spicy. The portion looked big too me. - Bun Bo Hue (Hue's style beef noodle soup): It was so spicy to my Japanese friend that we had to ask for a bowl of broth, but she was not able to finish it (still too spicy for her!). It was a huge bowl for her appetite also. - Com Lap Xuong Op La (Vietnamese style sausage and fried eggs over rice): My friend wanted to try something new and it was new to him. We don't think this dish is popular in Vietnam and he said it was alright, nothing too special. However, if you've never tried Vietnamese sausage before, give it a shot! - Bun Bo Nuong (Grilled pork with lettuce on rice vermicelli): The grilled pork was well-seasoned but the vermicelli was not well-cooked (it tasted a bit raw and hard to chew). The fish sauce was not a big hit but it helped save the vermicelli. - Che Ba Mau (Vietnamese dessert with beans and coconut milk): It was a big save for my Japanese friend. She loved when she had to mix everything up. The jello and the coconut milk worked perfectly with the beans. Recommended by a non-Vietnamese!! - Ok, last round: Vietnamese sandwiches, a MUST-TRY!! The pickle was so well-made and it added a touch of sweet and sour taste to the terrific grilled pork. We didn't add any chili peppers but if you think you are pro spicy-food eater, go for them! Last but not least, the service was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. We didn't wait in line and the food came early. The restaurant was a bit far from Manhattan but if you really crave for Vietnamese food, a subway ride wouldn't be too much and you can also walk around Brooklyn's Chinatown. Did I mention they sell Dried Jackfruit Chip? You'll get a big bag for $3.25 and it could save your grouchy tummy if you have to spend hours in big museums like MoMA or Brooklyn Museum :D.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Just had dinner with a few friends here today. TLDR go for the burger, get the sides and dessert somewhere else.Quick turn around means fast seating. Arrived at the height of the rush at ~7:30pm on a Saturday. Hostess said that it could take up to an hour, but many people had left. Ten minutes later our party of three was seated with menu in hands (niceeee). The decor of the restaurant is very nice with interesting paintings of local New York attractions. Everything was very clean especially for a place that mainly serves burgers. Our hostess came over and asked a few questions, however the place is fairly noisy so we just nodded and smiled. We ordered two original burgers, one cali burger, fried pickles, smoshed potatoes, a slice of the pie and the cinnamon bun ice cream sandwich. I had a Mama's Little Yella Pils - Oskar Blues Grill & Brew, a mouthful which made ordering it rather entertaining especially since the waitress also had problems naming it. All of the calorie counts were on the menu. Starting with the burgers, they were very juicy and had the restaurants signature parmesan crisp which had flavor, but is also agreeable for people who do not like sharp cheeses. The bun was springy till the last bite and did not become soaked in the juices of the burger. The burger wasn't the best I have had, but was enjoyable nonetheless. The burgers came with dipping sauces on asian soup spoons. none of them particularly stood out, the burger was better on its own. The fried smooshed potatoes were mostly red skinned potatoes that seemed to have been cut in half boiled and then fried. Some of them were crispy, but most of them weren't. Not very smooshed, not very fried... The fried pickles were alright, they were spears as opposed to the chips you get at many places. The cinnamon bun was a bit disappointing, the table next to us did not finish theirs which I should have taken as a sign. The bready portion of the cinnamon bun was a bit dry with neither the normal buttery bun nor the high cinnamon content of most cinnamon buns. This is most likely to keep it from completely absorbing the ice cream, but left for a disappointing dessert.. All in all paid about $30 a head.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"When I thought I finally ran out of good places to eat within walking distance of DUMBO, I stumbled across this place on Yelp. They have great people working behind the counter, great prices, and a FANTASTIC cuban sandwich. I'm not a huge pork guy, but this sandwich rocks. Additionally, it's set up like a deli. Put in an order, and eat it there, or take it out. Their drink selection is aight. They also have a sort of make-your-own-meal hot foods thing going on too, which seems pretty popular. If you decide to stop by, try the cuban!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Surprisingly impressive. Went here with a friend to just have a drink while we waited for another reservation. The bartender however lured us into eating there (because she mentioned soft shell crab which my friend is obsessed with) which was the best thing we did. She said it was really good. I, on the other hand, had the lamb chops. These were the most amazing lamb chops i have ever tasted! They are so tender and tasty that you will sit there and say to yourself, wow. There is some type of spice rub on it that i believe is where the taste comes from. This was actually a recommendation from the bartender once again. It came with carmelized pumpkin (i'm not a big pumpkin fan) and it was really tasty. We also had the goat cheese salad (with some berries i believe) and this was excellent as well (again, i love goat cheese! I had the lamingtons for dessert - i didn't like it (it was a bit dry), but it didn't really matter to me. So, i would definitely recommend this place, the atmosphere and service is great also (and we sat at the bar). The wine was good too, but staple are the lamb chops here.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went here last night with a couple of friends.  We own and operate bbq restaurants and also do competition bbq all over the country.  I must say the brisket was very very good, the sausage was good, the pork was very good, the ribs were below average, very dry.  The beef rib had good flavor but was very over smoked.  I really like how they finish all of their products with sea salt.  The sides..............Pickled vegetables were good, nice tangy and fresh, the beans were good, lacked a little seasoning, the edamame was terrible, had a pasty mouth feel and no flavor at all, the sweet potatoes were good, but missing the wow factor to put them over the edge.  Over all its a very good BBQ restaurant, they have the right idea and some of it is perfectly executed, just a few things they could do to add the wow factor and make it that much better like paying more attention to the seasoning of the sides.  Servers were very friendly.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Honestly this place is over-rated. We ordered a large pie half white and half margherita, two bottle beers and a caesar salad and spent $70! The beers were warm at best not cold so that was upsetting. Also, our waiter was all over the place bc they sat him 8 tables so he wasn't as attentive and we had to wait for him a lot. Worst of all the place is CASH ONLY, who does that? This is NYC in 2014 please upgrade! The margherita pizza was exceptional but even then it was too pricey, the white pizza was good but it has way too much garlic. All in all, I'm glad I came and I tried it but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, not when there's another 4 pizzerias around the block with better service, better pizza and cheaper prices. I feel like this is a tourist trap, they get you by saying it's the first pizzeria in America but they fall short. Skip it if you can, it's not worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"GREAT food here, BUT... I went last night (Saturday night) for dinner. Dinner was delicious, but we were rushed rushed rushed through our meal. It was very uncomfortable.   We got the meatballs and the gnocchi. We ate at a regular pace, not at all slow. While we were very much still actively sopping up sauce with our bread, and had a couple pieces of bread and lots of sauce left, the waitress came by and scooped up all three plates and walked away.  I'm not sure why we didn't say anything ( like wait, stop!) But we didn't. Then, as we sat with full drinks, the waitress came by and dropped the check. We paid, left a 20 percent tip, and then continued to chat while finishing our drinks. After only about three minutes, someone came by and asked if we wanted anything else. We said no (we had already paid). It was clear the only reason for their asking this question was to usher us out.  I repeat, we had mostly full drinks, and had only a few minutes earlier wrapped up dinner. Then, a minute or two after that, they came by and CLEARED OUR WATER GLASSES. Come on Northern Spy - you guys are classier than that. I've worked in a restaurant. I know when you want to turn a table, and the customers are dawdling. But we weren't doing that. Do you really want your customers to feel rushed and unappreciated when they leave?

"I keep on giving back to Yelp my reviews because of the great reviews I've read here as well, especially for this trip out to New York.  This is on of those places that I'm definitely grateful for reading on Yelp.  We waited only 15 minutes and got great seats at a booth.  I love the decor here with the painted palm trees on the wall and the old fans blowing.  It makes you feel like you're somewhere else.  I thought the staff was very nice and the service was great.  The bartender sure knows how to make her drinks.  We started out with these corn pancakes that were yummy, and only making me want more!  The margaritas are fabulous here!  I had the guava and my friend had the mango and it was just wow.  I had the pork chops, and the charred flavoring made it seemed grilled and homemade.  Everything else my friends ordered also looked very good - the Cuban Sandwich, the skirt steak, and the shredded pork.  The rice and beans were also very good.  I don't even usually order beans, but I liked them alot here.  I had the fried plaintains and the sweeter ones as well.  Both were very good.  I was pretty stuffed and couldn't have been happier!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bogota used to be my go-to place for a fun, festive dinner (before i moved)!  The drinks are fantastic and there are certain nights (like Monday I think?) when it's happy hour all night long!   The sangria is fantastic. The sweet arepas are delicious and I love to get the skirt steak with chimichurri or the fish tacos.  And if I still have room, the churros are great as well.  It can get a little loud here, but once you start having your own drinks you won't really notice.   The restaurant also has a great attention to service - the servers usually pass out a little survey at the end of each meal to ask how you liked your visit and ask if you have any feedback for them.  My only complaint is that it can be very busy even on weeknights.  It's good to time your visit - go early or go later so that you don't find yourself squeezed into the front area while you wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The Cookshop Menus have had entrees on them that reflected their state of preparation since man invented fire and menus. Hip eateries like the Cookshop are no exception flambéd charred and blackened are expected to be on the menu but not used to describe THE menu. It is so ridiculously dark in this stylish setting (at least I think it was stylish. - it was too dark to tell for sure) the menu should have been in Braille! Paper menus returned to servers with char marks, blackened and rolled into little Tikii torches is always a clue that something is wrong. My companion was reduced to ordering what ""that woman at the table under the wall sconce had"". The management even manages to defeat the time honored fall back for these romantically lghted venues (a.k.a. dark) of taking the menu to the bathroom to peruse by having the low lighting in the toilet too. The poor woman who emerged looking like the Joker after touching up her makeup was not amused. I like to enjoy the presentation of a meal. Sadly this was not possible except by the light of a very useful cellphone APP called the ""torch"" which helps to illuminate menus, makeup and dishes at the Cookshop. It is a harsh glare. I guess they don't want you to see the prices on the menu or the short pour on the wine either.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Has definitely fallen to catering to the casually dressed tourist and bar trade even when meals are priced at levels comparable to some of the  finest restaurants in NYC. Having arrived a bit early my party was confined to a small waiting area with no opportunity for drink service. Fought for attention and service at the bar and returned with hands full while the unobliging management staff looked on. Dinner service was spotty; choices a bit I'll-conceived and generally not satisfying.  If you frequent class NYC dining spots you dont need this kind of abuse. Plenty of other choices for fine dining. I'll go back there for a burger and beer as I understand the bar menu is more reasonable and more in line with expectations.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

I was hesitant to try Dinosaur again.  I had it a few times when they first opened in Harlem and was unimpressed.  I went because friends from Queens were visiting and they wanted to try.  It is accommodating for a large group - options for everyone - not many BBQ places have salads for those trying to eat healthy!  I feel like the food snob of the group but I couldn't believe the low quality of the meats - how are they making any money selling a rack of ribs and four sides for $30 unless it is the lowest quality ingredients available.  I feel like now that I eat higher quality meat I can really taste the difference of cheap meat.  What I like about Brooklyn is small neighborhood non-chain restaurants with personality that are creative and use high quality ingredients -- so this place is really not for me!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's a bad sign when you want to review a place and you simply cannot remember the name of it, no? We went here in December to celebrate my Birthday. I was super excited as it was so highly revered by some of my most respected yelpers. Soooo, It's a cold Friday night in December and luckily we had no problems with our reservations and were seated immediately. Unfortunately for preggo, irritate-able (yes, I know it's not a word!) me it was furiously hot and stuffy in there AND there was a table for 200 from Long Island (no offense) right next to us. To say it was loud would be an understatement. I am not exaggerating here, I could not have a conversation with my husband at our sweet table for two. We barely exchanged three words with each other the whole dinner. Even so...had the food been spectacular, well...this would be a different review. I ordered the famed Lobster Cannelloni and could have cried with the sheer mediocrity of it?!!?! I mean, what the hell? It was CLEARLY made using frozen super overly salted lobster. The cannelloni part was very good and perhaps homemade fresh pasta....but that does not excuse the piss poor lobster. Yes, the hubby's meatball was a fantabulous meatball. Too bad. I don't think I can ever bring myself to go back. It really was a lousy experience. We didn't even bother to tell them it was my B-day...lest we have to stay ONE MORE minute to eat dessert.

"American Retro Bar is is a wonderful and needed addition to dining wasteland that is 11th Ave.   The decor is regular, middle of the road tavern / sports bar.  The menu is very reasonably priced and the fare is burgers, sandwiches, nachos, pitchers of beer, etc. On our trip, there was a couple of Zog Sports group playing Beirut, having a blast and there was a bunch of smaller groups eating and drinking away - definitely a great vibe.  There is also a skee-ball machine, just like Chuck-E-Cheese as well as a jukebox. For food, the group got everything from pulled pork sanwiches to sliders to nachos and it all looked very good - and they annihilated all of it.  This was while we were looking at menus, so I figured we would be in good shape.  I got a burger and tater tots and it was all very good.  My wife asked for a sandwich with all sorts complex modifications and they nailed all of them.  To top it off, the staff was excellent and they did a great job taking care of us.","[1.0, 0.0]"

First of all, if you love fun markets where you are bombarded with endless varieties of different items, such as cheeses, desserts, cured meats, you would LOVE Eataly.   My boyfriend and I ate at I Panini, our panini was so delicious.  The bread was just crispy enough on the outside, soft, chewy, and warm on the inside.  The meats and cheese weren't too over powering.  We also had the Arancini (risotto balls!) which were heavenly!   We ate in front of the Roticceria, which made us wish we could come back to try the rotisserie chicken and roast beef sandwiches!!!  We will definitely be back the next time we are in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We waited with empty plates and glasses for almost 20 minutes before we got up and settled at the counter. We were never offered water or a refill the entire time. My friend got the cheese grits which she liked but personally I didn't enjoy. I found it strangely seasoned though I'm partial to only salt in mine. She also got a side of bacon which was fine. I got a ham & brie croissant which was underwhelming. It was slightly warm but not really and had a side salad thrown in it.

They have a standing bar with a little space inside and a shelf outside the window to put your slice on, which really isn't ideal for day trippers like myself.

"My friend celebrated her 29th birthday today at Rincon Criollo.  There was a total of 30 people in the party.  This restaurant was a perfect choice! It was a cozy environment, and the staff treating the whole party like if we were VIP.  And to handle 30 of us...trust me, the orders could have easily gone wrong, but it didn't! Now for reviews on the food...I ordered the breaded chicken cutlet, white rice and black beans.  I'm glad I ordered it! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the black beans was flavorful.  My girlfriend arrived late and I ordered her the same plate.  She didn't get to eat it until we got home.  When she did eat it,  she told me it was ""really really good.""  I overheard everyone at the table talking about how great their food was and even heard some of the say, ""MMMMMM."" My friends who sat to my sides and across from me ordered the Ox Tail, Shredded Beef w/Garlic, and Fish.  ALL OF THEM SAID THE DISH WAS GREAT! Not only was the staff on top of their game, but there was this one gentleman, who I believe was the manager or owner, any who he was there helping his staff and making sure each one of us were doing fine.  For birthday events they play the birthday song, but after the birthday song, the whole restaurant lights up in different colors and the manager dances for you to a song that just makes you want to smile and laugh.  It was great and you have to experience it in order to know what I am talking about.  The birthday person is definitely the center of attention for those few minutes, and that's in a good way.   Wait...and that's not it! Great service, great food, and great price!  Just make sure you bring cash or have American Express.  They also have an ATM machine inside the restaurant.  I hope my review helps.

"This a cute cafe spot that has a nice panini, pizza, dessert and cocktail menu. Probably good to hit this place up after dinner to grab dessert and coffee and sit in the garden. We came for dinner and they didn't have any pasta options, but the lasagna. The pesto lasagna was really the main reason I chose this place though and I am so glad I did. It may have looked oily, but it was divine and very easy for me to finish quickly! The best part I would say is that they give you a small cup of Parmesan cheese that you can sprinkle on your food until your heart's desire (AKA when the cup is empty, but that would be way too much). It made me wonder why pesto lasagna isn't so common...It's so good! Pizza was also good and stayed straight when folded, that's how I judge my pizzas, so no sogginess here!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The food here is very heavy, but I haven't seen another place with this type of cuisine in Astoria.  The BEST is the mac n' cheese.  I've also had the chicken and waffles (weird combo, I know) but the caramel was super sticky and strange.  However, as a whole, this place is great.  The drinks are great but the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because $12 for a martini in this neighborhood is too much, in my opinion.  But definitely would recommend this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I don't understand the many 4 and 5-star ratings associated with Balthazar.  I have lived in the city for years, but I always assumed that without a reservation, Balthazar would have an impossible wait for Sunday brunch.  Much to our delight, my boyfriend and I were promptly seated at 11:30 am.  Our delight ended there. First, we saw the prices.  Yes, yes, we should have looked first, but we figured that if the food was delicious, then the price wouldn't matter so much. Second, when I received my food, I felt like a fool.  I ordered the French Toast for $19.50.  What I got was two slices of dry brioche and some limp, bland bacon.  That's $10 for each slice of toast!  Like I mentioned earlier, if it was delicious, then cost wouldn't be an option.  However, it was meh.  Insultingly forgettable.  My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  It was also meh. If you want a scene (or if you want to pay too much for forgettable food and to be surrounded by tourists), then go to Balthazar.  If you want solid brunch fare, then go to one of a number of other great places that this city has to offer (westville, grey dog, clinton st baking co, good, cafe cluny...for french toast, I should have checked out nearby jane, where I haven't been in years, but whose toast left a fond mark on my memory).

"The place felt intimate and service was good. I felt like I stayed forever chatting away with my friends but the waitresses were very nice and asking us if the dishes were to our tastes. I had wanted to try their burgers but turned out it was an only lunch and brunch thing. Instead, we started with a steak tartar and it was delectable. It was seasoned and mixed to imitate salsa, thus it arrived with chips on the side. I was taken aback and impressed with the fresh taste. Also ordered a penne dish with basil, parmesan, and tomatoes. This dish didn't stand out to me and probably shouldn't have order. There basil made it oddly spicy... Lastly, the rib-eye steak was pretty good. This meaty dish could feed two-three people. It was such a comfort food with mashed potatoes and topped with onion rings and crispy kale. I liked the meat done medium and bits of crispy on the outside.

"I am a big big fan of hot pot and this is the place to go!!! Most of hot pot place in NYC are overpriced or bad quality products, I've tried so many hot pot restaurants and this is by far the best. For $22  (was $19 few months ago) you have all you can eat hot pot and a large choice of products. Also the good thing is the sauces & herbs are self-service which I really appreciate since I mix like 10 different sauces together and I hate asking the waitress to bring more. The BBQ is $25, nothing special to say about it. If you go there don't waste your money on it. Would definitely recommend the Hot pot instead. The staff is very friendly even if they don't speak english very well. The service is so fast!!! it's really appreciable when you are very hungry. Only 5 minutes wait after we order. Icing on the cake, it's free for your birthday!!!! INCREDIBLY AWESOME!!! You just have to show your ID and that's it! Last time we were 5 people but it was my birthday and one of my friend too. So the bill was almost divided by too, however the staff wasn't annoyed by that and they even congratulated us for our birthday. Ideal place if you want to invite someone for their birthday LOL Bottom line, this place is a gem in the city and we still often go there even if we live in a different area now. The trip is worth it! Just hope they won't increase their prices even more.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love this place. Not only do they roast the most amazing chickens - I will never buy a grocery store rotisserie chicken again, but the daily rotating selection of food is awesome. And it's great that when I don't feel like cooking I can go there and get a whole dinner for my family and know that it's healthy and delicious. This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I hope they stay around for a long time. OH. And did I mention their sandwiches? Yum. Oh.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Delicious food! We went here with a couple fellow Yelpers (shout-outs to Tiffany and Sam!) after attending an elite event that left us drunk but hungry. We sat in the atrium(?) part that's all glass with lots of plants, which is beautiful and makes you feel like you're eating outside, only with AC. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for the four of us to share. The mixed platter was hummus, tabouli, eggplant and tahini, and salad. Everything was fresh and delicious, though we had to ask for more bread. The mussels were fresh and the broth was light and flavorful and paired perfectly with the garlic toast (we asked for more of that too). LOVED the lamb tagine with the casablanca. It had this wonderful salty-sweet combo of chickpeas, onions, and raisins that went really well with the gamey lamb, which was tender and falling off the bone. The Bastilla was wonderfully flaky and the filling was very fragrant with spices and the chicken and egg. On a normal day, you probably would want to order at least one more dish to round out a meal for 4 people. But since we were all a little inebriated, this was just the right amount. Perfect ending to a great afternoon!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Okay so this is harsh but... Adorable restaurant. Big, obnoxious, well-dressed, sunglasses-wearing crowd. Positives: - liked the striped shirts the servers and busboys were wearing, even though one of my friends was wearing a striped shirt (and thought he might start taking orders for fun) - food was good if not terribly interesting Negatives: - oh EVERYTHING holy, how did I spend so much on brunch?! there goes my monthly food budget - oh and I was not exactly ""full"" - hot toddies are overdone now. and $10? are you joking? - we were sitting four inches from the table to our right - oh the wait. the wait. the wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This review is for the Duck Ssam - and it is amazing!!! We made a reservation about 3 weeks in advance for a Thursday night at 6:30pm. We arrived there 10 min early and waited for them to prepare our table. This is my only complaint for the entire night - the hostess was rather dismissal when she asked us to wait. In the next few minutes, 2 more parties with reservations came in and she seated them right away. And then when I went up to ask about our table, she quickly walked away to do something else. We were finally seated at a table that I'm pretty sure was open the entire time... BUT - regardless of that snafu, the meal was AMAZING! They showed us the duck before cutting it and we were surprised how much food it actually was. The platter included the duck and duck confit over a bed of rice and a ton of delicious sauces and fresh herb sides. I tried the scallion pancake but thought it was really greasy and oily, so used the bib lettuce instead, which worked really well too. I would definitely try it if  you can get a group to go together! I would come back to eat it again!!!! We were so full that we could not eat any dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After doing some major research on Yelp, I decided to bring mi amor here for his Birthday dinner. I thought walking through a dark, graffitied alley to get into a romantic yet laid back restaurant was pretty cool. (Note: Dinner starts at 6, and there are two floors. I would recommend making reservations.) We tried the hot artichoke dip for our appetizer and I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers that this is a must try. For entrees, I had the chicken breast confit with squash puree and I loved it. Only thing I would change is instead of the kale, I would rather have spinach, but that's a personal preference. (*I'm not a veggie person.) Mi amor had the pork belly and for a big guy, he was full and satisfied. Service was attentive and friendly. Would come back someday to try their brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
The atmosphere is fantastic here as well as the rustic decor. Really a calm and peaceful place to enjoy dinner. Service was wonderful and the grilled artichoke appetizer was delicious. The only reason I am taking away a star is the side dish for the roast chicken. I am not sure if it was a type of rice or whole grain but it was altogether vinegary and did not compliment the delicious twice roasted chicken that came with it. I highly recommend the chocolate mousse!,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Nothing beats the authenticity of this place. This place is original and unique in its own way. I have ate here countless times, mostly for breakfast and brunch. You can expect to see a line outside and around the block from this restaurant every weekend! They offer you orange slices and coffee to those waiting outside, so the wait feels like nothing. The owner frequently strolls the Diner and visits with some of the guests and is very friendly. The service is fast and the food is deliciously fresh! This place has a special homely feeling that beats all other Diners.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After reading about this place on the Dyker Heights Christmas Lights facebook page, we decided to give it a try last night.  First it is not in the Dyker Heights neighborhood as we drove a good many blocks to get to it.  No parking  in lot, but did get street parking. Went in to crowded waiting area where they continually wheel large garbage cans through on hand trucks. Spoke to woman in charge and asked if they could accomodate our 80 year old mother who has celiac disease and they said yes, just to speak to the waiter. Told us there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. So we waited - more like 40 minutes, but were seated.  Waiter took our order.  Very quickly delivered the sicilian pie for the five of us and pitcher of sprite. But we waited and waited. Finally kids ate the pizza and still no grilled chicken for my Mom. A busboy finally came and asked if everything was ok - we said no, still waiting for grilled chicken. Waited some more and waiter finally appeared. He went to check and said chicken was still on grill and quickly left. Waited some more. Finally got up and went to get woman in charge. Lo and behold the chicken appeared.  Now our pizza was ice cold and the chicken was only luke warm. Bus boy began clearing table moments after chicken was finally delivered.  Not one person apologized for long -long delay for a simple piece of grilled chicken served on a bed of lettuce and tomato.  $40 for 6 of us to have dinner seemed reasonable, but service left a lot to be desired.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My friend and I both live in this Harlem neighborhood and decided to meet for dinner and sample one of the many local eateries that have popped up in the area in the last year. We decided on Blvd Bistro on the corner of 122nd and Lenox. First, the diningroom looks great, feels like an old Irish pub, very warm and homey. Service is great. Wait staff and even the chef came by the table multiple times to make sure everything was good. But most importantly, the food was amazing. We shared the beef short rib taco starter- comes with 2 nice size tacos. So yummy I regretted not getting my own order of 2. My friend had the pork chop. I'm not into the thick cut pork chops myself, but I had a taste and it was tender and juicy and flavorful. I had the pan fried chicken- this was some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. A boneless breast piece and a drumstick. Fried just right, and the coating was the bomb! It comes with delicious collard greens and potato salad, but I got garlic mashed potatoes instead. I normally would take half of a meal like that home, but it was so good I forced myself to stuff it all down in one sitting. Everything was so good I just had to try a dessert, knowing I'd end up taking most of it home, I was so full. I settled on the apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. It was piping hot- PIPING- but yummy and the ice cream was especially good. Had the remainder of the cobbler for lunch today and was reminded how much I enjoyed my meal there, so I popped onto Yelp to try to spread the word. I want these good new places to stick around and Blvd Bistro is one of the good ones. And the staff/chef really seem to care about the place. Not sure if it's a family business, but it has that feel. 5 stars! Oh, I almost forgot- the biscuits! Their free bread is a pair of the yummiest ""like your grandmama made"" biscuits with some kind of syrup butter (ask for an extra)!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hands down, my favorite Restaurant Week menu in FiDi & Tribeca area so far. Appetizers: - Linguini with Summer Squash and Baby Calamari was awesome:  Nice portion and tasty sauce.   - Chilled Cucumber Soup with Fresh Heart of Palm and Cherry Tomatoes:  Very refreshing and the soup was neither too thick or salty. Entrees: - Chili Rubbed Rock Cod with Roasted Corn and Onions:   My top choice out of the three.  Again, nice portion. - Grilled Pork Loin with Navy Beans and Mustard:  Tender and a good combination with navy beans. - Flank Steak with Braised Gingered Greens and Fresh Horseradish: It was good but nothing really special. Dessert: - Frozen Milk & Chocolate Chip Cookies: The combination freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and milk flavored ice cream met every desire I have for a dessert.  As simple as this dish sounds, it puts all other fancy complicated desserts to shame. - Pistachio Cheesecake with Plums: good, but the cookies were much better. Overall, the experience was wonderful.  The restaurant had a nice modern design and an open kitchen concept.  The service was outstanding and our server made sure we got all the dishes right the way as we had to rush back to work.  Will go back there again!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Nice, quiet brunches around the Union Square area are an oxymoron-- at least I thought they were until I found Taboonette today. The steak and egg pita might be one of the most satisfying meals I've had this year. The warm, soft pita bread goes incredibly with a generous portion of steak, and a medley of other well-seasoned, fresh ingredients. The setting and service are also superb here. The decor is clean and graceful with a rustic tilt, thanks to the firewood panelling to the left of the entrance. The staff and owners were also very friendly and their cheeriness made it a real pleasure to hang around and enjoy some tea. As if things couldn't get better, the whole experience is a great value, especially for the quality you get.

My husband and I took our son to NYC to celebrate his 10th birthday.  Many different review sites directed me to this restaurant albeit not super convenient to where we were staying near Central Park.  We absolutely loved our meals and the atmosphere was lovely.  My dish was a pasta with lobster (on the menu) that was very delicious.  Service was attentive and owner/GM and/or chef (not sure) greeted us after our meal and shared a couple of complimentary glasses of moscato that completed a wonderful experience.  Would definitely go back!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"it's sooo good, so as a 100% born and raised southeast asian, i decided to give this place a go to see if it lives up to its reputation among my friends. i didn't expect much of the decor because it's an asian restaurant(fushion restaurants had better designs to attract americans). ordered Sambal Petai, which, if you're not familiar with petai(a type of vegetable found in tropical countries), i would suggest you not order it. To some it's poison, to others it's a delicacy(but just a little better than shark's fin and abalone... to me at least). Anyway, this type of vege was meant to make you fart for the next two days, as well as stink up your mouth and poo. but the spice  was perfect, although it tasted like the chef had put too much msg. petai was kinda old too. chicken curry with rice was served very quickly, so i kinda doubt the freshness of it. however, i love the sweet+slightly spicy taste of the curry. Asked for green chilli and red chilli. the green chilli was too big so it wasn't spicy, blachan was not good at all. like a typical malaysian restaurant, do not come here expecting exceptional service. what's important was that they were attentive such that they made sure empty dishes were cleaned and tea refilled. i had no problem getting their attention for chillis, drinks and check. overall, this clean restaurant served up good food at a timely manner. worth a try.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We have been eating at Iron Chef for over 7 years! Always stellar sushi. I give four stars due to the often slow service as well as long door wait times. Often when arriving there is a crowd in the very narrow doorway and no one at the host table to greet or take names and give a wait time. The fish is always fresh and the portions are large. My favorites here are the triple spicy combo, crazy couple and sweet potato rolls. The salad ginger dressing is one of my favs as well. Since it's a very small place it can get crowded on peak weekend dinner times. We will often order togo or delivery and get the sushi quicker than had we waited for a table:) Due to how small it is, it also makes a great romantic date spot.","[0.0, 1.0]"

(this is New York... if your name is not on the list, you are not getting seated no matter how long you've waited) My friends and I went right around 5PM on a Saturday and had to wait over an hour to be seated.  We ordered the Totto Miso Ramen (which my friends later had to ask for spicy paste because it was a bit bland without it), Spicy Tuna Don, Sea Urchin, Char Siu Chunks, and Avo Tuna.  I thought they were all prepared decently; the Char Siu Chunks weren't as tender as I expected them to be but not inedible.  The service was decent; food came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  I'd come back if I didn't have to wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here because of the mass number of good yelp reviews. Here's another. The reason why I couldn't give Upstate a perfect score: The service. When we first walked in, there was an open table, but no one was there to seat us, so my date and I waited by the door for a few minutes before we were seated. Not a big deal, but here's the kicker. From the time we sat down, we waited at least half an hour before the waitress took our order. The waitresses had some hardcore tunnel vision going on. And when our order was taken, the waitress awkwardly lingered by our table, but that's coo.   Don't let that paragraph of negativity above give you the wrong impression. The food is on some next level shit. I ordered the fettucini with mussels. There was nothing super special about it, but everything just worked well. . . really well -- next level well. My date ordered the scallops which was one of the days specials. It was also very good, but I may be biased because I'm a sucker for seafood. The beer was also mad good. I forget which one I ordered but it had the highest ABV, that's why I chose it. Overall: cute date spot, warm ambiance, awkward service, good beer, NEXT LEVEL FOOD. aww yeah","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Wow, people seem to either really love or really hate this place! I thought maybe it depended on who the chef was night to night, but our group ordered a bunch of stuff and it was erratic. The walnut trio (especially the green bean pate) and the mushrooms were quite tasty; the khachapuri  and the kidney beans quite disappointing--both bordered on flavorless.  The hot yogurt soup was interesting, with a strong dill flavor but too much overcooked white rice at the bottom. I didn't pay attention to what wine we ordered but I was not at all impressed with it, especially at $35 for the bottle. But my wife, who's more into wine than I am, thought it was quite good. I had a couple of sips of my friend's tarragon soda, which was quite delightful in spite of the garish food coloring (bright bluish-green).  But the drink itself was not oversweetened and the tarragon taste shone through. Of course, for both drinks, the restaurant's role consisted only of curating and opening the bottle. Overall, it was enjoyable but not extraordinary. I'm a first-timer with Georgian food, but I've eaten a lot of Eastern European and some Turkish, Uzbeki, and Persian in my time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The Koreatown location of BCD Tofu House is back and better than ever!  Its 24 hour policy made it the ideal spot for my second dinner the other night.  (I know, I know...) The new location offers plenty of spacious seating options across three floors.  The service is so friendly that multiple servers, ones that are not even yours for Pete's sake, will greet you as you come and go.   Our meal began with various Ban-chan, which are small starter dishes that are delivered as compliments of the kitchen.  The large fried fish and crisp broccoli were our favorites, while others like the kimchi, bean sprouts, and seaweed salad were a bit bland. However, these additional distractions are unnecessary and only delayed our bites of the house specialty organic tofu soup.  BCD offers a wide array of flavor options, including an aromatic Curry and a fiery Mushroom.  All soups include massive chunks of tofu, as well as substantial portions of meat and/or vegetables.  Everything can be tailored to your preferred level of spiciness.   In addition, the restaurant serves popular dishes like Japchae and different barbecued meats, but nothing quite beats their tofu soups!  BCD is definitely worth seeking out amidst its block of competitors.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm not really a gyro kinda gal but my husband made me go one night and now, I'm a convert. I have chicken souvlaki with mama sauce - totally delicious and very nice quality of chicken which was tender, lean and with a great char-grilled flavour. The tzatziki sauce is also slurpworthy. I like the fact that they're not too massive and are reasonably priced. My hub had the mama gyro x2 option for just $7 while I, smugly virtuous, ordered the solo $3.95 option the first time I went. Balls to the smug vituousness, Ima ordering TWO babies next time. Saved one for the next day and it was surprisingly delicious having been nuked in the microwave for a minute. There's a choice of white or wholewheat pita and a loyalty card. The gyros & wraps are advertised as having fries inside so the first time I ordered, I didn't order a side as I was planning. However, there were exactly 3 fries in there so I was a little disappointed. Lack of intro-gyro fries and weirdly early closing hours (9pm?!) lost 'em a star for me, but I'm being pedantic. Also, who I can only assume is MamaGyro herself, told me they were extending their hours in the summer. It seemed to be PapaGyro who wanted us out at bang on 9pm (they have about 6 stools and a bar for eat-in). Doesn't Papa know that he's serving the city that never sleeps - or never stops eating gyros? I think mama and papa Gyro live in my building cos I'm always seeing them - maybe I should slope up to them and discuss the paltry intro-gyro fry situation...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"B4 is a total gem. From what I gather, it's relatively new to the area and I'm shocked that it hasn't garnered more attention. It is a tad on the pricey side, but I think the quality justifies the pricing (for once). Service was solid. The portions were smaller than ideal, though which is the only reason why it's not a full 5 stars. Came here with friends for brunch. I ordered chicken and waffles which turned out to the best damn chicken and waffles I have ever had. Seriously - it was incredible. The gravy was made with bits of sausage and pork which brought it to an entirely new level. The only other odd complaint was the incessant playing of Fergie - not exactly who I want to hear hungover on a Sunday morning.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"TORTILLA DE PATATAS! (yes, the caps were necessary) Tortilla is a thick egg omelette made with potatoes and fried in olive oil. Well, finding it prepared bocadillo style in NYC has not been an easy task. Until now my friend... until now. It was big and delicious (my only complaint was the addition of mayo and the big bread). It was $8 and big enough to share with a friend. There are about 6 tables in the back of the grocery and the ambiance of the entire place took us back to Barcelona. Ahhh...... It looks like they are going to start making paella on Saturdays too!! The food love shall continue.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stayed at the marriot marquis and it's right across the street.  Came with preconceived notion that this was going to be an overpriced tourist trap but I was pleasantly surprised.  Served complimentary homemade pickles, pickled beets ,and sauerkraut. very good!   Ordered the Southern Fried chicken and it was very good.  Crispy and not heavily breaded.  I was too full to finish the cherry cheesecake and I didnt even have to ask for it to be put in a to go box.  The water was always refilled promptly.  The waiter was HOT and so nice and attentive.  lucky me!  still..great service considering its a very busy place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Really great beer selection, although a little on the expensive side ($6 a pint). Double Windsor varies the beer selection, so there's always something new to try. Service was quick and friendly. During my several visits, I only had one altercation with another patron -- a goth woman who looked really put out when I asked her to move her belongings from an adjacent bar stool so that a friend could sit down. Some people just don't get it. The rivalry on Yelp between Double Windsor's and Farrell's patrons is funny to read, but unnecessary. Sometimes you're in the mood for a microbrew flight, other times you want a Slurpee-sized container of Bud. You can have a good time hanging out in either bar.","[0.0, 1.0]"

But I did have a really lovely pasta with lobster that was on their ""Prima"" part of the menu. And I loved the minestrone soup, very earthy and full of vegetables with a lovely tomato base (vegetarian) perfect on a cold cold night! Service very nice and lovely choices in our bread basket so all in all we had a very nice dinner. My only wish was there were just maybe a chicken dish on the menu without PORK in it there were a couple of fish dishes in all fairness. But other than that great meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Phenomenal food!! I came here with a group of six and we were seated right away. For appetizers we had the toasted ricotta gnocchi and goat cheese flatbread. HOLY CRAP! I never had anything like that before in my life. The gnocchi was featured on Food Network's ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"". I found that out after my experience at Jane. It really was the best gnocchi I ever had. I don't know how anybody could eat the whole dish by themselves, but apparently it's been done. It's sooo rich and thick. The goat cheese flatbread had arugula and caramelized onions. I tried experimenting and make it at home, but it wasn't even close to the same. I had the special of the day - Cioppino. It had EVERYTHING: clams, mussels, shrimp, flounder, etc. Unfortunately, I think they took it off the menu since my last visit. My friends had the seared ahi tuna, the pork chop and big pot of mussels. we kept passing our dishes around because everything was so great. Finally, for dessert (of course) we had the milk & cookies and  ""Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate"". wow. Milk & Cookies was exactly that- they give you 3 large cookies, vanilla ice cream and a cold glass of milk. Childhood memories came alive during this indulgence! Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate was a 7-layer bittersweet ganache and chocolate ice cream. SO RICH and filling! Chocolate lover's dream.

"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,   Ich und meine Frau stammen aus Ausland. Wir leben  schon über zehn Jahre in Bundesrepublik Deutschland und haben nie einmal gedacht, wie viel Ausländerhass steckt in manchen Deutschen. Aber dass deutsches Gericht diesen Hass unterstützt, hatte ich nie einmal erwartet. Ich möchte mich kurz fassen. Es geht um das Urteil Im Namen des Volkes des Amtsgerichts Schorndorf unter dem Aktenzeichen 6 C 327/13, verkündet am 07.11.2013. Die deutsche Familie H. (Kläger) hat die Ausländische Familie (mich und meine Familie  = Angeklagte) über Jahre als Verbrecher dargestellt. Eines Tages haben die Ausländer (ich) die Deutschen angefordert sich an der Wahrheit zu halten. Also, keine Lügengeschichten mehr. Die Deutschen waren  damit so beleidigt, dass sie die ausländische Familie (wieder aufgrund bewusst gelogener Anzeige!) vor Gericht gestellt hatten! Das Gericht hat bewiesen, dass deutsche Familie die ganzen, rein erfundenen Geschichten doch  nicht nur mündlich, sondern auch schriftlich jahrelang dar gelegt hatte. Auch dass die Klage auf einer bewussten Lüge basiert ist. Im  Prozess kam mehr aufs Licht, dies wurde aber ""aus Versehen?"" nicht dokumentiert, z.B. dass der Kläger mit dem Umlaufbrief sich beschäftigte um Ausländer zwangsläufig aus dem Haus zu vertreiben (also klare Beweise des Hasses). Dabei wurden diese Lügengeschichten als Grund der Zwangsräumung vorgesehen! Eigentlich, sollte es als bewusste,  jahrelange Taten gegen Ausländische Familie heißen. Was wurde der ausländischen Familie vorgeworfen? Nur das, dass sie gefordert hat diesen Taten das Ende zu setzen. Aber, wie denken Sie, wer wurde überwiegend (4.500,00 €) bestraft? Ja! Ausländer! Für das Gericht wurde es klar, dass die Familie H. in jedem Punkt gelogen hatte. Aber es war nicht wichtig! Wichtiger war die Frage: ""Warum hat Ausländer gewagt den Deutschen zu sagen, dass sie mit Lügengeschichten aufhören müssen? Dabei war das Gericht ohne Beweise (erste Sitzung) gerechter als mit Beweisen! (zweite Sitzung). (Auch ein Beweis dafür, dass die Beweise eigentlich keine Rolle spielen - die Ausländer müssen Verbrecher sein!)   In der ersten Gerichtssitzung hat die Richterin Verschlag gemacht die Gerichtskosten 1/2 zu 1/2 zu teilen??? Das hat der Kläger natürlich voll abgelehnt. Auf die Frage der Richterin, was erwartet man vom Gericht? Antwortete der Kläger: ""Es ist mir alles egal. Hauptsache Angeklagte mehr zahlt"". Und im zweiten Sitz wurde das Gericht zum Wunschkonzert des Klägers! Ich habe das Urteil des Amtsgerichts und Sachverhalt einem anderen Rechtsanwalt gegeben. Er hat erst gesagt, dass das Urteil sehr komisch sei und er wird mit Berufungsklage beim Landgericht Stuttgart  das Urteil widerrufen. Später war er sehr empört. Mir hat er nur eines gesagt, dass sie alle zusammen sind und wir erreichen dort nichts außer weitere 4000,00 € zu zahlen. (Beschluss Geschäftsnummer: 13 S 208/13 Aktenzeichen: 6 C 327/13 des Landgerichts Stuttgart). Ist es der politische Trend, dass man die Ausländer als Verbrecher darstellen soll? Also, deutsche lügen, sogar in der Anklage. Ausländer zahlen - so lautet das Gerichtsurteil. Damit wurde Hetzjagd aber noch längst nicht beendet. In der Eigentümerversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, gesagt, dass es, unter anderem Versperren der Kellertür usw. als Bote an uns gewesen war,  dass wir (Ausländer) in dem Haus nicht gewünscht sind und ich soll aufhören mich zu verteidigen. Was über mich und meine Familie erzählt wird, soll ich schweigend annehmen. Ich wollte wiedersprechen mit der Aussage: ""Aber nicht die Lügengeschichten..."" Und habe die Antwort von Hausverwalter erhalten: ""Wenn es euch nicht gäbe, sollte Familie H. nicht lügen""??? Hat Familie H. im Auftrag gelogen um zu zeigen wie schlecht Ausländer sein sollen??!   Also, scheinbar, immer öfter in Deutschland das Wort ""Ausländer"" automatisch mit dem Wort ""Verbrecher"" identifiziert"" ist. Damit wurde noch nicht das Ende der Geschichte gesetzt. Vor dem Gericht wurden nur böse Geschichten über Ausländer ausgesprochen. Jetzt kam es zu Erniedrigungstaten. Jetzt hat ihr Hass, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, sich weiterentwickelt - von Lügen bis zum Rechte weg zu nehmen.  Das Gericht, anstatt Hass zu bremsen, hat das Gegenteil erreicht. In der Eigentümerversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter einen Vorschlag gemacht, der Ausländerfamilie ihre Rechte auf Gemeinnützige Räume  zu benutzen, stark zu reduzieren, im Vergleich mit den anderen Eigentümern. Auf die Frage, warum die Ausländer nicht gleiche Rechte haben dürfen, hat Herr Verwalter folgende Antwort gegeben: ""Die Frage ist richtig, die Ausländer haben das Recht, aber wen juckt das? Wir nehmen ihnen diese Rechte einfach weg.  (Protokoll Eigentümerversammlung 2014). Herr Verwalter hat auch gesagt, dass das Haus, seit Ausländische Familie  die Wohnung gekauft hatte, hat viel am Wert verloren. Früher wohnten im Haus nur die Deutsche, jetzt nicht","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Best taco's in the city, hands down! If you like spicy, then Tacqueria is the place for you! The steak taco's are my favorite, but pork is pretty delicious as well.

"The french toast is pretty damn good. It's giant slabs of brioche type bread with a tasty carmelized exterior. ($14)  They give you real maple syrup, sides are all seperate and the smoked bacon ($5 for 5 pieces) was perfectly proportioned withe lean to fat and cooked just right!   My friends loved the chicken sausage ($5 / 2 patties) but it wasn't my fav.  The Egg's Johnny? with chicken sausage, corn bread patties, and a tomato hollandaise was superb.  The eggs were nicely poached and it comes with a nice crispy bunch of home fries. Our waiter was nice, and sneakily attentive.  In all the rush, we'd hear a how are you doing a few times, water would magically refill and empty plates would disappear, and in a blur he would be gone... The music they play for brunch was way freaken cool.  Too freaken cool for breakfast, this definitely isn't your grandma's brunch spot.   SOOOOO BUSY tho! and crowded.  I don't know that I'd go back during Sat rush... whew.  There's no waiting area, it was packed, with waiting customers, staff, and tables... yet somehow, no glasses were dropped, no elbows got stuck into passing plates, and we were seated relatively quickly.

"Came here with extreme high expectations due to majority of Yelper's 4-5 star reviews and overall the experience was just eh Service- good. I took other Yelpers recs and made reservations. Even though my friend and I were late due to train issues, they were understanding and seated us right away. The waiter delivered our food and drinks fairly quick as well Food- I went for the brunch here. My friend and I ordered the Vaca Frita and Ropa Vieja but they weren't phenomenal. I would say the food wasn't worth the price for something that didnt taste amazing. Also....only the complimentary bread basket they offered when we were seated was delicious. Drinks-My friend and I were  psyched for the unlimited sangria so we tried all the red and white wines on the menu and they weren't as great as people made them out to be. We started with the most recommended sangrias (from Yelp)- Havana Banana (White) and Fresas (Red) which were both pretty strong. Felt like we were drinking straight from the wine bottles ourselves. But since we were already there paying for unlimited drinks and brunch we decided to try everything, thinking other flavors might have been better and they all tasted pretty much the same. So sangrias were just bleh. Def had better sangrias elsewhere. Overall, Calle Ocho deserves a 3 star. After having such high expectations and being let down, I don't think I will be returning for brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The tonkotsu base was rich, strong and...super fatty! yum.That is exactly what makes a good base.The noodles themselves were not especially great, but bathed in the broth--just fantastic. We got the pork buns and chicken wings as sides. Good stuff, but to be honest not that special. Next time around I think I'll do straight ramen and then get a refill on the noodles!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wasn't sure about this place since the location has had some turnover over the past year or 2, but ventured there with a few girlfriends after work last week and was pleasantly surprised!   To start, the staff were courteous and very responsive to our needs.  We ordered a few apps to share and then dinner, along with some delicious cocktails!  We started with an order of buffalo wings, the fresh catfish bites, and cajun fries.  The wings were just the right amount of spice, the catfish bites, fresh and light, and the cajun spice on the fries made them addicting to all of us at the table!   The owner (I think) came by a few times to make sure all was well, which also reinforced my comfort level, being in a new restaurant.  They actually really care and want to make it a cool, laid back spot for the neighborhood.   Anyway, after the apps, we had our entrees.  One of my friends had the lobster ravioli, another had vegetable fajitas, and 2 of us had quesadillas (1 chicken, 1 shrimp).  I sampled everyone's food and everything was delicious.  I had the shrimp quesadilla.  The quesadilla's come with black beans which are super tasty.  The quesadilla itself was really good too!   At the end of our night we expected to pay a hefty sum, but the bill was completely reasonable, especially given all the food and drink we got!   All in all, I would go back again and again!  This seems like a good fit and perfect addition to the neighborhood. Can't wait to take my family there for a leisurely weekend brunch!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to this place a number of times and, having read the other reviews, can see where everyone is coming from in terms of the praise and the gripes. Yes it's weird that they don't serve lunch until 4pm on Saturdays, yes it's loud and you have to wait on weekends for what seems like an eternity, but on the plus side...the fries are great!! The brunch menu with mimosa is also great value. I have never had a disappointing meal here, it's a great place to meet someone for an informal bite and the breakfast/brunch menu never disappoints. I recently had the chicken meatball sandwich which was divine, and i'm also a fan of the pumpkin waffles, the salmon wrapped poached egg and...well, ok everything on the menu. The cakes are also a treat, I recommend the red velvet layer cake if you're going to indulge. My only two complaints are that the filter coffee isn't great (but then it is free as you wait) - and that the service could sometimes be friendlier depending on who you get. Other than that, this is a real find in NYC.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was having a bite to eat at gaia when lisa j and her rude fiancé were dining.  gaia is a small authentic italian eatery.  I personally think it is one of the best kept secrets in manhattan.  too inexpensive for the fresh handmade dishes.  when you order there is a sign that lets you know before ordering that the dishes come as gaia thinks they should be served as well as the fact there are only 2-3 people working at any given time... and they are delicious.  she does not offer substitutions or changes to her menu.  lisa j's rude companion asked for parmesan cheese to put on top of his fish.... a big no no in italy and gaia did not offer it.  that is the beauty of owning your own restaurant... you have the ability to say no and stand behind it.   not only did this douche bag keep saying "" you don't know who i am""  to gaia... as if that mattered.  trust me when you have to say thing like that.... you are not anybody.  he claimed he ran a 4.5 star italian restaurant and that she was rude and just kept on with the rudeness.  he did however finish his entire meal and then just threw $5 on the counter... and walked out without paying for his meal.  when gaia went out of the store to ask him to pay... he flipped her the middle finger and kept up with the ""you don't know who i am"" .   then has the audacity to write a review skewed to make him look like the victim.  i can tell you one thing.... no one wants to ""know who you are""  you are just a bully... i am sure he has probably shown that bullying side to you as well lisa.  get wise... dump this man and pay your bills. i will say that gaia has a thriving business and mostly with repeat customers... we love her and her restaurant. r.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We came here for brunch with friends from out of town who are a huge fan of the ""all you can drink"" brunches.  The deal at Yerba Buena is all you can drink for an hour for $12.  Considering a mimosa is $8 at most restaurants, you can easily get your moneys worth within that hour.  They are, in fact, a bit slow at refills, but I think they got the hint about 4 mimosas in. Nevertheless I would say I got my $12 worth. We started with the fresh guacamole.  Don't let the brown color deceive you, I think it was only the chipotle flavoring.  I usually prefer my guac with some lemon or lime, but this guac was as fresh as can be.   I then moved on with the Tres Arepas for my main course - three miniature sandwiches, one with bbq short ribs, one with pork belly, and one with chicken tinga.  All delicious, but the pork belly was definitely my favorite of the three. The best part is this brunch is actually very reasonably priced.  I also enjoyed the decor and atmosphere.  Our waitress made it clear that she would have rather been enjoying brunch than serving it, but the bartender was absolutely adorable and friendly.  I'd def give it another go to try some of their other dishes on the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The place is very quaint. No pictures on the wall, no statues in corner. Some twine held back the curtains in the main window. Simple, sort of reminded me of a country home. The food is simple as well. I had the summer lettuce with goddess salad and bread-crumbs. My partner in crime had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. As we ordered we joked that we could make the same meals at home for a quarter of the price. But once we got our meals, simple as they were, we knew we'd never get the same delicious results. My salad was crisp with dark leafy greens. They were not stingy on the dressing, but they didn't overdo it either. The bread-crumbs were amazing, the perfect touch. The grilled cheese was crispy, with thick slices of bread and cheddar cheese was oozing down the sides, melted to perfection. The tomato soup was home made, chunky and creamy. One thing I recommend are the cocktails. They are absolutely amazing. My boyfriend had the special, watermelon juice, sparkling rose wine and gin were the main ingredients, it was amazing. I had the Summer Fizz - which was delicious as well. For dessert we had he chocolate pudding. For me it was a little to rich and heavy. But it was definitely home-made which is a plus. I highly recommend going here if you're in the mood for simple food made with fresh ingredients. They have ""Sunday Supper"" which comes with an app, main course, side and dessert. All this for $25 a person- we'll be back for that next time!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"La Lanterna is a small piece of Europe transplanted to NYC!  I have taken many friends there over the years, and everyone has loved it.   Eating there will transport you to Brussels, Rome, or another European city.  The decor is beautiful yet understated; the inside is very historic with multiple working fireplaces.  It is comfortable, cozy, gorgeous, and romantic.  It is a perfect place for a date or dinner with a  friend.  The garden has beautiful greenery, colorful lamps, and views of the sky.  It is a glass-enclosed garden, so you can enjoy the outdoors all year round!   The Italian food is authentic and delicious!!!!  All of the pizzas are delicious.  I personally enjoy the ones with Gorgonzola cheese.  I also like the Caprese salad (with buffalo mozzarella) and the salad called ""Tonno con Tomate"" (tuna with tomatoes and onions). They offer a very good selection of wine as well.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The worst experience ever. Last night my wife and I went to Blue Ribbon in park slope. We arrived in New York 2 days ago and expected to have a nice bite and some easy ambiance. We weren't looking for the best food or service just a decent place for a pregnant woman and her husband. We set at the bar, our favorite spot and I ordered beer from ""Adam"" that was quite friendly; Then we ordered food. We wanted to start with some appetizers before checking on the king crab as Adam recommended. The beetroot salad was flavorless and had 3 cubes of tomato on top. The asparagus were blanched (cooked) probably at the same time we landed at JFK and the ribs, a plastic like dry pieces marinated and braised in an artificial flavor sauce were simply bad. The highlight of our night was a drunken guy named Brian. The village fool of Blue ribbon in Brooklyn. Apparently this guy is a usual at the bar. He set next to us and started talking to my wife. We were friendly until he became rude and obnoxious.  (Asking my wife what was she doing with an ""ugly guy"" referring to me). We tried to be polite and Adam tried to get rid of this guy and was apologizing repeatedly. When he failed to get rid of this drunken fool he sent us OUR CHECK as if he wanted us out. The manager that was at the end of the bar babbling with some waiters did nothing. We decided to take off leaving the free desert that was sent to us at the bar. Don't go there! The food is less than average and the bar is a neighborhood spot for older, aggressive drunk locals.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here the other night for dinner. No line at 10pm which was a surprise based on other reviews. This was probably the best burger I ever had.

"Almond has it all. The service is amazing - Vanessa was particularly wonderful, and the management is also the best I've seen in a long time, particularly Candace. The ambiance is comfortable and chic, without being over the top. Plus it has the option for outdoor seating. I love having the option of sitting on the patio. On top of all that you have amazing food and drinks for good value. The pomegranite martini my favorite - the cinnamon sugar rub around the edge of the glass makes the drink. I would dare say they might have the best macaroni and cheese in the city - complete with hefty shavings of black truffles and prosciutto. The mussels are also delicious. They're soaked in a beautiful white wine, sauce toped with shallots and parsley. They are perfectly cooked - not a chewy one in the bunch! the large order is perfect for sharing 4, or as an entree. And the classic croque monsieur brings me back to the streets of Paris. As an added bonus, they have ""disco fries"" - otherwise known as Cheese Fries Quebecoise. They're crispy, perfectly fried shoestring fries covered in gravy, and cheese. It doesn't get better than that. I highly recommend you try this place, and you won't be disappointed.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So what they say is definitely true - the hostess is really snarky and a little bit mean.  All she had to say was that our order wasn't ready yet - yet sh e behaved like I likked her dog or something. That said, some of the food was amazing....and other dishes really failed.  We had an order of hummus, which was the best I'd ever had before, and I haven't had better since.  It was so creamy and full of garlic without being off-putting (I was, after all, with a boy at the time, so you can't really be too stinky!). It came with a large round of Turkish bread - sort of like a fried dough consistency, but tasted more like a sesame bagel.  Though the outside was stale as the day is long, the inside was very light, fluffy, and squishy - even the next morning.  How do they do that? We had an order of grilled octopus, but it had such an off-putting fishy smell that we had to abandon that cause after a few bites. Note: tabbouleh lovers, do not order it here.  It was about 95% bulgar wheat, and 5% other items.  It lacked that strong parsley/onion flavor that makes me order the dish in the first place.   At the time we ordered (about 9:30pm on a Thursday night), they were out of all meat except chicken.  No lamb, no beef, nothing.  So we went for the chicken kebab, which was actually grilled very nicely with a crunchy, charred outside and juicy inside (again, how do they do that?).  However, with a restaurant full of people, how does the place run out of all meats so early?  What is everyone else ordering as a substitute? Finally, we had a Shephard's salad, For $9, it was too small a portion, but the salad was fresh.and full of cucumbers, tomato, and onion.  Though This isn't a great value, it certainly rounded out the carby, creamy goodness of some of the other dishes. I don't know that I'd go back...at least I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if you're in the area and looking for some nice takeout that's a cut above your standard greasy Chinease/Indian fare, this works well in a pinch...just try to be nice to the hostess-  kill 'em with kindness and whatnot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We came to NY for the weekend and ended up coming here twice during our stay. We first came for lunch, which turned out to be very good, both food and drinks were great (and reasonably priced too). The location is perfect...near Bryant park, Times Square and fifth avenue.  The decor is much more upscale than we expected, and so when we were looking for a drink the next night we came back. The place was full, but  not so crowded we were overlooked. In fact, we were served our drinks quickly and had a great time. Next time I'm in the city, I will definitely come back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I've only ever eaten at the bar but it's always been good. Every time we go we see this other patron who eats there 3-4 times a week and is also a been a chef. He is always saying to try the chicken. I would but the fish specials always seem more tempting. Definitely worth a stop but keep in mind this place is not super casual so dress like you should. It's worth it.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Soup dumplings! That's all you need to know. Seriously. I've been here a number of times and that's all I remember ordering. The rest of the menu is okay. Not memorable for me. They have pork dumplings and pork and crab dumplings. I like the pork and crab better, but we usually end up getting several orders of both. They are delicious, hot, steamy, and delicate! There's a clear separation of those who know how to eat soup dumplings and those who don't. Since this place gets a lot of tourists, it can be rather entertaining to watch others attempt to eat them properly.  Since you'll probably be sharing a table with a bunch of strangers anyway. Tip: DON'T just reach in and try to nab one with your chopsticks! Have your spoon out in the other hand, ready to catch the dumpling so the bottom doesn't break. You're welcome. Service is typical of Chinatown, which is to say that there's barely any.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had dinner here tonight and it was nothing less than a perfect evening. We arrived about 730 just before the room filled up and while the room is small we felt comfortable at our table. There is a nice easy warm vibe to the place and while the food and service are way above par it retains a casual relaxed tone.  Service was professional and spot on while also being friendly at the same time. There is a very decent selection of wines and beers to satisfy most tastes. The only problem I encountered was having to choose which items to select from the menu, everything sounded delicious and from what I could see at other tables presentation reinforced that impression. I finally chose the mushroom app, a wonderful blend of mushrooms in a very light and delicate sauce and the halibut with celeriac, Japanese turnips, and African basil which again was in a light sauce.  My companion had the Spaghetti Chitarra  with black trumpet, asparagus, ricotta salata which she loved and for her second course Truffled fried potatoes which were too tempting to resist. We also had a wonderful conversation with the couple sitting next to us that made the evening all the more enjoyable.  The chef latter sent out a few deserts to both our tables, I believe due to our table neighbors having been in the  biz and we fortunately were allowed to go along for the ride, thank you  Patrick and Wendy. All were delicious especially the pudding and cream. We stayed late and never once were we made to feel like we overstayed our welcome and I thank the staff for that , as well as the chef for the wonderful dinner and the special treats he provided us. As good a meal and experience as I've had in a long time, LIC is definitely on my A list, not just for Queens but for the City.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"i went there for lunch with friends a couple of months ago.  If you don't want pizza, then don't go there for lunch.  There is little else on the menu to choose from besides pizza.  Also, they do NOT tolerate changes to the menu (i.e. no cheese, etc.) I don't eat pizza, so I got a crab salad, which was good, although nothing special, and was overpriced.  My friends said the pizza was some of the best pizza they'd ever had.  Unfortunately, the service was not great.  My friends who enjoyed the pizza were also turned off by the poor service.  None of us plan to return.  If you like pizza and don't care that much about customer service, it's worth checking out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was tasty, but the tempura crumbs soaked up the soup very quickly and made my dipping sauce... solid. Coconut dessert was delicious, but it was made with frozen fruits and the whole thing quickly congealed... We came here because the other location was busy. This one is bigger and was not crowded at all. They still rush you to order and finish though, but that might just be customary. I'll probably come back again and not be blown away.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Great ambiance! Great Live Music on Sunday night! Service is amazing! Started with a drink at the bar the bartenders are very fast considering it is one of the longest bars i have seen so far they work it very well!

BIG SMILES and great sense of humor and did not make us feel bad about not reserving in advance! Service was great now being served by a waitress it was an even much more pleasant experience being that it was a bit more personal than being at the bar the waitress was very nice! we ordered apps and the nachos are to die for if your into that kind of stuff! they offer a full menu and I will return here and suggest you all check out the spot for sure!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hi, I'm a huge fan of artichoke pizza and in fact I probably come at least twice a month. However, this weekend, I was extremely angry after my visit and am actually writing because I want an apology. This Saturday night, I took my cousin from California to this location. With a line of less than 20 people, your bouncer was acting like a pyscho on some power trip. He was constantly yelling at everyone to get in a single file line, although we all were in one. In fact, he hit my should and told me to go behind my cousin, which I already was. I'm sorry but at no point should any huge man ever touch a female that is about 100 pounds. But, I let that one go knowing how the crowd can get late at night here. After ordering my pizza, I added went to add some seasoning. This bouncer starts yelling at me to ""move it along."" Mind you, nobody was behind me trying to get out of the way. If he wanted me to move, he could have asked me nicely to step to the side. When I told him to calm down, I'm trying to get some chili flakes on the $5 pizza I just bought, he proceeds to continue to yell to get out of the way and move it along. I don't understand why you have this guy working your door. He's on some extreme power trip working the door to a pizza place and I am writing you so that you speak to him. Like I said, I used to come at least twice a month and am always bring new people here. I don't think I'll be coming back for a while unless the owners get rid of this guy....FYI you don't need someone like this working here, there are plenty of people who need jobs that know how to talk to customers. I get the crowd can get unruly but it wasn't, if you have cameras, I suggest you check them for how all your customers were treated on Saturday night. It's honestly a shame and have already told 8 of my friends not to come here anymore.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I can't believe I hadn't been here yet. Got this for hangover food on New Years day. It was the first real meal I was able to consume that day (champagne + tequila is tough on my stomach) and maybe it was just awesome because I was so hungry, but I think it was actually that awesome. While waiting for a table the couple behind us was saying that they have been coming here once a month or so for 14 years. I immediately started to properly eavesdrop so I could get the scoop on what to order. Thanks to their chatter I was sold on getting something Salt Baked and man am I glad I did. The Salt Baked Squid was so good. Exactly what I wanted to eat in that moment. Additionally I ordered the lo mein with oyster sauce and tender greens and my date ordered the lo mein with ginger and scallions. Mine was delicious (the greens were broccoli rabe I believe and were perfectly cooked, just a little buttery, and all around amazing), but his was mouth watering. I had to resist doing even more plate-stealing then I am normally accustomed to. We walked home full and happy and I felt like this was a positive start to a new year of living in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I just moved to Prospect Heights from Austin, where it was easy to find various styles of superb Mexican cuisine.  So I found myself wandering around Franklin Ave. on a Sunday mid-morning, and stopped into Chavela's on a whim.  Note:  The front door weighs about as much as a water buffalo, so collect yourself before throwing your weight at that bad boy. Sunday brunch at the bar was great.  The male bartender gave great service and was a skilled salesman.  I'm not a bloody mary drinker but suddenly I was drinking one.  And it screamed fresh salsa and spice and really hit the spot.  The margaritas aren't bad either; not too sweet, with a little effervescence.  And the Micheladas are also a new favorite of mine. The food, as compared to my favorite spots in Austin (yes I'm partial) is pretty good.  I tried their Pollo al Horno on my first visit, and everything was fresh and flavorful.     I've tried their tacos, a few of their specials, and I get the guacamole every time, which unto itself isn't life-changing, but I love the tostadas that come with it.  They have amazing lunch prices and a great happy hour, and I've obviously been back a few times.  It's pretty standard Mexican fare, and my taste buds always leave happy.  It's nice to know that it won't be hard to find good Mexican fare in my new neck of the woods.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Maialino is yet another restaurant in Danny Meyer's portfolio and it doesn't disappoint. The restaurant has a spacious bar as well as a comfortable dining area. The decor has an older, rustic feel that made me feel like I was dining in an authentic Italian trattoria. The restaurant is classy without being overbearing or stuffy and would be a good choice for even more casual dinners.   As far as food goes, the pasta was extraordinary. My carbonara had the right balance of pepper, pancetta, and cheese and brought out the extraordinary richness that really defines carbonara. As far as I am concerned, I could easily have believed that my I was having pasta at one of Rome's best restaurants. For my main course, I chose the suckling pig special, which was a crispy skin suckling pig over a bed of potatoes. While the pig was delicious and flavorful and the skin had a wonderfully crunchy texture, the dish overall felt a little one-note and heavy and could have used some component to lighten it up. The pig is certainly an experience and worth trying once, but I think the next time I go, I would choose something else.   Overall, Maialino is a very excellent restaurant and one that I would gladly revisit whether it be for a work or casual dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have eaten at Ippudo twice so far, and I can honestly say that the ramen is pretty good.  Is it the BEST ramen in town?  I can't really answer that.  However, the ambiance is nice and they really did try their best to give visitors the best ""ramen"" experience when they designed this restaurant.   Two of the negatives that I can think of are: 1)  The long wait.  I know that this is probably one of the trendier and more popular ramen places in town, but waiting an hour for ramen might be considered unreasonable to some. 2)  The prices.  Yes, the ramen was good, but paying $12-$13 for a bowl of ramen can be quite steep.  The last time I went there, the bill came out to about $100 for a party of 2.  This included drinks, appetizers and ramen.   Overall, definitely a place to check out!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I feel like an authentic Italian when I ate here. We started the meal with calamari, Caprese salad and another find cheese. For an entrée they have a three pasta sampler, which changes every day.

After you try the pastas you are invited to grab more of your favorite pasta from the three. It was a very filling meal, thepastas were delicious. Every meal also came with Cesar salad and vegetables. The only thing I thought that was weird was that the pasta dishes it came with a plate of vegetables which were hard to tell what they were, I think there was potatoes, green beans, carrots, roasted tomatoes, beans and a few other others that I was unsure of what they were.

Second, the bar truly is beautiful.  There is a nice big window looking out/in to the street, and the bar looks extremely inviting from the outside and is nice and cozy from the inside. The brunch is a knock you on your butt sort of meal.  I love the eggs benedict on the southern biscuit with the bacon gravy.  Add a side of bacon, some bacon grits, and a bourbon bloody mary or two and your will likely sleep the rest of the afternoon.

"Since we had been in the neighborhood shopping around, we decided to give it a try after finding a parking spot right on the block. Like many of the places to eat around here this place is small. There was a crowd out front but, we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Not too bad for a Saturday afternoon. We were taken into the back. The room was what appeared to be a nicely converted garage.(Although it will probably be freezing in there come winter.) As for the food. We ordered chicken & waffles, shrimp & grits, 2 sweet teas. Food came quickly. It seems that most people are watching to see what everyone else ordered. No fancy plating here, food is served like you would have at home. The chicken was divine but I am still trying to figure out what the waffle was made of as it was flat, the color was not too appealing,  & it did not have much flavor. Fluffy buttermilk waffles would have been so much better. The shrimp and grits were very tasty, creamy grits ladled over the shrimp topped off with a green sauce/salsa. For dessert it was banana cream pie and apple cheddar, both were delicious. On the way out the crowd had grown and the wait 30+ minutes. Overall, I was glad that I had the opportunity to try this place. I would go back for the pie alone.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Sometimes it pays to just walk around the neighborhood with foursquare up. I saw they had an offer for a complimentary chocolate hazelnut mousse so I thought, why not? Love the ambiance, pretty cozy with soft lighting and the requisite candles. The seating may be a bit claustrophobic for some (my girlfriend included) but you're not in danger of constantly bumping elbows. Now for the important stuff: the food. The ceviche was mediocre; I feel like I've had better elsewhere. Everything else was great, however. They have a delectable grilled octopus, but be cautious with the octopus ink. My girlfriend had the house beet pasta while I had a seared sea bass, both of which were delicious. I'd pass on the mousse next time though.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First of all, let me tell you that we were staying at the setai hotel for an extended anniversery getaway and had dinner here as our first major meal in the city.  The restaurant itself is very pleasant inside and had a nice romantic feel to it.  Very soft and quiet (though went around 6:30 so the place hadn't filled in fully yet).  The staff were perhaps some of the best we've had (and we went to several high end restaurants over the weekend).  Our server explained everything to us and gave great suggestions.  We decided to go with the 4 course prix fixe which was more than enough food for us and gave us time to slowly enjoy our meal together.  For the appetizer, I ordered the fio gras (I had never had this before but really wanted to try it).  It was nice and buttery as you would expect after feeding a poor duck to death just to get his liver fatty enough to be spreadable on toasted bread!  My wife had the zupe di aglio (garlic soup) which was one of the best dishes either of us ordered all night.  I then had the risotto with duck confit.  It was amazing and perhaps the best thing I ate all weekend.  My wife had the tortelli which was also nice but a little softer on flavor than my risotto.  I then had the tagliata for my meat dish.  It was decent but not amazing.  My wife liked it more than me -- I was fairly underwhelmed by it.  My wife got the sea bass (spigola) which she really enjoyed except that the fennel flavor on the dish was quite strong and caused everything it touched to taste like black licorrace.  If you like that flavor, you'll love this dish.  The fish itself was cooked and flavored nicely.  We both got chocolate desserts which were both delicious.  Overall, we had a really nice time and the food was above average.  No five stars here just because our main dishes were just ok instead of amazing.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A bit conflicted on this one. A a below-average experience overall but the pan perdu is superb and the homemade caramels with the bill are a nice touch.   Came for brunch with a group. The restaurant is a little loud but that actually works well for either big groups or families with kids. Friendly and quick service for brunch. From the orders among our group, my sense is the food is very ""your mileage may vary.""  The pan perdu is unique, fantastic and well worth the trip - delicious, custardy with almost the consistency of bread pudding and an excellent maple syrup. Another highlight is the lunch lasagna - meaty with complex flavors. Where Landmarc falls short is with the brunch staple eggs Benedict. With three variations on the menu (benedict, florentine and norwegian), I thought they would have nailed this.  The hollandaise sauce tasted bland, the egg was underpoached (runny whites?) and worst of all, the burnt flavor from the English muffin was the dominant flavor in the dish. All in all - come for the sweeter side of brunch or the lunch menu but skip it if you're looking for savory brunch options.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is my favorite yakitori place! They used to only serve dinner, but now they are open during lunch too. This was just late last year (2010). This has the vibe of a Tokyo izakaya. First you go up a flight of stairs, very steep, but that's okay, you must come hungry. Then you turn left and bam, the receptionist is there. They do not take reservations, so be prepared to wait for a little bit. The waiting area is just a row of high stools behind the yakitori bar, where people are actually dining, which makes it a bit awkward to be almost hovering over them while waiting for them to finish eating. Inside there are tables that are good for groups of 4 or six. But if you come alone or just as a pair, they might seat you at the bar, which is preferrable for me because you get a view of the cooks grilling your skewers. I usually order scallops, beef tongue, chicken tails and shisamo. They have pepper powder and salt at every table so you can salt and add spice as you wish. To balance with some starch, the rice ball with plum matches these skewers perfectly. I once sat beside another loyal fan of YT and he ordered quail egg on the side with the chicken balls. He dipped the chicken balls in the quail egg yolk before eating. Being very curious, I tried it, and happy to report it is very yummy! It sounds gross for some, but it is actually very safe to eat egg yolk, as long as the egg is pasteurized..","[1.0, 0.0]"

After the cocktails, the night moved on to an amazingly fresh Arugula & Honeycrisp Apple Salad. For the main course, we shared the BEST burger I'd ever had in my life and one of the tastiest and crispiest Fried chicken and cheddar waffles. Yes cheddar waffles! My mouth is watering just thinking about this meal. Then came dessert... we had a tough time deciding but we went with the Mini Pecan Pie Sundae... It was delicious as well!

"I would have given them 5 stars but last night they pissed me off. I usually stop in here for their steak tacos for take out. last night i went in hoping to sit but as usual this place is CROWDED. so i ordered my take out then went to the bar to have a drink. i decided, oh let me just eat one of my take out tacos at the bar when my order was done. i was told by the bartender that i cannot eat take-out at the bar. ok fine, your policy is your policy. (though i find it preposterous that you will tell someone who just ordered your food and your drink, that they cannot eat your food at your bar where they are having your drink). so i ask the bartender then what should i do? what's the other option so i can eat at the bar? put the food on a plate? pay a eat in fee? what? like a deer in headlights, he doesn't answer my actual question. instead he keeps repeating like a robot that i can't eat [their take-out food] at the bar. i looked at him bewildered and just say ""ooook."" and continued to hurry and try to gulp down a big glass of a margarita. after i rushed to finish my drink, instead of being able to order some extra food which is what i was willing to do, so i can take a little longer to savor my cocktail, i decided to talk to the manager. it just gets dumber from here on out. i was trying to get contact info to call her the next day because the place was loud and crowded and i didn't want to yell. but instead i was forced to have the conversation about eating at the bar then. i tried to explain to her, that i get that it's your policy not to eat the food i ordered in your restaurant for take out at your bar. but i should have been given another option, like i don't know, ordering some food NOT FOR TAKE-OUT and eating at the bar like everyone else??? instead she was just like ""oh it's because you already ordered food."" so wait a minute! there's a food ordering quota now??? i can't order take out and then order something else so i can eat at the bar? i was so pissed. i had to rush my drink, and wasn't even allowed the option to order more food because i'd already ordered food. classy taqueria. learn some customer service and pick better policies. if i didn't already pay for the food and drink i would have (or should have) thrown it in your faces last night.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So, I'm usually a fan of the Taiwanese-type hotpot (note: the difference is in the broth of the non-spicy side and the spices used for the spicy side). But since there doesn't seem to be one in NY (there are a lot of those in LA), Mister Hotpot is really the next best thing. I'm so glad to have found it because FINALLY I can satisfy my craving for spicy hotpot!! I will ONLY eat hotpot with people who appreciate intestines and pig's blood. The one thing that is probably better than the hotpot restaurants in LA would be how soft and flavorful the pig's intestines are! We had to order 2 of those intestines because it was SO GOOD! I also really enjoyed the broth (if you get the split pot one) of the non-spicy side. Even though I like the spicy side more and tend to cook more of my food on that side, I will still put some ingredients on the non-spicy side because it makes the soup so much better in the end. The broth they use has a milky white color because it's probably cooked with beef/pork bone marrow for long periods of time and it is soo flavorful. (the taiwanese ones usually use fermented vegetables soup as soup base). Can't say which I like better since both are really good :) There is something magical about their hotpot because i keep wanting to go back and order those intestines!!

The only other type of pizza that comes even close to the magic of the artichoke slice is the crab pizza. Not quite as good, but still worth it. I've had the margherita and white slices; they're tasty, but not amazing or inventive. If that's more your speed, you can definitely find something cheaper.

"Just came back from brunch. It's so nice to have a classy and friendly brunch place to go in Queens instead of joining the line in Manhattan (you know which places I'm talking about). Granted the brunch menu is quite small and entree salads are limited (if management is really this, please ask your wonderful chef to create more entree salads! :P), I've to give my thumb ups to the great service. The waitstaff accommodated the dish I wanted. When one item was missing from my salad, he apologized and brought the item back to me right away. The prices are reasonable and the portion is no diner serving, so it's just right and won't make you hold your tummy out the door. The cappuccino was delicious too. Very casual and laid back atmosphere. Partial walls are in brick, whereas others were stocked with a shelf with random items that give the place a rustic look. I'd imagine it must feel really sexy and atmospheric to eat dinner there. Outdoor seating would be great, but really, not much of a scene there and because it's at the corner of a busy street, you'd just be inhaling gas and dust. So stay in. Too bad it's so difficult to get there by public transportation, but it's definitely a nice addition to the neighborhood.

The food redeemed our experience slightly.  I ordered the Hokke teishoku, and my partner ordered the Mackerel.  The fish was cooked nicely, but some of the other components were lackluster.  The oroshi (grated Daikon) was bitter and spicy, which results from slicing the daikon incorrectly.  The pickled vegetables were bland.  And the chawanmushi lacked anything but runny eggs.   Perhaps it was an off-day, but the service and poorly prepared sides do not entice me to return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here with my friend and her mom after my friend's wedding dress fitting at Kleinfeld's a few blocks away last month, May 2010.  It was a nice day, not too hot but one of the first warmer days in a while.  We were supposed to be able to get breakfast items still bc we had asked the hostess since we sat down before 5pm.  We weren't greeted till after 5pm so the manager came over and explained the mistake and that he would send out any appetizers we'd like, on the house.  I took off a star for that part, the fact that the wait staff was inattentive almost the entire time we were there (luckily we didn't care so much bc we were having fun talking wedding dresses and wedding details).  They sent over a lovely tuna dish and the ""mac attack"" both of which were so different yet so delicious!  My favorite mac attack was the one with smoked gouda (I'm a gouda kinda girl).  The prices were decent for Chelsea and we got to sit right on the edge of the restaurant and the outdoor patio.  We enjoyed the sun and the breeze while not having to deal with obnoxious people walking around. Luckily we made it in right before the dinner crowds started coming.  The chairs (I'm a big believer of judging a restaurant's outdoor patio by its chairs) look  like they'd be uncomfortable but in reality they're very comfortable.  The drinks that passed us by, mojitos specifically, looked phenomenal.  I can't wait to come back and try them. I got a steak caesar salad that comes with a biscuit that acts as the crouton that has a goey runny egg in the middle cooked to just the right temperature.  The dressing tasted like real caesar dressing made with anchovies and had it not been for the mac attack I ate earlier in the meal, I woul dhave downed the entire salad (which was quite big).   Dessert was the apple bites with ice cream which was also like heaven in my mouth and dessert was hard to choose.  All the dessert items sounded mouth watering! Cafeteria seems to do comfort food at a trendy level with gourmet added to the mix and I love it.  I think its a definite try if you're in the area and if you're looking to conserve funds then get one thing like the salad because the dishes seem to be quite big!  I'd love to come back for the breakfast items because they looked to die for! And I'll have to come back for more dessert too!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ventured in to the city from Queens the other night for dinner with the girls, and was not disappointed. Typically unimpressed with Spanish food of any kind, but of course I trusted my company. First impression of Cafe Habana: super small. Plus a 40 min. wait + empty stomach = not amused. Luckily we were seated in about half the time. We got a super-squished table in the back but hey, we were seated. My friend ordered for the table: 3 orders of the famous corn (don't judge, it is really that good), an order of the roast pork with moros y cristianos, and a cuban sandwich. One word, CORN. Cheesy, spicy, tangy roasted corn goodness. And side note, no need to be embarrassed by the combination of cheese kernels and mayo all over your face. The table to the left of you, right of you, and front of you will most likely have ordered the exact same. Pork was pretty good, not a fan of veggies in my rice though (mini turn-off). The flan was a little thicker than I like but hey, it was still delicous. On that note people keep in mind one thing during your visit to Habana's: CORN.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cheesecake, plain.  We walk to Schubert Alley (the real location for this) or to original in Bk or to GCT to use calories in advance.  We order Cheesecake, plain.  We tried toppings & swirls; no disguising needed.  We attempted a light dinner once, but it was besides the point.  Cheesecake, plain.  Our Aussie friends agree.  Our SF friends agree.  This location has two take-out areas, true t-o in the alley & t-o with picnic tables on W 45 St, plus service dining.  People who work here usually are nice.  The tourists are hysterical.  The ambiance is meh to tacky.  The cost & calories are high compared to other cake slices, so we are amenable to sharing.  Junior's Cheesecake, plain.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ok, here's the thing about Eataly: it's been set up by 'big business' Italo-Americans bringing what they feel is authentic Italian food (some of it is no doubt) to the populous of NY. All well and good, but in doing so they've lost sight of what Italian food is about. As an Italian I have never had to queue to get into a food store, when I do go to a food store, I do not expect to see an American concept of what people think Italy is like, I certainly don't expect to pay Eataly prices, and I like a choice of products, not just a few house-hold names (Barilla, Lavazza) thrown in with a bunch of artisan (for that read expensive) brands which are stocked solely to impress New Yorkers. In setting up Eataly they have created a brand - a virtual 'Italian' shopping experience, while forgetting that Italian food is about simplicity, frugality and comfort.","[1.0, 0.0]"

picklicious good!  The fried pickles were worth the trip to Astoria.  Many people may not know this but there is an art to fried pickles.  Sweet Afton has figured out the perfect combo of batter to pickle ratio using a perfectly tart pickle - add in a spicy mayo dipping sauce..yummy.  Im a bit of a wuss when it comes to cocktails.  They have a dirty pickle martini which was like pickle infused vodka - I think I would have enjoyed it more mixed with tonic only cause as I said i'm a bit of a wuss and it was too strong for me.  The bar tender was super friendly as was the wait staff.  They were crazy busy and were still all smiles.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

All of our guests loved it (in fact, it was the requested pizza restaurant over L&B-sorry Spumoni Gardens! Everyone's been digging the thin crust, coal fired pizza!)

"A lad from church had mentioned this place, so I put in in my list of places to try out. I was under the impression that it was more like a french bistro/cafe so I went with the mindset of getting a croissant, maybe some tea. I took my friend with me on Saturday, and we have to say we loved the decor. She said it reminded her of the places she would go when she lived in Australia. Anyways, we were handed a menu, but it turned out there was a flat fee for a brunch meal. I wasn't that hungry so my friend and I split the meal in two. Kara, who waited on us, was super charming and very patient with us. She and the manager were very accommodating with our requests. All in all we were blown away by the service. And the food was rad. We tried such interesting flavors. The squash blossoms were amazing. Given my initial mindset, I still had a craving to satisfy and was given some little chocolate croissants :) and other asst mini pastries. I ordered green tea, which was good too. My friend downed the bellini haha The place has really good vibes. The other clients looked like they were having a good time, and people were engrossed with their gourmet meals.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Originally, we thought of a 4 stars... Although we encounter a few bummers during the night and this morning after having unslept on it... we are giving a 3 but really because we like Traif (same owners). First, it was really cold inside. The AC was over cooling the place and it did not establish a comfortable mood for our dinner. Cocktails were good but the only disappointing part is that with the ice cubes cocktail you really drink it when you are almost at dessert... Which is not a cocktail / aperitif anymore. The toasted black sesame - almond with house tequila was good . The food comes first ready, first served , as Traif. Until there no problem... Except when they forget one of the most important ones : the sliders. The bone marrow taste was good, maybe not melting enough like butter and the beef tartare was not good. The butterfish hamachi was good, the Mexican spicy edamame was good. The Coconut tuna was not pleasant and almost frozen... and the Brussels sprouts are fried so it removes all that deliciousness about them. Life and food is about balance... Not here. The scallops were good, the foie gras was good, the ribs were ok. We are still cold with goosebumps all over our arms and waiting for the sliders which never came. Meanwhile, someone refilled tap water on our bottled sparkling water. What a waste. One of us expressed it and the manager brought some sparkling water from the gun bar (sorry, that does not replace bottled sparkling water with minerals). We thought of leaving at this point but again, because it's the same owners as Traif, we thought of not leaving on a bad note. So we gave the desserts a try. We got the tres leche carrot cake and the maple flan. And that was good !!! Pfiou.... Something at least alchemic and as fine as you can find next door. But one of us could not digest the food. He got sick during the night, and another one is still trying to calm an unhappy stomach. We will not be back, we'll keep it at Traif only.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After our light dinner at John Dory my friend and I decided to come here for some fancy cocktails. She's been here before but this was my first as the first time I tried to stop by almost a year ago they were closed. Of course, the actual library area was at capacity so we had to be content with staying at the main bar area. We weren't complaining as we easily got drinks for ourselves. My friend got a tequila cocktail while I ordered the Sons of Liberty cocktail. My drink was fantastic! It was boozy but refreshing, aromatic and had complexity in its flavor. It was definitely one of the best cocktails I've had of late. I also enjoyed the gorgeous decor. Very classy and it would be perfect for date night. The drinks are pricey of course and each drink are about $16 or more. But over all, the atmosphere and the classy vibe along with the excellent mixologists make this bar worth it.

"I have to be honest, I was a bit disappointed in this restaurant. The location is weird but beautiful (hidden away between NYU Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital). It over looks the East River and the FDR Drive. The restaurant also has it's own garden where they grow their own vegetables. The space is very open and modern. We had the following: Smoked Ricotta Gnocchi (good, not great - it didn't taste smoked) Duck Confeti Ravioli (very tasty) Diver Scallops (cooked to perfection) Rib Eye and Brisket (inedible. Loaded with gristle. The hubby spit most of his meal into his napkin) Fingerling potatoes (good but a bit on the salty side) Peanut Caramel Chocolate Tarte (Not great and not worth the calories. It was deconstructed and boring) Affogato (good but boring) French Press coffee (If you haven't mastered the French Press don't serve it - had coffee grinds in my cup) What was really surprising is that it attracted a much older crowd. Very few people under 60. The hubby and I were the youngest by at least 30 years. On a positive note, plenty of jewelry and shoe eye candy. It wasn't worth the steep check and we won't be coming back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

When I checked in on a Tuesday night it was already fairly busy and I was looking at a 20 minute wait. I opted to get a drink at the front bar (they had a variety of Goldshlager cocktails on special). It was delicious and did ease the pain of the wait. As the time passed the other person in my party showed up and I let the host desk know. They barely batted an eyelash. Their response was always an ""okay"" or ""not yet"" - not a single smile in the bunch. This was really a bad first impression in my opinion. Eventually it was our turn to be seated and we were greeted with zero enthusiasm. I have to say that was my only complaint. Pork buns are great of course as is the ramen. I will say it's not quite rave worthy as I have had a couple of rival ramen bowls in the city as well. Overall, good food and quick, efficient, and nice service.

"Verdict: An amazing place to have brunch in NY. The on the house Sangria bar has interesting varieties and the bread basket is just the way BBs should be at a brunch place. Food's great and the ambiance lively ! Location: We went to the Calle Ocho on the Upper West Side. The place is huge and one might have to wait couple of minutes before getting a seat. No outdoor seating. Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty big, with the bar upfront and big hall at the back. Buzzing with activity, its a very lively place over the weekend. One of the highlights is the Sangria bar which is on the house when you get one entrée, has many varieties and large jars topped up for all ""sat-afternoon-is-a-good-time-to-get-tipsy"" crowd. Food: As I mentioned the bread basket is great ! Its an assortment of different breads unlike many restaurants which just stack up two types of bread and offer some olive oil to dip it in. This place has atleast 6-7 types of bread, different shapes, textures, fillings and taste. For entree I stuck to a basic omelette but I have to mention the accompanying  salsa was fantastic. I tried the Mojito Sangria and loved it. Deserts - go for the Crema Catalana - you wont regret it ! Let me know how it goes Service: Was prompt except one instance where the server took very long to get us sauces but what the heck ! everything else was as good as it gets.   I am going there again soon ! This place goes on my must-do-brunch list.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Branzino was cooked to perfection with a lovely light, herbaceous stuffing. Everything I tasted was interesting without being overworked... I hate it when a dish has a laundry list of ingredients.

"We had a difficult time finding the restaurant, it's tucked away behind a bedding and linen dept. The restaurant offered a nice view and had a nice modern look. We started with the Fried Calamari which was inedible. Tough and rubbery, the breading flaked off, and the portion was small, maybe 11 or 12 small rings. We later noticed an adjacent table, with the same order, which was twice the size. The waiter removed it and did not offer to replace it. At this point we were quite hungry and we were offered one piece of bread, we had to make a decision whether we wanted semolina or white. We later asked if we might be able to have one more. Although it was not crowded, we waited an unusually long time, we had to ask a hostess if she could check on our dinner.

"I found this place through Google one night when I was seriously craving nachos and am reallllyyyyy glad I did. I ordered the steak nachos for pickup and while the wait was a bit long, the nachos were definitely better than the mexican take-out places you normally find in Woodside/Sunnyside. These were a lot more authentic. The steak was delicious and there was plenty of toppings. My only suggestion is that you ask for an extra side of chips if you won't be dining in. I ran out of chips halfway through and was pretty disappointed. I would definitely recommend it. The interior is small but nice looking and I would like to go back and have a meal there.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Love that the maharlikans are helping the wave of filipino cuisine.  They advertise heavily on their website that this is not authentic.  Hard for many Filipinos to understand that so putting it out there is great. I had the sizzling sisig to start and it was delicious. Sisig was popping off the pan and garlic rice was tasty. I recommend using the vinegar they provide. I also tried to the longanisa which I was not really a fan of.  The longanisa was a little too sweet for my tasting. The Chicken and UBE waffles was also okay.  The waffle came out cold and the chicken was just alright.  They also use a anchovy bangaoong? Was not a fan of it.   I really enjoyed the sisig and am looking forward to try the other dishes.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I LOVE, LOVE this place!!!  When my family and I come here we eat family style so we have tried most of the dishes. I love the Chicken Congee and the Duck on rice. Yum! the green scallion/ginger sauce that they use is heavenly!!!  All the other dishes on the menu are amazing too but for me, I will stick with the Duck and the Congee. During rush hours be prepared to wait a long time for a table or share a table with strangers (I usually do).  Also don't expect a super friendly service. The servers and cashiers are so busy that sometimes they forget to smile. But if your order is not right, they always fix it with out a fuss. Go for the awesome food and not the service.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Excellent & quick lunch for only $2.50! The falafel sandwich is a pretty good portion filled with fresh chunks of tomatoes, crispy shredded lettuce, and this bomb tahini sauce in tasty pita. Didn't try their hot sauce, but perhaps I'll try it next time. I think people are always intimated by the line, but your orders are made rather quickly.. just make sure to know what you're going to order before you get to the front of the line. Also, the place is TINY (only two small sit-down tables and no elbow room left for those in line), so grab your bag and get outta there.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Grimaldi's is the type of place you want to go to when you're hankering for a long wait in line and poor service. OR... if you want basic, fresh and tasty NY Style Pizza. I walked the Brooklyn Bridge for the first time and did as millions of others have done before me -- headed straight to Old Fulton St and went to Grimaldi's. Waited in line and chatted with the other people in line which made the time go by so much faster. In about 30 minutes we were inside and seated. The service sucked, but whatever, the food came out quickly and was very good. Ordered the small ($12) with mushrooms (+$2) and pepperoni (+$2). ""Soda"" (I really want to say pop here -- the Midwesterner inside me) is $2. If you use the cup of ice, make sure it's clean. Mine wasn't and they unceremoniously took my cup of ice and Sprite and came back with new ice, but of course, no replacement Sprite. I didn't have a fork. Server THREW a fork onto my plate with a loud clang. Very poor service, good food, NY tradition... what can you do? You take it or leave it. I think after that, I'll leave it, but it wasn't bad, it should be done at least once by everyone who lives/visits NY!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A very good place for dinner but reservations are a must! We went on a friday evening and although there were several tables available, the manager?? said they were already reserved and he would only be able to seat us if we ordered pizza or appetizers. However, after pulling some strings and name dropping, they were able to seat us in our own booth and were very accommodating. First impression of this place: very traditional Italian and family style restaurant. We sat in the back room which was more slower paced, and quiet enough to have a conversation and really enjoy our meal. It kind of reminds me of the restaurants where old Italian mobs would come and hang out. The waiter and manager (I'm assuming) was very nice and always asked if we needed anything, or if the food was good, etc. The chef even came out to great the customers that he knew which was very nice. They gave us a menu but I was told no one really orders from the menu and don't bother looking at it. Just order the specials instead. Yes, the specials are extensive and takes the waiter at least 5-8 minutes to rattle it out, but it's worth it. Just pay really close attention. Most of the pictures of dishes on Yelp come from the specials menu, so if you see something that you like in the pictures, they're most likely from the special's menu. I wanted the burrata and prosciutto dish as seen in pics on yelp but couldn't find it on the actual menu. That's because it's part of the special and was glad the waiter mentioned it otherwise I would have ordered the boring mozzarella and tomato appetizer that I always order. The burrata was amazing. The fresh mozzarella was stuffed with pine nuts, basil and roasted peppers and a few slices of prosciutto. I devoured this in minutes. The mozzarella was very soft and so was the prosciutto and the filling of pine nuts, basil and peppers added a different texture and flavor to it. I can eat this every day. My bf ordered the chicken soup special. This was probably my least favorite dish because it didn't taste like anything special and reminded me of the vegetable soup my dad makes all the time. I ordered the osso bucco with gnocchi and it was great. It was also the most expensive of the the dishes we had costing $40. If I knew the price, I would have thought twice about it but it's good to try it I guess. The meat was very soft and fell off the shank. I devoured the marrow from the shank. I love the buttery and distinct taste of marrow but I can see why some people don't like it. It was my first time eating gnocchi and I didn't like it at all but it's my personal preference. It was very soft  yet chewy but I was basically eating a ball of cooked dough...which is exactly what gnocchi is. I would order the dish again though if they can substitute the gnocchi with a different type of pasta like pappardelle or something lighter. My bf ordered the pappardelle rabbit ragu. It was my first time eating rabbit so I was a bit skeeved but it reminded me of duck meat and it tasted fine.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"All my years of going to NYU grad school, I've never heard of this place..until the night of our last ever final when a classmate suggested we go celebrate here. Worth the special occasion. I loved the low key entrance at the end of quiet townhouse street. Apparently this place is packed all the time. Our wait time was about an hour and some change before getting a seat. In the meantime I enjoyed their Riesling Kabinett at the bar. Menu was tapas style.  Being a big group, we shared most of the meals. Standouts were the fried goat cheese, Bacon Wrapped Dates & Olives. Other dishes that made the table were  the Angus Beef Slider In Turkish Yufka Pastry, Squid Ink Paella, Pulled Pork Empanadas and Lamb Meatballs. Everything was tasty. The toasted Bass with North african spiced yogurt didn't look like it would taste soooo good but man was it good. We ordered it twice. The only downside is that this place is always always crowded....and loud. Oh and it's expensive.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I LOVE pizza. And I eat pizza almost every week, so I've had my fair share of pizza, but I must admit that THIS is the best pizza I've ever had. Which really surprised me because I live in Brooklyn near Grimaldi's - and I have always considered their pizza to be one of the best I've ever had. After reading all this hype about Di Fara, I finally gave in and made the trek to Midwood. And I must say, it was not only worth the trip, but it was worth the wait. Dom makes each individual pizza by himself. He really does use the freshest cheese and the most delicious tomatoes. He meticulously grinds the cheese for ever pie and then hand cuts the basil leaves for the finishing touch. I ordered the regular round pie and when I took the first bite, I was hooked. The pie was baked to perfection and you can taste the freshness of the tomatoes and the cheese. After finishing a whole pie, I could see myself going for more (but I didn't) because I was full. But I was REALLY tempted because it was THAT good. You should run there ASAP since Dom is the only one that makes the pizza but he's been scaling back the hours. He was open 7 days a week, then reduced it to 6, and now it's only open 5 days a week (closed Monday and Tuesday.) Hurry before it's too late and he retires! You don't want to miss it. Highly recommended and totally worth the wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Great spot in Brooklyn to go for brunch. The food was amazing. I had the pulled pork grits and my girlfriend had the all walks of toast (french toast). Couldn't have been happier or more stuffed.

"I really wanted to like this place.  Cute open space, waitress and hostess were super nice, easy on the wallet (most mains hovering around $10, brunch cocktails around $5), we (a party of 3) were seated immediately around noon on a Saturday, and the place seemed to have good reviews.  We ordered the eggs benedict, steak and eggs, and waffles-- all ok enough, which is fine considering the price and lack of a wait to be seated.  But I probably won't be coming back because, sadly (as others had previously warned on yelp), we waited over an hour for our food!!!!  We hungrily watched as everyone around us, including folks who were seated after us, received their food.  After almost 45 minutes of waiting, our waitress apologized and explained that our food had apparently been ""misplaced.""  Even after that point, we watched as other people got their food- and waited at least another 20 minutes until our food arrived.  I felt bad for the waitress, as the situation was a bit beyond her control.  But it just seems pretty ridiculous that misplaced food results in a 1 hour+ wait for a few simple brunch items.  There are plenty of other brunch spots in the area that have more efficient service and better food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm a bit late on writing my review, but still thinking excitedly about my next visit, and wanted to write in my positive words. I had a free evening and decided to give grab a solo bite at the bar. The owner, Simon, greeted me at the door and checked my coat when the hostess was busy seating other guests. I found an empty seat at the bar and just ordered a glass of wine, but will make sure to try out some of the interesting looking cocktails next time after seeing the bartenders work their magic behind the bar with the interesting drinks. The amuse bouche was delicious (and tiny). I ordered the Bucatini with Dungeness Crab for my meal, which was delicious and generous on the crab meat, and a perfect portion size. I loved that just when you think you're getting to the bottom and there will just be noodles at the bottom of your plate, there was a secret crab stash at the bottom. The staff was great and attentive, and the owner was really friendly, making his rounds assuring that his guest were happy. I love that Piora has joined my neighborhood, and cant wait to return. Best of luck to Simon with continued success of his first restaurant. Hope there will be more to come.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Once upon a time, there was a slightly insomniac (not so) little girl who lived in Battery Park City. One miserable-turned-magical morning, she stumbled upon Bubby's. Much to her delight, the place was OPEN at 8am (she later discovered they're open 24 HOURS! Except on Tuesdays). She peered in suspiciously, still in disbelief over this fata morgana, and spotted people inside moving about.  The dining room resembles the inside of a treehouse, a pricey treehouse with a hipster edge, and it smells like bacon and toast. [Turning off the storybook voice] I don't know what ambiance they're going for here, but it's oh-so-adorable. Bubby's is expensive (finding anything under $8 on the menu is pretty hard, even under the juice section), but the portion is generous and the food is good. It's also comparable to other brunch places in the area (Sarabeth's, Locanda Verde and the likes).  The menu is really simple, there are maybe 6-7 items under the breakfast plates section and a special section for pancakes.  Around me, I noticed families with young children, and some lone diners. Despite the ridiculously giggly children, the place was quiet enough to hold a conversation, read a book, or just peacefully demolish a stack of pancakes. I don't particularly enjoy breakfast or brunch, but Bubby's breakfast was good.  I got it with home fries, scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. The bacon was thick and sufficiently crispy, the eggs perfectly fluffy, and the home fries surprisingly not greasy at all. The most unexpected part of the meal was how amazing the toast and butter were. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was Kriemhild's sweet meadow butter (""from grass-fed cows,"" it claims) that really pulled this meal together. After demolishing a good portion of the plate, I didn't have enough room for pies (not sure they were serving pies that early in the morning anyway).  I agree with Megan C, it's comfort food that's not an unhealthy meal. Still, it pained me a bit to pay $18 for breakfast and $5 for iced coffee when they don't even refill the coffee! (free refill with hot coffee)  Don't forget to check out the photo booth and pinball machine downstairs.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Waiters seemed a little off - took a long time to get attention, then there were two of them, and they clearly weren't working together, which was annoying and confusing.

For dinner I ordered the Penne Gratinate a pasta dish with mushroom and marinara sauce. She had the Ravioli Caserecci which she thoroughly enjoyed.

First, I really like the decor and ambiance. Second, the food is just as sophisticated as it's decor. I had the tricolor salad salad, but I substituted the goat cheese for feta cheese-at no extra charge! The salad was tasty and the dressing (balsamic vinaigrette) was yummy also. I also really liked the grilled apples In it. I added a piece of salmon and although it was tasty It seems they may be using frozen salmon filets. My waitress was attentive.

"The atmosphere of the Rabbit Hole actually deserves a five - especially in the summer with its vine draped patio. The interior is equally beautiful, having dark wooden-bar, lowly lit with chandalier- and candle-light. Then, there is the food!  Every item I have yet ordered is absolutely divine.  Last night, I ordered the red lentil soup and the red beet salad.  I would definitely order each one again, though the red lentil soup was my favorite.   The only thing that sets this restaurant back is that most main course items do not come with sides.  You have to order everything a la cart, which makes a meal quite expensive.   My soup and salad combo ended up being $14-15.  The perfect thing to do in this case is to share a salad and a sandwich with a friend but only if you want a light meal.  The portions are quite moderate.  That said, I already know what I will order next time... the black bean burger and the red beet salad.   I have also been to the Rabbit Hole for breakfast, and I think this might be the best time to come.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich both times I went there, because it is simply that delicious.  Oh, yes!  And it is also only $6-7.  Although it doesn't come  with any sides, it makes a good meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Our breakfast was a complete disaster here. Food was fine but service was terrible. They would not seat us until our whole party of 4 arrived even though restaurant was empty. While waiting at the restaurant I leant against a ledge that had wet paint but was not signed. It ruined my brand new shirt. They told me it was painted this morning! Why wasnt it signed! Took ages for them to agree to comp our meal. In the end they said the comp was only for my pancakes and a round of drinks. Not coffee or my friends. This was not what the manager had promised us.

"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York. It's everything I am... if I was a restaurant. Simple, unassuming, seasonal and local cuisine. I started with some local IPA from New York. It was okay (I was longing for my San Diego-based Stone IPA at that point). I ordered a crispy kale salad with smoked bacon and pine nuts. It was a decent starter, but I felt like I could get this at other places. I followed that up with a roasted bone marrow croque, which was actually a very very nice dish. The richness of the bone barrow was complimented nicely with the overly crunchy piece of toast. If I came again, I'd probably order the burger as everyone around me was eating one, and they all looked damn delicious.

"Happy hour: Monday-Friday from 4-7pm. Sold.  Overall rating really was 3.5  (-0,5 for food), but I'd prefer to round up cuz I had a good time here. Came here tonight (Friday) at 6:30 to beat the crowd since we didn't have reso and coincidental made it for their Happy Hour specials....awesome! Food was a mix of hits and misses. Red Sangria was done well. What we ordered: FISH TACOS: solid. Fish was crispy outside n moist inside with a fresh crunchy addition from the cabbage...and some good sauce. WILD MUSHROOM TACOS: delish. I'd order again. BILILLO: meh. Baguette was a bit stale. Bbq pork itself was tasty, but there's not much else to it with the bread. Gets boring fast. CACTUS n CHEESE TACOS: server recommended, but I didn't like it. Cactus was too sour and fried cheese wasn't crispy or toasty.   DUCK ENCHILADA: flat. too dry and not much going on. The red sauce was bland and there's no cheese to add...an umph? Missing a kick. Boring. Our server was very attentive and sweet. Would come back for brunch...pictures from other yelpers look pretty delicious.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have been to Japan and have had some of the finest Ramen an American tourist could ever have.  I think this place does it well, though I think it is a little bit spendy for just a bowl of noodles.  Sure its gourmet, but I swear this stuff is cheaper in Tokyo.  And that city makes NYC look stupidly cheap by comparison. It was a great date night between my old lady and I, this place was glitzy and a nice change of pace from all of the other Italian joints that I hit up all the time.  Plus, its not easy finding a good Japanese place in the city but that is beside the point.  The total bill came out to be about $60 with wine and a couple of sensational appetizers.  I think I could drink the broth of my bowl for weeks.  You'd swear there was crack in that soup!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As I continue my somewhat search  for a great burger in the city, my sis and I ventured to Bare burger. She wanted to go here, because of their menu having other meats besides the standard here. She wanted to try a bison burger. So we got there and we were seated right away, which definitely was a good thing on a Sunday afternoon. She ordered the Supreme burger with bison, and i had a Bacon Cheeseburger with Bison. We also ordered a side of onion rings to share. I will start off saying, I loved the onion rings. I am big on onion rings and just love them. Now to the burgers, I would say that the burgers were prepared well, but we both realized me (my second time having bison) are not bison fans. Realizing the meat is a bit gamey for my taste. The burgers were kinda small, when u think of the burgers from Five Guys or even my favorite LA haunt of Hole in the Wall. But it wasn't too bad. I would say they are a bit pricey, considering the portion size.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great California-style tacos at low, low prices. The al pastor was the best I've ever had, with meat and pineapple sliced right off the spit and nestled on a tortilla that tasted of fresh corn. The asada was diced steak, charred on the outside with a pink interior. Nice fresh salsa and cilantro on top, and a selection of others to add if you wish. Guacamole and cheese and crema are available, but these tacos needed nothing else. Taqueria Diana is a small space, open to 2nd Avenue so you can grab and go. There are a few stools at the back. I ate in, and loved the way the tacos were served - on a sturdy rectangular aluminum tray covered in parchment paper. The only beverages available are a selection of Mexican sodas, but after the bar, who cares what else you're drinking. There's a lot of competition in the vicinity, but Taqueria Diana stands out, and not just for the inviting logo and convenient location. New York needs more high quality Mexican food, and this one holds its own.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"You truly are missing out if you havent been here for the weekend brunch. The several bloody marys I ordered were fresh, consistent and strong. The fried egg sandwich is hands down the best egg sandwich I've ever had, you need to try it yourself to understand. I also ordered the french toast which was amazing as well.

"This is a five star rating for DELIVERY.  I haven't dined in at this place, but I'm sitting here stunned, blown away by how fantastically The Thirsty Koala's food traveled, how nuanced its flavors were, and how fresh the ingredients tasted.  It's rare that you get pristine quality food out of tin containers, but honestly, the kitchen could've been 15 feet from my table rather than .8 miles.  I'm shocked. My girlfriend and I had the vegetarian chili, tacos and an arugula salad.  In the tacos and the chili, there was beautiful earthiness throughout thanks to outstandingly fresh mushrooms.  Each dish had a similar flavor profile--both contained walnuts too--which made for a wonderfully cohesive eating experience.  The arugula salad was kick ass as well. As a vegetarian, the idea that this place served marsupial was a little off-putting.  And after my experience with The Thirsty Koala, I'm actually a little more upset about the marsupial factor, because this place could easily thrive on its vegetarian options alone.   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how polite our delivery person was.   Wonderful all around delivery experience.  Easily the best out of my 10+ here in Astoria so far.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My boyfriend and I took a day trip to NYC. It was his first time in the city. I took him all over the place including the Majestic Theater for a matinee of Phantom of the Opera. I made reservations here for dinner 2 weeks in advance. We were early, they were PACKED, but they sat us quickly anyway. My boyfriend and I are both Italian so this was really a wonderful choice for us. The food was spectacular, our waiter was attentive. Great wine selections as well as entrees and desserts. Very warm, comfortable setting, and romantic to boot. :) I will definitely come back here for our next trip and I will forever suggest this place to friends.   We both got CAPRESE salad: Fresh tomato, imported mozzarella di bufala and basil - with Prosciutto di Parma Alex's Dinner: RIGATONI alla Trecolori Sweet Italian sausage, broccoli rabe and sun-dried tomato in a roasted garlic-pesto sauce My Dinner: LINGUINE NERE alla MONSIGNORE Homemade black (squid ink) linguini with shrimp, scallops, squid, clams, and mussels in our flavorful marinara For dessert Homemade sweet Cannoli with whipped cream, strawberries, raspberries and raspberry sauce.

"I was just walking exploring Ridgewood, specifically Metropolitan Ave. when I walked passed this place.  Even though it's a small building, you can't miss it because there is nothing else of interest around that part of Metropolitan.  My wife and I came back a week later and had an excellent meal.  It's a cozy, little place with mismatched furniture and interesting decor.  Even the bathroom is worth checking out.  I love the toilet paper tube dispenser and the plant.  I was also impressed with the simple menu.  In Chinatown you can get overwhelmed with the amount of dishes offered.  At Bunker they focus on making a few excellent dishes instead of throwing ingredients into the same broth like other restaurants. Anyways, let's get to the food.  We split the Crab Banh Xeo, which was very good.  It had lots of bean sprouts, which I like, and the egg, shrimp and bacon combination worked really well.  I'll start making omelets with though ingredients.  The crunchiness made it all that much better, as well. The Suon Nuong Xa was also great.  I flipped the egg over and let the yolk drip into my rice.  Tasty!  I didn't touch the sauce, at first, because I thought it was going to be that sweet, Thai sauce that I don't like.  It turned out to have more of a lemon flavor and excellent.  It was refreshing and a nice surprise.   My wife had the Ca Ri Ga.  I love Roti and this was some of the best I've had.  If you love curry, you'll love this dish. To make a long story short, I'll be going back for sure.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Eataly. Where do I begin? Lets consider Eataly the mecca for any Italian American. I first came to Eataly with my parents a few years ago and we ended up spending four hours in the store. I know, you think I'm crazy to spend 4 hours here but we loved every minute of it! The store can be a little overwhelming because there is so much to take in. First, it is a store with fresh food ranging from cheese, bread, meat, seafood, pasta and much much more. There are also goods imported from Eataly, I mean Italy. I think we spent at least 30 minutes just looking at the different shapes and sizes of pasta. Barilla pasta is also sold here, but it is not the same cut of pasta that you find in your local supermarket. The imported pasta can range anywhere from $3 to $10 so make sure you look at the price before you buy. Along with the store aspect, you can also eat at Eataly. There are numerous mini restaurants scattered throughout, each with their own set of tables and wait staff. My favorite section to dine is the pizza and pasta section because I do love my carbs. There is also a seafood, meat, and cheese/dried meats and wine section. The gelato/dessert/coffee section does not have servers and tables are first come first serve. If you are coming here for the first time come hungry! Leave your name at one of the restaurant sections and use the hour that you will wait for your table and explore every inch of the store. Keep your eyes open because you never know when you'll see a celebrity sighting. I once spotted Michael Chiarello dining. Okay, so not A-list celebrity but a food celebrity nonetheless. If you are Italian, you will be proud of your heritage and the amazing food that comes from the motherland. If you are not Italian, I'm sure by the end of your Eataly experience you wish you were. ""You are what you Eataly""","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great place, with super attentive, friendly staff in a warm atmosphere, but I had to knock off a few stars for the cramped space.

I guess that's what we get for dining at such a popular spot, but we did have an early reservation. I am determined to return on a weekday and improve this review some day. We had the three cheese as an appetizer, for $7, its a great deal.

I don't to waste time picking out tiny bits of chicken and goat bone from my mouth. It takes away from my dining experience. I don't mind bones on bigger pieces of meat, but this was just annoying.

The prix fixe menu means the chef can do whatever she wants, in our case a tiny bowl of heirloom tomato soup, homemade pasta, a crunchy little salad with piping hot pretzel rolls, seared tuna, and because I don't eat meat, a delicious stuffed squash blossom just for me (while my friend had the regular bacon-topped appetizer, which she loved).

"After being turned away due to a 2-2 1/2 hour wait one night before the holidays my sister and I stopped back in to Carmines for drink and dessert after having dinner at a nearby restaurant. Carmines was decorated for the holidays and had a fun and lively atmosphere. Our strawberry shortcake was mammoth and delicious! After hearing so many great things about the food, we decided to try back for dinner the next night. Since we got there early, we were able to get a table without a wait- but I definitely recommend making a reservation. Our server was great- really helpful and friendly. Everything here is served family style, so the portions are huge, and great for sharing- and excellent place for groups. The only drawback for us was that there was just two of us and a baby, so we didn't get to sample much since we would have had tons of leftovers- that being said we had the chicken parm and it was fabulous. Between that, a bottle of wine, and the basket of bread we were more than full, in fact we didn't even put a dent in it. I'd love to come back with a larger party so I could try out some more of the goods! Get there if you can- it's worth the wait!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We have been watching this space since the deli closed years ago and were so glad to see a restaurant opening a block away. We tried it last night and can only say that I hope it gets better. ATMOSPHERE It's pretty. The restaurant has great lighting and the decor is very understated warmth but it's a bit tight. The bar and open kitchen take up about 1/3 of the width, which isn't that big to start, so tables are close together and the walk to the single bathroom located in the back is narrow with bar patrons, servers and runners and diners all trying to get through. Also, some patrons are obviously confused by the hard-to-pull chain on the old-fashioned toilet as both times we went in, it wasn't flushed. FOOD Food was ok but nothing to shout about. My lentil, arugula and goat cheese salad was excellent. I wasn't that impressed with the steak - it was unseasoned and a bit tough -- came presented on a plate with a pile of mashed potatoes and no sauces offered. Didn't try any of the sides. We ordered the corn empanadas and ravioli for our 9-year old and she wouldn't eat either of them. The empanadas were way too cheesy and the ricotta/mushroom ravioli were a bit sweet - didn't get any flavor from the mushrooms at all. (Note: a friend who had been the day before raved about the spinach empanadas though). Our friend's calamari were undercooked so the dough was pasty and tasted of flour. She gave one to the man celebrating his birthday at the next table, 10"" away, and he agreed. My husband liked his chicken Milanese and the fries were excellent - cooked to a crisp perfectly in oil infused with herbs, rosemary perhaps. For dessert, panqueques dulce de leche were tops and what kid doesn't love chocolate gelato? Mine does, especially three scoops piled high. I found there are no small portions on the menu -- smallest steak is 12 ounces and the salad was enough for the table. SERVICE We were seated fairly quickly and the staff moved a table to accommodate us at the peak of the dinner rush. Our orders were taken and drinks arrived promptly followed not too long by bread with olive oil and then our appetizers/salads. And then it slowed down considerably. It took a very long time to get our main courses after they'd cleared the first course plates. The table seated next to us, and about 10 minutes after us,  finished their full meal, paid and were out the door before we ordered dessert.  Service felt rushed and uneven as if they just couldn't handle the volume. Overall, it wasn't a bad meal but I suppose a steak house where the salad and dessert were the best courses isn't quite cutting it. They obviously have some glitches to work out with the food and service and I am hoping sincerely that they do because the potential is there and it's sooooooo close.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is my favorite cozy little ramen place in NYC.  Minca is very minimal, just a handful of wood tables and some stools in the windows and at the small bar.  There is always some funky art on the walls and good eclectic music.   I'm not one hundred percent sure what I love about this place so much.  The noodles aren't handmade although perfectly good.  The gyoza, although they are handmade, are often a bit 'crisp' (read burnt) around the edges.  The quality is a little uneven - never quite the same from one visit to the next.  All that said, the broths are amazing, rich and creamy and complexly tasty and the gyoza are delicious.   I love to come here when I'm bummed or hung-over.  Something about the atmosphere combined with the not-quite-perfect but always yummy food is incredibly soothing; it speaks of the authenticity of home comfort.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friends who took me here professed that they absolutely adored place (knew the menu by heart, ordered from there often, etc.). For a lebanese restaurant, it's quite upscale and the decor was nice despite it's out of the way location. Our waiter was a little off... when we ordered sangria for the table, he brought us one glass. When we asked for the pitcher, he kept asking if it was suppose to be for the table. I'm not sure what that even meant. I tried the hummus with jalepeno which was really delicious as were the amazing fries which come with this garlic dipping sauce. The pita was warm and fresh baked, and when I asked the manager to put some pre-bought cakes we had from Dominique Ansel Bakery in the fridge, he was very kind to do that for us. Overall, I would say this is a solid restaurant. Not sure if I would make a special trip just for it though.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Normally I am not one for the buffet lunch ... something about it just turns me off. However, Fork & Spoon is very clean and well lit. They have a very good variety and everything has always tasted great. They normally have about 3-4 soups available as well that have been solid. I have only ever gotten soup or the buffet, but they have sandwiches, salads, udon, soba, bibimbop, and sushi. Everything always looks fresh.   Pricing is about average for the area. Staff is quick and friendly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Blew my mind. Definitely worth the hour wait. Just get some beers at the bar and before you know it you'll be chompin' on some hot, bubbly pizza. We ordered The Mootz with vegan fennel sausage, Arugula Shmoogula, and Hellboy. Hellboy was simply amazing. Don't be scared to try the hot honey, it's just the right amount of spicy and sweet. I think they might sell bottles of it too! We casually mentioned to our waitress of a birthday in our group and by the end of our meal Paulie himself came by with a dessert pizza, candles and all! He was super sweet. Even with the place jammed packed he visited each table. Really goes to show you that there are still some restaurant owners that care! Can't wait for my next visit.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"FOOD POISONING!!!!!! My dinner companions and I got very sick from the food at this restaurant.  The owner Moe did not take care of us after the fact.  After paying $1100 for 4 people, not including wine, we were very disappointed to say the least.  We thought the chef 's plates and ideas were great.  The service were outstanding.  Something was served to us that made us sick and the owner refused to acknowledge that the food was the cause. Not acceptable. Never going back to this restaurant. 0 stars","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What a cozy, dark restaurant. And by dark, I mean 'oh no the power went out' dark. I guess part of it was that it was lunch time so it seemed much brighter outside by comparison. After a while, your night vision sets in and you can see the floors for the first time. They sat us in a small alcove that had a table and two bar seats that were an awkward part of the bar. It was a really weird setup but it felt like a private room, so that was nice. The duck pappardelle was really saucy.. And interesting. I'd never had pappardelle before..or duck prepared in that kind of brown savory sauce. I would've thought it was a northern Chinese dish or maybe Mongolian.. The lobster BLT was kind of overpriced but it was undoubtedly a good sandwich. I missed out on dessert but would come back just to try it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"for me, my breakfast was ok and i think its a little overrated. i had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which are good but i am not one to ever think pancakes will ever be life changing. hash browns were so dry. and the sausage was just ok - a little dry too. i did like the flavored butter that came with the pancakes. my bf had the pastrami and egg whites which were amazing. the pastrami was crispy and juicy and the eggs were the perfect compliment. the seating it very tight - but i was seated under a picture frame where i kept hitting my head on it. they shouldnt have a table there since i am very short and still kept hitting my head on it. i probably will stay in park slope if i want a good breakfast.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The design of this restaurant is superior. So is the service. The food is just plain good, but not great, to me. Came here with my family as they were staying in the adjoining Standard East. The entire interior looks carefully and artfully designed. My wife, the erstwhile graphic designer, rolled her eyes and said it was a derivative look, wasn't quite as impressed, but hush up, wifey. I liked it. I had a couple Roll In The Hay cocktails. Very tasty. The appetizers were quite good, too. We shared the mission figs and grilled shrimp. My entree was the baby chicken. I mean, the chicken was tender and all, but why am I eating a baby? Perhaps it was more the idea of the food than the food itself, but there wasn't a lot of meat on the bone, it being a baby I was eating, after all. Now I know why people protest the eating of veal. Oh well. I'd order something else next time I came, if there is a next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Reasons why I like the Meatball Shop 1. The top of their menu says ""BALLS"" 2. Pork meatballs 3. sliders 4. special Duck meatballs! 5. Ice cream sandwiches with homemade cookies Reasons why I do not like Meatball Shop: 1. 45 minute wait = 75 minute wait 2. no mixing of my balls! My sister and I went here for dinner because I knew anything that combined meatball subs and ice cream sandwiches would be a hit with her.  It was.  However, of course the wait got to us and we were famished by the time we were sat at the bar.  Due to being so hungry, the two of us ordered this massive list of food: one beef meatball sub, one pork ""smash"" (on a bun) with mozzarella and spicy sauce, one duck slider, one side of vegetables, one side of polenta, one chocolate chip cookie sandwich with vanilla and one with caramel ice cream.  We both also drank a beer to allow something in our bellies while we waited for our food to come.  By the time we were finished we were both so full it was difficult to hold ourselves upright.  I looked at least 7 months pregnant.  It was worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I think my wife and I have been here either three or four times by now. All but one of these times, it has been uncomfortably crowded, and something always seems to be wrong with the order. But we haven't complained, because whatever they bring is good! After ordering, we are usually asked what we ordered a couple more times before actually getting our food, but once we get the food, we don't really mind. We will usually order one plate of dumplings, one plate of pan fried noodle, and one soup noodle. All of this is around $15 or so, so it is extremely inexpensive. Though the service may not be too efficient and the atmosphere may not be too great, the staff has always been very nice. Despite seeing many reviews here with complaints about the service and even despite understanding why such complaints have been posted, I would hope that this place doesn't change. The food is great and the price is very low. And I think the service actually adds something to the place. Like I said above, even if your order gets messed up, there is a very high chance you're going to get something good! I look forward to going back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am a regular at this unassuming homely little establishment. Juniper offers a refreshing break from the pomp of much of Williamsburg, paring down stuffy atmospherics to focus on making great food at a decent price. Staff are always super friendly and accommodating (last time I was there they were more than happy to move around half the restaurant to accommodate a group of 10 of us) and the owner himself will always take the time to have a chat. The burgers are phenomenal: very simple, really high quality meat and a great selection of cheeses, as are the spicy fries! Byob is a great money saver. Quaint little courtyard out the back where you can while away a balmy afternoon. I cannot speak highly enough of Juniper! If you haven't yet given it a go, it's about time you did.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"i came up here all the way from South Brooklyn for a birthday brunch for my partner and it was totally worth it. I got a little overwhelmed seeing the crowd of people waiting out front in line, but it was super fast and the host was awesome. Made waiting much more enjoyable. We got in quickly, and the service was quick. I'm also into the big community table in the middle! Got the chicken and waffle, one of the benedict, and fried pickles. So good. Everything was hot and crispy and perfect. My partner being Brooklyn-by-way-of-The-South was in heaven. This is definitely a step above just soul food, but in such a well done and enjoyable way! It's probably best for my waistline and wallet that I don't live anywhere near this place or I'd likely be here every other weekend.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you are searching for an intimate setting for good conversation, eclectic variety of tapas and wine, high-quality service, Degustation is a gastronomical gem tucked away in the East Village. My best friend just moved to New York and Degustation was the ideal location for us to catch up. With no reservation, I called the restaurant and they seated us within 20 minutes. The arrangments are set like a bar so you essentially watch the chef prepare your dishes which adds to the allure of this tapas bar. Degustation is the perfect spot for: an intimate dinner with a close friend or date. Make sure you: have a reservation or call ahead.

"Over Hyped. I feel like ramen noodles is a specific type of noodle, and when my friend ordered a ramen it came out to be like spaghetti noodles. Definitely not something we expected.

I also didn't appreciate being rushed out of the restaurant especially because I waited for so long. We weren't even done with our meal and they kept on taking it away after telling them that we weren't done.

"Nineteenth street is a bold choice for a Korean restaurant, just half a mile from Koreatown. Especially since much of the food isn't terribly exciting. The too long menu features several food trends mashed together in a not terrible interesting way. There's a small plate, American bar sensibility, thrown together with an organic, locally sourced concept with traditional Korean drinking food thrown in the mix. There's also sushi, because this is a ""classy"" place. Standard dishes, like fried calamari, are made more ""Korean"" by adding kimchi. There's kimchi everywhere, which is not the most inauthentic in the world, accept for as a free panchan. They don't offer those, at least not in the back half of the restaurant. Portions are tiny and the prices inflated. It's not a food destination, but it's a wonderful place for a drink or two. The décor is a strange, exciting new take on the ""bare wood and exposed light bulb"" concept that dominates Williamsburg. There's a line of tied off ropes separating the entranceway from the main dining space. There are several circular light fixtures that resemble Swedish Advent wreaths. Occasionally a full moon is projected at the ceiling. Admire the decorator's chutzpah while sipping an above average selection of beers (not just Hite!) and soju cocktails. The mostly Korean clientele tends to linger, so come early for a place in the bar/lounge. Check-in on Foursquare when you get here, as there's prize wheel. It's amazing - not only is nearly every slice contain a freebie, but you can get to spin to see if you get a free glass of wine, soju cocktail or order of wings. This right here elevates the restaurant from a maybe go to a must go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

On the weekend.... 1.5 hour at least. But then once you get that nice, big bowl of ramen in front of you, you'll know it was all worth it. The broth, the meat, the noodles... are just perfection. Appetizers are good too. =) It's a little bit pricey but really not too bad. It's about $14 for a bowl of ramen but at a less expensive place it will still be about $11 or $12, so not a huge difference.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Thought this would be a good place to write my first review.... My fiance and I live in Bay Ridge, and were dying for a place like this to open up.  Although we do hang around the neighborhood sometimes, the nightlife here isn't exactly our scene.  We finally tried this place a few months ago, and have been back a number of times since. Some big pluses: 1) The Backyard-  Definitely the highlight.  Minimally (but very appropriately) decorated, feels like you are in the backyard of any normal Brooklyn home.  On colder days they break out the heaters, and it works perfectly!  They have waitstaff patrolling the back, although if the wait gets too long, it is just as easy to run back into the bar/food counter and order there.  We can sit back there for hours kicking back beers. 2) The Staff - Again, very laid back, relaxed, and friendly bartenders/cooks/waitstaff.  They may not get to you right away, but you are always acknowledged when you enter and leave, which is a HUGE change from some other neighborhood haunts. 3) The Beers - No, the selection is not as big as the Park Slope beer garden, but again, I think it is appropriate for the crowd.  Usually a solid dozen or so beers and wines to select from, and a good variety at that.  For picky, experienced, beer drinkers, there are usually at least a few interesting choices, and limiting it to a dozen or so makes choosing easier.  And for the inexperienced, the choices they do have should always make for a great night. 4) The Food - Okay, if you are going here FOR the food, you might be disappointed.  I wouldn't travel from afar for the food itself.  However, if you view it as a nice little accent (I'm drunk, and there are 10 different kinds of hot dogs), it is a great deal.  Inexpensive, and does the trick.  I think there is room for them to kick up the preparation of the food a bit, but again, I am certainly not complaining.  I still order and enjoy the food. Overall, this is a fantastic place to hang.  Great beers, environment, staff, and a very welcomed hang in Bay Ridge.  If you live in the neighborhood and are used to traveling past 60th street to find a place to hang for the afternoon/evening, give this place a shot.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The server told us that our order was stuck behind a larger party, which is no excuse to me. I expected a manager to come to speak to us but never did.

"* The broth is the creamiest that I've ever had.  Tasted pretty good.  Like most ramen, it is rather salty but not the insane saltiness found at Momofuku.  Still, the broth might be too rich for some. * The toppings tasted fresh. * The pork pieces were tasty. * I find it ridiculous that ""extra spicy"" has like 12 chilis printed after it especially when it packs less heat than plain old sriracha.  I think these people believe bell peppers are spicy.  Or maybe they conflate saltiness with spiciness because it was basically a cup of salt-saturated red-colored oil with bits of gunk that hinted at chilis. * $2 for a tiny cup of kimchi topping.  It was spicier than the ""extra spicy"" oil but it is a ripoff.  Our waitress had no problems recommending items with the smallest bang for the buck; she must have thought she was such a smart businesswoman.  They don't care; they know other naive people will come take our place.  Shameless. * Ramen is like the Japanese version of American hamburger and fries.  Both are junk food that appeal to our lust for salt and fat.  Why the heck would I wait an hour for junk food? Although the ramen was good, it's absolutely not worth the wait.  I'll leave the waiting to young people and tourists. 4 (ramen) -1 (price, wait) -1 (spice hype, upselling)  = 2 stars","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have actually never been to an Aussie restaurant but now I think there needs to be more. I think this restaurant got lost on it's way to Queens because it seems like it should be on the other side of the neighborhood where all the really great and popular restaurants are. I'm glad their compass was busted and they landed in an area that needs some new talent to shake things up. For whatever reason they chose to locate in the boring zone but the experience was anything but. Had the kangaroo burger with goat cheese. It was what love tastes like. The pineapple slice that they sneak into the burger really was the perfect compliment to the bacon that topped it. Just great. The fries were actually baked potatoes that were then fried which came out amazing and the chili sauce it comes with for dipping really hit the spot. Had this great dessert that reminded me of a hostess snowball only not as sweet or crappy. It was really good and you don't feel super guilty afterward. Perfect on that summer day. The drinks were very good as well. I could see this place doing a nice happy hour. I think just about everyone that was on staff that day came by our table to see how we were doing. It may have been the cute kid, maybe they are really just interested in what you think of the food and the experience - both of which are excellent. The chef even came out and told us about the impetus for opening this place. Class act. The prices were pretty reasonable too. I've seen people complaining about a $16 burger. Seriously? In NYC? Head on down the road to one of those overpriced Greek places and let me know how your wallet feels. I got a full meal with alcohol for my wife and I and our kid ate as well and we were out of there for $70 with a very good tip. I'll be back there. I'm easy to spot.

It was quite some time before our meals were served. i think our dinner ended up being 2 hours and 40 minutes.  I mean it was great that they didn't try to rush us out, but i think some of that time could have been streamlined a bit.  I did think the way they presented the meals was fairly impressive, 4 waiters walking out with our whole tables meals at the same time. My main course was ok. I had the ricotta and chicken meatballs w pasta (there was a total of 5 small meatballs within the pasta plate). At the end the meal, was the downfall of the night.  We had told the waiter that it was our friends birthday and asked if they could do something special for the dessert portion of the meal. They completely ignored our request. On top of that the waiter made a comment before the dessert was brought out, noting we had only ordered 1 dessert for the table for the bday girl (everyone else was super full). I thought that was a bit rude. It was our choice on how many desserts to order and that comment was uncalled for. Overall a 3 star experience, too bad, it started off with so much potential.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After hearing a friend gushing about this restaurant we all finally had a group dinner here. The place was full with only one person taking orders, bringing out food, clearing things away, and dealing with payments. Due to all the jobs he had to do alone, he was real trooper and always kept a friendly attitude. We ordered half litre of a Riesling- it was delicious. For 6 people we ordered Steamed Prince Edward Island Mussels ($9) Pizza Margherita ($12) Potato & Pancetta caramelized onions, apple & goat cheese pizza ($13) Vintage Hanger Steak, charred asparagus, lemon & tomato jam ($22) Everything was delicious but the pizzas really stood out.  I've never had pizza quite like this. They were thin crusted and I was hesitant because I tend to not like thin crusted pizza but these were amazing. They were a step above everything else (even though the steak was absolutely yummy and cooked to a perfect medium rare). And now ...dessert. The group of 6 ordered 3 baby jesus cakes to share. OMMMG. It looked heavy but the cake itself was not too sweet and actually not heavy at all. The freshly whipped cream on the side and the delicious sauce it came with...*drools*. Definitely coming back here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Madeleine's Thoughts This is a great place to venture to after a late night in the big city. I arrived here around 1-2am with a group of 6 people. We waited 10 minutes and were seated and immediately given waters, menus, and asked for drink orders. We decided to order several appetizers, including mac and cheese spring rolls, cornmeal calamari, seared yellowfin tuna, and the warm spinach and artichoke dip. All of them were fantastic and were promptly devoured upon arrival. My personal favorite was the seared yellowfin tuna, it was cooked perfectly and there was a generous portion of avocado to eat with it. nom nom nom. I just wish we had gotten to order dessert: the selections looks so very very tasty. The only thing that would make this place better was if it were magically cheaper. Overall: great music playing throughout dinner, great food, the service was awesome (our waiter was super attentive and the food came out within 12 minutes of our order), and I will definitely return if I ever venture back to NYC!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Dos Toros used to be my go-to for tacos. For several months after they opened they were consistently amazing. Then it started to go downhill. I continued to go long after I should have given up on them, still hoping that I might get one of those delicious tacos with the perfectly cooked meat and bright fresh guac on a warm toasty tortilla. But the size of the tacos seemed to shrink with each visit, and the flavor and texture of the meat was just not the same. By the time picked out all of the burnt, off tasting, gristle-y pieces I was just left with a smear of guac on a tortilla that I was paying way too much for. I hope I can find another taco joint that's as great as Dos Toros used to be.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This restaurant is in a weird outdoor garage-like space.  The food was excellent.  The ambiance....  I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy sitting in a garage parking lot, where it's cold and noisy.  It does feel very 'west village' so if this is your scene, you will love it.  Either way, worth checking out.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So I lived in NYC briefly and I've visited many times since then. With the thousands of eateries around, I try not to head back to the same restaurants. I try to find something new. And this time I found something awesome and new! Bea has been open for less than a year at this point. The ambiance alone should draw one in. There is a large central bar, booth and table top seating, exposed brick, dim lights, old films playing on the wall of the restaurant. It's cozy even though it's not a tiny restaurant. We made a reservation since we were a party of 6 but being that we arrived for an early dinner at about 6PM (very early for NY standards) we had no problems. It was a convenient and short walk from the New Amsterdam Theatre where we'd just seen ALADDIN. Our server was a delightful guy who gave us just the right amount of attention and gave us advice on what and how much to order. I happen to love little bites of food. You can sample so many signature flavors of a restaurant that way. Bea created the menu around that concept and yet it's not simply tapas. There are some main dishes that are large enough to satisfy an appetite. We ordered the Pork Dumplings and Spicy Meatballs for the table. Both were absolutely yummy. Great flavor in both and highly recommended. I ordered the Chilean sea bass, as did 2 of my friends. It was a sea bass filet served on a bed of buttered corn, brussel sprouts, red onions, and micro cilantro. I have never tasted anything like it and it was amazeballs. Ate up every bite on that plate. Aside from the incredible food, they are known for outstanding drinks. One at our table ordered a prosecco and another ordered a Paper Fox which consists of whiskey, maraschino liqueur, lime juice, and a homemade ginger syrup. It must have been really good because she enjoyed 3 of them! Needless to say, I'm thrilled to have found another incredible restaurant and a great space to spend time with friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow, so delicious!  I could probably end the review at that...but I'll continue :) Nothing makes me happier than melted cheese, and Il Bambino so a panini menu is right up my alley.  There are tons of options of paninis and crostinis to choose from.  Some are classics and some interesting combinations of flavors.  I had the prosciutto, gorgonzola and fig spread, do wonderful!  My boyfriend had the Pass The Hash, also delicious!  We also split the Tomato fresca, rosemary ricotta, black olive oil Crostini and it was heaven! I did not try the Nutella Hot Chocolate that everyone is raving about, and I'm kicking myself.  But I know I'll be back, so definitely next time!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"All I can say is Corn, Corn and more Corn. It's the best grilled corn I have ever had. I am not sure what the seasonings consist of but I know there is cheese and lime. I had dreams of that corn for many nights after I had eaten there. I also recommend the Cuban Sandwhich and the Mango Margarita. The place is small, very small. I could literally reach into the plate of the person next to me without barely stretching out my arm. However, the food makes up for the lack of space. The place was packed but fortunately since my party was just my best friend and myself we were seated right away. I will always make a point to go to Cafe Habana anytime I am in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Food is ok. Place is WAY too small for the volume of business. Why 1 star? Since there is no room to sit inside we sat right outside on their bench. As we are eating we noticed that the workers are constantly bringing food from the basement next door - constantly. Not 1 minute passes and a big RAT comes out of that same basement that all the food came out ### now how would you feel While you are eating your falafel that practicaly 70% was made in this rat's home? Taim's owner - you make enough money (All CASH) to afford a bigger place where you would have enough space to make our food without sharing the space and ingredients with RATS. That stinks!!!!!!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"The corned beef sandwich is amazing. Mostly I feel compelled to correct some of the other reviewers 1) David's Brisket is VERY CONVENIENT TO REACH BY SUBWAY. It's less than 2 blocks from the A (express) train at the Nostrand stop in Brooklyn. 2) Why do people keep saying that the neighborhood is shady? They must not be from the neighborhood or are struggling with a little bit of racism... I've lived 4 blocks from D's Brisket for about 12 years, love the neighborhood and have never experienced any kind of problem.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went here for a lovely Easter brunch with my favorite girls.  I couldn't forget the glory that was their banana French Toast from my previous visit, so convinced the group to order one for the table - Everyone was thankful for this - even the gal who doesn't enjoy bananas!   After not being so impressed with their Eggs Benedict last time, I ventured out to their baked eggs AND artichoke dish (don't worry - one of the gals and I split these dishes).  They were both INCREDIBLE.  The artichoke dish was fresh and wonderful - but I should warn you - it wouldn't be enough for a meal.  The baked eggs on the other hand is really dense!   Also highly worth noting is the EXCELLENT service - super friendly and told us to take our time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food on offer here is similar to what you'd expect from a Vietnamese Banh Mi, tasty meats and fresh salads inside a crusty piece of bread. The queue was long but fast moving, a good indicator that you're somewhere people come back to for more! I had the coleslaw on the side which is a good idea if you've got a bigger appetite as the sandwiches are fairly small and by themselves probably wouldn't be sufficient.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE Feast!!! As much as I want to keep this place a hidden gem, I want the restaurant to stay around! I contacted feast about 1.5 months before to reserve a space for a party. They easily accommodated our party of 20 at 8:30 for a Friday night - even after the times and number of people kept changing. The hostesses, management, and chefs were wonderful. They emailed me a proposed Chef's menu to suit some pickier and allergic attendees. They were very receptive to my changes and questions (yes, they even offered to have 20 different bills if it would be easiest to pay at the end). And the menu was unbelievable. The ambiance was great when we walked in. The room was crowded but not too loud. Our group was escorted downstairs where we had our own space (and restroom). Always a plus! With a group of people, there are bound to be dishes some may not like as much as others. At feast, the tastings are served family style (in waves) which is perfect for sharing and eating what you want without feeling like you missed a course or are overpaying for a meal you can't eat completely. Service night-of the party was unsurprisingly perfect. Each dish was described, multiple wine glasses provided, and no crumb was left behind! As for the dishes itself, here is the rundown: Beets with burrata: awesome! Love the endive boats. Oyster escabeche: gorgeous presentation, perfect amount of acid - making for a great bite. Charcuterie: nothing was left! The meats, pâté, hogs head cheese, pickles! Even the mustard was divine. Bacon and egg: awesome. The pork belly and quail egg were perfectly cooked. And the grits were delish! Pork Milanese: perfectly cooked and the blackberry sauce was perfectly tart without being overbearing. Scallop with citrus: the presentation was beautiful! And each one was cooked to perfection. Mushroom agnolotti: love the truffle foam and mushroom taste! As a mushroom lover, this was possibly my favorite (although I can't really decide). But the mushroom flavor is definitely strong. Summer succotash with grit cakes: when this came out, the entire table thought it was the scallops. The grit cakes had that gorgeous sear and tasted even better than it looked. The corn and poblanos was also amazing!! Mascarpone ice cream sundaes with homemade toffee: great presentation and loved being able to personalize the toppings. The caramel sauce was a hit! It was a perfect amount of food for the perfect price. As for the booze, despite no liquor license, the wines were the way to go. Very affordable and a good variety The duck pond pinot Gris and the Malbec were great. Great beer list too! And the cucumber lemonade was so refreshing! For the amount of food, wine, espresso, and private space, we each paid $112 a person after a 20% tip. More than reasonable! I would have paid 2-3x that given my experience! Will definitely be back seasonally to see the varying menus! Thank you Feast for a memorable night that couldn't have been any better!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow what a great experience!!! Came in this weekend for the first time with my gf, we liked it so much we went back last night We were greeted outside by the host Rob, he took the time to explain to us the menu which was posted outside, he then walked us in to show us the inside and were wowed by the beauty of the restaurant, he told us the wait was about 20 min and than brought us wine outside as we waited for a table, thanks Bud i had a great feeling about the place from there on ..we sat in a beautiful booth and had Arnold as are waiter, he was a really nice guy too and took care of us.....We had the Meatballs and Calamari for apps...hit the spot....the pizza was also amazing ,so thin and crisp..i love the coal taste Came in again last night and had another wonder evening saw Rob again who i found out was also the manager which explains why he was so caring towards us , had another glass of wine outside while i waited...waiting never felt so good as me and my girl sipped wine on the corner of 99th on a beautiful brooklyn night, got a booth again and had another great waiter sorry i could remember your name bud...food was great again had baked clams and the eggplant parm and it knocked socks off I could seriously eat here every night i will def be back this weekend.

With only 8 or so tables, reasonable prices and really exceptionally crafted yet uncomplicated food, the problem is trying to find a time when you can find a table.

"This was my second visit, the first having been many years ago when it first opened.  Let me state that my 2 star review is not a reflection on the quality of the food (still wonderful) or the service (excellent).  First, the wait in the outdoor space.  I was very excited to share the salumi and cheeses, and a rosato, with my 3 guests, but was immediately disturbed by cigarette smoke, plus cigar, CIGA,!!, smoke.  I know it is legal and all but get real. Why should the suicidal desires of the obnoxious few get to infringe on my experience?  Now on to the interior, where the music was playing so loud that it was virtually impossible to have a conversation with my friends.  At one point it was so loud that the speakers were distorting.  I am not one to complain normally, as I was weaned on rock and roll, but I save my ears for the concert hall and prefer to enjoy my dinners in relative peace.  Unless these issues are addressed I would never return to what is otherwise a terrific eating spot.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Gramercy Tavern is an NYC classic. With the beautiful setting and perfectly executed dishes, it's a must try for a special night out.  You have two options - sitting at the bar and eating a la carte off of the Tavern menu, or dining on the chef's tasting menu.  We were able to walk right in and sit at the bar within 5 minutes.  The Tavern menu has great options - we had the oysters, duck liver mousse, pork and fennel sausage and the chicken.  For dessert we tried the strawberry pie with mint ice cream. Every dish was outstanding, so don't think by sitting at the bar you are getting shafted in the least.  They also have great specialty cocktails and super friendly bartenders.  So if you're looking to take your date out to some place really special, and are willing to shell out some extra cash, Gramercy Tavern should be at the top of your list. @datenitenyc","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I can see how people think this place is overrated.  I live close by and only have been here on a couple of occasions and got take out once.  The takeout was my best experience.   The chicken is fine.  On my last visit , my side of mac and cheese was cold as was the biscuit.  The chicken was hot.  The chicken breast piece seems like they cut it in half or else they are killing very tiny chickens.  Over all probably not going to go back, I wouldn't have gone back the last time but my friends who don't live in williamsburg wanted to try it.  I will say that as most people have said the service is always very friendly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I like the place for finding products. But as far as customer service... On 12/27/12 I received a package that was sent to me via UPS air (NJ to Brooklyn) ""next day"" on 21/12 (guaranteed to arrive for Christmas). As soon as I received it I called to ask if the (very expensive) shipping could be reimbursed and a few items returned (they were meant to be eaten on Christmas). The lady on the phone assured it would be reimbursed directly and I would receive a label in the mail or via email to ship the unwanted items via UPS back to NJ. By 31/12 I had received nothing. I called customer service and left a message, to please call me back. Nothing. I called back on 1/2/13 and I was told she had indeed sent me an email with the label, but I had ""probably not seen it, or didn't check my spam"". I asked her if she could resend it while I was online. I again did not get it. I finally re-spelled my email address (which is spelled as my last name, which, as I pointed out at least 5 times in order to make sure she'd get it right, was also on the original package order) and she forwarded me the original email. This time I got it. In rereading it, I notice she had in fact, misspelled it. I then sent an email to that wrong address she had made-up, and it immediately bounced back. I called back the lady, saying that it had been her mistake, and she could have easily checked back with me when she saw the email bounce. But she said it never bounced back. How about my follow-up phonecall then? Did they also not receive that on Monday? She finally said ""Well we all got it now! Everything is fine!"". Yes, after 12 days of aggravation and money, it is! And not because you put any care in it! People get so frustrated and irritated by this kind of behavior that they have to wonder... Why pay so much money for the aggravation of not getting the stuff on time, not being treated like a decent customer and being dismissed... when the mistake is on their part again and again. Is this excellence? Is it a strategy to discourage people from returning stuff they didn't send on time? Oh, the UPS part was never taken care of also...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sometimes I find myself at work... Almost drooling... Thinking about that spicy beef bowl from Kobeyaki! it's not the typical beef bowl you expect... (typical to me = thinly sliced beef, sticky Japanese rice, oily goodness... ) First thing, it's actually nice chunks of beef, mixed veggies (even some edamame beans for a nice change) sautéed together in a great spicy ( but not TOO spicy) sauce. It's the perfect size and just makes my tummy smile. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood, I've gotten bored of Chipolte's burrito bowl and this is such a nice change!! I also tried the spicy tuna burger... Tasty change of pace also! It's a tuna patty with trimmings with some wasabi mayo for kick! I had it with the sweet potato fries... Me and my sweet potato again!

"Hudson Clearwater is the speakeasy of restaurants.  Well knowing that it was hard to find, I was completely baffled by the other 2 doors in which I thought were the entrance.  It wasn't until a passerby in the neighborhood who guided us to the actual entrance.

Greeted by a small gardened yard and attractive wait staff, how can you not like this place?  What is it about hidden places that pique the new yorker's interest?  Trying to avoid my all time go to meat - duck, I ordered the hanger steak.  As Dan T notes, it was quite a generous cut and executed very well.  However, I would have preferred it if my boyfriend's duck breast was on my plate instead -- I can't help it, I love duck.   The olive oil cake was a bit odd for dessert, and personally thought they should have made an olive oil ice cream to pair with it.

"This place is a great find !   The beef empanada was so good...really seasoned nicely.  Also had yucca fries which were fantastic...sauted with garlic.  Both came with a green sauce ( maybe tomatillos ?) that was to die for !  Got a side of kale salad because I had never tasted kale before and loved it....came with avocado and had a nice light olive oil and slightly garlicy dressing.....my new favorite salad ! Went with a group so we got several desserts and shared...one better than the other !!!  ....Key lime pie was nice and light and fresh, a strawberry scooter pie ( really unique) and a warm chocolate cake with whipped cream, and of course they had flan.  All were super !   I asked and was told that all desserts are made on the premises.  Not surprised....everything tasted so fresh.  The place has a lot of nice touches like that...cosy, clean and friendly, and very affordable.  Took the N.Y. waterways ferry over for $4.00 which drops you off 2 blocks away from the restaurant...made for a really nice evening !   Highly recommend it !","[0.0, 1.0]"

"a hip cozy corner pizza/italian spot worth the trip if you live nearby.

There is a room in front where the pizza oven is and also a larger room in the back, we sat in the back at a small 2 top table.  The decor is a mix match of furniture and home stuffs and it all fits in well.  Very nice.

It went really well with the sauce that they drizzled on as well. The mac n cheese was also super delicous, chunks of lobster were generously incorporated into the pasta and the cheese was so thick and creamy. The gumbo had a lighter broth than I am use to, but it was still very flavorful. The ambiance was pretty laid back, pefect for a get together with friends or a date.

The bartender Paul gave us good service. $70 w/tip included was OK, but it would've been better to have gotten more food. I think the drafts were $8ea.

Their beer and wine selection was excellent and the cheese and meat plates were phenomenal. Not to mention the raw beauty of the space. FIve stars for everything, but especially the customer service.

"Westville is a really popular brunch spot and rightfully so. It's healthy, filling, and affordable, perfect for all the vegetarian/vegan/GF/low-carb/paleo folks. I personally just love simple, healthy fare and get bored of brunch offerings you find at most restaurants. If you're not in the mood for YET another eggs Benedict or pancakes then go to Westville. I came here with a friend who was visiting and we shared the breakfast burrito with potato hash on the side and a vegetable plate. I LOVE their vegetable plate. $15 gets you 4 generous sides and they're all amazing and healthy. I went with their brussels sprouts, oyster mushrooms, quinoa with butternut squash, and seared tofu. Even ended up taking some of it for leftovers and it was just as delicious the next day. Normally I would say that you can easily roast up some veggies at home for half the price, but honestly, they're done SO well. The breakfast burrito was bomb as well. Service was fast and friendly. They got our food out in less than 10 minutes despite being really busy, so +1 for that! Completely unrelated side note: I saw Shoshana from 'Girls' here! She dyed her hair platinum blonde but a quick Google search confirmed that it was, indeed, her.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I do not understand. My friend has telled me about this place so we go one day, all of us. Now I understand that in Ukraine we do not have pizza's but I eat many a pizza since moving to Brooklyn and this one was nothing special. We all stand in line for hour or two, suffering in cold as smelling come from all over us. I must admit, it was good smelling. I was excited almost  to the point of sexual. Finally we get to front of line and we make order for a whole pizza. Waiting a while, we finally get pizza. Our mouth's watering with delight, we each take a slice. Was like eating Totino's Pizza Roll. I was unimpressed by this Pizza. Cheese was like goat's cheese that turn sour and red meat on tops was spicy and greasey. How dare they sell such things for human consumption. I will only buy again as laxative, for this...it does job well.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We have visited Palma twice so far. We originally stumbled upon this quaint gem while roaming the street with hungry stomachs. On a Tuesday around 8:00pm the wait for two was about 45 minutes but we found a seat at the end of the bar, chatted with a couple locals and sipped a Lemon Bail Martini (Fantastic) and Rosemary Rye (good as well). Before we knew it we were shown to our seats in the garden area. The ambiance of the garden is exceptional. We were seated in a quiet corner, above is a glass celling open for a cool breeze feeling surrounded by the perfect ambiance of florals and soft light by candlelight. It is truly romantic. Our service was also wonderful, he carefully explained the technique and products used to create the dishes, homemade pasta, fresh ingredients, etc. We ordered the calamari (delicious), the special of the night, which was spinach infused linguini with tiger shrimp, fantasy eggplant, garlic and grape tomatoes in a white wine sauce (a little too spicy for my taste but my boyfriend loved it!). We ended our culinary experience with Cappuccino and the Italian Cheesecake (out of this world!). Palma is a great place to unwind, enjoy unique food, along with a great conversation.

"I arrived with my wife one summer afternoon. The place was packed. We did not have reservations and the hostess said it would be about an hour wait, so we left and had a drink at another bar. We came back to see if space was available at the bar and it was still full, but the hostess remembered us and said wait here a few minutes because she knew people were about to leave the bar. So we did and it was worth the wait.   We were then greeted by the Bartender who was very nice and knowledgable. He made some great recommendations for us for drinks and appetizers. We like the open kitchen aspect and the fact that the head chef was on top of things. We had a sampler  platter of oysters recommended by the bartender which was spot-on. My wife ordered the smoked salmon which she very much enjoyed,and she's a tough critic when it comes to seafood. I had the scallops which were also very good and the crab cake which was ok. Over all I was very satisfied with our experience here and will definitly be returning.","[0.0, 1.0]"

This place was awesome, good drinks, good food and really super nice staff. I am always the first one to arrive and my friends were about 30 min late. The Host/esses were all very nice and understanding about my  friends being late. I sat at the bar and had the Morini brand beer and waited for my friends while watching reality TV in real time - this place had  a buzz and was exciting. My friends arrived and we were taken to a table shortly after speaking with the Host. Our waitress was very nice  and offered some suggestions. This is not your typical Italian food - it's better. I have to say everything was good. The staff was really welcoming and attentive, and we even got goodbyes and thank you from the staff as we were leaving  and walking out the door.

"I was on my way to lunch (I had planned on grabbing a boring ole' turkey sandwich from a nearby deli) when a Hummus & Pita Co. employee, standing outside the store, offered me a sample of one full falafel and a piece of pita bread dipped in a small plastic bowl of hummus. I don't usually like beans or fried food (essentially these are the two adjectives to describe falafel), but that one bite was enough to lure me into the store. I ordered the Falafel in a plain pita with Israeli Cous Cous. The falafel tasted like it just came fresh out of the fryer. Perfectly crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. The free hummus that is included with every meal was so creamy and flavorful. The Israeli cous cous added nice texture to the dish. I just wished the pita was slightly toasted because it tasted stale. Next time I will forego the bread and choose either the bowl (come with 2 fill its) or the platter (3 fill its).","[1.0, 0.0]"
This place is amazing and one of my favorite lunch places. There is a reason the line is always so long during peak times. I think of this place as a cross between halal cart food and greek. The white sauce isnt your typical Halal sauce. Its actually greek tzatziki which is cucumber yogurt sauce. They have decent sized portions and the Gyro is amazing. The combo platter is my favorite covered in white. The guys who work it are really nice. Try is out for some great great food. But if you want your typical Halal food hike over to 53rd and 6th.

"I really wanted to like this place as a local, but it just fell short at every turn.  The food is beautiful, but lacks any oomph.   Interesting concept, farm fresh ingredients but nothing was outstanding, and at this price point, that's a killer.  The lamb carpaccio was overwhelmed by the vegetables.  The rabbit leg with honey mustard could just as easily have been chicken.  The stuffed cabbage, fell flat.  The sea bass was quite good and the mackerel was nice.   The wait service was great, friendly and responsive.   But we had massive communication issues with the front desk, where they promised 30-45 minute wait and over an hour and a half later they said it would be 30 minutes more and then sat us 10 minutes after that.   The decor is nice.  Classy, filament light bulbs, quaint americana on the walls amalgamated in an overall rustic americana.   It's new and we may try it again in 4 months if they can get their footing on the food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Petite Crevette is a mighty restaurant for its size.  I've eaten there three times and each visit was perfect.  The best experience I had, though, was right before I moved out of the neighborhood (sad to leave places like this). I was going home from work, kind of late in the middle of the week, and I had a craving for this restaurant.  So I walk in and the owner (can't remember his name....) tells me I have to get the tuna burger.  So I oblige.  We talk as he chops up the tuna, forms it into an enormous patty, and starts to grill it.  The kitchen is arm's length from the tables.  He then asks me if I'm thirsty and before I answer he tells the waiter to pour me a nice big glass of red wine (the place is BYOB, so I guess that was his personal stock).  I drink my wine, watch the burger cook, and before long he packs it up with some fries and I'm on my way. Wow, what a meal that tuna burger was.  Out of this world. grilled on the outside, rare inside, wasabi mayo on top.  It was just perfect.  Add to that the good time I had waiting....  I miss that little joint.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We split the braised artichoke salad for an appetizer--it would make a great lunch or brunch entree--and for the main course I had the trout with dandelion greens while he had the pulled pork (sans brioche). I also had prosecco and the chocolate truffles for dessert. Everything was very good. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the soundtrack was some mellow blues. We spent about $75 all included.

"When I first moved to NYC as a young-un, this was where my ex-boyfriend and I decided to have our first dinner after a long day of apartment hunting. I was kind of thrown back by the hustle and bustle of the place. The service wasn't what I was used to back home in MN or during college in MA. I felt like running out of the place when we were seated at the same round table among strangers who were minding their own dinners. (Don't come here if you don't want to sit across or next to a stranger or if you want a more intimate setting) Dinner wasn't stellar. Again, I had high expectations coming from the midwest were I feel service is just better and helps defne the experience of eating out (otherwise you could just stay home, right?). The food itself wasn't great either. It was just bland. Even the famous dumplings did not sit well on my palate; it was runny, porky, and fatty. Bleh.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What a great experience! I've been hearing a lot about Nook but never made it before. I'll definitely be back. We came for brunch on a Saturday. It was crowded but they did a good job of managing the tables. It's amazing that one waiter can handle the whole restaurant, and the kitchen smoothly kept the food coming. Speaking of the food, there were three of us so we got to try a few things: The pierogies - we got a mix of potato/cheese and mushroom/sauerkraut. We also opted for the bacon, which made it perfect comfort food. Egg scrambles- there are a variety to choose from, so it was hard to pick. But the eggs were so good and came with a side of potatoes that were really good. Eggs benedict with salmon - really delicious I'm definitely going to make an effort to come back to try the dinner.

Drinks -  Perfect drinks with a touch of class.  Love the metal/steel straws that come with every drink 3. Service - Even though it was a large party, services were just on the mark.  From the host of the establishment taking out coats, to the servers who were patient, and ensuring that everyone was attended to, and following up to ensure that they had everything they needed. 4. Decor -  I have been to many many indian places but this one just exudes class and you can see how well thought out the everything was.  This is a place I can hang out with friends and family and just relax to good drinks and foof...or have a formal client meeting as well. 5. Attention to detail - Just what it says....embedded into everything that they do. In short, hands down one of the best indian restaurants I have been to!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Very cozy upscale Mexican restaurant in the West Village. We spent our time at the bar noshing on chips and pretty good gauc (not sure if they make it table-side here, but that would be a plus) and sipping on some seriously tasty margs. The bar tender was friendly, but a little MIA as the place became packed. The quesadilla is better than most, and we also tried a delicious shrimp dish from the appetizer menu-- though I wish it offered some tortillas or crusty bread for dipping instead of wheat toast. Portions for each were on the smaller side. For a date, I like this better than Dos Caminos or some of the other big Mexican eateries because Ofrenda offers a much more intimate atmosphere. As the night wore on and we continued drinking, the bartender even gave us a free round and a spicy tequila shot, which was a treat! If the prices were a bit lower this would be 4 stars in my book.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I don't know how many places I've been too that skimp on this. I had the lamb hash which was a special that morning. The meat was juicy and tender and was served with 2 over-medium eggs.

"I gotta say this is probably the best ramen I've ever had.  Is it worth the extra dollars charged here?  That's probably for you and your budget to decide.  Definitely come here during lunch since you can get a lunch set for an extra $3.  A lunch set will get you salad with some yummy wasabi soy-like dressing and a giant bowl of rice topped with your choice of spicy fried chicken (not spicy at all), spicy cod roe (yummy), or roast pork.  The akamaru modern is probably the most popular dish here with original tonkotsu soup noodle and some very fatty and delicious Berkshire pork slices.  I had the karaka men which is very similar to the akamaru modern but with a spicy broth.  The broths are very rich.  You can't ever go wrong with edamame as an appetizer.  The yuzu salt was a nice twist on a dish.  Come a bit after the usual lunch crowd and don't be discouraged by the wait.  We were given an estimate of an hour for three people, but it actually took about 35 minutes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"How can someone go wrong with a restaurant that serves so many different kinds of potatoes?!  I loved the COMATOSER better than the CURLY SUE.   I felt that that texture of the skin chips was so unique and awesome.  The inside of the ""chip"" tasted like a mashed potato and the outside tasted like a potato oven-roasted chip.  I really want to learn how to achieve that texture with my potatoes at home!  (If you know the secret...please share!!!!!)  I loved the delicious veggies, scallion, red onion, broccoli.  Oh my, the sauce was even more delicious -- I literally wanted to lick the whole bowl.  The bacon was so savory too.  THE CHEESE. THE CHEESE. Dang those cheese combos caressed my taste buds in a velvety dance! The Curly Sue I felt that you can just have this texture in regular fries, but I did loved the combination of flavors -- the chipotle ketchup seriously how can you go wrong?  I don't think I ever had fries with scallions.  Level up from regular fast food fries!  However, I just wish there was more of it...and to it.  I could easily make this one -- now that they listed all the ingredients! Okay, Pinky of course you're giving such a high score for a potato restaurant, but why the half point off? Honestly, the prices were pretty steep.  I get it that it's in Manhattan but this was more like a snack than dinner.  Don't assume you'll be full after this ""meal""!   It's a horrible habit to develop, but if it was cheaper I would come every single day. (I'm a poor recent graduate!!) And get fat, of course.  There is so much cheese in the signature meals!!!!  These sig meals would be cheaper than the ""build your own potato"" meals.

"They definitely have this thing down to a science.  Service was just fine, despite some canned conversations and stereotypical ""hey, you're here with a girl/friend/girlfriend/group/whatever so here are some pertinent one-liners"".  They've nailed the Italian kitsch, in fact it feels a bit like a museum in here.  Just good marketing, maybe, but you can't blame a super-popular place like this for trying to keep their brand consistent.  What am I even talking about?  Let's get to pizza. Fresh mozz is important, crust thickness and all that is way too subjective, so what's left really: the sauce.  Sweet, tangy, savory, not overpowering.  Maybe they got lucky or maybe someone a long time ago had a really sensitive palette.  Either way, Lombardi's has got the sauce:other ratio down pat.  This isn't the most original recipe, or creative, or challenging, or... cheap... but definitely satisfying.  It's pizza, whatever, just eat it.

"Wowsers.  Tell me how you can make money charging $4 for a modelo especial and an extra $1 for a shot of pretty good Venezualan aniejo Rum (sippable too).  Anyhoo.  Plantain chips and Guac totally hit the spot whist the Rums slid down, and the most fantastic Arepa (my first) arrived in time to save myself from embarrassment.  I had the ""Surena"" arepa - which was described as coming with an ""Enigmatic Chimmi Churri sauce"".  If ""Enigmatic"" is Venezuelan for ""Garlic-y as hell"" then they got it spot on. I'll be going back, cos the Arepa menu selection sounds really good, and the drinks are...well....free.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is amazing! I loved the food, the decor, the atmosphere and casual service. We were celebrating a birthday party and we all had a such a good time. I am guy from Balkan region and I can  tell that food is outstanding  and authentic. You should definitely try Rakia, the most famous drink at Balkan (my favorite is apricot).

"If you do come here, have an open mind. Sure its cheap food but know that it won't be the most pleasant adventure. If you're smart, find someone to order the food for you. Pros: - Really Cheap Food - Compared to restaurants similar to it, there is a lot of seating here - Large drink selection - You get to see those huge sesame pancakes being made in person Cons: - If it's your first time, ordering isn't going to be pleasant. You walk all the way to the end of the store, find the grouchy lady that takes your order and then get pushed by other patrons because like the people that work here, everyones grouchy because it's hot, tight, and sticky everywhere. - It's seriously dirty. I kind of lost my appetite because everything was sticky and greasy. - Really bad service. Even for a Chinese joint. You'll get your money snatched, scowls, ignored, and even yelled at. I understand the style of the business is turning over customers as quick as possible to compensate for the low prices but their rudeness was just unnecessary. But honestly, the service is so bad, my friend and I couldn't help but laugh it off at the end.   - The dumplings were surprisingly just ... okay. I was expecting them to be really good because of all the hype and the huge line but they were good at best. Nothing special and nothing worth walking 30 minutes for. Seriously, don't walk 30 minutes to go here, even if you're only spending $6 on dinner. - Bad dumpling sauce. It just soy and vinegar and the sriracha looked so gross. - And seriously, why does Chinatown smell so ... bad? Especially on this street. Not trying to be rude but the stench is almost unbearable especially when its warmer. Conclusion: Lots of cons. Was it worth going? I think so but only if you have an open mind. If you're in the area and you want to do something ridiculous, I say why not? It's so bad, it was almost fun laughing everything off and escaping the smells of Chinatown. But if you're coming all the way from Jersey like I am, you might want to rethink it or at least prepare yourself.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wahlau! Good food here la! So is an ang moh (westerner) really qualified to review Nyonya? Probably not, but I will anyways. My girlfriend is Singaporean and so are a lot of her friends so I have been here a decent number of times. The decor and atmosphere are pretty decent. It seems to have kind of a bamboo theme, so you kind of feel you are in the forest. It works though. As in most asian restaurants, the service is fast and efficient. You order will be taken quickly, served soon, and they will bring the bill just as you finish. It's good though, no pressure. The food is good, even to a silly ang moh. If you are an ang moh yourself, I recommend the roti prata, which is kind of like a flat bread. If you aren't an ang moh, you know a lot better than I do what to get. Ok, I won't say any more.

"The food at this place was great! I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was so tasty and creamy! The bread was delicious as well as the chickpeas drenched in olive oil that went with the bread. Wine was also very good. Then why only 2 stars?? The customer service was terrible!  A friend of mine decided to have dinner there to celebrate her 30th birthday.  When she made the reservation for 7:00 p.m., she told them that one of her guests (me) would be running about a half hour late.  They said that would be fine but that I needed to be there at 7:30 on the nose.  Of course I wasn't but the rest of the party was there at 7:00 and were seated.  When I got off the train at 7:50 my phone rang.  It was my friend wanting to know where I was because they had to put in an order.  I told her that I was right around the corner but to go ahead and order without me.  I would put mine in as soon as I got there.  She said the waittress needed the whole party had to be seated to place the order.  SINCE WHEN?! I've heard of waiting for a whole party to be present to be seated but not to order.  Once I got there and was settled in, I quickly scanned the menu but not without the waittress hovering over me and placed my order.  After that she ignored us for most of the time we were there.  Considering how she was sweating my friend about me not being there you would think she wold have been more attentive.  Then after a delicious meal, a cake was brought out and we sang happy birthday.   Shortly after that we got the check.  After we figured out how much each of us owed we handed it back to the waitress.  The money in the billfold wasn't even cold before the maitre'd was asking us to vacate the table! We had just spent over $400 on dinner and they couldn't let us chill for a minute?! That was some bullshit!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was excited to go there because i kept reading reviews about how they have the 'best burger in nyc', but i'm sorry to say - i was disappointed. I really liked the fact that it's a dive bar with cheap beers, but the burger wasn't even close to being the best i've had (and it was over cooked too!) .  The quality of the meat is just ok - nothing special at all - same with the bun, cheese and fries.  They are cheap, but i would have gladly paid an extra couple of bucks to get the 'best burger in nyc'.

"What the hell happened. I would praise this spot. Tell people/strangers to get their burrito fix from this lil spot. The last two visits have been a huge disappointment and I wont be giving them my business any longer. The scenario was really simple, my chili con carne burrito was not hot (temp) as it has been in the past. When asked to bring it up to temp of my liking the rolled their eyes and grunted and heated it so hot I had to wait 20 minutes to bite into it. So today I decided to have the same thing, again the temp was not hot. I asked If temp standard had been changed and he said the temp today is what it has always been. So I asked them to just pack it up so I could got home and heat the sucker up. Service has never been their strong point, but the food always made up to the lack of people skills. Although I have to admit the ONE female who works the register something is more approachable. Don't know what their demeanor is about im not interested in doing research to know. I have to say their burrito size wasn't enough to feel my belly. This is my experience and you may not agree, its okay. Not good.

"buffalo wings are a food beloved by abundant people that frequent sports bars. they are an American 'classic' but in the ever changing culinary landscape of bushwick they are likely to soon become stigmatized. notwithstanding, 983 will bring them to your bed where there are possibly no TVs, aging divorcees addicted to nicotine, or young bucks in the fraternal (dis)order. when you open up that container what you will find is this -- well-cooked, slightly chewy, vaguely crisp, nicely sized lil drumlettes and wingys drenched in that buttery, frank's hot sauce melange. it may be only two ingredients, but for some unknown reason only a scant few kitchens can replicate what happened back on that fateful day in 1980s(?) in buffalo, new york at the anchor bar (also called frank and mary's?) when some football addled cook with an idea, a bag of small pieces of chicken, and a few simple ingredients made a miracle. these come highly recommended and do fine justice to the anchor legacy. you also should try the cobb salad and the cheeseburger with the onion ring placed on top (but underneath the bun).","[0.0, 1.0]"

The foods are clearly labeled in both English and Korean, the trays were all full, and everything seemed appropriately hot/cold. I've only had Korean food once before, from a truck, so I wasn't sure what I'd like and so I grabbed a little bit of anything that looked good. My container plus a soda came out to a little over $8 and I took it back to my office to enjoy. The cold bean sprouts provided a nice, light crunch. The cold snap peas with mushrooms were O.K. and so was the white rice with vegetables, and what I think may have been broccoli rabe (not bitter at all). I enjoyed the clear noodles. The garlic chicken wing had a nice sauce and crispy skin. My favorite item by far was the fried rice with beef, so the next time I come here I'll be sure to get more of that.

"Ellary's Greens has become one of my favorite restaurants: delicious, affordable, healthy and satisfying. I love the atmosphere, it's scrupulously clean, and everything about it just feels right. I follow a paleo diet but my vegetarian and vegan friends always find something good on the menu as well - with lots of options for their diets as well as mine. My favorite is the crispy roast chicken - always juicy and tender. Though I want to try new things every time I go, it's difficult to skip the Kabocha/Butternut Squash salad with Enoki Mushrooms & Pumpkin Seeds. My experiences have all been excellent here and this owner Leith Hill did something really wonderful: I came into the restaurant on a warm day when the doors and windows were open to let in the afternoon sun. The restaurant felt warmer than usual and I was fanning myself to cool down, not expecting anyone to notice. Leith came to the table, asked me if I was warm and said that she would turn the air on. I didn't even ask! She just offered. That's super nice. I was also, finally, able to tell her how much I love the food. (Thank you, Leith!) I've read complaints about the chairs, (they're not the most comfortable) as well as about the single restroom, but these are minor complaints at a restaurant this good.

"Being a HUGE fan of Austin, Texas's Tex-Mex scene and having had real Mexican food in its homeland, I am super excited this place has opened. This place is a true rarity on the east coast. From the small details of ""Worm salt"" with their oysters, to having real edible cactus on the menu!!!!! After my entree, which was the ""La Rosa"", I was so blown away by how they handled their fish that I had to order their ""La Mano"" scallops immediately after. Everything is so fresh and well prepared. The staff and service are extremely chill and relaxed, but very attentive. The atmosphere is definitely an eat and enjoy attitude instead of eat and hurry up one. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu. ""To all fans of Guero's in Austin, Texas this place will be a no fail for you"".","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Saturday night around 8 pm was pretty crowded - not sure how long the wait would have been if we didn't have a reservation. I love the concept of this place. Super fresh, modern, clean Thai food using good quality veggies and meats. They are also very cool about substituting and modifying and accommodate food preferences/allergies better than most places. Nice ambiance, young crowd. Menu isn't expensive like some other Thai places and the majority of dishes here are noodle based instead of rice (other than fried rices). Pad Kee Mao: This is a hit! You can choose from three types of noodles (we got ""mah mah,"" which is around the size of a soba noodle), although I'm told the flat rice noodles are the most authentic. This dish is spicy, flavorful, and not as oily as noodles dishes general are. I would definitely get it again and I highly recommend it. It won't disappoint. Zucchini Pad Thai: I had read about the zucchini pad thai and thought it was a pretty awesome concept. It seemed like a good way to eat pad thai without feeling heavy, it got good reviews on here, and I happen to like spaghetti squash as pasta on occasion. I have to say it didn't turn out so well in practice. It pretty much had no flavor because the zucchini noodles were so watery that it diluted any flavor that did exist in the dish. I seriously did not taste even a hint of peanut flavor, which is normally pretty prominent (and I'm sensitive to it because I think it can be pretty overwhelming in pad thai sometimes). It is true that you feel super light and healthy eating this, but it's just a pile of thin zucchini (some long some short) and lots of bean sprouts. Would so not get this again. In both, you can choose whether to add veggies or some kind of meat. The portions are not huge, but will fill you up fine. If you're really hungry I'd say to get an appetizer as well. Our server wasn't the friendliest and didn't really have much opinion on any of the dishes we asked about. Even though one dish wasn't a success, I think that's more of an anomaly and that the pad kee mao is more reflective of the general quality. That, combined with their more innovative, fresh approach makes sure I'll come back for sure.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We came here on a weekday morning about 10am, just the two of us and were seated right away by the window. After reading many reviews of the place, I decided I had to try the banana and walnut pancakes with maple syrup - the pancakes were very yummy - so fluffy and the syrup made it nice and sweet. However, I couldn't finish it all - they served me a stack of 3 giant pancakes. My husband had the blueberry pancakes and they were very nice too. We also ordered a milk biscuit on the side, which is actually a large english scone but baked like a cookie on the outside, served with butter and jam. We saw someone have a scrambled egg breakfast which looked really nice - I wish I ordered that too! A bit expensive, at $13 for a plate of pancakes, but worth the experience. It's very small inside, so no wonder why people complain about the queues!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Lots of reviews for this place so I'll keep it short and sweet: Romantic setting, great use of space, great mood lighting, snappy design choices.  Atmosphere 5/5. Eclectic, well-rounded tapas menu with plenty of mains and sides to keep you interested.  The highlight for us was the pan-fried red snapper, the fish of the day.  Perfectly prepared and scrumptious all around.  The dessert we ordered, an interesting combination of white chocolate, olive oil, and foam fell a little flat.  4/5 for the food. 0/5 for the front staff.  Hostess was surly and rude and had a holier-than-thou attitude.  The bartender who took our cocktail orders while we waited an additional 30 minutes beyond our reservation time was equally pissy and snooty.  We were THIS close to walking out until the owner came over to our table, personally apologized for the wait, and gave us a few freebies.  Nice gesture.  I was so angry that my stomach ached throughout the entire dinner and I didn't really enjoy anything. Fire the Friday hostess and maybe we have something here. That is all.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I used to go to Yakitori Taisho in the East Village, but Yakitori Totto is definitely a step up in terms of quality and ambience. Plus, they have AC and it makes a world of a difference eating here during the summertime. There's not a whole lot of space and it's pretty intimate, therefore I highly recommend coming early to grab a table. The chefs really took their time and effort to keep your foods moist and flavorful and it's always nice to see actual Japanese people running a Japanese restaurant. My personal favorites for the night was the Eringi Bacon, Seared Tuna and the Ice Banana Dessert. Will definitely stop by in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So I have mixed views of my Perilla experience.  Wanted to come here for a longgggg while but kept hearing ""i'm disappointed"" reviews so I hesitated.  Finally a friend told me she went and had a good experience there, so I decided it was time.  (Plus I got a $20 Open Table gift certificate so Perilla seemed like a great place to use it.) First off:  Love the 3 Little Pigs dish!   Berkshire tenderloin, crispy wild boar belly & spicy hampshire pork booty pate... YES PLEASE!  I particularly LOVED the crispy wild boar belly (I'll be thinking about that one for a longggg time!).  My bf got the steak - which was mediocre...it was burnt on the ends like everyone describes.   For appetizers, we got Raw Hamachi and Duck Meatballs.  The hamachi didn't have much of a flavor and I won't be ordering it again here.  It's pretty generic raw fish and NOT worth the $14.  The duck meatballs were great but had a somewhat overwhelming herby/minty flavor.   For dessert, got some Toasted Almond Sundae.  It was decent but not mind blowing.  However, I don't usually like dessert so I'm not the right person to be making an authoritative dessert assertion. All in all, I was expecting more overall (as a big Top Chef fanatic!) but the 3 Little Pigs was to die for.  Everything else was a bit disappointing.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Good place w good environment but the fish was so bad that i couldn't even believe they served it. Also i asked for pasta to go and waiter said the chef does not take pasta to go. Whyy i asked?

"Enter Bistro in a search around Astor Place, and The Smith will be the first locale on the list. And what a nice Bistro style restaurant it is, the greatest thing though, Nouveau American Cuisine that is original, in NYC. A nice change from the redundancy of most American Restaurants. I went here with some friends/family starting with some White Rioja at the bar, which really helped build my appetite, especially seeing all the food around, from the Chicken Pot Pie with Cheddar Biscuit Top to the Ahi Tuna Salad. Even though our entire party wasn't there yet, my friend and I were seated with only two tables open and no reservation on a monday night, party of 4. Something that is rare in restaurants, we got two bottles of water, sparkling and still, nothing too fancy, but free. The bread and butter was good, although the bread was on the hard side, slightly tougher than crusty. At first glance of the menu, the appetizer that popped out at me was the Crawfish Hush Puppies with Old Bay Aioli. Until this night, I don't think that I have had Hush Puppies for 4 years, which was on a drive up from Nashville to NY. I knew I had to try these, which I did, and shared. They were great, not too greasy, fresh tasting, the Aioli had a nice sea breeze taste to it, with the lemon, sort of like a lite tartar sauce. The only thing that may have been disappointing was that there were not larger chunks of crawfish in them, they were mostly small minced pieces that you could hardly notice, but could taste enough to know they are there, and good, even if they are most likely frozen. My other friend had the Avocado Salad, he later stated that there should have been more Avocado. For my main course I couldn't really decide between the Roast Pork Sandwich with Spicy Cauliflower & Fries, the Lamb Schnitzel with Parmesan Crust or the Braised Beef Short Ribs. Then all of a sudden my fathers voice popped into my head saying, ""If you see Short Ribs on the menu, get them!"" So I did, and I must say the plate was great. Very rich in flavor from the wine sauce, but not overpowering, could be accompanied with a good red, although I decided to switch to Pilsner which wasn't bad at all. The Short Rib was cooked to perfection, you didn't need a knife and it wasn't stringy or too chewy. It tasted fresh and it had to be eaten, fat and all. The way the potatoes were prepared in the dish was very unique, they were whole potatoes, skins and all. The skins were somewhat difficult to break through, but once you did it was like you had opened up the most tender spud ever, it could just be me, but I have rarely had potatoes so perfectly done where the skins stay intact like a steam pouch. There was a nice onion which was subtly sweet and really brought out the flavor of the beef from the sauce. My friends had the Diver Scallops with Girdled Polenta and Melted Leeks, which looked and smelled amazing. Char Broiled Organic Chicken, what can I say, it was what it was, safety item. Burger Deluxe, I am going back to try it, I didn't find out what the special sauce was, and the fries looked good. A couple things that I really wanted to try, but decided to forgo were the Beer Battered String Beans and their desserts, which looked great. So for two carafes of White Rioja, two Pilsners,  two starters, and 4 entrees, the entire dinner with tip came out to around $160-170. I found this a great deal, good atmosphere, I was complemented that evening for my choice, which is thanks to Yelp, and don't really have anything negative to say. The Staff was great, at times they were in the way when you were walking to the immaculate bathroom, but i believe that is because of the slight intimate/friendly/homely atmosphere they have tried to establish, and it works, you aren't bothered. I am a definite fan of The Smith, and will be back on several occasions. A nice place for a date, but also a great place to have a meal with friends or family. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it is slightly out of the cheaper price range that I have grow accustomed to, if it were in the $130-140 range it would have made all the difference. Not a huge fan of the $20+ entree or the $8+ appetizer, especially in these times.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was majorly disappointed when I heard that Union Picnic closed, but Jimmy's Diner fills UP's shoes nicely in the southern food department. I've eaten in once and by the time my bowl of Tater Heaven came, I was too full to eat most of it because I'd been filling up on the free donuts and oh my god they just had to go and fry their deviled eggs, didn't they? Our waiter was absolutely the nicest I've ever had in Brooklyn. The place has southern hospitality to go along with their southern inspired menu, which is hard to come by in this great state of New York. I've ordered out twice and the first time I got the Cowgirl veggie burger which was out of this world and a side of  fries which were nice and crunchy and perfect. The second time I was violently hungover and ordered the cheese grits and tater heaven once again. Being a GRIT (girl raised in the south) myself, I know there is a right way and a wrong way to make grits. And Jimmy's does them up right. The tater tots in the tater heaven are very interesting, almost more like hush puppies than taters, but still delicious. For dessert,  I would definitely recommend splurging on their mocha malted milkshake because it is definitely worth the $5.","[0.0, 1.0]"

If you lack a monthly metro card, the trip will be the biggest part of the expense. Coupled with a potential language difficulty in ordering and the lack of worthwhile seating (unless you're purposefully trying to keep your in and out time under 5 minutes) it's a bit tough. The dumplings, I preferred fried, flavorful, good texture, siracha and soy helped significantly though. If I lived closer and could get take out and walk home I'd be here at least once a week to get a ton of dumplings, pair it with a couple beers and some must see tv and call it a night.

"I learned about Michael Psilakis via Food Network and was curious to try his restaurant, given that a) I love Greek food, b) I specifically love meze platters and meatballs - two items on Kefi's menu, and c) I really, really, REALLY love inexpensive, quality eats in New York - which can be hard to find. I dragged my aunt along with me to Kefi and I could see her bristle, initially, at the casual atmosphere - she's a bit of a food snob, and I could tell that as she eyed the inexpensive, simple menu, she thought it was going to suck. Happily, we both were blown away by the food. The meze platter of mixed spreads was an amazing starter, particularly the hummus and the creamy, garlicky yogurt dip. The meatballs were also wonderful, served in a tomato sauces with salty olives and roasted garlic cloves. I could have stopped there, but we ordered two mains - baby lamb chops (a special of the evening) and the Kefi mac and cheese, distinct by its use of sheep's milk cheese. The mac and cheese was good - something different - but the true standout was the lamb dish. AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, not at all gamey, and delicious. Our entire meal - with apps, mains, a side of potatoes and two glasses of wine - was less than $100. We were stuffed and happy. What more can you ask for?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I absolutely worship this place. If this were to be my last meal on earth, I would die a happy gal. It's hands down the best sushi in New York City and possibly outside of Japan. Super fresh, with a lot of variety of different fish and super authentic. There is nothing gimicky about this sushi restaurant. Mr. Yasuda's ethic is to keep it simple. No crazy rolls here or fusion foods. Just simple, beautiful fish and a few delicate appetizers. Don't dip your sushi in soy sauce if you can help it. The chefs brush them with soy and/or salt them lightly with fleur de sel so each bite is superb - a yummy, melt-in-your-mouth creaminess that is to die for! Also, don't put too much wasabi in your soy sauce! It is frowned upon because the chefs already place a small dab of wasabi on each piece, and that is more than enough. They also brew their own soy sauce here, which is what the pros do in Japan. The menu is constantly changing as well, because if Mr. Yasuda can't get the freshest fish flown over from all around the globe, then he doesn't put it on the menu. Expect to choose from at least 5 different kinds of tuna, NOT including toro (tuna belly - food from the gods!), half a dozen different types of yellowtail, and so much other fish that you probably have never heard of. Highly recommend the uni (sea urchin) here, as well as the toro scallion handrolls. I can eat 10 of them, they're so damn good. The nori here is always crisp, always fragrant, and has that perfect CRUNCH to it when you bite into it. The rice here is always perfect as well - good sushi rice is neither warm nor cold, and it is much less sticky than 90% of the restaurants make it. Learning how to master the art of cooking sushi rice takes years in Japan, and it shows at Sushi Yasuda. When making reservations, always ask to sit at the sushi bar with Mr. Yasuda (although he doesn't come in on Saturdays). LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Much better than sushi at Masa, by the way.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What a pleasant surprise! I was in the neighborhood looking for a place for brunch and found this cute cozy cafe on yelp. It has a small town diner feel with thrift store decor, which remind me of Gray Dog Coffee in Manhattan. Many details are carefully picked, but not overly stylized to be pretentious. Surprisingly young and stylish staff and clientele for the no-frill neighborhood.  I liked the vibe of the place very much. The menu is also carefully thought out. It was unique and everything sounded delicious, though most of them seemed high calories and high prices. I'm not American and so crazy about American comfort food. Finding healthy choice was a challenge. Serving Stumptown coffee is definitely a plus. I chose the the Perfect Storm - Smoked Salmon & Hash Brown, Arugula, Poached Egg, Hollandaise. It was delicious. The portion was small, but for me it was pretty close to what I was looking for. The minus 1 star is because of the small portion for the high price and they charged a full price for the 2nd cup of coffee. I wish either they told me that it wasn't a free refill or refilled at a discounted price. Even Starbucks refills for 50 cents. Otherwise it was 5 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Then when we paid, the bill came to $25 with a 20% tip already included (check your bill large parties), since no one had exact change we all put in $40 or $50 to get change back. When the waiter came back without change, he said, ""Oh, I didn't count the money."" Really?! I bet he would have come back really fast if we didn't give enough. Anyway, the $70 extra would have given him a 64% tip which he would not have deserved, and then to add to his abysmal smug ""service"", the guy took 15 minutes to give us our money back.

"After reading all the reviews I made sure that I had to visit this cart during my stay in NY. I am so glad I did. Their food is so good!! A cart that has a line must mean something and it has lived up to all of my expectations and much more. I went two times during my visit after getting out of a Broadway show. I always got the combination (chicken, beef, and lamb) over rice with the pita bread and all for $7 that is a steal. The portions is big enough to share with 2 people so thats even more of a steal! I pour on the white sauce like no other and I was pretty cautious with the infamous hot sauce. Theres a reason the devil is red and let me tell you I think the devil created this sauce. Man it is brutal I could feel my internal organs burn up but it's so addicting like an addict who loves crack.

The service really left something to be desired.  We arrived right when they opened, and for the first 20 minutes or so of our meal, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Nevertheless, our server was very slow and not attentive. One of our friends wanted to try a new wine and she asked for some suggestions.  The server just repeated the options on the menu and kind of seemed like she was going out of her way to embarass our friend.  That may not have been the case, because she was mostly polite to us after that, but it was a very awkward interaction.  She never brought one of our drinks, but she charged us for it and we had to ask for it to be taken off the bill.  She never refilled our waters.  Due to the delay we ended up being pressed for time because we were trying to get uptown by a certain time, even though we'd allotted over an hour and a half to eat.  I finally had to go up to the counter to ask for our bill, and she apologized profusely and gave it to me.  We realized that the forgotten drink was still on the bill and that she had also overcharged us for our meals.  I took the bill back up to the counter and pointed out the mistake.  She again apologized and said she would fix it.  I went back to my table and sat down, but we waited for almost another 10 minutes, so I went back up to the counter and saw that our bill was still laying there, untouched.  I asked someone else to fix it and he did right away.  By this time we were really in a rush so I called my party up to the counter to stand with me while she rang up our cards so we could sign the bill and leave.  Our server told me that it was her first day working brunch.  I get that (I was a server too), but she also said she had been working the lunch and dinner services and we were also the only people in the restaurant for the first 20 minutes, and it wasn't that crowded for the rest of our meal, either.   We might go back at some point to try dinner, but I just don't know if it's worth taking the risk of having such bad service again.  I can't say I would recommend it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am obsessed with the classic sandwich. It is just perfect: fresh baguette with a nice crunch and a bunch of delicious meat and veggies (getting hungry as I'm writing this) and nicely priced for a great lunch. My team orders from Hanco's all the time, and every time it takes a bit longer than I'd like. Understandably so, Hanco's is located at least 15-20 min (walk) from my office. A good trick is to order well in advance!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hmmmm.... the pork broth! I can have just that forever! Ramen was not what I expected. Menchanko does a must denser ramen. Pork belly buns, gone in a second.

"went here on sunday afternoon.  The place is small, but the crepes are made fresh so it could take a while if there are many customers, but luckily no one was ahead of us.  We ordered 2 savory crepes, and 2 coffees. $20.  very satisfying, very tasty, crisp where it needed to be.  I will definitely go back to try the sweet crepes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So we came here because Di Fara's was closed on Mondays. Make no mistake, the entire atmosphere/vibe is not far from what you get when getting pizza and ice cream at BJ's. But those square pizzas ($2.50) are somethin' else. With this seemingly pervasive NYC antitrust of deep dish pizzas, I have longings for that which I've grown up eating -- thick, fluffy, juicy pizzas that are not overkilled by cheese. This fits the bill. The pistachio spumoni ($2 small) provided a happy ending.","[1.0, 0.0]"
The atmosphere is fantastic and the service was outstanding!  Hands down the best service we encountered all week (shout out to Leila).   The food had potential but it seemed like the cook forgot to use salt.  We had the mini chicken pot pie and wee shepherd's pie and both dishes were super bland.  There was no salt/pepper on the table.  Once we got some and added it to our dishes they were quite a bit better.  The pastry on the pot pie was wonderful and the sauce could have been amazing with a bit more oomph. I would definitely give this restaurant another try on a future trip to NYC.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

Confession: I've worked for Mexican restaurants in the past. So believe me I am biased. The staff here is great. The Margs are killer. There should be a warning not to let me know 2 or else chaos.

One of my favorite spots tucked away in the West Village. I like how the dishes are simple and on the healthy side yet gourmet at the same time.

"We couldn't wait for this place to open, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is very cozy with reclaimed wood featured throughout the space and a huge window at the front of the room. The music is set at a comfortable volume and the lighting is warm. Our first visit, we tried the beets appetizer (recommended by the neighborhood blog) and the prosciutto pizza. Both were excellent. The sea salt really brought out the flavor of the beets and the wood fired oven provided a tasty char to the pizza crust. Our second visit (in less than a week), we tried the leek pizza and the minestrone. Again, both were excellent. Notably the pizza was had the same perfect char as before. Like Costello Plan (same owners), the menu is concise, but every item is well planned and delicious. The chef also clearly tried to avoid cannibalizing business from Costello Plan (i.e. the menus have very different flavors and offerings). A new addition to our standard rotation of dining out, along with Purple Yam, The Farm on Adderley, Costello Plan, The Dogwood and  Oxcart.  We live in the area, but this place is worth a trip on the train.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I don't know how many of you are lovers of the Food Network but this season on Next Food Network Star I became completely obsessed with Justin, the young chef from Brooklyn.  Such a bad ass.  And then low and behold he wins!  This prompted me to visit his restaurant as soon as possible before all of America decided to book a reservation (which is funny because they don't take them). The restaurant is a little bit of a trek from the city to the Bedford/Stuyvesant area but TOTALLY worth it.  The restaurant itself is a little small (bring more than four people and it might be a bit tricky to fit all of you at a table comfortably) but totally cool.  It's hipster in the real way not the annoying ""hipster"" way.  The tile floor features a skull and cross bones, the table tops are glass with flowers and other scenery underneath and if you are headed to the bathroom make sure to ask the bartender for a marker so that you can graffiti the wall (yup it's encouraged). And when you are done loving the look of the restaurant you can begin focusing on the food which is probably the most random menu I've ever seen.  My friend and I shared... the foie gras doughnut (famous), the fried chicken, the frog legs, the nachos, and the shishito peppers. The doughnut - I'm glad I tried it but it wasn't my favorite.  The doughnut was warm which was obviously a plus but I think foie gras and doughnut together is just a little too rich for me. The fried chicken - Other people have given this bad reviews but I thought it was really tasty.  It was fried the ""good"" way where there isn't too much breading and the ratio was a lot of chicken to two small waffles which I actually prefer.  A lot of the places in LA overkill on the waffles.  Lastly it had like a mango honey glaze which topped it off! The frog legs - It was my first time having them so I can't really make comparisons but for my first foray into frog body parts I thought they were really good.  Also they were cooked in a Dr. Pepper sauce which I thought was inventive and fun and still tasted great.  They were also huge which I wasn't expecting and realistically tasted like chicken haha. The nachos - The nachos were suggested by Justin himself who even after winning Star is still waiting the tables at his own restaurant which I thought was really cool.  The ""nachos"" that came out were the strangest nachos I'd ever seen!  They were really more like fried dumplings with gouda cheese inside and then covered in ""nacho""-esk toppings.  Regardless they were delicious! The shishito peppers - I'm still having day dreams about the peppers I had at Blue Ribbon in Vegas so I felt bad for this dish.  I thought it was an interesting idea to serve the peppers plain and then provide different powders to dip them in but at the end of the day the sea salt grilled peppers at Blue Ribbon just blew these away. My final comment about the restaurant is that when it came to dessert, Justin very nonchalantly told us ""We don't really do dessert.  It's not our thing.  We have assorted ice creams and serve a ice cream Snickers bar from the bodega down the street.""  My friend and I thought this was hilarious and ordered the Snickers.  We started cracking up when it came cut in four pieces, still in the wrapper, topped with powdered sugar and a sliced strawberry.  So hipster ironic haha.  And it was delicious. Overall loved this place and would totally come back.  After reading some other reviews I also learned that they have an outdoor area too so I may have to try that next time.  I highly recommend you try it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I need you to cue the Oompa band and get in a sausage-packed, spatzel heavy, beer drenched mood. Cafe Katja is a true gem in the neighborhood. The house made sausages are rich and delicious.. and the buttery spatzel swimming in a rich creamy peppercorn sauce was awesome. I love the HUGE beers served in head-sized steins or boots.

"Where does a place have to be in this city to actually be hidden?? Maybe tucked away in a bunker somewhere held under lock and key? I seriously wish this city had more alleys (and tunnels and skyways and secret doorways) because then maybe a few places could escape the wildfire of NYC hype. I avoided this place for the longest time because I knew it would be trampled upon by those in the know, but that tactic proved ineffectual. A typical wait on a Friday/Saturday night is over an hour. No reservations for tables under six, and although there are two bars (one in the front room near the entrance and another in the back), there isn't much space to hang out. It has a nice kitschy hunting lodge getaway thing going on that would be fun to explore on a weeknight sometime. Maybe I'll try Monday at 5pm. As a friend in the neigborhood says, the only days the LES is worth going to are Mon-Wed. Damn condos!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Our favorite neighborhood restaurant. Been eating almost weekly since they've opened, and have been turning on friends and relatives to this place when visiting.  From my experience,  the food has been consistently DEElious. The staff is super friendly, though the one of the managers? can be a bit smug at times.  The portions are great, the prices are very reasonable -- unless you're adding drinks from the bar of course, and the atmosphere is comfortable. We go very late in the eve, when there are fewer people & nonstop chatterboxes. To each his own, but the few people here who gave it a one star review either have a competing restaurant in the neighborhood, or are just one of those overly petty individuals who need a reality smack instead of a hug. Oh one negative: They've added a Foosball table near the front. Why, I have no idea. The loud smashing sounds created by two overly-hyped players is not what I'd like to hear while eating and trying to carry on a conversation. I love Foosball - but leave this noiser-maker at a testosterone-populated sports bar. *************************  U P D A T E  4/14/2012 Just got back from a midnight meal.  Now, Iv'e been back there plenty of times since my previous review, in fact, the Foosball table was removed like a week after my review (I'm sure others complained). Well, much to my shock and horror, in the same corner where the beloved Foosball machine once stood during its short life, was a female disc jockey; yes, a DJ! We were so hungry, it was late, and we did not have other options, so we grabbed a booth all the way in the back. The problem was, no matter where you were seated, it still felt like Rihanna joined your party and decided to sing her hits directly into you ear....with a mic. To carry on a conversation, we had to scream at the top of our lungs, including yelling in our orders to the waiters. OK, I realize it's Friday night, and the city is hopping with energy, but come on, this is a restaurant not a nightclub!   I'm trying to figure out the strategy behind this? Was it to attract an even lager crowd of under 30 year old's? Was the DJ a distant cousin of the manager, in need of a gig? I'm confused because the place is always crowded, especially on weekends, so the ear-bursting decision? In any case, the food was good as usual, but the moment the last fork full of food was eaten, we practically jumped the waiter for our check. One star has now been deducted, for the Margue de Sade version of relaxing dinner, and I will never attempt to step foot in there on a weekend evening again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Once upon a time there was a place called Milos Estiatorio in midtown up by the Ziegfeld.  Milos was an awesome destination for some excellent Greek Islands fare and healthy portions of alcohol.  Well, times, fortunes and bank account balances change, and a decade later, and a boro away, I find Olea, which offers food just as good, in a friendlier atmosphere, without requiring collateral in the event that you cannot foot the bill.  Have already been twice in as many months, and am looking forward to going back many, many times in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The cilantro, the spice! Ahhh!! I love it. I always tell myself I'll just eat half the sandwich and save the other half for later.

But, seriously, ignore my bottomless pit of a stomach and pay attention to the tastiness.

The decor is most DEFINITELY bare bones-- don't expect an 85 degree restaurant with a fire lit in the back, but, hey, it's Sunset Park and we take what we can get here. My only desire is that this Ba Xuyen was open later than 6:30 PM (closes at that time everyday) that way I can get the yum yums after work for dinner!

"Very good - was more into the calzone than the pizza, but both very good. They keep it simple, it's all handmade and brick oven, very homey atmosphere. Watching two strapping young dudes handmake your pizza by firelight is um, niiiice. The secret to any good pizza is two things - the sauce, and the dough. These guys use a thin crust without much flavor or complication to it - it's a stage for the sauce. Their sauce is where their magic is at - tart, thin, zesty and packs a lot of flavor. Pizza's a good balance for a girl like me, who loves carbs but also thinks of pizza as sauce+dough, and is not interested in a whole mouthful of edge crust to define her pizza. The calzone is rich, exorbitant (in flavor and heft, not price), yet, oh so delicious. It's big enough to feed a family of 4 or 5 alone (two adults, 2-3 kids). You only get one choice - ricotta. But that's OK, cuz it's hella good. On the day we came, Beyonce and Jay-Z walked up in there and freaked everybody out. But apparently they've been coming there for years. Good times.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I ate here once a few months ago and left satiated. And while I didn't think the food was superb when I went, I enjoyed the ambiance. I recently revisited for a good friends' birthday. Literally, everything that could go wrong, went wrong. They got every order wrong. The table wait was grossly inaccurate (30 minute wait became a 60 minute wait). The dishes were wrong. The drinks were forgotten. The waitress seemed high (which I guess justifies forgetting our entire order). When we had arranged for the bill to be covered and for desserts with a candle to come out, and all that was screwed up, we went to the manager to ask for some kind of explanation. He proceeded to basically tell us we were in the wrong and that we shouldn't tell other people about our experience there. So, YELP community, don't eat at glasserie.

"I have eaten at Piccolo Angolo many times and cannot stop raving about the food.  However, the service at this restaurant is horrendous and the owner is extremely rude and disrespectful.  I understand that it is a challenge to get reservations; however, I was there two weeks ago and was totally taken aback at how rude and insulting the owner was to my friend.  The restaurant was virtually empty and a staff member the previous day had told me on the phone not to worry about a reservation since I was planning on being at the restaurant at 5:30pm.  When my friend arrived at the restaurant the owner in a very disrespectful way told her that he did not have anything available even though most of the tables were empty.  She left after this exchange, where I not knowing what had transpired, arrived at the restaurant to ask for a table and told him I didn't have reservations.  After some reluctance he proceeded to seat me.  When I called my friend to tell her about the table, she told me that she had arrived earlier and had been turned away.  I don't understand this double standard.  Needless to say I will not be returning nor recommending this place of business to anyone.  NYC has too many restaurants with great food and service for anyone to be subject to this type of behavior.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went to this place for the first time because I live in the area and what an incredible find!! The only reason I didn't give it five start was because of the terrible service. I couldn't really understand it. The ambience was amazing, the place looked wonderful, the FOOD WAS AWESOME, but our waitress was so mean from the get go. We asked her if the apple cider on their drinks list was very sweet and she looked at us like we were crazy and then proceeded to say in the most exasperated way that it's ""Just like any other cider."" Worst way to sell something and we obviously didn't get it. She was like that the whole night, even after we decided that she might just be having a bad day, and tried to be super nice to her. There was no change, still really mean and haughty.     The horrible service aside, the food was phenomenal, the squash soup made me melt and the goat meatballs were very good. Hummus, swordfish, everything was delicious with complex and bold flavors, so big props to the chef!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went there for a 15-person dinner (!) for my birthday last weekend and we ate family style, so I am unusually qualified to rate this place: and it is as good as it gets. Somehow, despite the amazing prices, the 150+ choices, and the quick service, the dishes at SriPraPhai taste like they were cooked one by one, with care to doneness and development of the flavor of each dish's components. Every dish I had was a mixture of some kind, and yet none were a blurry mash of taste or texture. I marveled at a duck dish in which each piece of meat was crisp and juicy. Tips besides the entrees: * Thai Iced Tea with tapioca, $3 * Best value dessert menu anywhere, typically three to four dollars per plate * Waitress spoke excellent English and could make suggestions for all of our needs * ""No reservations"" but call anyway for a large group.

"Ate dinner here this past weekend.  Walked about 15 minutes from the subway in light flurries and the cold which only enhanced what is already a comfortable and cozy atmosphere.   Got there a little early so we sat at the bar with a glass of wine and studied the wine list in anticipation of a bottle with dinner.  The manager and hostess both checked in with us while we waited, offering us help with the wine list and letting us know that if we wanted to wait a little longer we could sit at a two in the window if we preferred.  We did and it was worth the couple of extra minutes.  The table was in the corner just to the left of the door.  There's a small curtain on the door so don't be worried about cold air if you get offered this table, it's a great spot. The food (everything we ordered is still on the website menu where you can get full descriptions).  We started with salads; beet salad with the horseradish creme and the mushroom and brussels sprout salad.  They were both excellent.  The mushroom and brussels came with a fried egg on top and a couple of small cubes of lardon on the side which you might think a little cliche until you put it in your mouth.  The mains were the sauteed halibut (perfectly done) and the pork shoulder (fork tender and a great choice on a cold night).  We caught each other doing the closed eyes rocking in your chair thing a couple of times during the meal.  Dessert, we shared two scoops of gelato (rum raisin and sour cream flavored), Don't know if the gelato was made in house or not and don't care.  It was excellent.  Speaking of excellent, we haven't submitted many reviews and try hard not to default to excellent even if we like a place a lot but we really don't have a choice here.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So, let's start with the basics. I'm a 1st generation American born of Spanish parents from Valencia, Spain. I spent summers and other important times of my early years in Spain, and not only am I obsessed with food in general but I know Spanish food, especially rice dishes and paellas. That aside, I'm always cognizant of the fact that local products often make the unique tastes found in national and regional cuisines so I try to temper my reviews with those pesky little facts in mind. Myself and three other adults went to Casa Mono for lunch since my father in law is always talking about going back to CM. We've been to CM at least dozen times and I can say with certainty that the quality of Spanish cuisine has been consistent since the first time I've been there. Which is to say not always great. There a few dishes I can recommend but aside from that you'll be paying for overpriced and not very interesting nor delicious combinations which have little to do with Spanish cuisine. So to start, we had the Sepia which was a sad little meager helping of very thin cuttlefish. In Spain, hell when I buy cuttlefish in Chinatown, they are usually plumper and fatter than the pathetic serving we received. Taste was fine but the presentation of such a wimpy sepia was disappointing and without a thick slab of sepia to chew on the texture that is so lovely in most sepia dishes was completely missing. We'll call this a fail. The frisse salad with Manchego was good but that's a hard one to mess up as long as the frisse is fresh  and your Manchego is half way decent. Ensalda Rusa was a take on the traditional dish with some exotic items thrown in for what I later determined was just to throw them together as they neither enhanced nor elevated the original dish. The dish had many of the items I usually covet, like sea urchin, but I have to say that this combination left a lot to be desired. I'm always surprised when people combine things that by themselves are delicious, i.e. boiled egg--check and delicious/sea urchin--double check and double delicious/chicken cracklings-- oh man here I come!! But all of these items together were stupid together. Whereas I can enjoy Morimoto's poached oyster with foie gras and sea urchin and loved what they did together, this was just a mess. A $14 mess that sucked. C'est la vie on to the other items. Next we ordered the Spanish Anchovies with ramps and not the usual Lardo Iberico. How sad that I didn't taste either. The waiter sold me on the uniqueness of the anchovies being home-style, which I've had in abundance in Spain. The beauty of these home-style anchovies is that they are less salty, plumper and taste more of the actual fish and the sea than the usual cheap canned variety. Sadly both the anchovies and ramps were dumbly combined with so much tomato paste that I couldn't taste anything but the tomato paste. The pork croquets were good, although they weren't of the creamy Spanish variety I'll let them slide since they didn't anger me in any way and were at least tasty. At this point, I'm just pissed. This sucks and aside from the salad and pan con tomato (messing bread and tomato is hard to mess up so there's that) everything has been a huge disappointment. The sweet breads were too salty and had to be sent back. Whereupon the newly arrived dish is less salty but quite a bit more on the teensy side. So sad to see that these pucks can't even make sure to keep their clients happy. The duck egg and bravas were fine but not amazing. I'd order them again if I had to since they were at least technically adequate and the ingredients weren't over shadowed by some bullshit. The razor clams were as usual pretty good. But again like all things Batali it seems, as long as the product is decent and the chefs don't do too much to the actual product, like drizzle with olive oil and bake, then you're good to go. I've been to many Batali joints (I haven't been to Babbo but considering all the crappy disappointing experiences I've had so far with Batali's cuisine I don't think I'll try) and can say without any reservation that the only thing that Batali does well is import excellent products. If you get a cheese or charcuterie plate, sans chef's additional tweaks, you're good to go. If you get a pasta plate or pizza at a Batali joint with a traditional sauce, you're good to go. However, if you venture into the creative side of any Batali eatery, beware, you are likely to spend too much be assaulted with what can only be described as a ham handed attempt at creating something delicious which Casa Mono clearly and sadly cannot achieve. Good luck Casa Mono I hated almost every bite.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I had high expectations for Cheeky Sandwiches after reading the reviews about the chicken sandwich, so my friend and I made the trek from Columbia down to Chinatown for it. Unfortunately, I was totally underwhelmed. Born and raised in Houston, I was craving a good chicken biscuit. The one I was served was completely overpowered by the sour red cabbage slaw. After a few small bites, I just scraped all of it off and gave the sandwich another chance. The chicken and biscuits were still bland, and I was not satisfied. It definitely wasn't with the $6.50 I paid for it. I wanted Cheeky Sandwiches to live up to the hype, but it didn't. Chick-fil-a's spicy chicken biscuit blows this one out of the water, so I'll just stick to my chicken biscuits back home.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Don't go to Eataly, they said. ""It's too touristy,"" they said. 'They' are currently on friend probation. Yes, the place is usually packed to the brim with people but I refuse to let that take anything away from the experience. If you go right when they open on weekdays, you have a few moments of open space. The market itself is fascinating, with a myriad of Italian imports ranging from teas and candy to books and stemware and every possible type of food or drink item in between. The restaurants can be confusing, as they're spread throughout the market. The woman behind the chocolate counter was more than happy to direct us accordingly. We chose the pizza & pasta place and it was awesome. No line since we were early, and although tables were very close together, we avoided sitting next to anyone. The pasta buccatini and the margherita pizza were both excellent. Portions are definitely big enough to share, which can help with the price a bit. Service was on point, and overall atmosphere is really unique. Even if you don't dine here, at least do yourself the favor of walking through.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I wanted to like The Pines because of the concept, antique interior, and location, but the initial smell when walking into the restaurant should have been a sign that the experience would be bad.  The place smelled like a bathroom.  The restaurant is over priced.  I think we left the restaurant feeling like we had spent 100 alone on bread (because our entrees and share plates were so disappointing).  The drinks also could have been better.   The oxtail cappellacci was mediocre.  I know it gets many good reviews online (probably by reviewers who get comped meals) but anyone who I have talked to who has been there said they were also really disappointed.  We also had the wagyu culotte steak - this dish was incredibly disappointing.  In this case the rare steak was not done correctly and after sending it back to be cooked more it was actually edible.  I appreciate the effort to have the other featured ingredients with the steak but they didn't work (part of the reason I ordered the dish is I love mushrooms).   Our share plate was so forgettable and not very well put together.  I remember that the share plate had almost as much bread as the bread plate.  To be fair, I went here a few months ago but was really so disappointed with it. I heard through friends the only reason one would want to go is the backyard to drink but that the food is not worth your time and money.  The Pines is definitely overhyped and part of an overhyped wave of new overpriced restaurants taking over brooklyn, manhattan, etc. that we are force fed reviews by young freelancers who wil write a good review for anyone who comps them a meal.  For a regular person who has to pay for their own meal (or makes the mistake of going here on their birthday like I did) - I would highly suggest skipping it and going elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here with my brother for my ""last meal"" before I got my wisdom teeth pulled. Let me say, I was not disappointed. We started off with the mesclun salad and the dressed prawns salad. Although the mesclun was just simple with greens and a light vinaigrette, it came with the most amazing baked goat cheese on top of a toasted piece of bread. The cheese made this simple salad amazing... I am a HUGE cheese fan and was beyond happy with Minetta's choice to compliment the greens. The prawn salad was also delicious with thick, juicy shrimp. For dinner we split the black label burger and the New York strip, both medium rare, as recommended. Both entrees were delicious, but the burger was truly out of this world. I wish we both would've gotten the burger so I could have fully indulged. The steak was great top, don't get me wrong, but the black label burger was just epic. The fries were yummy and the sautéed spinach was just basic, like any other spinach side. The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because our specific dining experience  #1 the table/booth we sat at was right behind the hostess stand and it was difficult to maneuver #2 because when the ny strip first came out it was basically raw and we had I send it back. The second time around it was cooked medium rare to perfection, but it did take a while. I will definitely be back and when I go I want to try the  $148 steak for two. The quality of beef at Minetta was top notch, so I am sure I would be more than satisfied with that dish. All in all it was a wonderful experience.

"Good food, great ambiance and despite sharp critics that compare it to Dell'Anima, a good place to eat. If you are looking for the Dell'Anima experience with easier reservations, this you will not get because the fact of the matter is that although the menus are similar in theme, the feel of it is different. Louder, less intimate, and more spacious L'Artusi has a different ambiance. Similarly, the staff, while still knowledgeable, also seem perhaps slightly less confident (or it could have been our luck of the draw). If you stop comparing it to Dell'Anima, however, it is a good place to eat. Tasty, simple pastas and seafood. Although I do not love everything on the menu (escarole salad was just boring to me), in general it still scored high points for me in terms of the quality, simplicity, and taste of the food.

"The pizza was delicious, and the friendly servers make this an enjoyable experience.   Two people can easily polish off a 16"" pie.  I thought the pizza was unique because the dough and crust are nice and chewy, but the bottom is cooked all the way the through.  The ingredients are all fresh - from the mozzarella to the sauce.  I would highly recommend this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to this restaurant with my cousin who frequents this establishment. It is a great place to eat and relax. I enjoyed the delicious food and wine. The restaurant is dimly lit and it has big windows. It has beautiful dark wood throughout the restaurant. I like the small candles at the bar and tables. The flowers on the table and bar area added a nice touch as well. The spacing between the seats is a little tight however it is cool. My cousin and I were discussing a book and the table next to us read the same book. All four of us had a nice conversation.There is seating by the windows and it is cool to see the neighborhood. You can sit by the window and feel the nightly breeze on your skin. There is also seating at the bar which is great as well. This restaurant could have been in an episode of Sex and The City. I could see Carrie Bradshaw having brunch here to work on her column or the ladies getting together to gossip.   We were attended by Devon and Carter. Devon is awesome and friendly. He made me feel really welcomed. Carter was nice and he selected a great wine for me. I do not recall the name however it smelled like a sweet fragrance. We had an appetizer that consisted of bread, cheeses and various meats which was excellent. My cousin had the meat and mozzarrella pizza that was delicious. I had the chicken breast salad and it was good. The food was fresh and amazing. For dessert, my cousin had the apple tart with cinnamon ice cream. I never had a dessert like this and I was pleasantly surprised. Overrall, I was very pleased with my dining experience at Grape and Grain. This place can handle all your needs whether you are having a dining experience with a group of friends or one friend. This place looks great for couples especially first dates. The vibe is cool and the prices are reasonable. I look forward coming here again. Also, the bathroom is very clean. I was surprised that I didn't have to look out for ""droplets"" on the toilet seat. Not only is Grape and Grain a cool place to chill but it is very clean as well. Please check this place out because you will have a good time!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Went in last night ( a little on the late side) and the two dudes working there was some of the rudest people I've ever experienced. After asking to sit by the window, as there were no seats available, they said no.

"This place makes me wish I live in Williamsburg.  Food is awesome, service is great, and the restaurant itself is roomy so you can actually get a table without the hour-wait that's standard at the East Village location.  They also have really cute garden seating when the weather is nice. Both the food and drinks here are top notch.  There are vegetarian options, and they seem really accommodating about (reasonable) substitutions. The service slows down a bit if it's crowded.  In that case, I highly recommend ordering a drink and the tostones mochimero appetizer (plantains with mojito mayo) and just enjoying the laid-back vibe. P.S. The mango (?) sauce at the tables is great on EVERYTHING.  Try to resist the urge to sneak the whole bottle home with you.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Holy return to the Motherland! If your motherland were Italy. That statement was the initial reaction from a friend who was blown away by Eataly. I had heard about Eataly for months, especially when it first opened. The initial bad, even horrid reviews (too crowded, too confusing, too expensive, etc) did not compel me to make a visit. But recently I was a block away, incredibly hungry but couldn't eat anything big because I had dinner reservation in a couple of hours. I needed a snack STAT. I saw Eataly and cautiously approached it. It was mid-mid, mid-afternoon, which turned out to be the perfect time to go to Eataly. There were plenty of people, but I could still move around and not feel claustrophobic. Once inside, I realized why all my friends screamed about the clusterf*ck mess that Eataly could induce. You see, one-stop shopping is an American concept. In Europe, you go to one place for meat, another place for vegetables, another place for bread, etc. Mario Batali created Eataly that combined the American's love of one-stop with the European concept of meandering all over town just to buy a few grocery items.  You're in one place (Eataly), but you need to go to different sections and stand in different lines to buy whatever it is you want to buy. And if it's really crowded, that means the lines all snake into each other. Yeah, a clusterf*ck. But without the maddening crowd, it's not bad and I could even kinda see the charm of visiting a place that tries to recreate the feel of a small town market square (albeit a very upscale market square). I bought an arancini, a fried Italian rice ball stuffed with a little bit of meat and cheese. It was fairly large, and it was the perfect sized snack to tide me over until dinner. Crispy outside and deliciously soft inside with gooey mozzarella.  I stood in another line to buy a drink. Wandered around a bit to admire Eataly and then left. Any Italian food product that you could think of, could probably be bought here (at a premium). It was a fun visit, but I can't imagine making this my regular shopping experience. Unless Ron C. can get me a discount. Can you, buddy?","[1.0, 0.0]"

Do yourself a favor and head a few blocks away to Lil Frankie's on First Ave for REAL Italian style flatbread pizzas, or pop in to the decidedly unglamorous but amazing Rosario's on Orchard street for a chewy, cheesy NY slice.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Disappointing. I remember when Walter Foods opened, I was spending a lot of time in Williamsburg, but in recent years my life has been focused in other parts of the city. A friend's band performance brought me back to Williamsburg for the night, and Walter Foods was a must on my list. The French Dip Sandwich, Lolli pop Chicken wings and Blackberry Bramble were my favorites years ago, and I was stoked that they were still on the menu. So that was my order. Let me tell you, these are not my favorites anymore and Walter Foods has lost a spot in my heart. The French Dip was on day old, maybe two day old baguette, not the crunchy delicious bread it used to be on. The warm sliced steak was almost non-exisitant and flavorless. Sad. Sad. Sad.... and the sadness continued with the lollipop chicken wings..... hot wings, tossed in cold gloppy hot sauce and served swimming in sauce. I ate one, and decided the calories weren't worth the rest. This food is definitely not made by the same chef and cooks that opened this place and made the menu so good years ago. My Bramble, was so sour and tart it was hard to drink. I understand it is not blackberry season, and maybe I should not have ordered it, but come on Mr. Bartender change the drink if you can't get in good berries.... have you tasted it lately? One might ask, why didn't you address these issues with your server? I would have if she could manage to get over to my table. It wasn't like she was over worked or anything the place was not packed, she was just too busy chatting with her friends 3 tables away. Eye contact, Hand wave.... Did it, got me nothing.  I had to ask for my check 3 times before I actually got it. Manager? Nope don't think there was one working that night. Maybe they should invest in one.   I was really hoping to go back to an old favorite for a meal that would bring back memories, but instead I got crap and indigestion. Mr. Walter Foods, please get back to the basics... well cooked food and attentive service. It is not that much to ask for.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The chicken's name was Colin and I was told he was quite popular in his pen and made the other chickens cluck their ass off with his wit and humor. Okay so Stone Park isn't that precious but it sure is damn cute and one of Park Slope's most popular brunch and ""nice dinner"" destinations. I've mostly been here for brunch and after trying their short rib hash, french toast and eggs benedict I gotta say the eggs benedict is my consistently a great dish with its non-gross hollandaise sauce, poached egg and a hearty-sized slice of canadian bacon. The short rib hash is pretty excellent too if you need a hangover buster and like your brunch to stick to your...ribs *snicker* I find it to be too heavy for my Sunday morning hustle. If you're coming with more than two people get ready to wait up to 45 minutes on Sunday mornings.

"My first time trying Belgian fries and I'm a believer. // LOCATION // Lower east side and a short walk away from Chikalicious dessert bar, another must try. It is a tiny little shop that looks like a small wooden cabin...a Belgian cabin. Walking inside though, I was surprised to see two smooth talking Asian guys ready to take our order. // FOOD //     +Pommes Frites: Got the small which was more than enough for two people to share. They were crispy and cooked to perfection. Frites are served in an adorable paper cone allowing for simultaneous walking and face stuffing.     +Dips: Some of the dips are free including raw onion, ketchup, mustard, vinegar, and tabasco. As a minimalist, these sauces were enough for me and let the frites speak for themselves. Most of my friends rave about the Vietnamese Pineapple mayo though. Definitely worth a try. You know the frites have to be good if this place only sells that and has a line out the door at an ungodly hour of the night.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Terrible experience. Don't expect to get in if you are a group of 5 or more, this is one of those places that gets by purely on hype. We were told at 7PM tonight to expect a 1 hour wait. 2 1/2 hours later we gave up, the fact we had 3 kids and said we didn't mind splitting our group made no difference. Rude is an understatement.

"I love this place- the space is adorable; small yet feels spacious.  The two tables by the front wall are cozier than the three on the other side as there are lanterns under the table and the chairs are more comfortable (and colorful). Food is made with great care, using fresh ingredients and interesting combinations. Slow down; enjoy the atmosphere which feels a little like an indoor garden scene from a Murakami novel. However, I get the feeling that once they officially open; their menu is going to expand. Armed with the owner's cell phone, I'll be back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I usually wait to order several things off of a menu before I come to a fair assessment about a restaurant. Having done so, let me say that Cafe Ollin is consistently some of the BEST MEXICAN in the city. The green sauce is tantalizingly refreshing and spicy; the deluxe tacos are bursting with fresh produce and cheese;and the burritos pack a wallop, stuffed with slow-cooked delicious meats of your choice. Cafe Ollin uses authentic Mexican cheeses that pair so perfectly with their tortillas. This fine establishment offers a turn from the norm, with meats like spicy pulled goat and cow tongue (for the adventurous types). Get your ass to Spanish Harlem as soon as possible!

The waitress was fine.  It seems the kitchen is a bit inconstant which lessened my want to return.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Su Khum Vit is to Thailand as Broadway is to New York, and as any naïve diner like me would assume, authentic name = good food. Luckily, this is one of the cases where my judging of the book by its cover worked in my favor. It was a cute little place tucked away on 51st Street, as the name might imply. Not a bunch of tables, but they have great food and nice staff. Had some nice little appetizers; curry puffs had to be my favorite, though. Pad Thai was a bit on the sweet end, but I enjoyed the chicken in it. If you need some decently priced Thai food in Midtown East, not a bad choice here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was looking forward to dining here for a while.  I have heard only the best things about this place.   PROS:   Hostess was very welcoming and super helpful - she was great!   The Upstairs Bartender & Raw Bar Chef were extremely friendly and knowledgeable - very impressed with those two. The Mulled Wine was out of this world!!! The Bussers had a great attitude and were friendly! Decor strikes an interesting balance between super cute and hipster grandma kitch. Great Beer selection as well! This place is a very cool spot - the ambiance was very cool and crowded. CONS: Manager was extremely busy, hence the dismissive attitude is to be expected? Our waiter had a polite disdain for us.   The food was decent but not amazing -  as we had expected for the price of the menu. Apparently here the price does not equal quality.

"We don't normally write reviews, but we had such an amazing experience at Palo Santo that we felt we ought to let other yelpers know where to find the most incredible ambiance, food and service in Brooklyn. No kidding. We went to Palo Santo last week for date night because we wanted to try something new, and for all of our 4 years of weekly date nights all over the 5 boroughs, Palo Santo is now in the running for our top 3 restaurants ever. We had the Picante de Mariscos (a complicated seafood and chile dish with cream and jasmine rice) and the Chayote Salad with an orange Vanilla dressing.  The food was exceptional.  It was creative and complicated, organic and ethically sourced.  The service was incredible. The gentleman serving us was extremely attentive, yet not over bearing.  The server was extremely knowledgable on both the wine and the food and how to pair these.  The server was also able to inform us on the exact local and ethical sourcing of the meats (which is extremely important to us).  The server afforded our table a complimentary sweet cake which was so tasty that that alone warranted our trek from Williamsburg to Park Slope. The ambiance is just what you would want in a date night or a night out with friends.  Great lighting and a rustic chic decor, an clean open kitchen, and latin saint candles on every table. We love Palo Santo, it will be a new date night go-to for my partner an I.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The rating explanation says it all - ""Meh. I've experienced better."" Put briefly - I'd suggest skipping this place all together; And given the prices, I wouldn't even recommend 'giving it a try.' Just stick with Chipotle - the place where you know won't be disappointed :) And also just down the block btwn 21st and 22nd street! The draw to this place is that everything is ""smoked."" That's supposed to be their distinguishing factor.  They offer a meat, chicken, pork and vegetarian option with a variety of 'toppings' in a burrito, burrito bowl, or taco form (all this is pretty much the same as Chipotle) The difference? The lack of flavor and mushy rice.   Bottom line, I'm not sure the meats are actually smoked or rubbed with ""smoke flavor"" then fried.  Overall I was underwhelmed with my meal (pork shoulder burrito bowl) and won't be going back. PS: The smashed and smoky guac just tasted like regular guac -- and yes, that too is better at Chipotle.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I disagree with some yelpers about this place. This is an ok place but there is nothing really to brag about. I went there once and now I don't even remember what I got there.

"I live across the street from here so I am always walking by and checking out the crowd inside. I decided to go in on Friday. The menu did nothing for me it was not exciting and nothing stood out to me to order. So I just decided on cocktails and sat  at the bar. I had a couple of gin and tonics and there were delicious of course for $14 each they should be. I had the pleasure of watching the bartenders make other drinks and they looked equally as good. I will definitely stop back in when I feel like treating myself and staying close to home, but its a little expensive.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love going out for Tappas - not only does sharing small plates enable me to try a variety of different things but the communal feel of a shared meal with friends can't be beat.

We split a bottle of a jammy, juicy, full bodied red - wish I could remember the name - it was fabulous and exactly what I needed.  We ordered 5 plates which was perfect - duck in a wonderful blackberry sauce, jamon, manchego green salad, butternut squash and pumpkin goat cheese croquettas (my favorite!). For dessert we split vanilla creme broulee with bay leaves coated in a delicious sugary puff. I must disclose that I don't eat red meat or pork so the jamon wasn't for me, but I was told it's delicious. The service was a 3, which is the only reason I didn't give this place a 5. Definitely a place I'll return!","[0.0, 1.0]"
The dumplings themselves were great. I had the pork and crab mixed with pork dumplings. A little bigger than I'm used too but tasty! The dumplings themselves are 4 stars but the atmosphere and restaurant facilities suck. Who wants to be crammed in a table with random other people. But its New York City chinatown so you can't really be expecting 5 star amenities and service. The standard that I compare all dumplings to though is Din Tai Fung in LA and in Taiwan. So compared to there the dumplings are just a notch below and they don't offer the dessert dumplings that Din Tai Fun does. Overall Joe's Shanghai is good but no reason to make a special outing there if you are there on vacation with precious time to spare.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"An amazing meal from start to finish. Love the decor. Waiter was very knowledgeable. Had the three small bites as an appetizer - eggplant, eleven later potato and and cheese and breadcrumb salad.  All three were excellent, well thought out dishes with great flavor. For main I had the kale and wild mushroom paella topped with an egg and fried artichokes, this is one of the best vegetarian dishes I have had recently. Amazing flavor and texture and a really unique dish. For dessert I had the brown butter almond cake - great flavor made with almond flour I think so great nutty flavor and topped with caramel and gelato. Cheesecake was very light with great texture and flavor as well. Loved the espresso bread pudding but really more of tiramisu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"By far the worst eating experience I've ever put myself threw.  I've never written a review before but my experience was so awful it needs to be shared. After arriving we're told it will be a ten minute wait for a table for our party of 4.  Seeing 4 empty seats at the bar we try and sit down to get a drink while we wait.  Upon trying to do this an unpleasant female bartender informs us that 2 of these seats are taken, while there is no sign of this. She makes zero effort to try and take our orders as she just wants us to move, and then puts two dirty glasses on the bar to show the 2 seats are ""occupied"".   We hear a little later that shes saving them for her two friends, who eventually showed up over an hour after we got their.   We are basically forgotten for 20 minutes as the host goes outside doing god knows what and we are left to wait for him to comeback so he can bring us to our table.  The waitress was the worst.  An awkward snutty girl who doesnt get that shes doing a job. When she brings drinks she reaches over my group violating our personal space, instead of moving her feet to do it properly. it would take 2 or 3 times to have her bring things like cream for coffee or more water as she would forget or is just incapable of maintaining information.   The music is so loud that you cannot have a conversation without yelling.  Not something I look for in a brunch atmosphere.  He blasts some bootleg rap that the host clearly has a some personal connection to, while he dances around.  He dances a lot, something that a customer eating brunch isnt trying to do. Its hard to dance and eat.  An older lady comes and tells him multiple times to change the music and turn it down.  This will last maybe 7 minutes till he turns up the music again. The food is pretty good, but it takes awhile.  I enjoyed my omelet, good quality biscuits, but the gravy was a little suspect.  The bloody marry's are little bit of a mess.  Way too much going on.  With the food and decor this place has some potential to be a good spot but the staff make this place unbearable. It seemed like no one cared and no one wanted to do anything.  The idea of service is foreign in this place and I highly caution people from going there.  Side note my friend in my party was at this place one other time.  He sat at the bar and was ignored for 15 minutes.  This is a trend.","[0.0, 1.0]"

They have magazines like a nail salon or a Doctor's office, except no tabloids and they're not crusty from 3 years ago. The dining experience involved lots of Italian food googling and ended with a serious cookie dispute. The woman at the counter did not charge me for my cookie, so she offered a free cookie to my friend, except she called it a biscuit in her thick italian accent. This added a sincerity to the offer in my mind. My friend declined, the woman again said, ""are you sure? you could have it for breakfast."" She refused about 3 more times. I would have eaten the cookie. I left extremely bewildered with my ""friend"" and we had a very Seinfeldish discussion on and off for about 2 weeks.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Was in NYC on vacay and had to check out the Spotted Pig having heard such fabulous things about it....and am so incredibly glad I did! Of all the places we hit in the City, this was definitely my fav and the one that exceeded my expectations. We put our name for the anticipated 1 hour wait and headed to one of the local bars for a drink as the bar at SP was a little too packed for us. Regardless, upon arriving back they seated us right away. The service was great..super friendly and helpful, as we had lots of questions about the menu but the thing that stood out here was defintely the food...OH the FOOD.. it was crazy delicious! We have lots of really good gastropubs here in Southern Cal but I have to say the food here was the BEST I've ever had at a gastropub.   We started out with the devils on horseback and the ricotta gnudi...both were delish and loaded with flavor.  We were pretty hungry so these did a perfect job of taking the edge off our hunger while we waited for our entrees. Next up was my friend's apple salad and my burger with the most amazingly delectable fries w/garlic and rosemary. OMG.. we could NOT stop eating these fries..these were seriously the most flavorful fries I've ever had in my life.  The burger was also pretty damn amazing...and let's just say not a bite was left on the plate. ;-) I highly suggest you make time for the Spotted Pig if visiting NYC...totally worth whatever the wait is... :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here for my 1/2 birthday and farewell dinner to my BFF Neth--it was one of the best 3 hour dinner of our lives. Kiyo (the chef) even came out and talked to us a couple times. Love the space-- huge skylights in the middle of the cieling, and recessed garden on the side wall. Couches as seats makes the whole room feel like youre at someones house-- Kiyo's house. Food...everything was excellent and thats why this place gets 5 stars ($15-25 an order). It's tapas style, very easy to share, sizeable portions. Here's what we ordered-- 1. The cavier-- this lasted us through all our courses. Get it, have it on the side and dip into it when youre waiting for your next plate. Comes with beet, cucumbers, radishes, etc. 2. The mushroom uni croquette-- melt in your mouth uni. Its a small fried ball filled with savory mushrooms, and topped with a generous amount of the most seductive uni Ive ever had. 3. Oysters! You can buy a dozen for $30 or 6 for $16. I say GO FOR THE DOZEN! Caught from Massachusetts, so fresh and silky. Best part though was instead of cocktail sauce, Kiyo makes this amazing apple vinegar sauce instead. Seriously. Go for the dozen. 4. Market Price Sashimi-- you choose 3 of the 5 they have, and they give at least 5 pieces each. They dont skimp on this. 5. Today's Special Wagyu -- TONGUE. How could I say no? How can anyone say no? Yum. Comes with fried potato and garlic. Make sure to take each bite with the rosemary. 6. Black Miso Cod-- Yeah you'd think all cods should be the same since all Japanese establishments serve this-- but youre wrong. Dont be stupid. Order it. We ordered it twice. Something about the seared skin, and buttered meat...very irresistable. 7. AND last but not least, the sake panna cotta. Not too sweet, just the right amount of alcohol. Helped keep our buzz going from our own bottle of sake. But just FYI-- its BYOB. Dont worry though, Rick from Sakaya can hook you up with a bottle.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The review may have been colored by my hunger, but I'll let it slide.  I had a delicious omelet feast for lunch today--eggs with feta, spinach, dotted with kalamata olives, with a little salad, two full slices worth of rye toast, and some tasty hash browns--for just $8!  I washed it down with an apple flavored tea and enjoyed the decent amount of seating and nice lighting.  My friend was very satisfied with her dishes.   Unfortunately, service was a little intermittent, but generally friendly.  So probably not the place to go if you're in a rush, but I'll be back for another leisurely lunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"*********   Dept of Health gave Iris Cafe a letter grade of '""C""  ********* Today I went to Iris Cafe and I noticed that they didn't have a letter grade posted (nor a ""pending""  letter grade notice) which I thought was strange.  Out of curiosity I checked the Dept of Health's website to see what their grade is.  I was shocked to find out that they were given a ""C"" grade....but what disturbed me even more is that Iris Cafe hasn't posted the letter grade as required by the Dept of Health.  I can't help but feel cheated by this establishment given this deceptive omission to their clientele.  I eat there on a weekly basis and am now reconsidering whether or not I will continue to go there.   Since Iris Cafe has decided to hide this very important information, here are the violations that the health dept inspectors found (link:  a816-restaurantinspectio…).  There are some pretty serious health violations noted below.

We ordered a set of chef's selection and they all came scatteringly without a complete presentation. The guy waiter was rude. We also added 5 bucks for the tea with the set. They ended up charging us 2 dollar more because two people were drinking it. Ridiculous! We gave them cash and the woman was requesting 18% of tip and asking if we wanted changes back. Yes, we do. The place only cares about money. They take no credit cards no matter how much you ordered and you always have to order two sets for two people. Their food is cheap home made food and but they charge way more than how much it costs them to make it. IRS should do an audit at this place to see how much tax they invaded by taking only cash, probably the only place in St. marks that does not take credit cards.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friend and I had a quick dinner here before catching a Broadway show. (I am a huge unfan of the Theater District - feel free to prove me wrong, excluding Hagi). I called Bar Jamon on the way up from the nail salon. There were 2 seats available at this point. However they were gone by the time we got there a few minutes later. Poo. Fortunately there were two counter seats left at Casa Mono. We sat at the far right end of the counter and had fun people watching. The hoof of the hunk of pork was in my face (in a nice way) the entire meal too. I like sitting at the counter. I feel like service is more personal and faster. I let the server know that we were in a rush and asked if it was possible to be done with dinner within 40 min. It was a tight squeeze, but they managed with minutes to spare and were very gracious about it. We each got a quart of vino. I went for the cheapest blanco and it was just as described. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. We ate: - Pulpo with Fennel and Grapefruit (Much love. I'm a big fan of savory fruit dishes. Pulpo was nicely seasoned, on the saltier side) - Mussels with Cava and Chorizo (Very good. And we dipped the excellent free bread in this sauce) - Skirt Steak with Onion Mermelada (Awesome. Perfectly cooked medium rare and loved the mermelada and red sauce) - Setas with Garlic (Mushrooms. A bit too salty.) - Ramps with Romesco (It's ramp season, and I've been reading about ramps in just about every other food blog? So I had to give it a try. More tender than typical Chinese leek) I'm looking fwd to corn season - I liked the corn pimiento dish I had last time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is not really Colombian. It's over-hyped, overpriced and food is less than average. Not really sure why it's called Bogota since it is not even close to authentic Colombian restaurant.

This one came with cabbage salad (weird!), and then $21 a pop...too expensive!   Also, Colombian arroz con pollo served with black beans (are you kidding me?) Colombians don't eat black beans!

"Cafe Mogador has a beautiful ambiance. The festive decor makes you feel like you're on an island somewhere along the Mediterranean Sea. The food is a savory collision of smoke and spice. The colorful dishes taste as delightful as the presentation. I came here for brunch, and decided to try the Halumi Eggs. Fluffy poached eggs over luscious roasted tomatoes, wonderfully seasoned halumi cheese, a light, delectable salad, and warm zahatar pita bread. The only fault I found in this plate was there was not enough. I didn't want my Moroccan daydream to end! The service was attentive and the staff was very accommodating.  There was a bit of a miscommunication during seating, and while it essentially was not a big deal, our waitress apologized and gave us free freshly squeezed orange juice -- which I highly suggest you order. Their orange juice tasted like they were handpicked from the fields of Sicily. The sweetest, most refreshing orange juice my palate has ever experienced. Cafe Mogador is like taking a mouth-enticing whimsical voyage to the marvelous Mediterranean without the sea sickness, the inconvenience of passport checks, breaking your wallet on cheap souvenirs, a couple pills of Immodium, or even that restless leg 10-hour flight.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And then I will let out my belt three notches, and vow that I will rock-climb on the morrow as punishment for my indulgence. But I won't. And that will be my secret. Also, our waitress never wavered when my friend and I told her a) we'd be ordering a bunch of appetizers instead of an appetizer and entree and b) that she was not drinking wine (a teetotaller, that girl.

The Fries where amazing and crispy, but the burger was borderline inedible being smothered in a pound of blue. I scraped as much off as i could however the residue remained.

Also had the cuttlefish special, stuffed with crabmeat.  I've never had cuttlefish before...the texture is similar to octopus...but it's pod-like so perfect for stuffing.  :)  My boyfriend had the Petroniana.  It was perfect.

But ok, you didn't come here only cause it looks nice, and frankly, neither did I, so on to the food and drinks. Well... The truth is it was above average but below amazing (except for their fire wood chicken wings, those were just too good to be true!!). The drinks are pretty good, but the place was so packed it took over ten minutes between us ordering our drinks and when they arrived our table. also the table we actually sat at was very very small, actually the two dishes we ordered and our drinks took almost all the table space. The seating was also pretty tight as I kept elbowing the woman behind me by mistake every so often and it just was not comfortable. I think this place will do very well. the bar seemed like a great place to be at but sadly was super packed.

"Holy mother of all this fat, M. Wells Dinette is fantastic! Love that it's located inside the MoMa PS1 and decorated like a school cafeteria! I never got the chance to eat at the original location so I was very excited when my two girlfriends suggested eating here for lunch and what a feast we had! Between the three of us, we shared 7 dishes - several of their small plates, a charcuterie, two mains and a dessert. We came hungry and left very very full! Everything we shared was delectable. The highlights for me were their Escargot & Roasted Bone Marrow (they now use fresh snails apparently), Fluke Crudo and Lobster Pasta. Both the Goat Cheese with Roast Beets Salad and Banana Creme Brulee Pie were the least memorable - they were good but it did not stand out like the rest. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the dishes offered here! The service is friendly, helpful and quick. We initially ordered the Tuna & Ham Charcuterie plate and was told that they ran out of ham so they whipped up a hybrid for us, which was tasty. I loved that they wanted to give us something similar and got creative with it! There is no excuse not to venture out to Long Island City to eat here. Several trains are within a 5-10mn walk of M.

"I'll admit that I was very disappointed when I received pizza delivery from this place.  I ordered a large pie to share.  Their large is only 12"".  The menu didn't offer this information.  Given that i was thin crust, it was not enough to share (for me, a guy, expecting to share a standard large pie that's 18"".)   It was unexpected, forced portion control.   Having said that, the pizza itself was very tasty (gourmet) and of quality ingredients.  I note that I had ordered extra cheese, but it didn't seem like it had that.     If you can get past portion size, the pizza really is very good.  I would order from them again, on the right night, but taking this into account.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Absolutely love this place.  Been here several times and the experience had always been one of great food and service. Their 3 pasta all you can eat is the best deal in town. Their food is fresh, served promptly by an attentive staff and everyone seems concerned that you are enjoying yourself. Whether as a party of one or a group of 8 the experience was the same! It is best to make a reservation, especially if you are a larger party, but I dropped in once as a single during the dinner rush and was seated promptly. This is a very popular Italian restaurant in the Theater District and they have lots of pre-theatre patrons, so if you are going during the week getting there after the theater rush will make it more enjoyable. They don't rush you either, particularly for the 3-pasta all you can eat, they just keep coming back asking if you want more...

"This has a four-star average from over 1000 people for a reason. It is seriously good! I feel bad for those who went that did not have good experiences, and would hope they try again so they can really enjoy what good pizza is all about. A table for 2 on a Monday night at 8:30 ran about 30 minutes. The hostess told us 30, and it took pretty much exactly 30. On the way to our table, the host took us through the kitchen to see where all the magic happens. It's nice that they do this when seating you. Also, a firetruck of firemen pulled up while we were waiting, and went straight to the back for their pizza. Pretty cool that all these guys wanted Lombardis will all the options around the city. They also let some tourists look in the truck, which was super cool of them. We sat down and got the Large for two people. It's thin crusted and I easily finished 3 slices (bf had the other 5, oyy). We got half plain, half meatball. The meatballs were fresh and flavorful, and perfect for half the pie. The fresh mozzerlla and sauce were just perfect. Perfectly oiled on top, with a perfectly balanced crunchy/chewy crust. Our waiter seemed to have the majority of the tables in the area and was still friendlly and attentive, so great job with the service. We will definitely be back, and tourist or not, you should go too! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you are looking for an intimate, quiet, romantic dinner this ain't the place. However, if you want old school NY atmosphere and decor, this is the place.  Can be loud and cramped here but the service is excellent and the black angus burger lives up to its reputation. Hard to think there is a better burger in NYC but you will pay $26 for it.  The octopus app is delicious and the wine list, which heavily favors French reds, is priced all over the spectrum. There are many good value items on it. My only gripe would be with the bone in NY strip. It is very tasty but this is not a high caliber steak and $58 seems a little pricey for it. For example, look at the type of steak the same money will buy you at a place like Del Friscos. That being said, I would return as I had a great time here and the brunch menu looked great...","[1.0, 0.0]"

Went for happy hour and dinner with friends on a Friday night. Wasn't too packed when we first showed up so we quickly got a seat.

Loved the deviled eggs and the bacon wrapped dates. Our server was fantastic!

"I am ambivalent. For the prices of the meal, I felt like there should have been bread or something plopped onto the table for us to munch on while we waited. Since there wasn't, I was forced to make conversation with my boyfriend while being extremely hungry (amazing conversation did not ensue). The food definitely took some time. He ordered the chopped pork mustard barbecue sandwich with baked beans. When I think of barbecued pork I think saucy. This sandwich didn't really do it for me. We went back and forth over whether we liked the beans, since they were not traditional baked beans. Apparently we did, cause we ate them all. I ordered the roasted chicken. As my boyfriend said, chicken is just chicken. Which kinda sums it up. The roasted mushrooms and whipped potatoes that the chicken came on was super delicious. I would have liked more of that, rather than the large amount of chicken. We ended the meal with the chocolate cheesecake. This was the best part of the meal. UGH why did we share? I HATE to share. I wanted the whole thing. It looked a little funky upon arrival, but trust, it was tasty as hell.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I wanted to love this place since I live across the street and met the chef before they officially opened, who couldn't be nicer.  He is the reason this review is not 2 stars.   I went with a group of friends last week and the food was great but the service was mediocre. Figured they just had a few glitches to iron out. Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go back just the two of us, without a reservation. The hostess had no idea what to do about walk-ins. She basically tried to turn us away completely until we asked if we could have a drink at the bar and wait for a table. The drink menu is problemo numero uno. Very limited selection of specialty drinks with ingredients you would not expect from a high end restaurant (Hennessy, flavored vodka, sour mix, you get the point). My first two wine choices were sold out (cava and sauv blanc), as well as my boyfriend's beer selection. You can tell they weren't too prepared for a busy Friday night even though they were totally booked up. I ended up with a very bad and cheap tasting Chardonnay. Next we went with sangria. It tasted like candy (way too much grenadine). I asked the bartender what was in it, as I clearly didn't like it and he responded ""I can't tell you. It's a secret recipe"".  That guy should not be behind a bar. Luckily someone else helped me out instead. Next was dinner.  We ate at a bar table and it was a disaster.  It took 30 mins for our food to come out and when it finally did, the app came out with the entree, which there was no room on the table for. The busboy made zero attempt to make room on the table and instead warns me that my plate is VERY HOT and then places it only halfway on the table, practically falling onto my lap.  The waitress/bartender forgot to take our drink order for a long time, never gave us utensil set ups, didn't take our menus after we ordered, and charged us for a drink we had already paid for prior. That said, our entrees were very good.  We might come back when it's nicer out but I really hope they come up with a more sophisticated drink menu....who knows, it may attract a whole different caliber of clientele too :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been going here since the beginning, since the very first week they opened. I have had at least 10+ visits here. At that time, they ran a really tight operation. The food was excellent, the service attentive, and the location was convenient, hip and cozy. Tim, the Maitre'D apparent informed me that it was a new venture by one of the owners of Le Barricou, an exceptional French restaurant, and one of my personal favorites a stone's throw away in Williamsburg. He claimed that they ""were better than Le Barricou"". It was a bold claim, yes, but I felt like they might actually have been able to back it up. It was to me, at least, without a doubt a 5 star yelp experience. Unfortunately since that time, it seems to have wavered in quality. One of the most frequent problems I experience here is the lack of attentive service. Most of my recent visits have started with a 20 minute wait for a drink, or even water. I get the distinct impression that there is a culture of disinterest among the staff, whom seem far more interested in socializing with each other or their friends at the bar, than actually catering to their customers.  It has the effect of making the average customer feel like they aren't part of the club. I wish I could say it was any other way, but it's an experience I've had multiple times. The french onion soup is excellent, the burgers, pasta and fish are extremely good, and the steak is pretty good, as well. The Beef Bourginon and Coq Au Vin are pretty good, but not at the level of Le Barricou. The cocktails are ok but lack the polish and imagination of nearby mainstays like Miles and Dear Bushwick. The flourless chocolate cake is on another level of excellence. I have insisted to visitors that we dine here just so it can be experienced! Over time though, the portion size has shrunken somewhat disappointingly. It still ought not to be missed though. Like other reviewers on here, I am extremely torn about this place. I desperately want it to become ""Le Barricou East"" but it seems like the requisite discipline is missing that would put it on a higher level. If they can't reach that level, it will merely be another in the long line of decent but disappointingly aloof New York City dining establishments.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My girl and I just went here last weekend based on some of these reviews for our anniversary as well. Not being a very big ""planner"" I called day of for a reservation and was told they didn't do them for less than 5 people day of, and that the dining room was booked for the night, but to ask if anyone didn't show when you arrived. We got there and they said it would be about the same wait for both rooms. I let her know that it was our anniversary so we would wait for the nicer dining room with the three course meal. B/f I was done with my glass of wine, they came over to seat us....This is a place that gets all the details right...like placing out wine glasses on a tray to bring to the table...when we sat our excellent waiter came over with a bottle of sparkling wine from Spain to congratulate us on our anniversary. When it came time to order I asked his advice on three wines i liked, and having seen the price range i was looking at, and the kind of wine, he offered another suggestion that was excellent (Can Blau 05). Then we had a spoonful of fish tartar and other little veggies, apparently to awaken our palate. My girl had the crab ravioli and I got the lobster appetizer--Get the crab, the sauce was crazy good. Then for the meal I always ask my waiter and got the pork bellies and savored every bite, tender with a sauce that made me want to lick the bowl.--Side note--we know an ave amount about food and didn't know what a couple of the things on the menu were and the staff were very courteous and warm in their explanations so I didn't feel like an idiot asking what char was.---then we opted for a cheese plate and ordered three that sounded good, and she then brought over 4 kinds so we could try another she liked on the house, and ended with her getting the chocolate mouse, and I got the cheese cake---Go with the chocolate---then i finished with a cappuccino. At the end our waiter, Mathew, even brought the label to our wine in a card along with two coffee cakes to enjoy the next morning...The entire meal was excellent, the staff amazing, friendly, and very knowledgeable. the food, great--for a four course meal, a bottle of wine, and a couple of glasses to start,  with tip it was $300 and I would gladly spend that much again.......next year (the tavern seating is cheaper)","[0.0, 1.0]"

I tried to sit catty-corner from my boyfriend at the chef's table so that I could face him, but I was asked to move back to my original seat (there was no one around us). A couple near us asked if the window could be closed because one of them was getting over the flu, the host said ""ehhh I'll ask."" It was never closed while we were there.

"Their grilled cheeses may be snobby, but their delicious and worth making the trek out to Astoria for them. They had several incredible looking options, I had trouble choosing. I ended up going with the Gouda Grilled Cheese ($10.00). It has gouda cheese, pickled jalapeños, guava jam, and black bean hummus. It may sound strange but it's amazing. It all works so well together. The guava jam adds a slight sweet taste, and the jalapeños add a slight spicy taste. The bread was perfectly crispy and cooked to perfection. It comes with a small green salad with jalapeño vinaigrette, which was surprisingly awesome. The establishment is a gastropub and features communal tables, which isn't really my thing. Thankfully they had a couple of small seats located in the window for you to sit at. Other than that, the service was really good, and friendly, and food is on point. The location isn't ideal, but I'd definitely make more trips out here to try more of their different grilled cheeses.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm torn between three stars and four stars on this one, but I'll go with three since all my star meals seem to include a few Chimays with them which unduly bias my perception of the meal.  (Hell I'd give the fat sandwiches at Rutgers 5 stars depending how much I.....nevermind)   I'm going to continue with my introduction a little bit more.....on Monday, it's half-price Chimay, so that does add considerably to my whole meal.  Belgian food to me is essentially pseudo-French food that is a little lazier in its preparation.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  The burger and the mussels are quite good here and aren't quite as heavy or complex you might expect haute cuisine to be.  My belief is that if you're going to use a little butter, what the hell, go nuts!   Good waffles here too, but figures I guess, no?

"I have to admit, when I walked up to Scarpetta (which sits on the 14th Street border of the Meatpacking District) late on a Saturday evening, part of me expected to see an H2 limo pull up and let out a gaggle of women having ""like the best night ever on Stacey's 34th birthday!"" Luckily, that was not the case. For now, the tasteful and dim lit room is calm and relatively untouched by Meatpacking District sprawl. I say ""for now"" because rave reviews, proximity to the Gansevoort, and the chill out lounge beats pumping through the speakers will soon draw in Stacey and her wobbly heeled friends. Regardless, Scarpetta fully lives up to all the recent hype. The food is absolutely incredible, and I was blown away by how simple and well executed everything was. Truffles and foie gras make appearances, yet don't come off the slightest bit heavy handed. I was never a fan of sweetbreads, but Scarpetta might have changed my opinion after having them in the excellent farfalle dish. The spaghetti is just that, spaghetti in tomato sauce with basil - incredibly simple and somehow the star of the menu. I will deduct points for the electronic elevator music, but otherwise Scarpetta is about as good as it gets.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Highly recommended when it is nice out in the spring, summer & fall months. Sit outside- the patio has a great atmosphere! My friend and I went for dinner and drinks and got a pitcher of something fruity - I don't remember what it was called, but there was red wine, limoncello & blueberries in it. That was ok but very lemon-y. For dinner, I ordered the 3 meatballs, my friend ordered a side salad, and then we split a pasta with crab meat and spicy sauce (I believe there was chile in it). The meatballs were good, but there are raisins in them and I wasn't a huge fan of that. As for the pasta - SO GOOD. It was small though (especially for $19), so if you're going to split it with someone, make sure to get something else as well. But seriously.... that pasta was well worth the price.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Does it feel like you've tried every decent brunch place New York has to offer? Does it feel like, though there is definitely a wide variety of brunch options out there, they are starting to all feel (and taste)... the same? If you answered Yes to either or both questions, I have a brunch suggestion for you - Maharlika! Maharlika is a Filipino restaurant, which offers a very unique and very delicious Filipino American fusion brunch menu. I have been here twice, once with a group of 10, and once with my BF, so this place is great for groups of all sizes. Both times I went splities on two dishes - the sizzling sisig with egg and the eggs benigno. YOU HAVE TO GET THE SISIQ.. the dish is different parts of the pig, cooked in 3 different ways, all cooked together with a raw egg, and served with a size of garlic rice. mmm. The EGGS BENIGNO was also very good..it was a Filipino twist on eggs benedict, with poached eggs, spam instead of ham, and sweet Filipino bread instead of english muffin. In addition, the meal comes with all these Filipino sides and sauces that are worth trying out with your meal... the most interesting was Banana sauce, which interestingly enough served the same function as ketchup.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I recently had a business lunch, which began with a flute of spumante (dry) to accompany the toasted bread and liver paté we nibbled on while browsing the menu. We settled on sharing a pair of appetizers. One was insalata di lenticchie, a delightful and extremely interesting lentil salad seasoned with curry, fennel and lemon -- a combination that wouldn't have occurred to me but was quite good. The second, bruschetta con il cavolo nero, bruschetta with kale, was less interesting but not less good. Standard Tuscan fare, but perfectly prepared, with a thick bed of kale atop the slices of bread, and just the right amount of good oil. The kale was a little bit salty, to compensate for a lack of sharpness attributable to unseasonably warm weather, and the whole was quite nice. The second course was arista in crosta, roast loin of pork en crust, though crust is something of a misnomer here as the wrap was moist and herby. And quite good, as was the meat, which was extremely tender. There was also creamed spinach, which was simple and tasty. The wine? Cantinetta Antinori features all of Antinori's wines, and is thus an excellent place to taste by the glass. We had Guado al Tasso, a Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend produced at Bolgheri, which was quite nice, rich and enticing of bouquet, and full, round and with nice fruit on the palate. For dessert, a simple crostata di mele, a delicately made, tasty apple pastry that went very well with a glass of Muffato della Sala, the botrytized dessert wine Antinori makes in Umbria. It's similar to Sauternes, though this vintage had more pronounced fruit and less evident botrytis than the French wines I've tasted. Quite good, however, the sort of wine you could easily spend an afternoon enjoying sip by sip. Highly recommended.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The mussels were fresh, but a bit dry...thus the four star rating. Overall, I think I'd definitely go back for more waffles (though a bit pricy), but I doubt I'll go for their all you can eat mussels again, it was just too much mussels for one sitting.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The staff were so unbelievably friendly -- from the bartender that invented a bourbon cocktail for me while I was waiting to be seated, to the host who was incredibly attentive from start to finish, to the wait staff who were knowledgable and inviting. Speaking of wait staff -- one waitress sang an short operatic interlude for the guests in the garden! And of course, what would a glowing review be without mention of the food.

"So we decided to try this restaurant after learning our favorite west side Italian for delivery had closed... This restaurant is a perfect example of one that must engage in posting false reviews, because no one in their right mind would give this place a favorable review. I typically don't go out of my way to post reviews, especially negative ones, but this one deserves a few lines (or at least it will make me feel better after the gastronomic equivalent of being mugged). At nearly $100 for delivery for 2 persons, I would expect food quality at least better than my corner pizzeria. We ordered Veal Picatta and Fettucini Alfredo with a side of spinach. What arrived was a few pieces of shoe leather swimming in a soup [literally a trough of lemony broth] and a plate of wallpaper paste garnished with sad little frozen peas. The spinach was laden with burnt garlic, so it was bitter to the point of barely edible. All in all, it was one of those meals that you actually contemplate just pitching and reaching for the cereal box. Terrible and incredibly overpriced for the, eh hem, pleasure of enduring the experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is the type of restaurant I'd love to open in the future.  It's tucked away on the corner of 2 streets with enough seats for 30, max.  It's a cozy candle-lit spot, subdued with rustic elegance reminiscent of a quaint farmhouse transported to the West Village.  Service was great, as the waitress/hostess was around just enough and very friendly. This place is apparently famous for its meatball sliders, and I can see why: each bite  results in a juicy well-seasoned explosion of beef/pork/veal, with just enough sauce to soften the bread's texture without causing it to disintegrate.  I had the largest pork chop of my life, served on the bone and cooked perfectly without any semblance of dryness, over a bed of dandelion greens and half-mashed lima beans with a delicious vinagrette to cut through all the meatiness.  We ordered one of every side: sauteed mixed mushrooms with truffle oil (as good at it sounds if you love truffles), grilled asparagus (solid), chive mashed potatoes (decent but nothing special), fries with chili aioli (scrumptious), and mexican corn taken off the cob (not as good as Papatzul or Cafe Habana, but those are hard to beat).  The halibut with pesto vinagrette was also excellent.  Desserts were beignets (really more like high-end cake munchkins than true New Orleans beignet) with raspberry jam and nutella and a root beer float (2 thumbs up just for offering this). Great date place or if you're in the mood for a delicious meal in a comfy setting, just make sure you have reservations.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In stepping into Piccoli I felt like I was back in a quaint neighborhood restaurant in Italy. Although the décor is minimal, it is charming and cozy. Our waitress, who had a smile throughout the service, started our meal off with freshly baked bread with a homemade marinara sauce. The sauce was delicious, however I would have preferred it a bit warm given the outside temperature. The menu is extensive and rich with variety. I opted for the shaved fennel salad with citrus, which was refreshing and yummy, just the right amount of dressing. My husband had the sardines, which he claimed were the best he ate in the US. We also shared the carpaccio, which we ordered seconds on. The portions are very generous, so we were pretty full by the time our risotto arrived as the main course. My husband had one with Italian sausage, both sweet and spicy making a yummy balance in the mouth. I opted for the white risotto with cauliflower and parmesan. Although the risotto was cooked to perfection, I found the taste and texture a bit bland. We also ordered the homemade ravioli, which was a hit. The meal ended on a sweet note with the strawberry panna cotta, which I requested the recipe for from the waiter. We will definitely be back with friends and family to try more of the homemade pastas and have more sardines.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The home fries were seasoned very well and we were kind of ""adventurous"" going with eggs benedict, but it didn't taste bad. The pumpkin pancakes were THE BEST! I'm actually searching frantically online for a recipe to replicate my experience at Cafe Orlin. Wish me luck! The only confusion I had at this place was that customers pretty much just seat themselves. I read somewhere else that some restaurants frown upon that, since it messes up their whole system or whatever, but Cafe Orlin is totally cool with that and it's amazing since there are four seating sections - outside, and the three inside portions. I like the inside middle section just because it's bigger and more open but to be honest that was the only area I've ever been in, so take that at its face value.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cafe Sabarsky is supposedly very authentic and true to a traditional Viennese cafe: from the brocade upholstery to the marble tables to the Michael Thonet chairs. And oh, the food as well. I thought the breakfast here was kind of pricey for what it essentially was: some cold cuts, some bread, some eggs, and some jams, but if Cafe Sabarsky is shooting for authentic, they're nailing it. I found the country bread that came with my ham a little bit too toothsome, but I suppose I've been weaned off the fluffy consistency that is Chinese bread. The brioche, however, was excellent and as was the attentiveness of the servers. I also tried the chocolate and rum cake, which was not quite as chocolatey as I was expecting but I was also informed that Austrian/German cakes are generally just dry and crumbly... Oh my goodness, what a cuisine. Probably would be a good place to come if you wanted to be all old and sniffly and read a week-old Austrian broadsheet on a weekend morning.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Call ahead, sometimes during lunch they can seat you right away. Otherwise brace yourselves for a lo-o-o-ng wait!  For dinner: about 1 hour / 1.5 , they don't take reservations.   Tip #1: If the weather is warm and you don't feel like waiting around, chances are others are not going to either.  ( Cold weather? The wait may feel a little longer then expected.) --   They have a bar with decent house warm sake, beer and the bar tender is friendly and can be creative.     The soup is what I wait in line for, it's a hug in a bowl, silky smooth and perfect with it's al dente noodles.  They roll out the specials, which my partner in crime alway likes to try, but I stick to my tried and true Akimaru (sp?).  Also, I like the little peppers, they are fun to eat because some are spicy, but can't tell which one by just looking at them.  Pork buns are popular, although they do look like they could be fun to make, I am not a fan.

So many unuasual sandwiches to choose from on the menu - I'll definitely be back. Finished off with a perfect cappaccino. My only comment is that it's a little pricey for a small lunch, but for me, well worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This will go down as one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. My entree was described as having grated yams atop the seared tuna and rice bowl. instead it came with a viscous cream of wheat like pudding atop the rice. It was one of the most vile substances I have ever tasted and the only food I'ver ever eaten that actually triggered my gag reflex. We immediately called the waitress over to let her know that these yams were not grated as the menu described, and were not edible by even the most liberal definitions of the word. She replied by saying that the restaurants policy is not to take back any items. We insisted that the entree was not as it was described on the menu, at which point we commenced the portion of our dinner wherein we engaged in a spirited debate about the precise definition of ""grated."" Now, this server was nice enough and a competent waitress, but no one would confuse her for a native english speaker. She, and the manager who arrived to investigate the fracas, insisted that these yams were grated.  It quickly became clear that they were going to stand by this poor translation.  At that point I said, ""whether or not these yams are grated , this is inedible. We'd like to get something else instead."" The manager too insisted that they could not take it back. After a bit more scuffling, we ended up ordering something else, saying ""We are not going to eat this grated yam rice bowl, so you can take it back to the kitchen. In a New York City restaurant, it would be absurd to charge us for something that was misdescribed on the menu and effectively inedible."" The manager didn't respond. When we got our bill, we were shocked to see that we had been charged ($16.50) for the misdescribed, uneaten, and inedible entree. Truly, some of the worst service I've ever received anywhere.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So yummy! Vanessa's dumpling house is a great place to go for delicious food. They have many different types of dumplings and also have a selection of buns and savory pancakes.

"Absolutely loaded.  When handed the brown paper bag with my take out Banh Mi, I was thinking ""it looks a little short.""  When I opened it up, it was fat and bursting out of the bun.  I've nearly dislocated my jaw getting my mouth around many sandwiches during my lifetime, and I've managed to get away with it unscathed.  Had I tried in this particular instance, I'd probably be in the ER right now instead of writing up this review. They do not skimp on anything here, and at $6 per sandwich, the price tag is a steal.  They load it up with meat, spiciness, cilantro, you name it and the sandwich done got it.  Most importantly, all this loaded-ness results in a hella lotta flavor.  Definitely gotta see how much more they can pack in with the $2 extra meat option. I dare say, I've found my lunch spot for the summer.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What a great place!!! If you are a seafood lover (like myself) I highly recommend taking the trip to Red Hook, Brooklyn for a clam bake. With an amazing view of the Statue of Liberty and the freedom tower on a gorgeous night.. Who can beat that?!   I ordered a piña colada it was blended perfectly and my husband had their homemade Narraganset beer. He loved it as much he ordered a pitcher! The fried calamari was ok. But their fresh oysters and clams were great and fresh. As for our main course my hubby and I ordered their famous clam bake.. King crab legs, w/ corn on the cob and coleslaw. Talk about ate like ""kings"".  The staff was very friendly and funny and knew how to take apart crab legs as my husband needed assistance. (I was too busy!) lol. I will definitely be back! Parking was great. Their is also a fairway right acids the street we parked their how they closed early on a Sunday. This place is open all year round 7 days a week. And it is busy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"As you well know, this is considered to be one of the ""best burgers"" in the city. The restaurant itself is cozy and dark - great for a bite on a winter night. There was a wait, so we put our name in and went to another bar in the interim. This was easy given the multitude of places nearby. Once we sat down, I felt obliged to sample the famous burger. The patty was large and a perfect pink medium. Then, it is topped blue cheese. I am a blue cheese girl, so it hit the spot. The shoestring fries were crispy, salty, and plentiful - an excellent addition. I opt for the Belgian presentation when it comes to eating fries, so was a little disappointed to learn that they did not have mayo. All the same, The Spotted Pig lived up to the hype!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Public has a pretty cool vibe. Actually the decor is a bit nerdy (which I love), but most people won't notice that. The whole theme is ""public spaces"" or something, according to the host. They attempt to achieve this through exposed brick, conceptual lighting that borrows from the simplicity of bare bulbs, tables and chairs that create an industrial elegance out of metal and wood, antiquated library books on shelves and a filing system circa Nixon, and even a wall of old school bronze mailboxes. If you're lucky, you can become a member and have a bottle of artisanal wine delivered monthly to your personal mailbox at Public for the price of $50/month. The door to the ladies room looks like a door into someone's home, and instead of matchbooks they provide a wall of little individually wrapped hand soaps that say ""Public."" The host was attentive, but our waiter was awful. We were seated with menus, but had to stop a bus boy to ask for water when after 8 minutes our waiter had failed to arrive. Upon arrival, our waiter simply said to us, ""So do you have any questions about the menu?"" Okay, let's take a freeze frame here. Mr. Madden, please use your special tv paintbrush and put some colorful circles around myself and the waiter, then add some dotted lines connecting us, and write ""WTF?"" above my head and draw a big ""X"" through our waiter. I've been a waitress, a bartender, and a pizza delivery girl. I try to be compassionate to members of the F&B industry, but I happen to believe that it is pretty universally accepted to greet your guests in some fashion (a simple Hello, Good evening, Yo shorty, what your name is? will suffice). Once you have broken the ice with a proper greeting, perhaps you can helpfully highlight the specials of the evening, and maybe even offer to take a drink order? I don't know. That's just me. Anyhow, our waiter couldn't be bothered. Our table consisted of a square piece of wood that could slide horizontally along a steel beam which supported a dozen other identical pieces of wood. Like the beads of an abacus, you could push them all together to make one big table, or separate them to make many smaller tables. Needless to say, our wood attachment was structurally unsound, which created a teeter totter effect between us. The waiter claimed there was nothing he could do because of how it was attached. Funny, considering that 5 minutes later the host showed up and when we mentioned it to him the table got fixed immediately. On to the food. I barely remember it, and it certainly did not atone for the abysmal service. We both had lamb, and salted chocolate mousse + strawberry shortcake for dessert which will run you $75. Everything was ""okay"" tasting, but I was expecting more. The only thing that stood out was the wine, which was gifted to us by a friend who has a private mailbox at Public. It's not the most expensive meal I've had in NYC, but it was also not very poignant from a food perspective. It's a neat concept but I doubt I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am a NYC fine dining regular and was excited to give Hearth a shot after numerous excellent reviews. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and a large, spare dining room with padded carpet strips on one wall. Hearth has a large, seemingly complicated wine list that is likely excellent by-the-bottle, but too highbrow if going by-the-glass. After plenty of consultation with our server, we opted for the autumn tasting menu with one substitution. The salad course was not remarkable, with light dressing reminiscent of Henri's Tas-tee on the pear and pecorino salad. Next came lukewarm pumpkin ravioli that was so sweet it made my teeth ache, like a too-rich dessert.  The next day I read a 2006 interview with Chef Canora, who noted the following:  ""The filling of the pumpkin tortelli that I serve at Hearth in the fall is made with Mostarda di Cremona, which is essentially a jar of radioactive-looking fruits, and store-bought amaretti cookies.""  Assuming he used the same filling here in 2009.  I certainly wish I would have seen that ahead of time. The main course of venison (again, lukewarm) was overcooked yet flavorful.  The server smartly and subtly tried to warn me off of it and I should have taken her advice. My wife substituted the duck, which was excellent and the best thing we ate that evening. The apple crisp dessert was very basic and very good. In the end, I was turned off by the coldness of the dining room and the average quality of the food, especially at those prices.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of the definite go to places for ramen. Ippudo may have the Akamaru Modern and fantastic decor, but it also comes with a higher price tag and an absolutely absurd wait for a table. Minca is small and easy to miss when walking by, so it's not a place for large parties. However, it's unpretentious and where you go for some amazing ramen on demand. Although I prefer Ippudo's glutenous and out of this world ramen, Minca is still quite comparable and I promise you, no drop of broth was left in the bowl when I finished.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My 3 previous reviews of this place have been filtered out by Yelp's obviously crude and poorly-tuned filter. I might jokingly say ""Help! I'm a prisoner in Yelp's program!""

I find this the most comfortable and enjoyable restaurant in the neighborhood, lunching there once a week on chicken in a few forms or liver or portobello (the sandwich is a very nice construction) or papardelle with either Bordeaux, Malbec or Cote de Rhone. Mussels once in a while. In almost two years, believe it or not, only a single dish (cauliflower soup) failed to please me.

My gf and I shared a lobster roll and it made me thanked God for giving me such crappy sense of direction!   I've rarely had lobster meat so tender and delicate, and the light dressing (very little mayo, lemon, and either old-bay or paprika powder) serves the lobster just right.  The lobster is accompanied by scallions and shredded lettuce that provide a nice texture and contrast. Last but not least is the pan-buttered hot-dog bun that all sandwich bread should aspire to. It's slightly toasty, buttery but not greasy.   There's really no space to stand and eat (we ate in the car), but one can down one of these rolls in just a few minutes.  I feel it's entirely worth the 14 bucks and hope to go again soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We found this place on Yelp, and had high hopes due to the good reviews. So on one weekend afternoon, we ventured all the way out to Williamsburg to have lunch here. We ordered the scallop appetizer, uni on salmon, sashimi platter, pork belly and party bomb. The quality and taste of the food that we received was not impressive. They do get some points for being creative, but it seemed that they did that at the expense of taste. The pork belly and party bomb were particularly disappointing, as those were both highly recommended items based on reviews. We were left scratching our heads as to why others gave such high ratings.   The sashimi quality is average and the cooked food was also not memorable. The portion sizes were also very small even and overall it doesn't seem that what we received was worth the price that is being charged.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am mad at myself for waiting this long to try this place, it was fantastic! To start, get the Watermelon Vodka cocktail (actually, get two, you will finish the first one so fast).

We also shared the special that day, a fish with peas and corn -- I could have eaten a bathtub full of just that. For entrees we shared the swordfish and the duck. I usually don't like swordfish because I prefer flaky white fish, but this swordfish was so tender and moist and tasted yummy with the sausage and clams. The corn emulsion was delicious, I kept poking at the bottom of my plate to try to get any last remnants on my fork. The duck with beets was perfect, I wish I could eat it again right now. The desserts were totally fine (coconut semifreddo and pistachio cheesecake), but by this time my head was swimming from the Watermelon Vodkas plus the espresso cocktail the waiter talked me into (so good!), so I am a little fuzzy on specifics =) I liked this restaurant so much that I am already trying to book my next dinner here!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I honestly couldn't have imagined that many complex flavors in a salad, prior to tasting Room Service's. Roommate had the green dumplings, which were pretty dense. We also had the pumpkin curry--delish--and the spicy basil fried rice--solid but as impressive. Oh and their dozen+ varieties of mojitos are a must; coconut's a stand-out.

"Family trip to NYC called for some good ol' home-cooked Filipino food for dinner! The menu had most of my favorite dishes growing up, so I was pretty excited. It took awhile for our group of five to vote what we were going to order. While we waited for our food, we were given homemade chicharron (fried pork rinds) with various sauces. Yum! Appetizers: Gambas (shrimp slathered in chili oil for a spicy kick), Lumpiang Barquillos (foot-long fried eggrolls), Sizzling Sisig (assortment of pork parts cooked three ways) which comes with garlic fried rice. Entrees: Ginataang Isda (giant prawns in a coconut-based base), Pancit Bihon (noodles with more giant prawns and veggies), Sinigang (sour-based soup with MORE GIANT PRAWNS, salmon, and mussels), Pata Confit (crispy pork all cut up) Dessert: Macapuno flan topped with sliced strawberries (young coconut in a creamy custard) Overall, the food was pretty amazing. We arrived super hungry, but after this dinner, we were fully satisfied! My favorite was the sinigang, and although I usually have mine with pork, I enjoyed the taste of the broth here with the seafood. Not as sour, yet full of flavor. Service was great and attentive!

"This is the second time I have eaten here and once again I ordered a citrus soda as my beverage of choice. The menu changes daily, and I had the braised pork belly as my appetizer and the steak as the entree. My girlfriend ordered the lobster, and I was able to persuade the kitchen to make her an appetizer portion of the risotto (on the entree menu). Both of our appetizers were phenomenal. With that said, my steak was decent, but I've had way better. The gf had grilled wreckfish, which was flavorful by itself. The sides it came with were rather bland though. I almost forgot to mention this, but their white and wheat homemade bread with pate and French butter is scrumptious. I'd go back just for the bread alone. Our meal was slightly over a $100 even without ordering wine or beer. The next time I go I'll just stick with ordering a couple of appetizers since both times we went the starter dishes outshone the main entrees.

"First time eating filipino food. It was really salty, but maybe it was the dish I had. I must have ordered the special, but it was a mix of pig ears, weird intestines, and eggs served in a hot skillet. I was a little sad when I saw the portion, but it was a filling amount. I was surprised. People in my party ordered a mix of things and it all looked and tasted good, the only problem was everything was a little too salty for my taste. I liked the fried pork skins that came out in the beginning, it reminded me of better tasting fried wonton skins. We sat by the kitchen, so we saw all the action. It also meant, we smelled like food when we left the restaurant. A strong delicious smell of filipino food. I didn't mind it too much, but it was almost like going to a BBQ place. I dont think I'd go back, but it wasn't bad.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went there today with two of my colleagues.

"This place appears to have some mixed reviews; and I'd venture to guess, having been here multiple times, that I know why. It's rather inconsistent. At certain times you go in and have the meal of a lifetime, (which is probably far too dramatic a statement) whereas other times you go in and during a shift change in which the cleaning crew appears to be manning the culinary helm. Even so, the cleaning crew doesn't do too bad a job and at this place's worst its a three star establishment. At its best it gets all five from me. I generally have the #11 (the name of which escapes me). It contains beef, egg, and of course, a veritable bounty of noodles. If you come when thsi place is on and order the aforementioned dish, you'll be likely awed. If you don't, you'll still have a good meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We read all the positive reviews and decided to celebrate an important ocassion by dining here. Word cozy kept coming up in the reviews and I thought, I like cozy! And then we entered the restaurant and I was shocked to see that a restaurant business could be started in a horribly cramped up space like that. Then the waiter ushered us to ""our table"" and my jaw dropped. There was one tall table, in the middle of the hustle bustle, with tall and very small rotating stools (no back support) and 6 other people already occupying the 3 other sides of the table. We still tried our best to sit down with our legs touching others and our every movement disturbing their meal and vice versa. Sharing tables to that extent, with the servers touching your back every time they move behind you to serve the dishes - I was put off that very moment.   Suddenly a wooden plank for 2 was vacated - We requested to be reseated there - the waitress politely told us that the plank was being transformed into a plank of 3 (Are yo ukidding me!) We did go on to try the so raved about dishes like watermelon salad, lychee martini and shrimp but nothing was really out of this world. It was different but not heavely different to be paying 70 bucks for 3 small Tapas dishes and sitting toe to toe with 6 complete strangers. Servers were friendly overall but frankly speaking I could not enjoy my meal because of the ""coziness"" of this place. We ended up leaving completely disappointed, with our appetite still raving, and went to a different restaurant where we had the ""luxury"" of getting our own table and ate that celebration dinner. I will never go back  but my advice to Mehta - You are earning 100 bucks per couple - Pls rent a bigger space!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been ordering delivery from here and occassionally enjoying a meal on the back patio for years now.  I really don't understand the reviews saying that the food is just ok.  I mean, you understand that paninis are just grilled sandwiches, right?  You can't really complain about that.  If you came in thinking you ordered a steak and were served a grilled sandwich, ok.  Otherwise quick nit-picking!  Yes, they're just paninis, but they're delicious paninis!!!   My favorites are the Mozarella Tomato Basil Pesto and the Mushroom, Scrambled Egg and Tuffle Aoli paninis.  But pretty much every single one I've tried has been great in it's own way.  The salads here are good too, almost all of them I've ordered have been served with a pile of pecorino on top (always ok in my book!). Whenever they have tomato soup we always order that as well.  It's creamy and perfect and served with a big slice of the panini bread slathered in pesto.  How can you complain about that?! I will say that over the years they have gotten slower with delivery and now there's always a wait if we decide to eat there; it's just too popular!  And I can see what people are saying about the waitstaff.  But at the end of the day they're just a bunch of hipsters from the neighborhood reveling in their super cool hipster job and sometimes not focusing enough on actual customer service.  It won't keep me away from the yummy food though!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Eataly reminds me of visiting Time Square: crowded, overprices, and full of tourists. Sure, they have imported products that may not be so available at other stores, but gosh are they overpriced. I once came here in the spring looking for ramps and they charged $4 FOR ONE RAMP. You can buy seeds and grow a whole lot of ramps in a garden for that price (except you kind of can't if you life in NY, but hypothetically) Everything else is also overpriced and unless you are looking for a specific imported product, you can find it else where. Probably somewhere without people posing along side produce.. I have eaten here twice: once in the pasta section and once in the vegetable sections.

"As a carnivore, I avoid vegan places like the plague. However my curiosity got the best of me. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. It wasn't too spicy. The sandwich was a sizable square flat-bread with tomato, lettuce and a vegetarian chicken patty dipped in buffalo sauce. The patty was similar in texture to a Chinese vegetable and minced meat bun (choy yok bao), but with buffalo sauce. I was pleasantly surprised that my veggie sandwich didn't suck. It was sizable and packed 500 calories with 30 grams of protein. On my second visit (Fair Disclosure: this meal was entirely comped by Terri due to my review of its buffalo sandwich above), I had the following: Meatball sub- was a sizable square flat-bread with 4-5 ""meatballs"" and ""cheese"". I was amazed by how much this sandwich tasted like real meat. The ""meatballs"" don't have the exact texture and flavor of a real meatball, but it's close enough to fool this carnivore's taste buds. The vegan cheese was also close enough to the real thing. (550 calories and 38 grams of protein.) Ginger Lemonade- If you only like very sweet lemonade loaded with sugar, this is not the lemonade for you. It's a bit sour and the ginger gives this lemonade an extra kick. A bit pricy at about $3 a bottle, but not outrageous. It's organic and doesn't contain chemicals that I can't pronounce. Overall, I like the place. It wouldn't be my go-to lunch spot. But I'm definitely coming here for Lent and any holidays where I have to give up meat.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Totally wrong, I've officially given up on getting good tacos in the city. I guess I'm going to have to resort to going out to the reliably good places I know in bk and queens if I want good mexican.

I always get the mango chicken, it's amazing!  The chicken nuggets (an appetizer) are also pretty good, but I'm not too impressed with their sweet and sour chicken (the sauce just isn't sweet or sour enough). The service is great, too.  I always call ahead and pick it up since I live around the corner.  The food is always ready and waiting on time, but also always hot and fresh when I get home and open it all up.  Ugh, I am salivating just thinking of this place.  Also, the woman on the phone/at the register is very sweet- she's even starting giving me back even change on the lunch specials (which come to like 7.05 or something but she always charges me 7; for a very very broke person this is very very nice!).","[0.0, 1.0]"

One problem though, there was a highway in between the restaurant and the river making us converse by screaming over the noisy traffic !own below. Food: Bread: I never review on the bread but this one is A-frigging-mazing. There's sea salt on the bread! Probably the best part of the whole meal. Appetizer: Salmon Tartar - came with a side of potato chips. It was a bit too fishy and bland for my taste. My friend got the bruschetta, she loved it. It had a creamy cheesy (?) filling in between the veggies and the bread. Main Course: They ran out of branzino, so they replaced my dish with salmon. Salmon was bland. I like the crispy skin though. My friend had poached chicken (bland), with squid ink (too salty) and quinoa. Meh. Dessert: Beignet (Deep Fried Dough) : Nice and hot with side of raspberry jam Peaches and Cream: Vanilla Ice cream with Peaches and Nuts. Awesome. Overall: Everything was pretty much bland.

"We went for the pig's head.  Turns out, they only make 1 per day, and someone had ordered it before we got there.  Would have been nice if they mentioned that on their website, or on the menu. We decided to stick around anyway and got several items. Broccoli rabe - it tasted like floor cleaner.  Far too astringent.  The parmesan cream on the bottom was tasty, however. Lamb pate - Mint jelly sauce was a nice touch but it was overly salty.  Not the worst thing I had but it was mediocre for what it was. Bone marrow - easily the best thing we had.  Sadly there wasn't a lot of it.  But it was very very tasty.   Lamb shoulder for two - this, however, was the worst thing we had.  I was very excited for it as everything had been kind of meh to that point.  It was completely overcooked - I like my lamb rare to medium rare and this thing was well-done, tough and quite dry.  They also didn't deliver our dish with the sauce it so desperately needed, and we had to wait a good 10 minutes before it came after we requested it, so by the time we tucked back into the lamb with the sauce it was cold and even dryer.  I was very disappointed as this was the most expensive thing we ordered and it was awful. The other thing that my date did not mention to me until after we had left is that in the yard area, there is a small garden growing behind the tables, and there were mice constantly running back and forth across it as we ate.  That's seriously disgusting, as the mice obviously can easily get into the restaurant from there and into the kitchen.  For what we ended up paying (over $140) the meal was absolutely not worth it and the ambiance sucked.  I almost fell off the bench I was sitting on several times because they are wobbly and parked on top of uneven cobblestones.  I will definitely not be returning, even for the pig's head.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm glad the food was great, because the service last night was awful!!  the bartenders were incredibly rude! we even overheard them talking about how much they don't like their clientele.  I'm sorry, but when five customers are buying drinks, appetizers and dinner spending that much money I'd expect at least some form of a smile or signal that he's happy to be serving us, even if he has to fake a smile!  the terrible service just continued on and on.  he made it seem like we were bothering him the whole time, when we would order something else he would slam the new updated receipt in a rocks glass in front of us.  we ended up moving down a few seats to huddle up in the corner for better conversation, leaving a couple of empty glasses and our bar tab glasses to our left. the other bartender then came over and rudely said ""what is all this shit??"" really loud right in front of us, I was appalled.  after our bartender saw that we noticed, he started acting a little nicer (finally)! but it really shouldn't have taken that interaction to get better service. honestly, the food was great (and it came out insanely fast).  however, when three of us ladies ordered dinner entrees, he quickly turned to put the order in without asking the two gentlemen with us what they wanted, therefore making their dinners come out after the three of us had almost finished our meals. another strike. It may seem like I'm tough to please or am being too critical, but it was seriously terrible service.  all five of us are either in the service industry (some with restaurant management experience) or have been in the past. I know that makes us a little tougher of critics, but it was obvious that this place's service was piss poor.  even watching their interactions with other customers was sad.  though the food makes you want to come back for more, the service scares me away.  the interactions with the rest of the staff was stellar, even as simple as the servers moving out of the way when we were walking through to the restrooms or exit, they were all really friendly and polite.  I feel bad that the bar service gave them such a bad name for my party and I.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Holy cow. Go here hungry. No, go here starving. No. Go here starving, with 9 starving friends. Order one dish, and you'll be set. I'm not kidding, this place is like your sweet little grandmother, who's always telling you, ""Eat! You're too skinny!"", and constantly shoving heaping platters of food your way. Oh yeah - if you're hoping to get a table, make reservations early. We wandered into the restaurant on Easter Sunday, and were told that reservations were full, walk-ins were no longer being taken, and the only availability was either at the large bar downstairs, or the smaller one upstairs - IF you could find seating. Not to be deterred, we trekked upstairs and were lucky enough to score a small booth off the bar area, which the wait staff promptly converted into an actual eating space for us. Drinks and bread appeared immediately, and we set to deciphering the menu (while trying to ignore the sky-high prices next to the food items). Our waiter/the bartender came over to ask us if we had any questions. No, my husband replied, and tried to order the calamari. He looked at us a beat, then said, ""That MAY be too much food."" My husband started to object (he was set on the calamari), but the bartender continued, ""It's 2 pounds of calamari!"" Hubby's mouth snaps shut, and he turns to me, his eyes wide. *I* certainly did not want to eat 1 pound of calamari! Luckily, the bartender was ready with a suggestion, which was delicious. We ended up getting the baked clams, and I had to stop myself from licking the plate clean. They were so good! For our ""entrée"", we chose the special of the day, which was basically a pasta sampler. Four different pastas between the two of us...no problem, right? Our waiter comes back around with a plate that's as big as a scooter. I'm thinking, ""Wow, one of the tables of 6 or more people have a good dish coming their way!"" Then, he stops at our makeshift booth. Now I'm thinking, ""Surely he has the wrong table."" Then he sets the behemoth down in front of us and smiles at me. I wanted to cry. Piled high on this platter is mounds and mounds and MOUNDS of pasta. Lasagna that's taller than some toddlers; enough ravioli to build a house; manicotti the length of my arm and a pile of Bolognese rounded out the dish. That sweet little man plopped that huge platter down in front of us, then went to grab plates. He came back and started to serve us, giving us a ""small tasting"" of each of the pasta items. ""Small tasting"" in this case is basically a regular meal. ""Small tasting"" in this case also accounts for food enough for two people for a week left on the plate in front of you, waiting to be eaten. The food was everything I hoped it'd be. My favorite by far was the Bolognese. It was the only thing I went back for, again and again. The lasagna was good, but took a little work to eat (seriously - I had to knock the slice over and attack it as it lay there, helpless). The manicotti was also tasty, but a little too rich for me at that point. The ravioli was so good, but again, a bit rich. But the Bolognese - spicy and saucy and...man, now my mouth is watering! It certainly isn't the cheapest place you can dine, but the quality of the food and the service definitely make the final bill worth it. That, and the amount of food.

I went in for dinner, and the host said it'll be 45 minutes to an hour, so he took our name and number and said they'll text us when our table is ready, but in the meantime we can roam around the area. So my friend decided we'd check out the area and walked many blocks away in about ten minutes, when we got a text that our table was ready. Yes, I'm glad our table was ready much quicker than expected, but we had to sprint back for our lives in order to not lose our place to somebody next on line. We were sat a table so close to the party next to us that I was rubbing thighs with a stranger. But the whole place is cramped, so what can ya do? Can't really complain about that I s'pose. However, our table was set up improperly.. while all the other tables had a nice set up and candle, we didn't and had to ask for ours to be set up again. Then we waited 15 minutes for water. Then our biscuits came out, and we had to ask for the strawberry jam that took another 10 minutes. We ordered our food. Two parties came in and sat after us. We waited about 40 minutes for our food, while the other 2 parties got their food before us and were well on their way to finished. It's not like our waitress was purposely taking long for us because we were mean patrons, because in fact, my friend and I were still very friendly to her and didn't complain about how the 2 parties got their food before us. The food was great.. the pancakes were DELICIOUS but it was a limited time dish. I wasn't a fan of the sauteed spinach we got, but the sweet potato fries & buttermilk fried chicken were great. The biscuits with strawberry jam were awesome too. I'd come back for the pancakes for sure, but since they don't serve those pancakes anymore, and the service sucks, I don't think the rest of the food is worth the trouble.","[1.0, 0.0]"

This place is absolutely wonderful. We had some time to get dinner before a concert at the Bowery and Yelped a restaurant nearby and found this place. The portions are filling and delicious and decently priced. Happy hour is a good deal. A great place for dinner or some appetizers and a bottle of wine. The staff is friendly and attentive. Came back a second time and was not disappointed! The interior is dark and romantic and there is a small lounge area in the back to sit if you are with a larger group of people.

"The rustic touch on Grimaldi's pizza shows their style of pizza is up to par with pizza from Italy. The thin crust on Grimaldi's pizza is light and crisp and leaves me craving more all the way here in California. For 3 people, we ordered 1 small white with basil and 1 large regular with mushrooms onions and sausage. This was more than enough to overstuff our bellies and crawling back to Manhattan. The use of fresh mozzarella on the white pizza and large rough cut mushrooms shows that they use very fresh ingredients for their pizza. Simply put it, Grimaldi's is the BEST pizza in NYC - Brooklyn.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I, too, was really looking forward to this place opening. I've been watching weekly as it's been constructed. Unfortunately, they really haven't figured things out yet. I did not eat here, but i tried to--it's confusing - who's waiting, who's looking, no one offers to help or welcome you. The bar is packed, and even with all the windows open, incredibly hot.  I was hoping this would be a cool place for the kids, but it's just too expensive for a family of 4 to dine here, $48 for king crab legs?!!   We went back a second time, hoping for just a drink at the bar, maybe a cool breeze by the open windows at night, NOPE, still baking hot in there after 9pm.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's rare that one finds one's self in the position to review a restaurant at which one hasn't actually dined.  And yet, there are the times when a restaurant adopts a policy so offensive that one doesn't actually ever wish to dine at that establishment. I've had many hamburgers at ridiculous price points.  I've paid crazy amounts for cocktails, scenery, famous chefs, etc..  Point being, I'm a New York foodie who wants to give you my money in exchange for a great dining experience. But. Customer service is equally as important.  Today I called Minetta Tavern's reservation line to reserve a table for my design firm's holiday dinner on Wednesday, December 1st.  I didn't mention it was a company dinner--after all, it's only five people.  We're a small group, it didn't seem necessary. The group wanted to dine at 7pm.  I requested a table for five at 7pm, 28 days in advance.  (Their reservation policy limits advance reservations to 30 days in advance.)   I was told that parties of 5 and over were only allowed to reserve tables at 5:30, 6:00, or 9:00pm. EXCUSE ME????? This policy is not mentioned anywhere on the website.  In my years dining in New York restaurants, it is also the first time I've encountered such a policy.  I've put up with the ridiculous labyrinth of phone calls and confirmations many upscale restaurants.  I will continue to put up with other small annoyances that are just par for the course in a city where demand exceeds supply. This policy, however, exceeds my tolerance. Should I have mentioned the corporate card?  The fact that I'm even wondering this tells me that, regardless of how great their gourmet burger is, my money is better spent at any other place.  I will never dine at Minetta Tavern if I can avoid it.  And in a city of great restaurants, that shouldn't be hard.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I wanted to get some grade A, professional photos for my Tinder profile, because the one I have now where I'm petting my orange tabby, Mr. Snugglesworth, gives off an evil genius, I plan to take over the world vibe. When I got there, I had that delicious, delicious mashed sesame sauce dripping down my face. You know what these cats at Tinder Headshots did? They wiped it off my chin. They made me look like a presentable human being. Crazy, right? Did I mention the tasteful cardigan I had on was DRENCHED in that awe inspiring mashed sesame sauce? I wanted to keep it on during the photo shoot and just suck on the collar between set ups. THEY WERE HAVING NONE OF THAT.

"I just can't get excited about this place no matter how many times I get their food.  They're great to order from late at night.  After a certain time this is the only place I know of in astoria that's open and will make you a decent meal that doesn't taste like it was made 2 weeks ago and then frozen. But it does often taste like it was made 1 or two DAYS ago and then frozen, which is better than other late night places, but still not great.  I ordered a salmon there once and it was bad.  Tried again a few months later to see if that was a fluke.  It was just as bad.  So never getting seafood from here again.  Their salads are nice, but they are never really mixed all that well.  You'll get your salad with like a HUGE half a chicken cut in only 3 large pieces.  So you have to take out your knife, cut up the chicken and then toss the salad around a bit just to get all the flavors & ingredients into most of your bites.  Cutting up your meat is fine in an entree, but in a salad it really sucks because you end up having to toss your own salad just to make sure you don't have a bite of chicken and then a seperate bite of leaves. And the salad doesn't always seem that fresh- but its better than local diners. Generally I only go here when my other options have closed for the night and my only options are this or diners in the area.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Nice portion of greens sautéed in garlic.  Could use lesser oil. Adorable decor ... including the cute pig stubs,  vegetable posters and other curios.

"Took wife over at La Sirene to celebrate our first anniversary on one of the coldest Saturday night, and to add salt to the wound it was the night that NYC got its first biggest snow storm of 2013. I had made reservation ahead of time, and knowing how difficult it would be to travel, we arrived at the restaurant way earlier than planed. We were the first customers to show up at their door steps when the waiters and chiefs were still quietly chatting near the counter. La Sirene was not a spacious restaurant, but cozy, heart warming, and the settings held promise for a night of great dinner and intimacy. Once we were seated, our waitress brought over the menus and also one of the biggest disappointment of the night: they don't serve alcohol. French food with no wine paring! That was like peanut butter without jelly. ""You must had been informed over the phone while making the reservation and we also allow you to bring your own wine at no extra charge. But worry not, there is a liquor store not far from us where you can order over the phone and they deliver for free"", so said the waitress in such a casual way that made me wanted to roll my eyes at her. I wasn't informed, I called the restaurant when I first made the reservation and confirmed with the staffs the day before dinning and both times no one mentioned about not servicing alcohol. And worse I had to confirm with them over the phone to make sure they indeed don't accept credit card. Like the lack of alcohol, this was an inconvenience caused by the restaurant, at least the staffs should have the courtesy to inform the customers. For the night we kicked off with French onion soup, foie gras,escargots, baby octopus. The onion soup was rich and flavorful and we enjoyed it, but the bread topping beneath the cheese was too soggy. At every French restaurant I always order the foie gras. By far this version done by La Sirene was the most fattest ones that I ever tasted. My wife didn't enjoy it as much as I did, as I happily spread layers of the ""light brown stuff"" on my toasts and munched away. As for the escargots, this was our first opportunity tasting the giant snails and we were not very impressed with the taste. Being both Chinese, eating exotic foods weren't foreign to us, especial when it was associated with shells. The escargots were tender, soaked with butter and an emerald green garlic sauce. But the flavor was missing. It was like a piece of gum that had long lost its flavor after chewing it so long. The baby octopus was grilled right, tender, flavorful; the way I loved it. As for the entrees, we had a filet mignon and the oven baked seafood, which many reviewers on Yelp mistakenly thought it was the shepherd pie. I would boldly say the fillet mignon had the worse presentation that I ever encountered in a dish served in a restaurant. On appearance, it was a dark brown medallion of grilled-looking burger, topped with a thick brown slice of foie gras, all drenched in a thick layer of dark brown sauce. The whole thing made me thought a dog had pooped on my plate. But of course you couldn't judge a dish by its appearance alone. Despite its awful look, the filet was cooked perfect, medium rare. To add icing to the cake, the combination of the chilled foie gras was mind blowing awesome. It well complemented the meat and added an even richer taste to the dish. If you are a meat lover this was a must. However, the complaint I had was associated with the heavy use of salt. I would normally call myself a salt lover, but this dish even surpassed my level of tolerance. The baked seafood was sadly mediocre, as all of the ingredients were stuffed together under a thick layer of cheese. It tasted blend and boring as if all the flavor and salt went to the filet, where the seafoods appeared to be like rubber. The whole experience made me wondered how could the two dishes be so unbalanced in terms of quality. As for dessert, we had the banana brulee. It was funny and misleading as the menu specifically said this was a banana pudding and not a creme brulee. Really? I beg different, as at its heart, it was the same custard top layer fired crunchy with alteration of banana slices, crackers and pudding as filling. Who were you trying to fool? The dessert at best was average, nothing noticeable. La Sirene was a small, cozy, and intimate place for a date on good settings and decorations. However, if you are looking for great french food, then this will not be a place suitable for you, at it lacked both on presentation and flavor.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Good thing we only waited about 10 minutes for our table of four (it was a Thursday at around 6:30). Not long after we ordered, there was a long line outside. I had the Truffle Burger. To give you a general idea of just how greasy this burger was, think - the oil of five Shake Shack burgers squeezed into this one Umami Burger. (Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a tad but I think you get the picture). We also ordered the truffle fries, cheesy tots (not on the menu) and the smashed potatoes. CARBS GALORE! Truffle fries were good. Cheesy tots were okay but it only comes with eight dinky pieces so it wasn't really worth it. The smashed potato is literally just a smashed potato. Flavorless and looks like somebody sat on it.

"We were a party of 8 searching for a restaurant in the theatre district that would take a rersevation on a Saturday night on 2 weeks notice for 6pm.   Based upon some reviews that we read on Yelp we decided to give this restaurant a shot.   Not only did they seat us upstairs in a nice room with hardwood floors, the service was very attentive and we were made to feel very comfortable throughout the meal.   We strongly recommend their chicken with portobello mushrooms serviced in a brown sauce, their grilled salmon, and the veal trattoria (there signature dish), was also very good  .For starters, you got to try their salad that comes with the walnuts,  cheese, red lettuce and a delicious vinegaurette dressing.   For the money, great ambiance and a terrific value.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I initially really liked the interior of this place upon arriving and the menu seemed unique and to have a lot of options.  Unfortunately, the food was not very good and the waitress seemed irritated and unhappy from the start.   We had the kale and calamari salad.  The calamari was flavorless and not grilled quite enough.  The kale salad was dry and bland. I ordered the Baja Fish tacos.  When the dish arrived, I initially thought they sent me the wrong item.  The fish was battered and fried in a hard fish and chips batter and it was served in one of those hard taco bowls like you see on those infomercials for making your own tortilla bowls.  When the waitress asked right away how we liked everything I told her that the dish wasn't what I expected.  And she sort of condescendingly told me that Baja fish tacos are fried.  It wasn't the fried fish I had a problem with, but the many times I've had baja fish tacos they are NOT covered in a hard, fish and chips batter and they are placed in a nice soft tortilla, not a hard tortilla bowl.  The description in the menu said nothing about this.  I have never sent food back but I actually sent it back because I really couldn't eat it.  The waitress seemed annoyed by the request. On the upside, my friend ordered the whole trout which I thought was very good.  The grilled asparagus was pretty good. The waitress brought the check as soon as we received our dessert without us asking for it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I recently went here with a friend for an early Friday night dinner. The food was very good but I will not go back due to how they rushed us out. We were not lingering and in fact my friend had not even put the last spoonful of dessert in her mouth before the plate was swept away and there was someone (they use rotating wait staff so you don't have a 'waiter/waitress' per se) asking us if we wanted anything else. We said no and asked for the check and paid it promptly. We were finishing our drinks (and I mean it was 3 mins after we paid) and another wait person came by and asked in a rude tone if wanted anything else. At that point we left.

"A guide to a successful Mamoun's trip: 1)Get shit-faced. Preferably in the Macdougal St. vicinity, but to each its own. 2)Find Mamoun's (look for the line out the door.)

Plus, at this point, you don't need choices to confuse your alcohol addled mind; there are only two possible options: a falafel, sans tomatoes if you're me($2) OR shwarma + falafel sandwich ($4)   4)Place your order, pay for it with the same crumpled bills you use to tip your bartender, and thank the man who chose to have pity on your drunk ass and feed you. 5)Step to the left, drown it in extra hot sauce and tahini, then grab a fistful of napkins. 6)Proceed to nearest street corner/park bench and EAT. 7)Release a nice-sized burp, then head back to the bar in time for last call.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In my opinion the #1 place for sushi in NYC. The neutral tones of the decor were soothing. The sushi was incredibly fresh and served in well-prepared bite sized pieces (unlike the gargantuan slabs of seameat a la Tomoe or Japonica). The aspect that separates Sushi Yasuda from other places is the attention to detail. Though portions were small, the food were exquisite (down to the soda I ordered, which came in a little teacup - too cute to hate on). Even the green tea mochi for dessert was creatively arranged in a way that was so simple and zen-like that it became a conversation piece.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If you are looking for traditional New York pizza then don't go to Patzerias but if you are looking for a face full of great flavor then beat a path to their door right now. Don't bother getting suited and booted, this is a real hole in the wall with a couple of stools against a counter but you will get a warm welcome from the cheerful chaps serving. Top of the heap for me was the tomato, basil and garlic slice. As it hit the plate it smelled good, in the mouth it was a sheer fresh-tasting delight, and even though the base looked a little thicker than I usually like it was crisp and delicious and worked better with the simple topping than a thinner base would have. The pepperoni and Italian sausage had a lot to live up to and it did a valiant job with plenty of good quality toppings but it will be the tomato, basil and garlic pizza that I will go back for.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We happened upon Isabella's on accident, but it ended up being a happy accident. We stopped by for brunch after spending the morning walking through Central Park, so we were a bit hungry. Luckily Isabella's believes in serving complimentary bread - in this case, it was corn bread and lemon poppy seed poundcake - as a starter. More restaurants should make this a standard practice. We both ordered omelets, and while we enjoyed them, the flavors weren't anything out of the ordinary: goat cheese and tomato, mushroom and herb. The meal was pleasant, and the restaurant wasn't too crowded, so we didn't feel rushed. We would certainly stop back if we were in the area; however with so many other great brunch spots in Manhattan, we wouldn't necessarily go out of our way to try it again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've eaten from Empanada Mama twice (once eat-in and once take-out) and both times there were some good things and some bad things. I've tried the Cubana arepa, chicken tamale, Greek spinach pie empanada, the Brasil empanada, and the avocado salad. The Cubana arepa was decent. The filling was a bit dry and the cheese didn't go with the whole dish, but the arepa itself was delicious. The chicken tamale was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and there was a perfect balance of peas, potatoes, and onion. The Greek spinach pie empanada was aright. It had a wheat crust and was baked, so it was a little dry. In all honesty, if you're going to eat an empanada, get a real, fried empanada. The Brasil empanada was so much better. The ground beef paired really well with the olives and there weren't too many potato pieces. The avocado salad was pretty bad. I ordered it as a take-out item (my dad had previously gotten it as an eat-in item and said it was excellent) so I think it may have been better had I eaten it there. There was no cilantro and very little scallion and tomato. It was pretty much a bowl of iceberg lettuce and avocado. They were generous with the avocado (two whole avocados for one salad) and the cumin dressing was EXCELLENT! I've also had their tostones and plantain chips. The tostones were a bit dry by the time I got them home, but the plantain chips were so good! Most dishes also come with red and green salsa, both of which are fresh and delicious. The most recent time I was there, we were given this sour cream avocado thing which was also very good. Overall, if you go, get the tamales, They are so delicious. Also be sure to sample the FRIED empanadas and any and all dips your meal comes with. Eating in is a bit cramped (this place is always crowded), but I feel the experience is much better there than getting take-out, where there is time for everything to get cold and dry out.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This was the best dinner I've had in a while and that's saying a lot as I dine out so frequently.   The decor was gorgeous!  You walk in and immediately you feel the warmth.  You see the cozy bar area first and it was just the cutest thing.  I loved the design and the handsome bartender in suspenders.  As you are walked in, you walk into a room that was so chic and well thought out. The best part is the back room, though!! It has a fireplace and a retractable roof for when summer hits.  I can't WAIT to come back when the weather warms up. The food was on point.  We ordered the pork belly tapas and the Spanish goat cheese one.  Both were fantastic.  Then we had the bacalao con pulpo and and the braised lamb shank pasta as our entrees.  Both were extremely delicious.  Ended the night with a nice port and their dessert cocktail. Let's just say this is my new favorite date spot but as I looked around the room the seating was also perfect for friends who came to catch up.  Nice touch, Salinas.   Beautiful decor, excellent food and even better service.  The owner came over towards the end of our meal to check on us and I always appreciate when they take the time to say hello!  It's those gestures that make us feel welcome and confident in our choice of restaurant. See you soon, Salinas!","[1.0, 0.0]"

However, a line around the block says something about the restaurant.  If you come here you HAVE to get the gnudi.  Trust me, you will be in heaven.  Roquefort burger and rosemary garlic shoestring fries are also amazing.  I will be back when I can figure out what time is easiest to get a table.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My second visit to Balthazar was just as convincing as the first. This is definitely as quintissential a New York restaurant as there is. Rarely do places that get this much press live up to the hype but Balthazar consistently hits on all cylinders. Sure, it is overrun by tourists and constantly packed to the gills but the food, atmosphere, and service are worth walking through the crowds and  rubbing elbows (literally) with the next table. No matter which meal you go for- brunch, lunch, or dinner Balthazar will deliver a terrific experience. On my most recent visit, I arrived promptly at 6pm on a frigid Saturday night right when they opened, hoping to avoid the crowds. Obviously, to no avail. However, after a quick 10 minute wait they lodged me into one of their round corner tables off to the right which is set aside for walk ins. The food items ordered included: Butternut squash and ricotta agnolotti with pumpkin seeds and gremolata ($20)- For a French spot, they executed this pasta dish very well and made this Italian guy very happy. The agnolotti were perfectly al dente with the proper filling to pasta ratio. You could actually taste the butternut squash in the filling, which tends to get lost in other places. Pumplin seeds added a nice crunch, while the gremolata brightened it up with an herbacious flavor. Only bad thing I can say is they dont offer extra parmigiano to sprinkle on top. Most Italian restaurants do this. ALL restaurants should do this, while most do not. At $20 for 5 agnolotti the price is definitely steep. But then again, you should know this coming in. Braised short ribs with cippolini onions, carrots, and garlic mashed potatoes- This is the Saturday night special and wow is it incredible. Simple, homey, textbook French, and just what I wanted on this cold night. The fatty ribs were braised to gelatinous perfection sitting in a pool of port wine jus, surrounded by onions and carrots and garlicy whipped potatoes of my dreams. Like a pot roast elevated to the highest degree of execution. A satisfying portion too. Side of onion rings- They don't have a section for sides, but they will let you order anything listed on the menu (gotta love that service). WOW. That's all I can say. One of the best onion rings around. Absolutely wonderful- perfect batter somewhere between tempura and beer batter, crispy but no trace of grease, and the onion and batter stay together when biting into it. All you need is some ketchup. These are the side that should get all the press instead of the much talked about french fries. Profiteroles for dessert were a nice sweet ending. I'm not as enthused with their desserts as I am their food, but when you put vanilla ice cream between cream puffs and drizzle it with warm chocolate sauce I am liking it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Service is atrocious. Food is not bad, but a good portion of the dining out experience is the service. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, and I understand a new/inexperienced server will be running around like a chicken with its head cut off, but when you look around and see other tables seated after you being serviced first and more attentively, and you constantly need to call out to the server and remind the server to bring items to the table, it gets annoying after the third time. For crying out loud, this is not a large restaurant! I get better service at the truck! You ever get that feeling after you sit down, wait a bit, ask for water, then wonder if you should leave after what feels like 20 minutes of no one wanting to take your order? That's here.

"My dinner at Vitae was nothing short of exquisite. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his graduation and decided to go all out and ordered the chef's tasting menu. We were not disappointed. Each dish was a celebration of the senses. We enjoyed ceviche, scallops, three different pasta dishes, lamb and sea bass. To top it all off, I had a chocolate soufflé, which was served with espresso and cream on the side. The chef suggested I break open the soufflé and pour the hot beverage into it, and so I did. This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It actually made me want to cry! How often does food make you emotional?? The service was also excellent -- attentive, courteous but not overbearing. We were served dessert wine on the house, too! I cannot say enough about this wonderful new gem in Midtown. I plan to return regularly and am looking forward to sharing this find with friends and family. I wish the owner/chef all the best in this new endeavor. I expect it to be a huge success!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here for free brunch for their first anniversary.  Even though it was a long wait -  an hour and a half outside the restaurant and over an hour to get our food, it was definitely worth it.  The kitchen was exposed with a wood brick pizza oven.  The Bibb lettuce salad was alright, but i would have preferred the lettuce to be bite sized.  The artichoke and smoked panchetta pizza was interesting with slices of artichoke on top.  The bacon egg and cheese pizza was a real winner with a topping of eggs over easy.  It was the most unusual and one of the most delicious pizzas I've ever had.  They were thin crust pizzas where the dough was crispy yet chewy.  Ask for the bottle of olive oil to drizzle on top.  Next time I would try the Nutella Cazone which looked absolutely amazing - football shaped with nutella drizzle and the gelato which is from il laboratorio del gelato.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"While the pancakes and biscuits are phenomenal, I have found the rest of the menu at Clinton Street Baking Company to be completely underwhelming. Their egg dishes are rather tough, the food is generally rather bland, and if you have ever stopped by, you will know that the restaurant cannot accommodate the combo of tourists and locals that stop here, so wait times are enormous. We came in at 9:30pm one night and waited 2 hours for a table that they told us would be 40 minutes. If you really need amazing pancakes, this is the place to go. I just don't find the $15 price tag and 1.5 hour wait to be worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Yes I live in Chicago....but I never stop telling anyone who will listen about Risotteria. Came here 2 years ago on a date (who truly appreciates my gluten free lifestyle) and have been back 4 more times. Its a small intimate space with only seating for about 35 people. Totally worth the wait of several hours since the neighborhood is great just to walk around. Obviously the risotto was scrumptious but the gluten free breadsticks (which I could eat about 10 if I was allowed) and the gf pizza crust is my favorite. I have purchased several packages of the breadstick mix and turn out great at home as well. I am still trying to find something as flavorful and sooo gluten free friendly in the Windy City. I'll let you know if I ever do...,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"The ambience here is lovely. Beautiful decor for a swanky drink. Unfortunately that's where most of the fun ends. I came years prior and remember being very impressed by how beautiful the place was and how attentive the staff was. We sat and ordered drinks in the lounge area. The drinks were great and they still are. The price is not so great. Slightly overpriced for a rosewater lemonade. That being said, it was really good. We wanted to order a dessert for a night cap so we took a recommendation from our waitress. Evidently the chocolate soufflé was ""incredible"" and "" I can't even explain"" delicious. It was not. I can explain. It was mediocre. Nothing to write home about. It came with a creme sauce in a copper pot that you pour into the soufflé. Just a basic sweet creme. Without it the soufflé would have been dry. All in all not a bad spot. A bit pricey but not horrible. The service is good and the ambience is great. The bathrooms are also pretty cool. I love a good bathroom!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Danny loves pizza. He eats, lives and breath pizza - he wouldn't probably even marry it if he could so this place was on out ""must go to"" list when in New York after reading about it on yelp! Pros: - cooked in coal brick oven - pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno   - flavorful - each bit was so amazing - great crust Cons: - Cash only - gets really cold if you are sitting downstairs near a window - poor service - no beer! Helpful: - small regular pizza (feeds 1-2 people) $12 - large regular pizza (feed 3-4) $14 - toppings: $3 each Overall: 4 stars. It wouldn't have been a New York trip if we missed out on Grimaldi. After walking in the snow in 20 degree weather, I was ecstatic to see the Brooklynn Bridge. I was even more ecstatic when I saw Grimaldi right underneath (how convenient!) When we got there there was like 3 parties right at the door. It was very confusing because i had no idea whether I was suppose to go inside to put my name down or what. I then walked instead and the guy (I am assuming the manager) starts yelling for us to stand outside. I told him that we are here for two and just confirming on the process. He responded by saying ""yeah, i know two. now stand outside"" That kind of caught me off guard a bit but didn't stop me! Got in line and thank goodness was only in it for no longer than 10 minutes. We got seated by a window table in the far back. When we were waiting for our food, our area got extremely cold (maybe around 30 degrees) which kind of made it difficult to eat/wait. The couple next to us complained, but the manager said it was ""just them"" and moved them elsewhere. As we were waiting, the line outside grew and grew. If I was waiting more than an hour outside, and got seated instead (in the cold) i wouldn't have been happy. Anyhoo, we ordered a large pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno between two people and devoured every last bite. I asked Danny if this was his favorite, and he stated that he has had better but it was still really good and tasteful. I guess it really depends on what type of pizza mood you are in! Overall, great experience, glad we tried it and would go back again if we were in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Waited about 20 minutes for half a dozen of blue point oysters. Only thing I did enjoy from here were their blue point oysters and shrimp. So fresh! Probably the best I've ever had.

"Went to Alta with a group for a birthday dinner.  The food was good, but everything else was a disaster.  Service spotty, attitude high, and noise deafening.  Was offered a food allergy-specific menu after inquiring about ingredients, then told they couldn't guarantee I would be served the dishes I ordered -- they have too many other diners who need to be tended to to worry about something like that. (At this point of the  evening the restaurant was only half full.)  Not willing to risk getting sick, I explained that I couldn't risk it and cancelled two dishes I'd ordered and figured I'd celebrate my friend's birthday and eat at home after.  Then the manager -- at least I think it was the manager -- he didn't introduce himself or have a nice thing tpo say.  He stridently announced their policy which is not to insure that someone with a food allergy gets the dishes they order because the restaurant is way too popular and waitstaff couldn't be bothered with something minor like that (I'm paraphrasing, but not changing the content of what he said one bit).  Why have allergen-free menus if you don't honor them, one wonders.  Rude, arrogant, and only for people who enjoy a little abuse with their tapas.    At $10 - $15 a plate, and 3 - 4 to add up to a meal, you're easily in for $100 with a glass of wine.  For that, I can get much much better service, food and ambiance at a hundred other places in town.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"M girlfriend and I went to this place for a late dinner and everything was great. The place is small but the esthetics are perfect. The exposed brick, cool decorations, and music to set the mood. The lights were dim but not so much that you could not see the person across from you. We were also lucky enough to attend when there were not a lot of people. Since it is a small restaurant, I can imagine it being a bit cramped when all of the tables are full. Food: Pork Dish with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus - The curry sauce was just the right sweetness with a bit of a spicy kick, the pork was soft and moist and the mashed potatoes were just the right consistency! Soup: Homemade Chicken Soup - This was perfect for the cold weather we were battling that night. The broth was very tasty and there was just the right amount of chicken and vegetables in the soup. Bread - Awesome, no other word for it. It was soft, warm, and tasted so damn good! If your a fan of bread, ask the waitress to keep it coming!!! Rib Eye Steak 10 oz with Mashed Potatoes & Asparagus - The steak was ordered medium and that;s exactly how it was served. The meat was tender and super juicy, The potatoes, again, perfect consistency. Asparagus at first appeared to be undercooked but after the first bite, I realized it was perfect! 3 Dollar Sangrias! - One review said that they tasted like grape juice but let me assure you that this was not the case when we went. The Sangria was tasty and had a nice kick. After about 3.5, I was feeling pretty dang good and this is coming from a person that usually has two shots in his hands. My girlfriend is a bit of lightweight and she was feeling very good after the second round. For 3 dollars, you need to give them a shot! Shrimp - The night we went they actually had a special on the Rib Eye plate and you also received a side of 3 large shrimp and dinner for $33! Well the shrimp were very tasty. The lemon seasoning exploded in your mouth and they were cooked to perfection. Dessert - Cobbler - The fruit and crust pieces tasted amazing! The cream was a nice touch but if I had to pick at something about this dish, I would suggest that it be served with ice cream. That would have completed the dessert dish!!! Service - The waitress was very sweet and fast. The only gripe I had was towards the end of the dinner, she seemed a bit pre-occupied with her cell phone and then disappeared for a bit upstairs. I had to ask her for the check. I'll be nice and not knock off a star for such a little thing. Overall, I would highly recommend this place. The entire night ended up costing about $85, not including the tip. That got us 2 main courses, dessert, 6 Sangrias, a small appetizer, and soup. I am rather new to NYC, but I would have to say this was one of the more reasonably priced places that I have been to, I enjoyed the environment, got a nice buzz, and left nice and full!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came here today because everybody raves about how great it is.

"This is from a girl that lived in TX for 3.5 years, and have had crawfish straight in LA, this place hits the spot.  If i could rate it more accurately it would be a 4.5, because 5 would mean perfect, and perfect for me is Dallas' Boiling Crab.. nothing.. beats that. Asian owned, you know this place packs on the garlic like some of its counterparts, which makes it just an explosion of flavor.  The difference between this place and BC is the amount the butter this place throws in, def... A LOT more butter, but who cares, you shouldn't be eating seafood if you're concerned about your cholesterol at this point. Another difference of course, price.  This is double the price of your usual southern price, but hey.. where else are you gonna get it. Skip the fried oyster sandwich or whatever that was.  The wait... awful but expected, just be prepared for it and mosey around, you'll be fine. My first visit wasn't during crawfish season but.. the buggers were very  medium sized, and oddly, tasted.. fresh?  Even though i know it was probably frozen off season but that speaks a lot to the quality.

"my family took me out for dinner for my birthday on march 15 and suggested don peppe. we were a party of 7..we heard from others who have dined here in the past on how great their dining experience was . we also checked the reviews on  yelp and tripadvisor and zagat  and found great reviews. we however did not have such a great experience. we knew that there would be a wait but not 2 and a half hours(we should have not not been told  the wait was 30 minutes) we could have dined elsewhere but decided to stay and wait . we were getting anxious and hungry. the service was less than perfect. we knew how busy they are but we felt as if we were being rushed ,in fact the waiter told us what to order rather than us deciding. the  waiter was not very attentive and at times could not find him at all. once the food arrived we dugged into it(family style) because we were starving. the food  did not live up to the hype in our opinion. it was good but not worth waiting several hours for. for a 550 dollar bill we did not get what we paid for. we tried it and i am sure it is good for most of the reviewers but not for us sorry we wont be going back to dine there.. it was a memorable birthday but not in a good way what a shame...really wanted to give five stars....but couldnt...","[0.0, 1.0]"
"AWFUL! I really don't get what all the rave reviews are about. Yelp, you misled me. My friend and I both ordered cheese fries. They were stale and limp. There was none of this crispness everyone is talking about. The cheese sauce ... was not good. There's something in it that overwhelms the sauce. I wanted to leave after a few bites. My friend ordered iced tea with her fries and, when she asked if it was sweetened or unsweetened, she was told it's sweetened and it's actually Nestle Iced Tea. It turned out to be watered down Nestle Iced Tea. She was curious as to why Mark got such great reviews. It's gotta be the sliders, right? she concluded. So she wanted to order one to see what all the hype was about. I tried to make eye contact with our waitress to wave her over. No luck. My friend said she'd see our waitress look over at us, then look away. Not once since we got our orders had she gone over to our table to check on us to see how everything was. I think she had written us off after we only ordered fries and a drink. It wasn't until another party sat a table away from us that she had to come over to our section, where we proceeded to stare her down until she acknowledged us. When the slider arrived, it smelled putrid. At first, I thought I was smelling the city streets or sewage since we were sitting right by the open door. Nope, it was the slider. My friend put it best when she said, ""It smells like feet."" The verdict? ""It's not bad but it's definitely not the best burger I've ever had."" She would only eat half of it. Paying our bill took forever. I feel like our waitress just didn't want to work that night, or was being very selective about who she'd provide service to. I'm glad I went because now I know Mark isn't all it's cracked up to be.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The first oddity I noticed was that the restaurant seems to like placing rolled pieces of paper over their light bulbs. I was afraid a fire would break out because one of the pieces of paper (within my range of vision) had a large burn hole in it. I'm not sure if it's for mood lighting or what, but the proper application of lower wattage bulbs or even lamp shades could do the same without the hazard. Second, it's packed like a can of sardines. I was in a party of four and there was one table with four settings that was about the size of a coffee shop table for one. I'm not into pastas so I chose the Costoletta Di Agnello (lamb chop). Three Frenched lamb chops with spinach and new potatoes. The potatoes were crispy, but improperly salted - some had a lot of salt and some had none. The spinach was a nice relief from the meat and potatoes. Now, the star of the plate should have been the lamb chops. I ordered them medium and they came out nearly medium-well. And it seems that the kitchen rushed the order due to the crowds because they didn't let it rest enough - all of those precious juices were running all over the wooden cutting board they were served on and eventually all over the table. Sad. This left two of the pieces a bit dry and tough with the third just barely right. For the price, I'm sure there are far better Italian options.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Yes, we were promptly seated but that's the best thing this place did.  About 15 minutes into waiting, the couple (seated after us) ordered and received their food before even anybody came to us.  I had to yell to get a wairess' attention and she said (lied) that she wasn't assigned our table but was willing to take our order.  Another 20-25 minutes of waiting, we had to track down a busyboy to see where our food was.  I mean, c'mon, it's only eggs and sausage.  We got our drinks and food finally.  It was so-so.  NOBODY came to check up on us.  It took another FOREVER to get our check. My sister had to go up to the bar to pay the check.  She complained to the manager and he didn't even apologize.   This is THE WORST place I've ever been to.  If the food was amazing, I would maybe think about going back.  I am going to tell ALL my friends to never ever ever ever go to this place.  The service was horrible and food was mediocre.","[1.0, 0.0]"

For entrée, we shared the paella, which is saffron rice baked with clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chorizo sausage and chicken. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake.

The male waiter/host? who welcomed us in and our waitress were both so down to earth and very authentic. Pitchers of sangria were around $23 and weren't very large, but the white berry pomegranate sangria we got was absolutely delicious!! The waitress was very attentive and came over to refill our glasses every time they were a bit lacking in liquor. The tapas all looked so great. We ended up getting the croquettes and I was not disappointed. It was cooked it perfection, like a perfect friend ball of potato, ham, and cheese.

"I don't hand out 5 stars that easily but this place deserves it and deserves it well. Pinto is a perfect example of how a quiet, unassuming place can offer a lot of character while delivering high quality food and service at a very reasonable price. Tucked away in the Christopher Street area, I stumbled upon this place by accident. The exterior doesn't pop out but that understatedness works well because I was pleasantly surprised. The interiors are gorgeous. They took a small Manhattan space and with some astute design choices have utilized their space properly. They've used a lot of bamboo and wood along with glass and steel which I like. The interiors are a good fusion of new york chic with Asian sensibilities and their lighting choice has worked well in creating an intimate atmosphere. The menu is pretty standard American Thai fare but they deliver well. Portions are sumptuous so don't over order. Highly recommended if you're looking for a casual dining experience with a bit of style thrown in.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Well sized Well stuffed Filling I got the grilled chicken burrito and added guacamole for $1 extra. I'm pretty sure there was some guacamole in there. A smear, anyway. The order comes with some tasty chips and salsa, and hot sauce if you want it. The hot sauce is definitely hot, and it's such a vibrant green that I wondered if there was food coloring in it. Food was decent, and for about $10, I was well satisfied. No too heavy on any of the contents, instead a good balance of all flavors and ingredients. The grilled chicken was slightly dry and added nothing special to the burrito. I wouldn't say the burrito was the best I've had or anything special. It was good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"i went here for brunch on a friday and it was jam-packed... we waited at the bar while sippin on mimosas... they were super delish! I had a passionfruit cariation and I can't stop thinking about it... MUST FIND ONE IN LA... pronto! i ordered the turkey burger and at first the server advised they ran out of avocado (insert sad face)... but then they brought it out and let me know they had magically found one last one and included it in my burger (insert happy face) but they neglected to include it in my friend's salad (insert sad face)... that kinda sucked, because I felt like I was teasing her... but she wasn't that bummed.... the turkey patty was juicy, tender, and cooked to perfection... everything tasted fresh out the farmer's market.. definitely coming back here next time I'm in NYC :-P!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Edi & the Wolf is what I might picture eating at a casual tavern in a city like Salzburg despite never having visited Austria. You walk in from Avenue C into this seemingly out-of-place woodsy, rustic hut, and it's easy to forget that you're in alphabet city. Ambiance-wise, Edi is unique in an Alps chalet sort of way. The restaurant has wooden 2-tops, 4-tops and a long communal table in the center, and various trinkets line the exposed brick walls, giving it a very warm feel. However, the brunch couldn't match the same warm feeling of the room. First, service was aloof--the restaurant isn't that big but our server kept disappearing on us and we had felt like we were always trying to track her down to get a refill on water or to order additional drinks or food.   The brunch menu itself is a set menu, and $14 will get you a choice of entree, coffee/espresso/machiatto, a glass of juice, and a bread basket.  Price-wise, it seemed to be one of the best bang-for-your-buck brunches in New York. Unfortunately, the strong, rich coffee may have been the most memorable part of the brunch. My schnitzel burger sounded like a sure-fire hit considering this was an Austrian place, but the challah bread was toasted and dry, and the schnitzel was a bit too thin and dry also. Dry and dry didn't work for me, and even the savory cucumber salad couldn't save it. The breadbasket would be great if it all consisted of pain au chocolat and croissants, but for our party of 6 people, 4 of us never got a chance to taste them and instead had some relatively boring bread. On a cold day, the warmth of Edi would definitely attract me for drinks or maybe even to try dinner. But it'll have to be a really frigid day for me to come in for another brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I watched this place being built but hadn't had a chance to go and eat until yesterday. The decor inside is nice, a lot of old wood and warm colors.  They also have a market with organic and local products - I bought the spicy ketchup.  Because I like spicy ketchup. Anyway, I had dinner and I ate the hanger steak, which was solid.  Salsa was a nice touch. Also had the crab cakes, which were covered with kataifi.  I love crab cakes in general, but the kataifi gets a big thumbs up from me because it made them crunchy. I should have tried them with the spicy ketchup though.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My friend stumbled upon Tchoup Shop one Sunday and then brought me the next. Unfortunately because we had to work, we got there late (6pm -ish) and there were no more BBQ items. Instead we had the blackeyed peas, biscuits, beet salad, potato crayfish salad, rice, and left-over pork belly. The salads were delicious, my favorite was the potato crayfish. I also really enjoyed the peas. My friend told me that she had tried the bbq shrimp which was amazing so I'd like to try to come back a bit earlier to try the hot items. Simon, the chef, told us that when things sell out all depend on when the game is.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Fried Oysters with a lovely dipping sauce- this is an optimal bar edible. Lightly fried but not at all greasy. Got something caller Shiner wine which was beautifully packaged and made by the owners. This is an excellent choice if they still have it. It was a limited edition.

"I tried Perry street for dinner, during restuarant week. A group of friends and me tried everything on the menu, which was not much, just 2 options for the appetizer, entree and dessert. There was no vegetarian option for the entree, but I am  not complaining. We started with the fried calamari and Burrata cheese. Fried calamari for me was the standout dish. The Yuzu dipping sauce was exceptional, I wanted to drink it. But my friends favored the cheese, they serve it with strawberries and some kind of crackers, micro greens, the works, it looked beautiful, I guess my palate is not that complex. For entrees it was Salmon and Fried chicken. I never thought I would say this but I actually liked the salmon much better, it was slow cooked to perfection. The fried chicken was definitely a step up from KFC, but I wouldn't rave about it. You cannot go wrong with the molten chocolate cake at any Jean-Georges place, there was also a really good blueberry cake with cream cheese and blueberry sorbet, the sorbet was truly exceptional. Special mention to all the cocktails we had, they were outstanding. I especially liked my Passion Chili Sour. Overall I would say its minimalist ambience and good food will make me go again. The location is kind of non-descript, like lots of yelpers have mentioned, enter from the FDR.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The portions aren't big by any stretch of the imagination, but SO rich. I had the Austrian meatballs which totally knocked my socks off.

"Do yourself a favor and order the filet mignon benedict when you go! We went just before noon on a Sunday. Perhaps the snow made the wait manageable, as we waited for no more than 10 or 15 minutes even with the huge crowd by the door. It was a busy day but we were very happy with the service. The staff were obviously very efficient, and when we clumsily spilt something on our table and asked for napkins, the waiter gently wiped down the mess for us. The filet mignon benedict was the best eggs benedict I've ever had. It was pretty mind blowing. The sauce, the meat, and the onion rings around the eggs made such a perfect combination in terms of taste and texture. We also ordered caramelized apple waffle, latte, and earl grey tea, and we liked the bread that they served, but the filet mignon benedict was obviously the star of the meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After reading so many excellent reviews, I had pretty high expectations for this place. First thing you notice is overwhelmingly delicious smell of smoked BBQ even before you walk in the door. The menu is pretty simple so it isn't very hard to decide what you want to eat. Ribs, brisket, or pulled pork. The meats were just ok and the sides were extraordinarily rich. I paid $18 for two small orders of meat and a side of macaroni. This place seems to have a cult following but I'm not quite sure why.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went there with a friend, a few nights ago, for dinner. Food - Good. Very good.The fried chicken is one of the best I've tried in the city. The hint of lemon with herbs combined with the crispy, crispy skin. YUM! Service - Very attentive. We accidentally dropped our waffle fries (because the table was a tad small) and without us asking the waitress replaced it with a new batch. The hostess at the door was very bubbly and quite funny. I walked in with a smile and out with some laughs. Ambiance - It is a fairly small restaurant so it felt like a squeeze (but luckily the food and service made up for it). The only complaint I have is that it was quite loud in the restaurant, so maybe not the best choice for a quiet date (definitely not when they are busy which unfortunately is pretty much every night). Overall - Highly recommended. Go, be prepared to wait, but it will be worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The dosa man at Washington Square Park serves up some really great dosas. Though there were about 4 people in front of me in the line, it only took a maximum of 10 minutes to get my food. I ordered a 2 Masala Dosas and 2 Samosas for 13 bucks (what a deal)!  (The dosas were 5 bucks each, and 2 samosas were 3 bucks). I was a little disappointed at the amount of filling inside the actual dosas (and it's mainly all spiced, flavored potatoes). Given that I'm an insane meatlover, I felt like there was something missing, but oh well, I guess it's okay to go vegetarian once in a while. That said, I really loved the way you can watch him make the dosas on his griddle in his tiny cart. For a tasty and filling lunch, I may head back here for a quick fix.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My boyfriend and I came here the other night, this is restaurant #2 on our quest for NY's best BBQ... cue epic music... The restaurant was much smaller than I expected and the signage was either discreet or non-existent as I hadn't realized we had arrived until I peeked through the front door. So pay attention to your Google Maps. There was a small bucket of beer in the front holding Shiner Bock, of which I am a fan. Though I think with the weather and the ice melting rapidly I noticed my first couple sips being room temp before getting to the icy cold part. A strange sensation and a mere minor offense. We decided to order: 1/2 lb. lean brisket, 1/2 lb. fatty brisket, 1/2 lb. pork ribs, coleslaw, bbq beans, and mac n cheese. When the platter arrived, it truly was a thing to behold. The mac n cheese blew me away, the jalapeño flavor was distinct and such a wonderful addition, I couldn't help myself and ate more than my share. Definitely some of the best mac n cheese I've ever had. The coleslaw was a beautiful purple color with shredded carrots atop. I thought it was lovely and really wish I'd enjoyed it, but unfortunately I'm just not a fan of mint in savory dishes. It tasted rather prominent to me and just makes me think of what it's like when you eat just after brushing your teeth. The beans were quite good. Pretty standard fare. Not stellar, but by all means not half bad either. They were tasty and filling, but a bit forgettable. The ribs though... the heavens parted and the angels sang and a light shined upon them. They were other-worldly!! The bark was crisp, the smoke ring was dense, the meat was tender. Definitely the star of the show, despite the restaurant name. The brisket was delicious and you could clearly see the smoke ring deep into the meat. I think we'd definitely ordered too much though and we're unable to eat it all. The meat was sliced thick and so tender it was a challenge to even pick it up with a fork! I think for my personal taste though, the lean brisket was better than the fatty. Normally I prefer fatty brisket, but when the meat is cut as thick as this the fat becomes too much for me. I wish I could've reviewed a dessert, but alas we stuffed ourselves so full we couldn't even attempt it! I think a pound of meat for 2 people next time will be plenty. All in all, I think it was a phenomenal meal. Even the sliced white bread served with dinner was more complex than it appeared and flavorful. I was totally shocked that by 9pm the place had pretty well cleared out and the restaurant was left with only a few tables. A place like this definitely warrants a packed house We'll DEFINITELY be back for the ribs (!!!), lean brisket, and the mac n cheese. So far this is my favorite BBQ in NY, though it will be interesting to see how it holds its place as we visit the next contender. (I'm taking this NYC BBQ trial very seriously.)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came her with my girlfriend Friday night for some Korean food. If you look at their menu, you'll see that they only have three Korean bbq dishes so this isn't your normal Korean bbq place. There is no grill on the table. All dishes are brought from the kitchen. We got there at around 6pm so we got a table right away, which is good because people had to wait for tables 20 minutes later. We only got five dishes of banchan (small free side dishes such as kimchi) so don't expect Flushing portions. We ordered the vegetarian grill pancake, bulgogi bibimbop, galbi bbq, and bulgogi bbq. Service was a little slow and it took a while for our food to come out. All the dishes were pretty good. My girlfriend especially liked the galbi bbq. My bibimbop was great. Total bill came to $90 for four dishes ($115 after tax and tips) so it's pricey. Overall, it was a good experience with good food. Service was a little slow but the food was good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yes.  Absolutely.   Disclaimer: I've only been here for brunch. My fellow diners both got the Tea-smoked salmon, spinach and poached eggs on toasted sourdough with yuzu hollandaise and really liked it. I got the Turkish eggs - Two poached eggs on Greek yogurt with kirmizi biber butter with a side order of chorizo (again - I need the meat) and THIS DISH WAS RIDICULOUS!! This was a great brunch.  I've been using a Greek Yogurt for my home cooked dinners and breakfasts and love that now I am seeing it in restaurants.  It is excellent, I pair it with some Sriracha @ home and it just sings as a dipping sauce.  But it sang in this dish as well. Bloody-Mary = Excellent.

The decor and setup of the party was amazing as well.  Almost every person at the party asked me how I found this place because they loved it.  We had a group of approx. 40 people and the space in the back was perfect.  It was a specific area set aside for our party.  It was comfortable and nice.   The food we ordered was very good as well.  Everyone had plenty to eat and drink.  I personally loved the mac and cheese tartlets.   And lastly, the price was very reasonable.  We received a very detailed description of everything we were paying for and all prices were acceptable considering it was a Saturday night in Manhattan.

"We came to Jungsik with a party of four on a Friday night and was seated promptly.  Initially my impression before coming here was to classify Jungsik as ""Korean Fusion.""  But after dining here I would have to suggest New American with Korean inspired taste.  We didn't opt for the tasting menu option.  Instead, we ordered seven large(5) & small plates(2) to share: Bossam, Octopus, Lobster, Short Rib, Galbi, Uni, Snapper & dessert.   To be honest, the size of the plates are relatively small for the price. The service was amazing, very attentive and when I brought to their attention that the small galbi had only 3 pieces our server quickly brought the dish back to the kitchen and added a piece, which was nice so everyone could have a taste.

"I went for restaurant week last year. Did the pre-fixed menu, with the add an extra course for $10 or so. It was so good! I loved the sampler they started with, as I love bread and love dipping bread into everything possible. Then we had some meatballs, goats milk ravioli, some other pasta and I had a lamb shank. Everything was pretty good and love that we sat downstairs in the basement because it was away from everyone waiting around in random places upstairs. I skimmed through the regular menu while we were waiting for service (which was slow to start but I think it was because it was RW) and the prices looked decent and there were dozens of things I wouldn't mind trying if we weren't already involved in this intense 5 course meal! Had a great experience. Would have been better if it was just my friend and I but we invited another, so we could order all three choices on the pre-fix and be able to try everything they had to order.

I and my girlfriend arrived around busy hours and waiited 20 minutes, then only to wait 30 minutes more for our food without the waitresses EVER asking how we were doing despite the empty table between us. Now off to the food - Creamy Tom Yum Goong: salty beyond edible. I grew up and Vietnam and handle saltiness in food fine but the soup tasted too strong with the salt so I sent it back to the kitchen. This time we got a diluted version of the broth, less toppings and overall not tasty. After sending the dish was when we started to wait 30 minutes for our entrees which probably would never arrive if we did not ask the forgetful and unfriendly waitress. - Pad Thai: a Thai place can hardly go wrong with this dish.

"Some have called this the ""unofficial first restaurant of New York"".  It's crazy stinking good.  Fixed price or tasting menus only at dinner in the main dining room.  A superb wine list.  Flawless service.  And when they say ""business casual"", they mean it, by today's very relaxed business casual definitions.  You can get a little dressy if you want, or you can show up in cords and a buttondown, and you'll feel right at home either way. The food is ridiculous.  It is expensive.  But you won't care (and I don't care).  Do it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"4.5 stars actually So I was moving..again..and I was deep in queens and didn't know anything around me... a quick yelp search and Wafa's came up... after perusing the menu I realized i was salivating a little too much and figured that was a sign that I needed to try it... I walked in and it is a cozy little spot, that was pretty busy around 7 pm on Saturday night.  Immediately the middle eastern music made me smile.  I was greeted right away and told them I wanted to place an order for takeout... Now the menu I honestly wanted to try every appetizer bc it was everything that my mama makes back home and as I have been craving her food and missing home I was tempted to order every last item... however self control took over and I ordered a kibbe and the swiss chard soup.  My entree was the mixed grill platter with Shish Tawook( chicken on the grill) and shish kebab ( lamb kebab), it comes with two choices and i decided on the hummus and rice.   I also ordered two chicken shwerma sandwiches for the two people that helped me move my stuff... i'm nice like that... Anyway back to the food, the reason I took off half a star was the wait time the young lady said 15 minutes however 30 minutes later I was still waiting... I got home and my salivary glands were in overdrive especially as I first emptied out the cargo van before I started to eat... The kibbe was on point... not dry not overcooked just right! The swiss chard has probably got to be one of my favorite soups I have tried in nyc... the lemony light goodness of the soup with a nice balance of lentils and swiss chard was awesome... now on to the main dish... it was HUGE! I mean I opened up the container and was like how am i suppose to finish all of this... The chicken honestly was so moist and flavorful and the kebab was not dry and just done ever so right... i loved the fact that with their rice they put lentils as well yummy! and the hummus was just creamy goodness! perfectly seasoned just the way i like it... The guys loved the sandwiches as well, they kinda inhaled them.... I was honestly in a food coma when I finished but I was smiling the whole time... I really hope I have a reason to be back deep in queens as I feel the need to go back soon... very soon.... .","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Brunch at Ltauha, burger and huevos rancheros and coffee. No clue why everyone loves this place after that. Burger was extremely plain, tasted like what I would cook at a BBQ. Huevos rancheros were also maximum plain. Fries were fried great, but they had very little flavor. I thought this would be like a hipster place with espressos and stuff like that, but no it was just diner coffee. There is no way people can be serious about this burger being on the same level as Dumont or Northeast Kingdom -- it's just too bad that locals are too easily boosters because it takes away credibility. Maybe I'm being hard, but let me go further. When comparing to Bushwick restaurants, you are either comparing to overly hyped, big lined brunch places, or places with experimental and very interesting flavors deserving of hype. From what I saw, on this Labor Day, Ltauha was not anywhere to travel more than a subway stop for. Beware reviews with double exclamation marks. Queens has so much going for it. There are tons of great places in Ridgewood - and many that need to be documented on yelp to help with menus. We don't need to compare ourselves to Bushwick, and I'm not waiting to be Bushwick - there is no comparison to Queens and that's why we are awesome. New places have so much hope for people believing that Bushwick is coming, but with floors like that, it's not coming anytime soon. I feel like a snob, but whatever - the crux of this is to create some energy around places that are great that have been around forever. I don't know what they are so you locals have to review!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

My friend placed her hand bag on the lower shelf next to a light bulb.  As we stuffed or face, that light bulb slowly burned a hole into her bag. Fail!  We told our server about this, not in anger, but with a genuine hope that we wold prevent such a tragic outcome for future bags to come. Much to our surprise, she called in the manager who was not only very apologetic but took my friends name and number down with the intent to replace the bag. WHAT?!?! This kind of customer service is: 1) Rare  2) Rare in NYC and 3) Rare in a NYC restaurant that's popular enough that they really don't *need* your business anyway. Bravo!

It's a good place to go if you want to talk without yelling over the people at adjacent tables, which tends to happen often at good NYC restaurants. I was also particularly fond of the sake china, miso soup bowls, and small mugs for the green tea - all nice touches to accent the food. My friend ordered a beef dish that was prepared and cooked table side which looked quite exciting. It came with soup, sides (e.g. pickled vegetables, seaweed, rice), and ice cream, which seemed like a pretty good amount of food for $20! She also said it was delicious.

"Love this place! VERY pricey though, but what do you expect everything is imported and top notch Italian goods. We bought some fresh made pasta, that we have yet to try. All of the pasta looked good. I was itching for some of the fresh ravioli and I know that if I had gone alone I wouldn't have been able to leave without racking up a huge bill. What can I say I'm just a sucker for artisanal goods! We ate at Il Pesce, which was nice. The food was delicious and moderately priced. I had the fish of the day special, a whole butterflied fish then pan fried for a nice crispy outer layer. It came with warm roasted brussels sprouts. The fish was simply, but delicious seasoned with lemon, olive oil, salt and pepper. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Wonderful experience and good food. I also had the gelato at the gelato counter. You MUST try the sweet milk. It's similar to vanilla, but with a more complex flavor profile. Soooo good! This place is great for exploring and getting special goods at, such as god salami, cheese, basically things you can't get anywhere else. They also have a neat cookware section.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As a regular diner at this place I will be honest with you- Robertas is mad cool. The long low wooden tables are just my taste, I like a place with awesome food and not a lot of show. The selections of beer and wine are nice, they have super expanded their seating in the back and outside where there is another bar... and then they have events they are super fun and cool. Again, cool. Everyone who works here and eats here looks so cool. Sometimes its a bit annoying and people are putting on airs everywhere, but I can deal with it, because the food is AWESOME. The food is $$$, dont get me wrong, but so many items are local/fresh/grown BY ROBERTAS that I think it's worth it. Simple dishes with tons of flavor. The cuttlefish and the scallops are perennial favorites, and all the pizzas are good- order 3 with a group of 4 and get a lot of awesomeness for cheapish. The service has never been 100% on point but the place is usually mobbed by all the wealthy artists in the area with no where else to go (yet) that is as cool as they are. There is often a wait by the bar which is cramped but again, I can deal, because this place is just so cool.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We happened upon this place while walking in the Noho area, looking for some pasta. Here's my experience: 1. Space is cute and sweet. Decor is rustic, but not in a cheesy way. Small, but not in an uncomfortable way. 2. Service was perfection. Our server was sweet, knowledgeable and very helpful. Made us feel very welcome and didn't rush our dinner. 3. Food was delicious! We ordered the gnocco frito which were hot, light and airy. Served with cold cuts, which were delish. I had the pasta bolognese which was perfection. The pasta was house-made and made perfectly. Not thick and perfectly coated in their bolognese sauce. I would come back JUST for this dish. 4. I gave -1 star based on the carni dish we had, which was the Salcicce E Fagioli. We both thought the sausage was kind of dry and crumbly. We didn't really enjoy it. But honestly, the pasta dish was so good that we overlooked it. We would definitely come back here and totally recommend it. It's good to find a great pasta restaurant that doesn't break the bank.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My first time having Venezuelan food and it was amazing!   I have basically come to realize in my short time living here that Williamsburg food is way better than Park Slope food...that's right I said it! Anyways, great happy hour deal from 4-7 pm with dark and stormies (yeahhhh...my favorite) with a fruity kick.  My friend and I shared the ""Guasacaca with chips"" (haha caca...) which is basically really good guacamole with these unique homemade chips that aren't even chips (just go and try them...).  The ""tajadas"" plantains were also moist and I loved the sweet with cheese flavor combination.   And to top it off, the arepa was definitely the highlight.  I had the pernil special, which was juicy, well-seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth pork (mmmm my mouth is watering) on a soft, doughey tortilla. The venue itself is also very cute both inside by candlelight and outdoors - my friend and I were able to sit out in the garden patio - really felt like I was back in California :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to this restaurant last Friday night for dinner with some of my friends. I had a wonderful Burrata appetizer that was on special. I then had the cavatelli with ricotta and meatballs, which was very lackluster. My friends all had neutral reactions to their pasta, some were better than others. My only friend who didn't get pasta got the pork, and I'm pretty sure he liked it. The most disappointing aspect of the meal was far and away the service. Our waitor was arrogant and incompetent, a terrible combination... He screwed up, if you can believe this, three entres at the table and didn't offer to comp anything, not a drink, not one dish. He didn't even take anything back to the kitchen, he just stood watching everyone who got the wrong dish to make sure they liked what they didn't order. We just ate the stuff because it had already taken so long to get there, otherwise we most certainly would have sent it back. It then took him 45 minutes to bring us our check. This restaurant is really intimate, which is nice, but not when your waitor is walking back and forth right in your face ignoring you. We asked to split the check and not only was he not able to do it, he gave a 2 minute long speech about how much he tried. It was so ridiculous and weird, it was hard not to laugh at him. All in all, the atmosphere is very nice and I think that is main reason anyone would pick this restaurant. The alcohol selection is small but well-thought out. I wish that this server took more pride in what he does, I really hope the others do.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The starters, particularly the bakery basket, were excellent as well. We showed up around 1pm without reservations and the place was incredibly crowded so we sat at the bar. Despite the crowds the service we received was very quick and professional all the way through. I would recommend Feast to anyone coming to NYC. The only complaint is one all too familiar in NYC. Too noisy. Again, thanks to Katy and her Google glass wearing friends. I never would have tried Feast if not for you.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Arrived around 5:15 expecting to wait to get in, but was actually open at 5. Wasn't too difficult to find if you read these reviews! We sampled a number of items which were all pleasing in different ways. We sampled some skewers - duck and pork belly. These were simple and decent, but nothing amazing. Simple salt seasoning and grilled meat. Can't complain too much. We also started with a short rib appetizer. Guess I was expecting something a little more? Don't get me wrong, the flavor was good, but the same as the skewers - salt and meat. Good, but might not order them again. Next was the fermented soybean wrapped with fried tofu... this is definitely an acquired taste, but good. Not sure I would order it again, but it was nice to try. Next it was on to the udon noodles with pork and veggies. The sauce the waitress recommended was a little sweet for my tastes, but very good overall. Last was our favorite - the kimchi with pork belly. Guess I had my fill of pork for this trip. This was mild and not too spicy, but had great flavor. We finished our meal with some hot house sake and called it a night. I am looking forward to going back to this place and ordering some different combinations of items.

Also I really like their weird triangular plates. Very cool. Get the short rib slider. It's a bit overpriced but is really quite extraordinary. Super tender, with some mashed potatoes for good measure. The beef tempura tacos were also interesting and quite tasty. The more mundane stuff included the brussels sprouts and mushrooms. They were in no way bad, but there was nothing super special about them.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Cozy little southern comfort spot with good food. I had the hippie banjo minus the sprouts and it was fresh and warm. My wife had and enjoyed the chicken with waffles dish.

"I was born in Brooklyn and moved to Canada (for business - not witness protection!) I missed the Pizza in NY - especially L&B (which has changed... but that's another review).  I now live on Clinton St so Sottocasa is a nice walk. The wait staff was attentive, got seated immediately and they described the pizzas very well... This place is great for a group of friends just going to share a few pies.  It's a bit loud but hey.. this is NY - we're a loud bunch, right? I know which pies my server likes, as I was told - repeatedly... again us New Yorkers are opinionated, so I laughed it off.  Sottocasa has a good vibe, pretty much a young crowd, and being a tad past my tweens I felt a bit out of place. On to the pizza... I think this place tries too hard.  I had the POPEYE, and with a name like POPEYE, I was expecting lots of Spinach, like more green than anything else,  so I was dissappointed (a bit) to see that the spinach was applied sparingly.  My BF had the TONNO & CECI - must say that it was interesting, but I am not a big fan of these 2 flavors. Later that evening, I started to feel a bit ill - not nausea sick, but just uncomfortable.  My stomach hurt really bad, I don't know - it's hard to describe but I was out of it.  Tried good old Pepto to no avail, alka seltzer - nothing.  I wound up falling asleep out of sheer exhaustion. My BF was not 100% as well, he said he felt ""BLOATED"" like his stomach was going to explode. We went to work the next day, and on my way home I decided to stop by and let the Sottocasa know that I was ill the night before.  Maybe there was soemthing in the dough - maybe it didn't cook enough, not sure - I din't even play a pizza maker on TV.  I met one of the cooks, (the guy with glasses) and he told me that it was impossible that their food made us sick. Maybe we ate something else someplace else. OK, I'll take that - maybe the yogurt and banana I had for lunch at 2:00PM made me sick right after I ate at Sottocasa. Too bad, all the reviews were so good - I suppose you really can't trust YELP ~Inna","[0.0, 1.0]"

"threekitcheneers.com The Three Kitcheneers went to Gramercy Tavern!!! No trip to New York is complete without visiting Gramercy Tavern. It's the one place in the city that I will not skip. It's an institution. I walk in and feel right at home. I fell in love with pork shoulder at this restaurant. Now it's pretty much the only meat I want to eat. Going during off hours is ideal since there will likely be a couple of seats available at the bar (the tavern). I've fought for a table there before, then I figured out this trick and never looked back. The Tavern has the best cocktails.  Inventive without being fussy or trendy. Classic. In fact, my favorite cocktail there is called the Fall Classic. It's a knock-you-on-your-ass martini made with bourbon and Calvados, an apple brandy. Oh my, it's retarded good and it makes you hungry. One must have an appetizer to go with it. By appetizer I mean a dish of Smoked Pork Shoulder with Cornbread, but I like to share, so that still counts as an appetizer. I can't leave that place without some pork. They work miracles on their pork, so flavorful, so tender, you don't need sauce or fixin's, just the meat. threekitcheneers.com threekitcheneers.com/blo…","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'll preface this review by saying that I believe the difference between ""the best"" pizza in this city and pizza that is only average is a matter of degrees.  I think you'd be hard pressed to come across terrible pizza just about anywhere in the North Atlantic (I'm not even considering places like Domino's, etc.).  Anyone who's tried to find even decent pizza outside of the North understands what bad pizza is.  And so to me, a five star slice around here does not have to be leaps and bounds above the giant pack of four star slices, but it must contain something, often subtle, that makes it stand out.   Spumoni Gardens is one such slice. I have to drop the full 5-er on this place.  At least as far as Sicilian style goes.  The sauce is really well seasoned and has a nice little tang to it, but the best part is the crust.  It's buttery and crispy, somewhat chewy and simply scrumptious.  To the four people who get their mitts on a corner slice of pie:  You win.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Also, one fantastic employee, pretty sure he is the owner. The rest are all a bit young and a little too hipster for me... they seem to have constant bad attitudes.

"fried pockets of filling really can't be too bad.  if i were at a polish or chinese restaurant, i'd probably ask for the steamed version.  but i guess the 5 baked empanada options are the equivalent of getting your pierogies or chinese food steamed with sauce on the side. the restaurant is about 6 feet wide, crowded like nyc is about to run out of empanadas, and not a place i'd want to stay to eat at with all the people squeezing by to get to the register (take-out counter) and kitchen in the back.  so, the boyfriend and i ordered a few empanadas to go and found a stoop before tearing into our juicy selections (pernil, cheesesteak, chorizo, greek spinach pie).  if you decide to do the same, make sure to eat your empanadas off to the side so that you don't end up wearing the empanada juices and dipping sauce like i did. after ordering our food, it took about 20 minutes of waiting outside before our order was ready.  this place would be a solid 4 stars if it were a street cart.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I didn't realize this restaurant was actually on 27th so we stood on the corner of 27th and 10th for a good five mins while I searched my blackberry for the address, finally found it, and headed in, was pretty quiet for 8:30 on a Wednesday night, we were one of 3 tables I believe, but after a bit probably 3-4 more tables came in. They have a really approachable wine list with a lot of fairly reasonable bottles, all italian I believe, but I could be wrong. Got some sort of potatoe croquettes for an appetizer, which normally I really enjoy, but to be honest I could have skipped them, I've enjoyed them more at other places. However, the pizza was great, tried both the Martha (truffle pate prosciutto and basil, no sauce) and the standard bufala, both were really great and more than enough food, no need for an appetizer. The staff was super nice and attentive but not overwhelming. Would definitely go back another time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

As for the corn, I didn't know that it would come out smothered in mayo. Yuck! I'm not a fan of mayo due to the fact that it's unhealthy and especially since there was so much of it.

"You hear the phrase all the time, ""That was the best XXX I ever had""  and I'm sorry for using it here; but it is the ONLY thing that can apply to The Meatball Shop. My wife and I stopped by the Meatball Shop on Stanton Street after seeing the Phantom of the Opera; as we had not eaten dinner yet and were desperate for some good grub before going back to our Holiday Inn NYC- Lower East side hotel. We arrived at around 11:15pm on a Thursday night and snagged the LAST table in the joint; this small hole-in-the wall really gets and stays busy at ALL hours! Go during the week after lunch/before dinner time or really late (they are open until 1am-2am). The ordering system is cool; you place X marks on the  menu near the item(s) you want with the erasable black pens at your table. I ordered the sliders and you can pick any combo of your ball and sauce; I got 1 classic beef w/ tomato sauce, 1 spicy pork w/ spicy meat sauce, and 1 chicken w/ parmesan sauce. All were excellent, but I think I liked the spicy pork ball and the parmesan sauce the best. The atmosphere, vibe, and decor of the place was really hip, the wait staff was excellent, and the prices cheap by NYC standards (3 sliders were $9, sandwiches $10-$12 and came with an awesome salad, and dinner platters like $12-14 and came with 4 balls, bread, and a salad).

"What a wasted opportunity! I wanted to love the new Cafe Gitane so much, as the first Cafe Gitane is adorable and the concept of basic, affordable, and pretty tasty food worked well in that location -- which didn't have a real kitchen and was mostly a place for a cheap, casual, spontaneous meal or snack if you happened to be wandering around Soho. With the new space at the Jane Hotel, the developers had a real opportunity to elevate the concept of Cafe Gitane and make it even better -- but [tear], they failed. Why the developers of the new Cafe Gitane would keep the same plain Jane menu at the fancy Jane hotel in a space where people are looking for more pizzazz and where they now have a real kitchen is beyond me.  Additionally, the food is poorly executed - there is no excuse for things like dry couscous and burnt, very fishy and unfresh- tasting, salmon pot pie, overdone sausage with a very off, barnyard-like smell. Also, I can only hope our server there was stoned, because that's the only excuse for the horrendous ""I don't give a damn about you customers"" service we received-- drink mix-ups, sausage on a dish forgotten and brought separately when we were almost done eating, server trying to take away plates before we were done, no apologies! The location of the Jane hotel is so out of the way that the developers really need to make the food at the new Cafe Gitane food that is worth traveling for. It is nice that they kept the same low prices, but honestly, I would gladly pay twice the price if they would improve the quality of the food. If I were the developers, I would call the new space Bistro Gitane, double the quality of the food and double the price if neccessary. The Jane Hotel seems to want to attract a ""glam"" crowd, and therefore they really need to glam-up the dining experience!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I must say that the pho soup was actually pretty damn good for being take out and there loads of chunks of chicken in there too. Usually pho gives me a stomach ache and this one did not do A+!

"I have to start out by saying that it is extremely difficult to find authentic Vietnamese food in New York; it makes sense because the population is very low (I'm Vietnamese and originally from out of state). I came here for dinner with a friend. First off, the service was terrible! The waitress rushed us in and out. Now I understand that it was crowded and there was a massive wait line behind us, but it's not a pleasant experience to have a waitress walk by your table multiple times to give you mean stares as to hint you to hurry up. Second, the food was average and very Americanized. I ordered the chicken pho which turned out to be a big let down in authenticity. Their chicken was grilled with lemon grass and let me tell you, chicken in real pho is never grilled or cooked with lemon grass (it's boiled in the broth). There was no taste to the broth that authentic pho has due to adding in certain essential spices (cinnamon and anise). I was also disappointed by the fact that they only gave me a tiny plate of bean sprouts and no basil (this is essential). As for my friend's rice dish with grilled pork and veggies on top a bed of rice, that I had a taste of, it was decent. Not the best, but it was better than my pho. All in all, if you want legit Vietnamese food, you're looking in the wrong place. But if you can settle for average, Americanized Vietnamese food for relatively cheap prices ($8-10 per entree), then this is your place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Although the name may sound pedestrian, the food is far from it! Kitchen 79 is serving up some of the spiciest and unique Thai around right now and they will tell you off the bat if the dish is spicy. Some of the best in this category have been the wild boar, which explodes with galangal and keffir lime leaf, but also has a nice coconut milk sauce. The spiciest I've had is the Tai Pla - a fiery brown curry with mackerel providing the funk and can be standalone or with Thai pasta. The latter also comes with pumpkin and other veggies. They also do the classics well - namely the green curry and the papaya salad. For another unique dish, check out the Ming Ka-Nar, dry pork seasoned with ginger, lime chunks, red onion and peanuts. It is served with leaves of chinese broccoli and you can put together Korean-style wraps. This is a very light and refreshing dish that also packs some spice. Rudee, one of the partners, is a true sweetheart and will remember you on return visits. The decor is interesting and attractive - a far cry from when the old Arunee occupied this space.

"I went to Public for a big, group dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a reservation set for 8pm, but our table wasn't ready when we arrived (on time), so we decided to start with cocktails at the bar. We each had about a glass and a half of wine at the bar when they finally - 1 hour later - called us to our table. The wait was a little long for our taste (= -1 star), but by the time we got to sit down, taste almost didn't seem to matter because we were all pretty hungry. After an array of appetizers, we all chowed down on different dishes - ravioli, tofu, lamb, and duck. And at this point - taste truly did matter, because everything was delicious. I have to say though, the dish that was far superior to the others was the duck -- I'm getting this when I go back. Since we were celebrating a birthday, one person in our party called ahead to arrange a surprise birthday cake with Public. They were fantastic at providing us with a special menu to choose desserts from, and the full cake that we ended up choosing was great. I can't wait to go back for another dinner, and I really can't wait to go for brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Blend on the Water exceeded my expectations since I can be a food snob at times.  We had a party of 6 celebrating my husband's birthday and were seated exactly at our reservation time of 7pm.  It was a Saturday night so it was very busy and they had constant flow of people.  At no point were we impacted by their flow of people because the service we received was great from start to finish. We ordered several appetizers - arepas, tostones nachos, spicy prawns, lobster Mac and cheese, chorizo Mac and cheese, and the lobster flatbread.  EVERY bite of those appetizers was delicious and packed with flavors. Since we ordered a lot of appetizers we loved that they came out staggered instead of all at once.  After that they timed the entrees perfectly which included the chicken, steaks, and the salmon.  Once again we were blown away with the FLAVORS (especially the chicken).  The drinks are also very refreshing and perfectly planned since there is literally something for everyone (heavy drinkers to light drinkers).  Chef Kelvin stopped by our table to check on us and he was such a friendly and humble person.  Of course we had to let him know how amazing everything was and he assured us dessert would be the same way.  He stopped by around dessert time too and took take a picture with our group.  Once again just someone who took a great experience and elevated it to the next level.  Another thing I loved which you don't see at a lot of places anymore is 2 different managers checked on us throughout the night to make sure everything was okay.  I'm really unclear how some of these reviews say service here is not good because it was sooooooo busy tonight and the service was so good.   We all will be returning for sure.  Blend on the water has a chef and staff that truly appreciates the business they are getting and it shows in the quality of food they put out and the service/friendly environment they create for their customers.  THIS PLACE IS A MUST VISIT!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was at this restaurant last Sat with a group of five friends. The food was decent but the waiter refused to modify any item off the menu. I simply wanted a different sauce with my pasta. So we took it in stride and took what they were serving. But then as soon as we finished eating and we indicated we didn't want dessert the waiter kicked us out. I was embarrassed, shocked and extremely disappointed all at the same time. With so many great choices in Soho I would avoid this place at all costs. Someday places like this will realize good service is just as important as what they are serving.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Also got the gelato and an expresso to go with the liquor shot on the way out. Caramel gelato is the way to go! Enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"
I thought the service was horrible. Everyone that worked there was not friendly. I went there for lunch and it will be the last time I will go there. I waited 15 min for a waiter.

"Maybe my expectations were high. I've heard the mac and cheese was amazing - so we ordered the classic mac and cheese as an appetizer. It took a long time to get served - even took 5 minutes to get our waters - even though there were only 2 other tables at the time. The mac and cheese was very good, but nothing to rave over. Also got the BBQ tofu sandwich which was pretty good (if you're a vegetarian, I would highly recommend this dish). Crunchy, full of flavor. The ambiance is great - very hipstery with a lot of collectibles and drawings up on the walls. The servers were very nice. I would give this place a 4, except that we had made 3 different attempts at getting into this place; each time Queens Comfort was closed even though their hours said they were supposed to be open. No sign explaining why, nor saying if they would be open later in the day. All in all, a cute place. Would definitely go again, but not with as high expectations.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After having eaten here several times and meeting the owners, I really want Beehive Oven to succeed.  The owners seem like good people .... BUT..... the restaurant has a few issues.  First of all the location s*cks.  It may not be there fault (do to budget etc.) but THAT corner, in THAT building...it has a really negative vibe.  Could go into more detail here but I'll refrain.  They are trying to spruce it up but ultimately the location has a lot to be desired.  As far as the food.  Its good.  Its decent.  But one cant help comparing it to Pie's & Thigh's 2 blocks over.  My take is that they (Beehive) shouldn't have to tried to do the fancy/southern food thing.  Williamsburg has tons (too many) nice, fine dining, fusion establishments already.  If people want that there are plenty of places to go.  But if they want good ole fashioned southern food, home cooking (however you categorize it) there are very few options.  So therefore they (Beehive) should STICK TO THAT!  Don't try to make if fancy, just DO IT RIGHT!  Keep it simple.  That's why Pie's & Thigh's is so successful because they serve up what its meant to be.  Not something that's obviously trying too hard to be a new and contemporary take on southern fare etc.  Btw, the biscuits are kinda small. And like I mentioned before, the entrees are trying way too hard to be something different.  Also they don't transfer well into a takeout meal.  Did that once and it was a cold mess.  As far as atmosphere, its a little bright (at night) for my taste.  And the hours are posted outside the door in front but they don't seem to be accurate...or at least not yet.  ANYWAY, I feel bad for writing a lot of this because I like them and I want them to succeed.  I just figured I should be honest and hope that it helps them in the long run.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My friend and I got the seafood pancake, spicy pork BBQ, and spicy seafood stew. All very delicious. More than enough BBQ pork for two.

"Don't sleep on this place's excellent dinner menu! I've been coming to Commune for my morning coffee and occasional lunch since they opened a few years ago. Not many places make the transition to dinner easily, but the team who own this place have curated an awesome menu, with inventive dishes using local and organic food. The presentation of the dishes in itself is worthy of a high end restaurant. I had the salmon with sour cream tapioca and pumpernickel dust-they call it their interpretation of a bagel with lox and cream cheese. At first I had my skepticism, but with the first bite I was hooked!!  I also love that they give back to the community, involved in local charity efforts and cooking classes.

"I work in the area and have also been watching this place like a hawk. Went there with my boyfriend on two separate occasions. First time at lunch, second time at dinner. First, lunch. I had the spicy tuna burger and my boyfriend had the pork bun. OMG!! I am not even kidding when I tell you that both are addicitve. Seriously! Although I rarely eat pork upon my boyfriend's assistance I took a bite and it really was delicious, tender and juicy. In addition, the slaw worked really well with the warm bun. The second time was for dinner and it was a little more quiet, no line this time. Boyfriend had the crab bun and I had the shrimp tempura roll, both were really crispy, flavorful and fresh. I am really impressed with what I have eaten here so far, especiallly considering how fresh and REASONABLE everything is.

"This pizza is some of the best of NY. Here and Grimaldi's are places that you go for masterpiece pizza... from the right kind of oven, sliced cheese instead of shredded cheese, fresh sauce, fresh basil, etc. We came in on a Sunday afternoon, and there was no wait! This is unlike Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, which always has at least an hour wait.

"In the summer it is bustling, no where to park and people grabbing a slice and an ice and enjoying it outside on their picnic style tables.   I have only tried one thing here and that is their Square pie and I have to say I love it and actually crave it.  Its not your typical Square pizza.  They prepare it with sauce on top of the cheese and the dough is crispy not too doughy which I love.  I have heard really good things about their other food and my friends tell me that the Spumoni is out of this world. I will have to try it, but you really need to head over to 86th Street in Brooklyn and grab yourself a slice of heaven.  They also have a sit-down full restaurant that serves your classic Italian dishes like Lasagna, Manicotti, Calamari, Eggplant, Chicken, Veal Parm, etc. They have a parking lot and street parking and this time of year is better. They also take credit cards and do deliver but only to a few blocks within their area.  You will not be sorry!!!  But you might become addicted, so beware.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A sure fire testament to hedonism at its best. An elegant and romantic ambiance, cozy seating, enhanced with warmly lit hanging lights. I started with the Devils on Horseback, dates wrapped in bacon served with dijon mustard. If those are devils, then I must say it's a thin line between heaven and hell, as I don't know what ethereal place these bacon wrapped dates brought me to, but they were definitely out of this world. If those were the horsemen of the Apocalypse, then the world is not ending soon enough! Being on a budget, I opted to get a Burger with swiss, which was so flavorful I wondered whether I had forgotten what a burger tasted like? It could have been because it was the following act to my NDE with the Devils on Horseback and seemed to be the first thing I've tasted in this life. My friend and I shared, or were supposed to share (but he very rapidly inhaled all but a few), the Truffle Fries, which were a poignant and delightful coupling with my burger, or simply the cap to the evening's meal. Though I longed for dessert, I thought it best to be better safe than sorry (I only had $40 on me, holding myself firm in moderation). My friend got a glass of Stella and the Frisse Lettuce salad, which somehow rendered him full. I went last night, and have an overwhelming (and probably uncontrollable) desire to return this evening. I wish I could afford to be a regular, and can't wait to go for lunch and brunch! I had learned one of the collaborators to open this place is from my favorite coffee place in the city, Abraço. If they had that coffee there I would honestly move back to Greenpoint right away! It is the ideal date (and bacon wrapped date) restaurant: beer/wine/cocktails, gourmet otherworldly food, ice cream made in house, and of course, oysters. The combination of ambiance, food, and mood lighting proved to be an extreme aphrodisiac and I promptly felt all senses taking over. If I hadn't been there with my friend, I don't know that I would have been as discriminating with any ensuing indulgences. My only recommendation is, if dinner is followed by romance, be sure it's somewhere you can sleep afterward...because stimulation overload seems likely.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I don't really care for pork.  Its kinda something people know about me.  People go, do you eat pork, and I go, no...but I eat bacon at IHOP.  It confuses them, but really, have you ever had bacon?  When done right, its great. I had missed the Yelp event where they were giving out bacon donuts.  I had heard amazing things but never got around to going until recently when I finally stopped by for the one thing that jumped out at me: BACON DONUTS!! When I said I wanted to orders to go, they told me they would not give me the ice cream, but rather would give me an extra donut.  Cool. So I waited and waited and waited.  The place was nice.  I finally got my donuts and left with my bag.  I took them to my car.  I could have sat there and eaten them in the restaurant, but I had things to do.  I just wanted to try the donuts. In the car, my curiosity was seducing me so much that I gave in and opened one of the two boxes.  I was disappointed.  I paid 13 bux or so for these little things.  Wth... Then I tasted one. It was so good it made you wanna smack someone's grand momma.  Yeah thats horrible...but thats the point, for a second there I lost my dog gone mind. They were soft...Hot, fresh out the what ever the hell they used to cook them.  Then they had some sort of like caramel sauce on them and then there were bacon bits (as in bits of bacon and not that cheap stuff from the supermarket) drizzled all over them.  They were amazing.  Later that night I was getting some food and I met this nice girl who was also getting food.  I told her I had gotten the bacon donuts and she started asking questions about them.  I have no idea why but I started acting kinda aloof, I kept thinking she was going to ask me to stay and share them with her and that was just too much, even though there was no basis in reality for my belief.  I just felt like everyone was going to be trying to get at me for my bacon.  I excused myself and left.  So lady, if you ever find me, I am sorry.  I was not in my right mind.

"Real BBQ sold by the pound on a metal tray and butcher paper. Great selection of micro brews, fine whiskeys and great interior design. It is a converted car mechanic (if I recall correctly) Concrete, brick, subway tile, exposed beams and a whole wall covered by hand painted meat cut charts for beef, pork and lamb. The Brisket and pulled pork are amazing. Charred but still moist and falling off the bone due to their long slow cook times. I do have a tip while dining here. Eat your food as soon as it's plated (trayed?) and don't waste time getting beers and whiskey. Go with someone and have them get the drinks ready. The food gets cold quickly on the trays and it is so important to eat it while it's hot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ordered from Luzzo's on a Friday night per reading great reviews on Yelp.  Told me it would take an hour which I thought was a good sign as it was clearly in demand.  Have to say some of the worst pizza I've had in NYC!  By the time it got to me it was really cold and wet and slimy.  As I'd try to take a piece out the minimal toppings would slide off my soggy slice. Not to mention it was pricey.  Cost $31.00 with tip for a large with 3 toppings!  Will NEVER order from there again.  So, not good and so disappointing!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Really excellent brunch; both dishes we ordered were very well done: the parmesan biscuits and the polenta with eggs.  The service was also extremely good, and the coffee hot and refilled.  My only complaint would be with the space - on a sunny morning for brunch, it's a bit sad to be in a windowless room, pretty as it is.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have been to Buttermilk Channel several times and in the past loved my dinners there.  Needless to say, I was excited to bring my family, who was visiting from out of town, to one of my ""favorite"" Brooklyn restaurants. Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed by the customer service this time around.  The hostess was terribly rude to my 66 yr old mother and to one of my best friends (a fellow New Yorker) when we first arrived and asked for a table.  Because our party wasn't there at the exact same time, we were treated like 3rd class citizens.  We sat at the bar looking at free and empty tables while we waited the 10 minutes for the remainder of our party to arrive.  And, when we were all there, the hostess told us it would be 30 minutes (this was at 6pm on a Sunday).  We got a few drinks and an appetizer at the bar as we waited.  When my friend went back to check 15 minutes later, the hostess was rude again.   So, we decided our patronage would be more appreciated at a different establishment: we went to Prime Meats 2 blocks up and had an excellent meal.  Too bad Buttermilk Channel - you had a devotee and now we will never return.  Be careful and choose your hostesses better.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Probably the most over rated place i have been to so far. The huge hype for the chicken and waffles dragged me here. I am not sure how people on yelp write their reviews, but this was not the greatest chicken I have had. There was no flavor to my chicken and it was greasy. As for the cheddar waffles I did not taste any cheddar in them and they were kind of soggy too. My husband had the steak and he liked it. Service was excellent and very very prompt. This is probably the only reason I would give them a 3*. Over hyped... over rated... not going back","[1.0, 0.0]"
More of a bar with pizza than a pizza place. All pizza is salty but this was the saltiest pizza I've ever had. The predominant flavor is brine. The only bar I've ever been in even in NYC where you get charged tax above the price of the beer. One single beer bought at the bar before we moved to a bar-height table was priced at $7 but the cost was $7.62 (you get a receipt) which they rounded off in their favor so the coin part of the change for was thirty five cents. I gave them a twenty - I hope they didn't round off the bill part of the change in their favor as well - I just stuffed the change in my pocket as usual without counting.  It's one long narrow room packed with people on a Thursday night. Extremely loud - hard walls and ceiling - you have to shout in the ear of anyone you are attempting to have a conversation with.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is splendid, my friend and I was walking around the area looking for somewhere to eat when we notice this lovely little place. We had just come from another bar/restaurant that was over packed due to a party event but for a good cause. Even so, we really just wanted a simple place to hang. The night we were here at ""Grape and Grain,"" a jazzy band played cool relaxing music which went well with the mellow theme. I loved the home like feel to everything about the place, down to the un-matching plates each person received their food in. We went during the winter season, so coming out of the cold weather into a cozy little find like ""Grape and Grain"" was just what we needed. The food was nice but the wine bottle choice that my friend picked out was too bitter for my taste. It was a great find in a spot that we didn't think would be there!

"Come autumn, all I want to do is drink beer in the West Village. It has that glamorous, bohemian, ""New York"" feeling, that i'm-wasted-in-a-cozy-sweater feeling. That I-could-be-a-great-writer-if-i-really-tried feeling. So after two weeks of eating healthy and avoiding alcohol, I decided to cash in big time at Corner Bistro with my favorite dining partners: me, myself, and I. The crowd at 3pm on a weekday is old and haggard, with a smattering of GQ types and a few foodie tourists. I sat down at one of the ancient wooden tables, carved with various symbols and the names of previous customers, and promptly ordered a Cheeseburger ($6) and French Fries ($2.75). I read about a page of my book in peace, wondering whether I should've gone for the gold (McSorley's for $2.75) when my order magically appeared in front of me. The burger was huge eight-ouncer, with a familiar, juicy, homemade taste.The onions snapped off like broken rubber bands after the first bite, but they were raw, so no big loss there. On the other hand, the fries were pretty terrible and McDonald's-esque, with an aftertaste that sent me scrambling for the nearest dessert. But that burger and the calm, dark, autumnal atmosphere gave me such a great feeling that I really couldn't care less about the bummer frites. Next time I'll go for a burger, a beer, and the company of a few Hemingway types. We'll discuss the pros and cons of being married to the sea, trade wooly cardigans, and all will be right with the world.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I was mostly amazed by the crust which I just couldn't get enough of. It was to the point where I even took some crust pieces in my pocket to munch on once we left LOL.

"I'm biased, because this is where my boyfriend surprised me for Valentine's Day, but Buttermilk Channel is definitely worth a trip. I've been here on three separate occasions (twice for dinner, once for brunch), and the food has never failed to disappoint. They manage to make the standard brunch combination of eggs, veggies, ham and cheese a unique experience -- and that deserves some praise. The brunch is fairly priced, but dinner can quickly get expensive. The menu is pretty small, and has a gourmet, soul-food flare (they're known for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken).  All the entrees seem delicious, so I would recommend sharing if you can. Despite how full you might be at the end, you must order their Pecan Pie Sundae....two classic desserts combined into one giant glass of heaven.

"I had wanted to try Busters ever since I stumbled upon it on Yelp one day two years ago but the UWS is such a trek for me from Brooklyn. Opportunity presented itself last week when I visited my friend who lives on the UWS. We decided to have dinner at Busters and it did not disappoint. I was a little disappointed at first because the restaurant menu listed a variation on the smoked salmon sandwich's fillings. I had my eye on that sandwich after looking at the online menu which listed it as having capers, pickled onions, and cornichons, and I LOVE pickles. They were out of pickles but I decided to get the sandwich anyway. My smoked salmon sandwich on lightly toasted brioche with cream cheese, capers, and onions was heavenly and it was the perfect ratio of ingredients that left me satisfyingly full. My friend ordered the chicken burger made with free roaming, organic chicken. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal and neither one of us could stop commenting on how fresh and delicious our meals tasted. Both of our meals came with a side salad, each with a different dressing to compliment our meals, I assume. In addition, we got complimentary lemon cookies at the end! So yummy. Fidel was our server. He was so welcoming and knowledgeable about food, and his love for food was evident in the way he spoke about it. The whole experience was so delightful. We were so engrossed in our meals and with catching up that we didn't notice 2 hours had flown by, and no one gave us a hard time about lingering! I am so glad Busters extended its hours.  It was well worth the wait and the trip. I will definitely be making many more trips back to Busters.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to the location in Harlem many, many years ago and it was good. Unfortunately, I almost never go to Harlem so I was excited they were finally going to open up a location within walking distance of me, in Brooklyn. Let me say, I've eaten here three times, just to be sure...Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is overrated. The first time I tried them was for lunch. I ordered the ""Breakfast all day"" plate that comes with a sunny side up egg. I hate sunny side up eggs but forgot to ask the waitress to make it an over easy egg instead. When she brought my plate, I asked if they could just put the egg back on the griddle to make it over easy. Long story short, I was told NO, because the chef had given everyone very strict instructions on how that particular dish should be served and, in his opinion, it should be served with the egg sunny side up. Um, are you serious???? I was flabbergasted. Instead of ""arguing"" I just ate the dish as is. It was gross because the egg had the consistency of SNOT in my mouth. I just ate what I could and paid my check. In addition to the gross mouth feel of the egg, the cornbread was GOD AWFUL. The only flavor I could discern was what tasted like they use mop water in the batter. To be fair, Dino did make up for this gaffe with excellent customer service and a coupon. The next week my best friend wanted to treat me to dinner. She suggested Dino. I said okay since she really wanted to eat there. I orderd a drink and the appetizer sampler plate. Meh. It was just OKAY. Their deviled eggs were fine (but I've had better), their fried green tomatoes were fine, as well. Personally, I hate how messy the peel and eat shrimp were but they were fine, too. What wasn't fine was the chicken wings. TOUGH AS LEATHER! Are you kidding me? No way. She paid the bill, so I didn't complain. Last week, I was treated once again to Dino by my dad who was in town for the weekend. I ordered ribs this time. I was FIGHTING with these ribs. They were not succulent and tender, the way I am used to when my mother makes ribs. Personally, I like my ribs to fall off the bone. That was not the case with these ribs. I was actually fighting with them. One bone flew across the table because I had to put so much elbow grease into just trying to pull the ribs apart. Ridiculous. The flavor was good but all that effort/cardio involved was a major turn off. The mac and cheese is meh but the potato salad is pretty good. My brother did not enjoy his wings at all. My father said his food was fine but he wasn't raving over anything. We all agreed that the cornbread was trash and put them in the bucket as soon as the plates came to the table. I can't believe I'm about to say this but Dallas BBQ's is way better. I went last night and my chicken was SUCCULENT, tender, juicy and it FELL OFF THE BONE! I'm going back tonight! That's just how good it was. I really wanted to like Dino, but it won't be seeing me again.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I have yet to come here for brunch. Dinners here are always such a pleasure. Cafe Cluny is one of those restaurants that bank on ambiance. The restaurant is warmly lit with candle light which gives it a really romantic feel. It can be a little too cozy though. And often times you will be in other peoples conversation. Just work on mouth reading and you and your date should be fine. The food is really good. The pork tenderloin paired with mouth watering pairs is my favorite. The chicken too.

"The first thing that struck me about Graffiti is the size of the restaurant. It's small even for a New Yorker. I had read about it and decided to visit it but nothing prepared me for it. Having said that I have to mention, that if you just want to see the creative use of space then you have to pay a visit to Graffiti a. Even though it's a small place, you feel cozy rather than cramped. Chef Jehangir Mehta (who owns Graffiti) has added so many quirky design elements to the interiors of the restaurant that for a few minutes after entering you just look around in wonder, taking in all the personal touches to the design that make the place so warm and inviting. I really loved the funky animal chopsticks. The service at Graffiti is flawless. Actually that is how I spoke to Chef Mehta for the first time and heard that he was one of the participants on the Next Iron Chef. I now watch the show regularly and make sure I tell everyone that I have met him. The place is almost always full so I prefer to reserve my table, especially on Fridays. Though they do accept walk-ins, be prepared to wait for quite a while. Graffiti is always full! I don't like waiting for my food and that is another reason why I appreciate Graffiti so much. They serve food giving a detailed description of each preparation. This is something I really appreciate about the place. It makes you feel like they really know their food and they genuinely take pride in what they create. The proportions though small are filling and the best part is that nothing gets wasted. My favorite dish is the crunchy crostini and walnut salad as well as the watermelon feta salad. But no meal at Graffiti is complete without ordering atleast 2 portions of mango paneer!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It seems, perhaps, unfair to review a taco place on the basis of their coffee. That said, if you're going to charge $5.00 (plus tax) for a cup of coffee to go -- more than the price of one of the excellent-looking tacos, then you'd better stand behind it. I ordered the New Orleans Iced Coffee, 16 oz. size, for five bucks. I happen to love chicory coffee, and it's rare to find in these parts, so I splurged...especially when the friendly server was able to confirm for me that the coffee was kept in the fridge, and that I could indeed have mine without ice and that it would still be cold. I dislike very cold beverages; more than that, I dislike having my coffee diluted by melted ice before I've finished my cup. I watched as the friendly server's partner poured a half a cup of coffee for me, then poured a generous amount of milk in and -- seeing that it was still conspicuously not a full cup of coffee-- a second helping of milk. Even so, when it was placed in front of me on the counter, the cup was still only  three quarters full. I looked from the server to my cup  and back again, a surprised expression on my face. It either did not register with her, or she chose to ignore it, forcing me to ask her directly ""is the cup not full because I asked for it without ice?"" Yes, she smiled, that was correct, baldly admitting the truth. So, you charged me five and a half dollars for half a cup of coffee and a quarter cup if milk, and you have no problem with that?

We ordered the Margherita pie well done (I don't like a soggy center) with extra fresh basil and it was DELICIOUS!  The crust was perfect not too thick or too thin, the sauce was flavorful and there was just enough fresh mozzarella that you didn't feel guilty eating a slice or the whole pie, which we did :)  The staff is very accomodating and attentive.  We've made it our Saturday lunch spot and can't wait to try out all the other items on their menu.  Happy Eating!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Solid but not mind-blowing Italian. We started with the risotto arancini balls ($11) which were good but not the best I've had. The corn flavor was strong. I liked that but some might not.  I feel like the appetizers are a little overpriced, they're almost as much as the pastas. My husband had the gnocchi with mushrooms and cream ($15).  I loved this dish - the gnocchi were soft and pillowy and the cream sauce was a savory and a little bit more flavorful than a typical cream sauce.  I had the spatzle with brussels sprouts, kale and fontina ($15).  It was also good, but less exciting since I make pasta with roasted brussels sprouts at home a lot.  The sauce on this pasta was also a little watery.   The service was good.  The atmosphere is a little too ""cozy"" for me - tables are smushed together and if you're a table of 2 you'll likely effectively be at a table for 4 with two strangers.  This seems to be very common in NY, maybe because space is at such a premium in the city, but I'm not a fan of it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Believe the hype. I love this place. Their banh mi fries are perfectly fried and oh so delicious. The soy garlic chicken wings tastes great, are juicy and sizable. And their banh mi sandwiches are uh-mazing. I've tried the beef bulgogi, BBQ pork, lemongrass chicken, kakuni pork belly, the Joju, and the Joju Monster. They're all really good but my favorite is the Joju, followed by the beef bulgogi. I don't care much to have the green sauce because the sandwiches are tasty enough and I think the green sauce just makes it unnecessarily too spicy (even though I usually like spice). The sandwiches are pre-cut in half for you and are very large so you can definitely swap for the other half of a different banh mi with a friend to try different flavors, or even just eat half and be full. The drinks are pretty good as well. I like how they give a 10% student discount if you have your student ID. Love that they have loyalty punch cards as well, but I wish they don't have an expiration date. :( It is usually pretty packed in there during lunch time but the turnover is fast so you can get a seat if you wait for a teeny bit.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Everyone has said this before, but this place is so welcoming. We got here fairly early (10:45?) on a Sunday,  and so only had to wait about 7 minutes, but even so, the waitress came by twice with treats -- an orange slice and small chocolate chip cookie -- while we waited. A friend and I shared the pumpkin walnut pancakes and vegetable omelet with home fries. The omelet had lots of veggies, and the potatoes were not deep fried, like so many home fries, just lightly pan fried, yum. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I'm not sure I could really taste pumpkin, but still good, especially with the cinnamon butter they gave us (lemon and strawberry too). Other than the lack of pumpkin flavor, my only other minor complaint was that along with old-school price ($0.90) the coffee was old-school bodega quality, not the gourmet kind my spoiled tongue prefers. All in all, a delicious, fun brunch, and definitely a great place to take guests to show off the charms and warmth of the neighborhood.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here this past Friday night with 2 friends. It was a bit busy, but def not packed. Hats off to the chef because the food was really good! Some of the best pub fare around. The burger and fries are delicious, as was the dessert. The reason I am giving 2 stars is because the service was TERRIBLE. We waited 15 minutes for drinks (we were seated about 5 feet from the bar) and were told that our waitress never put them in due to some ""mix up."" Then, we ordered food and waited 35 minutes to get our burgers. When we ordered dessert, that took way too long too. So did the check. We became embarrassed for the wait staff. I'm not sure if they were short staffed or what, but the place was really not busy. When the server dropped off our check, she nonchalantly said ""sorry about the service."" If they were aware of the poor service (they had 3 chances (drinks, entrees, dessert, check) to make it up to us) the very very least they could have done was comped part of our meal. Apologies to the wonderful kitchen, but I will not be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"i've heard about this place for ages and i've been dying to come and check it out.  it's just it's out of the way and i don't want to come during prime time and deal with the wait in case this place doesn't live up to its hype.   well, the time finally came.  i went, ate and well, here is my review and i am sad to report that i am only giving this place 3 stars. i drove there on a weekday so i didn't have to wait.  there were ample seats and the staff there was super duper friendly.  i also liked the decor of the place a lot.  the menus are cute and the concept is cute. i am giving this place 3 stars because the food was ehhhhh.  it did not live up to the hype and i can't see why so many people are crazy over it.   food ordered: carolina pulled pork box - this came with a side, pickles and pulled pork on a small bun.  the side chosen was the breakfast sausage patties and those were delish.  it had a lot of seasoning in it and i liked this.  it's a flat patty look, kind of similar to the sausage patties at mcdonalds.  the pulled pork itself was disappointing.  it had no taste.  it wasn't dry or juicy or anything.  i felt like it was missing some pizzazz.  it needed some type of sauce or something to make it more flavorful.  this dish was not worth $11 for the amount of pork given.  the portion was tiny and the bun was tiny.  this was not a full size sandwich.  i would give this a pass. fried chicken box - this came with a side biscuit and 3 pieces of chicken.  the side chosen was the hush puppies and that was good.  it wasn't out of this world good, but it was the best part of this dish.  the white meat chicken was bland as heck.  the fried skin had no flavor in it whatsoever.  i can't say this chicken was dry, but then it wasn't juicy either.  i did not like the white meat at all.  as for the dark meat thigh, that was better.  the fried skin wasn't flavorful either.  it's like they forgot to add the seasoning or something.  there was crunch, but what's the point to crunch if it has no taste?  you might as well not eat it.   the dark meat itself was okay.  not dry, not juicy, but just okay.  i would gladly pay $13 for this IF the fried chicken was good.   renegade - this drink was a mixture of lemon, honey and ginger.  not too bad.  i would drink this again.   i don't think i'll be back.  i would if the fried chicken lived up to the hype.  how do you mess up fried chicken?  even kfc tastes better.  they need to do something about the seasoning to the chicken.  i can't speak for the other items on the menu, but don't think i'll be back to try them.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bad things first: you have to wait and wait and wait and wait, oh and did I mention wait? If you haven't made a reservation be prepared to wait anywhere between 1-2 hours. And when you have to stand in the cold for 1.5 hours (yes it really did happen), the pizza better be really good. Which it was, really really good pizza. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza for 3 of us, the size was perfect with 8 slices.. one of which we had to run out with unless we wanted to miss our broadway show. The pizza has a very thin crust and is loaded with enough pepperoni to give me a heart attack. A little more cheese on the pizza wouldn't have hurt but thats only because I love it so much. My friends seems to think it was just about right or it would've weighed down the slices. Our server was extremely busy but did her best to attend to us every now and then. In fact, when we let her know we were running late and our pizza took longer than ever, she gave us a free breadstick basket. Woohoo! The dipping sauce for the sticks was nothing like I've ever had before, LOVED IT! You know the pizza is good when you take your first bite, when people stand in line for hours for it. In the rain. In the mean streets of NYC (I'm only half kidding). My advice is to plan ahead if you don't have a reservation. Trust me, you don't want to run on the streets while eating that last slice so you don't miss the opening line of Chicago. Esp. if its your first broadway show ever. Yummy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We ordered Beef Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade, East & West Coast Oysters, Skate, and the Rack of Lamb. Initially, I was a little grumpy about the high menu prices until the food came. I must say, the portions are huge! The ingredients are fresh and of high quality (menu prices are justified!).  I walked out perfectly content despite the slimmer wallet. The relaxed atmosphere and seating makes you feel like a human being and not just another ticket. I look forward to trying the pigeon on my next visit. 1. The Oysters were delicious and perfectly chilled. We preferred the West coast oysters as they were meatier, brinier, and more flavorful. The East coast tended to taste more ""clean"". Both oysters did not have a metallic taste some people enjoy. Overall, at $3.50 a pop for the West coast and $3 for the East, it was quite pricey. I rather pop over to aqua grill. (2.5 out of 5) 2. The infamous bone marrow. To be honest, I felt quite disgusted after finishing one of the bones. I guess I have a mental threshold which permits me from enjoying too much excess - although I don't think most people will have problems finishing this. While people go on about how bone marrow is flavorful, it really isn't. Hence, the little bowl of salt which is brought with the dish. The real gem was the rustic oxtail marmalade which tasted like sticky braised short ribs and carrots in a heavy wine reduction. I wish I could say, ""I ate this in France."" Delicious! I grew up eating bone marrow so this did not have an ""exotic"" appeal. (3 out of 5) 3. The skate was perfectly cooked. Crispy skin and meaty interior. The accompanying side of shrimp, potato, and bacon matched well with the skate. However, the bacon was overly salty and brought the meal down a notch. (3 out of 5) 4. The rack of lamb was delicious. It had a nice char and a ring of fat around the medallions. Excellent cut. It came with mashed potatoes and spinach. To me, the mashed potatoes were a little bland but my gf enjoyed it very much. Nothing the jus could not solve. Speaking of which, the jus was so good. It was flavorful without being heavy or overwhelming.  (3.5 out of 5)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So I remember passing by this place a few times this past year and always having the same reaction; ""Omg this place looks so cute, finally a hipster joint right by where I live, need to stop by ASAP with some friends"". And then weeks pass by and Im too caught up with my hectic schedule to remember the cute little grilled cheese haven wedged in between Pollo Loco ( or whatever it's called) and Avon. UNTIL TODAY! I woke up this morning with a migraine and immediately remembered that I had a ton of research to do, couldn't find my phone charger, ran out of coffee and there was no more hot water. Oh boy. If I don't get my coffee fix Hurricane Sophia is going to wreck the streets of Astoria. And so I grabbed my laptop, cell phone and keys and went on my way to Starbucks. As Im walking towards Steinway in the sweltering heat with the anticipation of once again struggling to find peace of mind or a seat at a ridiculously over crowded and overly loud Starbucks, I spot the Queens Kickshaw. And would you believe me if I said that the birds started to sing, and the sun shined just a little bit brighter, and my feet no longer dragged themselves but skipped all the way to the Kickshaw. I walk in hoping for the best but expecting the worst as I always am when I go to study at Starbucks ( on Steinway). First observance: No loud chess players taking up half the seats. Good sign. No baby carriages blocking the way to the cash register...okay. No hobo sitting in the corner screaming nonsense?! NO WAY! This. Is. Awesome. I approach the cash register and I encounter an extremely likable cashier/ counter girl. I didn't catch her name but she was super sweet, very laid back and was quick to explain how the ordering worked at the Queens Kickshaw. She seemed genuinely interested in how I came across the kickshaw, and she even complimented me on my shirt :). I placed my order ( classic grilled cheese and an iced coffee) and sat down on one of the stool benches towards the back of the cafe. Finally I don't have to fight over outlets to charge my laptop. The food came promptly and was really delicious. Everything you expect from a great grilled cheese sandwich: Warm, buttery, golden brioche encasing an oozey medley of melted cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Ahhh soooo good. What was even better though was the iced coffee. Let me just say this: THEY HAVE SUGAR WATER. I always ask for sugar water in my iced coffee at dunkin donuts, at Starbucks, at the local cafe shop and this is the first time I actually get it! Without asking! So I stayed there for a total of three hours and worked productively on my work. They play calm jazz music during the early afternoon which gives the place a nice chill vibe. Around 7 they change the music to alternative rock which I LOVED. They played the strokes and Two Door Cinema Club. The waiters there show up at around 6 and they all seem pretty cool. Tattoos and gages and all. One of them approached me to see if I would like anything which I appreciated. He was the same guy I payed at the register and he was really nice, smiling while doing his job which I really like. Besides the nice atmosphere here I really loved the food, thought it was worth the money. The iced coffee was the best iced coffee Ive had in while. Not the kind that is masked by loads of sweet flavored syrup. But REAL robust coffee flavor that a true coffee lover would appreciate. This place gets 5 stars for atmosphere, great food and a very likable and down to earth staff. Will be back soon!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The three stars does not mean that this restaurant was bad - it was actually very good, it just wasn't anything special.   The restaurant itself is about as cramped as cramped can get... I was actively engaged in the conversation my neighbors were having because we basically sat at the same table.  This isn't a horrible thing, though.  It gives everything a cozy feel. For dinner we ordered the Tavern Steak and the Black Label Burger.  I have to say, neither blew our minds.  If you are looking for an actual slab of beef steak unlike you have ever had, this isn't the place for it.  The steak was thin and rather small, but filled you up.  The Black Label Burger is their shining achievement, and while it was good it was not the best burger I have ever had.  We also ordered the sautéed spinach as a side and that was delicious! For dessert we ordered the Belgian Chocolate Soufflé with a scoop of ice cream and that was probably the best part of the whole meal - it was delicious and we aren't even dessert people.   All-in-all the restaurant was good, and not saying I wouldn't go back; but with all the hype I was hoping for something a little more earth shattering, especially at the very expensive price tag.","[1.0, 0.0]"

How is it that I hadn't seen a server in 10 min.   The food was ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.  The burgers were, in fact, dripping with grease and tasted so-so. The taste came from the onions and cheese - less so the beef.  The sauces were ok at best.  The fries were served hot and seasoned well. Glad I tried it but as there are so many spots around that serves burgers, I'll shop around more before returning.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"OVERRATED!!!!  Since working in and around Tribeca since 2006 this place to me seems to have lost it luster and IT FACTOR!  I gave it another try after having brunch here one day and it didn't impress me not one bit.  On a business lunch meeting, I tried the meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  WHY???  So apparently the meatloaf was wrapped in bacon... I did my research prior to ordering and the plate arrived, and the food was cold.  The bacon was rubbery and the meatloaf lacked flavor.  Topped with onion ring crisp, I still didn't enjoy after every bite.  It was a very busy lunch hour and I understand the business part, but if you know your'e going to be busy, everything from the kitchen to the front door needs to be up to standards.  Later that evening, let's just say the food didn't ""hit me well""  I'm so glad I was home to relieve myself. Thanks Bubby's for keeping me up all night and turning on the faucet!!  My stomach is very mad at me.  I suggest, stick to the dessert menu.  I'm NOT A FAN!!!!!!

"If the eyes are ""the window into the soul"" then Perry Street needs a new host because this restaurant host never made eye contact. with us; his customers. We should have known that we had just entered restaurant ""hell"" and our souls were damned. We entered  the restaurant,and were not welcomed upon entering, but patiently waited until the host (no not on the phone and no idea what is more important than a customer in front of him) had time to look up and then ask what our party name was and then seated us.. We then looked at the limited menu and ordered our  food which was ""okay"" no wows at the table but okay. The appetizers were the most exciting item on the menu everything else ""okay."" At the end of our meal we then went back to the host and again he is not on the phone, not busy, but is writting on a pad of paper  (what his memoirs of contact with those pesky customers ) and once again does not look up till I loudly ask ""could you call us a cab?"" his reply, ""no but I can call you a town car or you can walk two blocks up and get a cab."" We did decide to walk and will never walk back into Perry Street. What an overall disappointing dining experience. Save your time and money there is beter out there.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My fiance and I went to Palo Santo to celebrate our engagement. We had never been there before, but decided to try the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings. The service was admittedly slow, but very friendly. We showed up for our reservation at 6, were ignored until 6:30, and didn't finish the tasting until after 9. If you plan on going, try to go after 7 when service has had time to pick up.. But as far as the cuisine goes, the food was phenomenal. Every course was incredible. The flavors were simple, clean and so fresh. The best meal I've had in ages. The food is all seasonal and the menu changes on an almost daily basis. If you are lucky enough to go on a day when the Green Curried Duck Breast is on the menu, go for it. It will blow your mind.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"YUM! This place is wonderful! Okay, so! My boyfriend and I stayed in NYC for a couple of days and our bus back to MA got canceled due to snow so we wanted to soak up our extra night with a relaxing dinner. Our friend actually recommended Carmine's to us knowing how much we love good authentic ""family style"" food. So, we made a reservation for 9:30. There was a huge dining room on the first floor and second floor which was much needed since it was packed! (Good sign!) We sat on the second floor with a large window next to us. We sat at a small table for 2 with white table cloths. The bread that was given to us was awesome because they had various selections, we love bread! The only thing we would have liked is olive oil to soak up, but either way it was fine. Our waiter was really outgoing, we ordered the stuffed artichokes and manicotti. When we ordered he told us how much he loved those dishes and went into detail about them which was really great because he made us feel comfortable with our decision. The stuffed artichokes were HUGE!!! On the plate was huge two artichokes stuff with a breading of sorts and was soaking in a little butter at the bottom. They were absolutely delicious although we didn't finish them, we took them back with us for a midnight snack. The manicotti was to die for!! The pasta and cheese literally melted in your mouth and the sauce on top wasn't too thick which complimented the pasta without drowning it out. We would've got dessert but we were so full and we saw the couple next to us get the Strawberry Shortcake and it was humongous!!! They seemed to enjoy it! If you're super hungry and want wonderful, Family Style Italian food...this is the place! And it's right off of Times Square so you can walk that full stomach off a bit! We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends and will be back next time we're in the city!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"PROS: good ramen, convenient location if you're going to see a Broadway CONS: long wait with NO call/text option so you have to stand there, NOT FRIENDLY STAFF, loud, rushed meal, large parties may be split up (or choose to wait even longer), cash only, pork buns not as good as Ippudo's. COMPARISON:  Ippudo has a far better system set up for people waiting (they take your number and they'll call your phone) AND their staff is much nicer.  The seating is also far less cramped.  Pork buns at Totto are also much fattier than less seasoned/flavored than Ippudo's.  The miso ramen at Totto was also far inferior to Ippudo's Akamaru Modern. Got here at 5:50pm on a Saturday night.  They open for dinner at 5:30pm.  We were a group of 4, put ourselves on the list and waited... and waited... and waited for a total of 1 hour.  Because they don't have the option of leaving your phone number to be called, you can't really walk around.  If they call your name and you're not there, they will move on with the list.  HOWEVER, when people-who-put-their-names-on-the-list-and-left (during which time their name was called) came back, the woman in charge would let them now be at the top of the list.  If this is the policy, why should anyone stick around?  I could have been warm somewhere too if I hadn't been standing on a smelly sidewalk waiting for 1 hour. Anyhow, we were asked if our group of 4 could be split into two groups of 2 for faster seating.  We agreed.  My parents sat down at the ""bar"" in front of the kitchen and ordered.  My husband and I were seated next to them shortly afterwards.  Between the three of us, we were going to order 3 bowls of ramen and then get Kaedama (Extra Noodles).  My parents had already ordered the Spicy Ramen for $10.25 and the Chicken Paitan Ramen for $9.25 when my husband and I sat down.  The waitress wasn't paying attention to us, so I asked one of the cooking staff (we were seated right in front of them) if I could have an extra bowl.  They handed one to me and I began to steal some noodles from my mom.  As soon as I did this, the waitress was in front of us angrily demanding that we order something and informing us that there is a minimum expenditure of $5 per person, or we should leave.  I thought this was really rude.  No one had given us a chance to order yet, and anyhow, if you did the math, our group of 4 was already almost at their ""minimum"" (which is not written anywhere!). My husband ordered the Totto Miso Ramen for $10.25 and I ordered a pork bun.  Both my dad and my husband also ended up ordering extra noodles ($2.50 x 2) AND extra toppings (about $5 worth) so we were comfortably over the spending minimum.  While I understand the staffs' concern about people not ordering and taking up spots in a restaurant that only seats 20, I think it was inappropriate to chastise people who haven't even been given a chance to order.  Also, no where did we see this minimum in writing (not on the menu, not on the website). Furthermore, as soon as there are no more visible noodles in your bowl, they basically try to push you out the door, with their hands already reaching to clean up before you're finished sipping your broth. The ramen was good (my dad said it was the best he's ever had, but then again he's only ever had real ramen once before) and very reasonably priced, but I don't think I'd come back here because of the wait, the service, and the inconvenient location.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Incredible food! There is a trick to getting right in on a fri/sat night. Although they dont accept reservations you ca call ahead on the same day you plan on coming, they start this around 4pm. So say you want to go Sat. night, call they place around 4pm on saturday and tell them you plan on coming at lets say 7:30, they will put your name on a list and you get there at 7:30 and you'll wait 5 min. max. Ive done this 4 times and it always works. Good luck getting a table if you don't do this! The food is great, try the squash pasta and the brussel sprouts. Both are perfect. And for dessert I am in love with the sea salt and olive oil chocolate mousse. Best dessert i've ever had. This is hands down my favorite italian place in Brooklyn. Great wine selection too!

"I wish I was allowed to swear on here, because I don't know how to express my absolutely awesome experience here without using some forceful expressions. As I showed up with my girlfriend for our 9PM reservation we were greeted warmly and seated promptly without a fuss, even though the restaurant was pretty busy and bustling at this point. We started with a mini seafood tower that wasn't very mini at all, and absolutely delish. Some other reviewer wrote about the shrimp, and they are that good. Next up: rib-eye for two. Probably one of the best pieces of steak I've had in a long time. Sides were also really good, but were kind of left in the wake of the the main dishes. There was this cauliflower gratin though, which was good enough on its own as maybe an appetizer or so. We skipped dessert this time, but our server caught that me and my girlfriend was celebrating a promotion, and discreetly brought over two glasses of sparkling dessert wine on the house. How's that for attentive service? I am hard pressed for negatives; it is a cool bar scene, but even if it looked busy over at the bar, our table in the back room was quiet and secluded. This one of my new favorite spots, and I think it is great either for a date, or maybe a medium sized group of foodie carnivores? F%^k yeah!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We've been here before and enjoyed. We have two of Lydia's cookbooks and watch her on PBS. Becco is her casual family dining restaurant in Manhattan. It's a busy spot and can have the feeling that you're just a number rather than a valued guest. Has a good wine list, especially the $25/bottle list. Food was decent, but not spectacular.  Mitch is a waiter that has been there many years and being sensitive to the needs of his tables is not high on his list. I found his manor quite offensive, rude, and unhelpful. He probably isn't going anywhere so he can get away with what he wants. Very opposite of the feel I get from what I've read and seen of Lydia. One of the managers, Ray, is very accommodating and sensitive to the needs of his guest.

"I have to laugh: though I was obviously excited for a Sweet Chick to open in Manhattan, Yelp, as well as Google Maps, showed this L.E.S. location to be virtually equidistant to their Williamsburg location, with the L.E.S. location being a mere 2/10ths of a mile closer. Still, I'll take it. Ha! I arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night, and while waiting for my two friends and their two kids, I put in a good word with the hostess that they were on their way, and she was kind enough to put a table on hold for us until they arrived. (Too kind, really. Thanks!) Upon arrival, we were led to the rear of the restaurant; this place is easily three times the size of it's Williamsburg counterpart. I've only had brunch, so I was curious to see their ""regular"" menu. Though many of the special chicken & waffle specials appealed to me, I did go with the good ol' original, but opted for their dried cherry waffles. It was a choice well made, adding a delightful burst of tart sweetness to many of my bites. As for the chicken...well, it'll be a cold day in Hell if I ever say it's bad. Hell remained very hot that day. Ha!  I also ordered the ""Ramble On..."", a mix of white rum, raspberries, elderberry, and lime. Refreshing! It was actually my first alcoholic beverage I've had at either Sweet Chick, as I usually go with the Arnold Palmer Soda at their other location; glad I finally got to try an adult beverage with my chicken and waffles! I don't often get to eat out with kids here in the city, but they're certainly very accommodating. It was easy enough to order them each a small stack of waffles and juice. Also, J Dilla's ""So Far To Go"" provided them a good chance to break out their dance moves. Ha! (Oh, to be five again...) So happy to have y'all on the Isle of Manhattan!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went on Friday night and it was awesome.  I actually was a bit of a hater on Carmines before but this was really one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. The waiter made the suggestion that an appetizer and a first plate could be shared and then for each of us (was just me and a friend) to order our own main plate.  I appreciated him letting us know that the portions were done so that we didn't over order.  We went with the Insalata di Bocconcini for appetizer and it was fantastic...fresh mozzerella, soprasatta, peppers, olives, etc. Next up the fresh made ravioli stuffed with a puree of goat cheese and pears.  Unreal.  I love cheese and fruit together, especially pears.  This was the highlight of the meal for me. Then Pollo alla paesana...chicken on the bone, sausage, peppers and porcini mushrooms in a balsamic reduction sauce.  I had this once before and it was really fantastic.  No room for dessert...I wish I could have done it but I just ran out of room.   Fantastic meal, great place.  Word to the wise...we showed up at 9pm and sat down immediately.  For a place like this it's best to avoid the rush...

"I don't know what happened to Gramercy.  I've been a bunch of times, each one more spectacular than the next.  However, my visit on Wednesday was not a bad meal, per se, but if all I wanted was a decent meal, there are many places in Manhattan that do that for under $84pp. First of all, we would have loved the tasting menu, but we had a vegetarian in the group and 4 of the 5 dishes on the vegetable menu had meat.  Not just chicken stock, but lardo, razor clams, etc. etc.  We know they will make substitutions, but substituting 4 of 5 dishes is extreme.  Further, it seems that Gramcery has embraced the recession - the whole menu, which now costs $112 was utterly not worth it in terms of what was served.   We ordered off the regular menu and everyone was pleased well enough, but nobody wowed, as we usually are.  The flat iron steak tasted like pot roast.  The duck breast was crusted with some random crunchy things that destroyed the texture of duck breast.  The food seemed scaled back on quality, but upped way high to foodie land.  Leave the weird foodie stuff to wd-50 and its ilk.  That's not why people go to Gramercy. But the most disappointing part was the lackluster service.  The reason Gramercy was my favorite restaurant is because going there is a pure experience.  We felt rushed to order, the menu was not explained well, the options were not presented well, our waiter forgot stuff, the cheeses are not longer presented tableside and our waiter royally screwed up our plate (had no idea what was on it after he told us he would make a selection of 5).  The fish entree was served cold and we couldn't find our waiter to warm it up.  We eventually flagged down a different waiter who, it seems, just popped the whole thing in the microwave, partially picked apart and all.  And finally, the signature coffee cakes were practically thrown at us and not explained.  In the past, we have been given a small spiel that wrapped up the evening.  It looked like this waiter couldn't wait to get out. It's a disappointment.  Gramercy has effectively lost it's billing as our special splurge restaurant.  We'll give it another try in the future, but our experience left us with a bitter taste.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Full disclosure in posting this review: I am friends with the Executive Chef's husband. So yeah, I'm biased. But damn, this was a phenomenal experience by any objective measure. Note that I won't cover every last dish below--there was a lot of food! Super friendly service to start. We were there before the dinner rush, but still, we felt like honored guests throughout the evening. Nice. Beer selection: wonderful. It's August on the US East Coast, so having a choice of saisons (in particular) was simply perfect. Very nice to see local breweries, but I was also impressed that they had MA gypsy brewer Pretty Things on the menu. Slick. Starter: I'd hate to take away from the truly excellent main & dessert, but damn, the appetizers are a course in themselves and simply rocked. It was a tasty flurry, of which I best remember the fresh pretzel roll, clam-in-a-blanket-of-lettuce thing, smoked bluefish pate (wow!), and a mind-blowing fruit salad prepared especially for us since we're pescetarian and would not be having the standard meatballs. Main: we both had striped bass with a zucchini pancake and stewed sungold tomatoes. Bass was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes really shined here; they were like little flavor bombs that you wanted with every bite. Pancake seemed to be mostly for texture, but doesn't mean it wasn't well-executed. Lastly, we were spoiled with a double helping of dessert as well. First up was a very cute little pie with ice cream (I think...pretty dazed by this point in the best sense), followed by a plate about which my late mother would have said, ""It's too pretty to eat"". This included chocolate and white chocolate, a macaroon...did I mention a daze? On the decor and aesthetic, I'd summarize as Oregon Trail without the dysentery. Cool!

They even have you on file when you're too busy to get online so you don't have to repeat your info - which is the most annoying thing when you're starving and speaking to someone with an accent. Food: Roti Canai is probably one of the best I've tasted and I'm Thai/Malaysian. They give you just enough for an appetizer. That piece of chicken literally melts in your mouth and the curry sauce is not too creamy, not too sweet, perfect with potato. The pancake is paper thin,, almost crepe like and equally soft and crispy. MMM. Tofu Satay was good. Pretty standard fried tofu with peanut sauce. I used hoisin and siracha instead though because tofu and the sweetness of the peanut sauce can be a little over powering. **Mee Siam is fanfuckingtastic. The first bite brought me back to childhood. It's exactly how my grandma made it growing up. It's like pad thai but with vermicelli noodles. Generous portion of shrimp, light tofu, noodles and seasoning were on point. It's got the right amount of fire (mild) but make sure to ask for hot sauce if you like it spicy since they don't give you condiments for delivery. Amazing. Lawd Jesus, hallelu. My friend ordered curry laksa which was also very good. Thick noodles with a generous side of spicy, lemon grass curry sauce. There was a variety of greens/veggies mixed with the noodles... I can't recall but it tasted great. Good for someone who likes the spicy and sour combo. The prices are great too. Absolutely love this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"$54 for 7 people....for DINNER! And um, for really delicious food! We were all full at the end and deeply satisfied. This isn't a fancy spot but it's great savory Malaysian food and it will fill you easily without you needing to reach deep into your wallet. I've been to Nyonya many a time since I was a kid and it's still that good! This was my first time at this location and I thought it was cool that it's updated with a bit of a contemporary feel - very appropriate for NY right now, esp in that neighborhood. The roti with curry is a classic must have appetizer. The coconut rice is also one of my favorite staples. And last night I ordered my usual Seafood Scramble Egg Chow Fun. It's so good! Usually I can eat the entire dish myself but I actually already had dinner before coming so I only had half (split with my hubs). It hasn't failed me yet. I'll be back for more. *note: this isn't the place you go to for a fancy ambiance, service or super cool clean bathrooms.

For a busy Saturday the entrance gets bottlenecked with people lining up to talk to the hostess. With as much volume they do during this time period I was surprised to see that it was so unorganized. Once we sat down the restaurant did not feel over crowded, so that was a good.

"Went here yesterday with my sister in hopes of finding some good latin food. Took the subway from manhattan and walked a few blocks to find this (I searched latin on yelp and this place came up so we tried it.) IT WAS THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD, I'm contemplating going back today haha. We ordered chicken quesedillas, an empanada sampler ]2 chicken, 2 steak], a order of guacamole &chips, and an arepa. The chicken quesedillas were the most outstanding food I've ever had before in my life and the empananadas were to die for. You MUST get both of these if you go there. The guacamole was great too and I just got a plain white arepa but it was delishhh. The service is great too. We had a nice bubbly waitress who had really cool africa earrings on haha.

"I had read some good reviews on yelp about the red cat in the past and hoped to try it out which I eventually did with a friend on a Sunday. I must say my dinner experience was definitely worth writing about. Getting a reservation was really easy w/o any wait. Ambience: it had a classy modern look to it with dim red lightening. On entering we noticed that they seemed to be a lot of older couples and families seating at the tables so we opted for bar seating which seemed more casual. Food: I definitely enjoyed every bit of my meals For appetizers I had the tempura green beans with some tangy/spicy sauce (was told by the bartender had wasabi in it). The beans were really crunchy and seemed to melt in your mouth with each bite. The tangy sauce gave the beans a great flavored kick leaving you wanting to more of it, especially since I really enjoy spicy food. For dinner I had the Polenta. For a first time polenta eater I must say I became a fan!!. I definitely enjoyed the marinara sauce with the mozzarella cheese. It kind of tasted like lasagna but 10times better. For dessert I had the banana ice-cream sandwich. From looking me the name I expected it to look like an actual sandwich. Although I was quite disappointed in my expectation I did get the best tasting dessert. It came with a really nice caramel cake with a scoop of peanut butter ice-cream and then some crunchy peanuts on the side (delish!!!). Drinks: I gave my review a four star based on their drink menu, not much stuck out on their drink menu, so I had a glass of regular champagne. Service: I enjoyed their overall service. The bartender was awesome and really friendly. The service was very prompt. Overall recommendation: It's definitely a great date spot or a restaurant for a night out with the family. I would definitely return for some great polenta and amazing green beans.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Have only been for breakfast, but it's heavenly! The blueberry pancakes are amazing -- chock full of delicious, juicy blueberries, with a wonderful caramel-y maple syrup on the side. Also recently had one of the breakfast specials, a waffle topped with caramelized apples, cinnamon sour cream and walnuts. OMG, so good!!! Even their end-of-the-day biscuits (savory) are ridiculously good. Only two drawbacks: 1) It's a bit pricey and 2) The coffee here is not great (think diner-style-weak brew). However, it remains that the quality of the baked goods and breakfasts far outweighs the coffee problem and is worth the occasional splurge for a hearty breakfast. If you must have a good cup of joe with breakfast, maybe consider a carry-out pastry and tote it along to your fave coffee shop... that is, if they'll allow it :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My boyfriend and I decided to have our date night here because we were in the mood for French food.  We were seated immediately (although we got there around 6 pm) and our waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  She also helped us decide what to order, which ended up being great choices--pan seared chicken with mashed potatoes and mushrooms, and parisienne mussels.  I'm usually wary of ordering mussels but we loved them-not too fishy, great texture, and wonderful broth with fresh vegetables.  The chicken was delicious too-it wasn't dry, was quite savory, and I picked it to the bone.  Mushrooms complimented perfectly.  Also, our waitress had us try the ""floating island"" dessert because we inquired about it, which I didn't end up finishing because it was too sweet for me.  She brought us creme brulee instead and only charged us for one dessert!  The only negative thing I could possibly say is that the bathroom was kind of icky.  Otherwise, it's a small, intimate setting that's perfect for a date and the price is ideal.  We will be returning.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After having recently been to New Orleans for vacation I'm definitely more critical of any cajun/creole restaurants I encounter outside of the big easy. Just a quick side note if you do visit Nawlins make sure you do some research before on where you want to eat out at. Only cause of the sheer number of fantastic choices available. So Sugar Freak is a great restaurant and I highly suggest it to anyone reading this review. Staff is friendly, prices are not too pricey. The decor is really great and they were playing great music in there. Drinks were strong and they have all the new orleans classics (zombie, hurricane, sazerac, pimm's cup). Its really romantic inside. Its not small but you might have to wait a bit for a table on busy nights. The food here is great and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on their menu. I kept it traditional and got the jambalaya. You can customize most of the dishes they offer so I told them to put some fried shrimp on top. The rest of my group also went the traditional route getting fried chicken, po'boys, and catfish platter. They have different batters for the friend chicken including a spicy crust (which I didn't try) and a cinnamon sugar, chill spice, and cherry pepper. You can get mac n cheese plain but also jazz it up (see what I did there) by adding other cajun specialities like crawfish or jambalaya. They also have brunch which has a lot of the stuff from the dinner menu and a ton of other crazy mashups. The only gripe I had was the waffles were really really bland. They just need to add something to the batter. I did see they offer some other flavors and ingredients for the waffles. Great restaurant and I will be back here for brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"There are many ways to prepare a tuna ""burger."" For starters, one could serve a seasoned section of tuna steak grilled to rare or medium rare on a bun with condiments and the standard lettuce, tomato, and onion. Or, finely chopped tuna could be formed into a patty with seasonings and grilled to rare or medium rare. However, I would not advise serving ground (yes, actually ground, not finely chopped or minced) tuna cooked to a dry, tasteless, cat food-like texture and served merely with the same lettuce that comes in the accompanying salad. Perhaps the tuna was pre-cooked or canned and that's why they couldn't promise me even a medium-rare burger (apparently they ""tried""). I suppose I should have known better than to follow through with my order once I realized the waitress couldn't explain to me how it was prepared. Perhaps you will enjoy Mooncake Foods, as most other reviews seem positive. But if you have any respect for tuna, wait until your next date with the sushi restaurant.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been going to Saigon Shack for a couple of years now and it's still incredible. I use to go to Pho Grand and a few other joints around town, but after my vietnamese foodie friend said Saigon Shack had the best pho broth, I had to try it. Once we had it, that was it, we only go to Saigon Shack. Another vietnamese friend from Seattle told me Saigon Shack is also as good if not better than Seattle. The prices are also $1 more than your places in chinatown, and there isn't a size option for pho like the other places... but you're getting some authentic stuff. Pho is great here. Bun is pretty good. Banh mi is so good (including the duck banh mi). Spring and summer rolls are awesome. Overall the place is a well oiled machine... it's a no-nonsense place where you go in, order within a minute of sitting down, and you get your food probably within 5 minutes and then you get your cheque maybe 10 mins after that. The lines seem long - even when they are out the door, but with the above turn around, you should be waiting more than 15 mins.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Beef Noodle soup and the Wonton Noodle soup are AMAZING! Delicious, not too salty broth, perfectly cooked noodles, tender meats and wontons (not too thick wrappers which is perfect because i don't think anyone wants to have too much wrapper and miss the filling)....

"I honestly don't know how this restaurant gets such rave reviews.  Me and my girls took a taxi from the Bronx to Brooklyn to try this restaurant after reading all of the glowing reviews on Yelp.  This atmosphere is fantastic and the waiters are courteous and helpful. The bathrooms are clean. But IMO the food is just all right.  Reading the reviews my mouth watered and I couldn't wait to try the pecan encrusted pork chops with sweet potatoes and collards.  Pork chops were just o.k. - thin and kind of dry.  Sweet potatoes were good but then again it's hard to mess up a sweet potato. Collards were good.  My sister had a salmon burger with fries. Fries were excellent; salmon burger was just o.k. My other sister had baked or steamed salmon.  She said it was dry.  Someone else said the macaroni was definitely on point. I had some kind of shrimp spring roll as an appetizer that DID NOT have any shrimp in it!!! The drinks were weak - too much ice, not enough liquor. The first few sips were o.k. and then it was like drinking koolaid.  Not only that, it took about 45 minutes for our food to come.  Maybe I should have had the chicken and waffles that everyone raves about instead","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Just amazing. I almost can't find English words to express what my happy tastebuds experienced. The hostess brought us to our table. Shortly after our waitress came by but we weren't ready. Then a different server came and took our drink orders. He gave us a suggestion and it turned out to be so smooth and flavorful, I actually enjoyed sipping it. My date ordered cold sake. When it was delivered, it was a beautiful piece of art. The sake was resting on a bowl of ice in a rotund opaque test tube, with matching mini cups for us. Our Homemade Tofu came with three varieties of tasting salts. So good! You can really taste the difference of homemade tofu versus prepackaged tofu. It's so fresh. We ordered the Mini Kaisen Don and Salmon Don and Torora Soba. The man who's been serving us turns out to be the manager of the establishment. His service was excellent. We had planned to walk off our fullness and get dessert elsewhere, but after glancing at the dessert menu we were hooked. The manager suggested the Traditional Japanese Dessert. It's not called that but I can't find the name. It consists of green tea ice cream, green tea gelee, sweet red bean paste and sweetened condensed milk. We substituted the green tea ice cream for earl grey ice cream and it was the Best Call we've ever made. I highly recommend this place. Although pricey, it's great for a special occasion.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"With over 2600 reviews, this place certainly isn't begging for an additional endorsement from little old me. So this is for my DC Yelper friends back home who have somehow overlooked this little food cart on their trips to the Big Apple. I was lured here by NY friends who kept raving about the addictive chicken and rice. Be warned, the food here induces somewhat of a delayed reaction. - Pre-meal thoughts: Sure, I'll try it, but c'mon, how good could it be? - First impression upon eating: Sure it's good, and a great deal for a mountain of food for $6, but it's no big deal. Totally overrated. - Next morning: OMG, what the heck do they put in that thing?? It's barely been seven hours and I'm already itching to go back!! They've expanded their operations to (I think) four carts. The original location still only opens from 7pm-4am, but, as I understand it, they've scoped out adjacent corners where they operate during the day.  No more super long lines!

Yes, we were all eating food from the same restaurant, but I wonder if this is a typical exchange that happens between diners here because everything looks (and tastes) amazing.  The dish in question that evoked said response was the pork jowl terrine, which is much more elegant and subtle than you might imagine for something served with a beer-cheddar spread (also delicious). The main was a goat special, served up in a variety of preparations (sausage, shoulder, loin and belly).  Everything on that plate was lovingly thought out and delicious, and yes - as pointed out by another reviewer, the portion is not huge (but also not tiny) - but every bite is well worth it. And what to say about dessert?  Awesome.  Of course I had to get the ""Apple"" dessert in a restaurant named as it is, and it was a beautiful way to end the meal.  The standout was actually the caraway ice cream.  I had never tried said spice in the form of an ice cream, but it worked BRILLIANTLY.  This dessert is worth trying just to try this concoction alone. Plus, super-friendly service and they give you a small free glass of cider to start the meal.  Am I coming back?  You bet.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Loved this place! Went here on a Wednesday night, and Matt (the bartender/waiter) said it was quieter than normal, but I liked that. He's super sassy, hilarious, patient, and helpful. He also said I'm funny, so I'm partial to him now, and was still super friendly even though my friend and I took ages to order and stuck around after paying the bill. He took music requests and the vibe was really laid back. Really enjoyed my time there & will be going back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place was my first stop in NYC last week, and it met and exceeded all expectations. It's super cute (though it was crowded), and everyone that works there is an attractive man, wearing an apron, with an accent. Swoon! I don't know if these guys came straight from down under, but I was not complaining. We snagged an outdoor seat and snacked on perfect avocado toast, while sipping on almond milk lattes. I forgot to order mine iced (they looked so refreshing in mason jars with red-and-white striped straws), but it was amazing nonetheless. This whole spot is out of an Instagram dream, and I can't wait to go back and try some other options (like the chia seed bowl or a milkshake)!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Bring a suit is what I was told a few days before I arrived in NYC to meet my girlfriend. It was a birthday dinner for me, and while she wouldn't tell me where we were going, I was told it would require a suit and I'd enjoy it. She was, as much as it pains me to admit such things, completely right about both. I am, as many people who may be on Yelp or even reading about this restaurant may be, a bit of a foodie. I've had the chance to eat at some truly amazing restaurants in my limited time, be it Michelin 3-stars, or needing Michelin off-roads to get to (see what I did there). Bouley is, in my opinion, one of the very best. From the foyer lined with apples, to the cart and waitstaff dedicated exclusively to artisan made breads, the service, food, and atmosphere were all exceptional. Everything was cooked to perfection, and in typical French cuisine fashion. There was never an empty plate in front of us, be it a main course or complimentary  amuse bouche from the chef. Atmosphere is definitely dressy, jacket required, and reservations are a must. It isn't a bargin basement meal, but without a doubt worth it for a special night or occasion.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A friend and I hit up Lupa around 9 PM.  It was an ideal time to show since we were without reservations and did specifically intend to linger over our meal.  We got seated inside the plastic porch under heat lamps.  It was cozy and comfortable, and very much preferable to the loud restaurant inside.  But the red lighting cast an insistent rosy hue over the evening, making us look a a bit strange and making it difficult to discern what we were eating at times ... But about the food ... In sharing a variety of dishes, we created our own tasting menu.  We targeted ingredients we were most curious about, ordering pairings that seemed obscure. Sunchokes: They look like galangal.  Their texture is slightly soft, slightly snappy-crunchy, like redskinned potatoes.  They taste a little sweet and a little earthy, the way rutabagas do.  They were served in halves sitting in olive oil, with thinly sliced pickled red onions.  The olive oil pool was a tad gratuitous. Duck (Special of the Day): Our concession to something ordinary.  The meat was dry, but the skin was crispy deliciousness.  This cruel contrast reminded me of Thanksgiving all over again. Lupa's best dishes were certainly their pasta dishes.  These were a unique education in what pasta has the fabulous potential to be. Ricotta Gnocchi: Fluffy pillows of potato pasta rolled around a ricotta-center surprise.  None of the dense gumminess one typically experiences with gnocchi.  Served with a modest portion of sausage meat and fennel-ly tomato sauce with crunchy flecks of not-too-spicy fresh ground pepper.  Lovely!  Relevatory!  Words you wouldn't think to describe the humble gnocchi. Pork Liver Tortellini Smoky pate (tastes identical to the paste spread on Vietnamese sandwiches) stuffed inside very al dente (or undercooked?) tortellini.  Served in a butter and black truffle sauce with a sprinkling of chives.  Fat and generous shavings of black truffle -- we were aghast but elated.  From this, I learned that black truffle tastes a lot like garlic sauteed in olive oil, but with less of the garlic-sharpness.  Not sure what the hype over truffle is, but maybe this wasn't the best dish to showcase such a subtle ingredient.  The flavor of the pate had a tendency to dominate. food: 5 for gnocchi; 1 for duck; 3 for everything else value:  3 service:  5 (waitress was exceedingly helpful and polite) ambience:  3 (nothing out of the ordinary here, save for volume) craveability:  5 for gnocchi; 2 for everything else","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As for the food, 3 stars. Quality, good. Price, too high. Atmosphere, Baaaaad. Especially considering it was Valentine's Day. We would have gladly paid $ 70 per person for 3 course meal if the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was romantic enough. My 1st course was beet salad with hazel nuts. It was good. Main was NY strip. Perfectly cooked to order. Good beef. Dessert was Chocolate Torte. It was good. Just enough sweetness. Very thick. Very good. My husband's was almost the same, but the dessert. It was lemon pudding cake which we agreed we did not like at all. Too much lemon zest or something. Personal preference. Food was good. Perhaps good enough for regular meal, but not good enough for $70 meal. Nothing was outstanding. I wish the person on the phone could have told us they only had Valentine's Day special on that day. Then, we would have not gone there at all. Oh, well. Stuff like that happens. We should have known. That was not the worst we had that day. There was a family who brought a baby and a kid. OK, this is Park Slope, I get it. I love kids, I don't mind seeing them, or having them at dinner, If, we were not paying frankly over priced meal at a supposedly great restaurant with great atmosphere. The dinner was ruined by their constant camera flash, and the mother's loud voice. The baby started crying. I understood she was a frequent customer for this restaurant, or owner's friend or something, but really. Do you really need to bring your kids to a nice restaurant for dinner on Valentine's Day? I don't think so. Baby has to cry at some point. Kids have to walk around or nag. That's what they do. So, please. Think about where you take your kids. Our check came and it was over $200. I expected more from this place. Maybe too much expectation killed the experience.  We probably won't be back for a long time, but maybe some time later. Perhaps not on Valentine's Day.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Empanada Mama is another good place in Hells Kitchen to help absorb all that late-night alcohol. There's almost always a line late at night with people grabbing take out orders or waiting to sit at the few tables. Last weekend after midnight my friend Nathan and I stopped by because we couldn't find a decent pizza place. Empanada Mama is much better than scarfing a pizza! We sat at a table next to the door but it was too cold, so the nice waiter separated some tables for us further inside. Let me just say, Yuca Frita with guacamole sauce is an awesome combo! Fresh cassava and hot out of the fryer! It was so hot that I scalded the roof of my mouth. But it was worth the burn, and soothed by the cool guac sauce! It tasted like upscale french fries. I was hungry and ordered three empanadas. My memory is vague for some reason, possibly from too many vodkas, but I know I ate a Brasil which had ground beef, olives and onions. Delicious! I think I also had a Mushroom and a Pernil, but don't hold me to it LOL. Anyway, they have a big selection and you can't really go wrong since they're less than $3.00 each.

"Yeah, yeah I know-everyone loves it, its out of this world, etc etc. Regarding the Grimaldi's itself-I totally agree. BUT, why I really love this place is how you can make a fab afternoon of it, especially if you have someone in from out of town. Sample amazing NYC day for you and a gal (or guy, slightly altered plan though) from out of town, or just needing a little staycation: -Go to Century 21 and stock up on lovely discounted couture lingerie. -Get out the camera and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge -Spend a few minutes walking in circles trying to find Grimaldi's -Get in the line and make a friend-asap -Offer to trade off waiting in line with this friends group, to which they will likely say ""Sure, we will hold your spot."" -You and your pal ask the people in the front how long they have been waiting so you can gauge how much time you have to essentially let someone stand in line for you, while you find the nearest bar and get the afternoon party started (We went to the place right on the corner, which had really awesome infused martini special-wild blueberry gin? Hello. -Come and check in with your 'friends' after like 30 min, then spend another 10 finishing up your drink(s) -Get back in line, showering thanks on the poor saps that stood there for 45 min. -Get called it, sit down, immediately start flirting with the very funny waiters and pizza chefs (they should be called that-they rock) -Order a carafe of wine, and a small pizza if you are 2 ladies sharing (its HUGE). I had mushrooms and anchovies on my half and had one piece left. -Save some room for the dessert-the tarfuto, tartuto sp? is this delish icecream roll with chocolate and vanilla covered in a dark chocolate shell with a little touch of raspberry jam, and the canoli was great too. -Have cash, dont take cc's, and don't take pics of the chefs. While the waiters hijacked our camera and took numerous pics of themselves, the chefs don't dig it. -If you can, walk back over the bridge. If not, the train is a few blocks away. =All the makings of a great day","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had a lovely lunch at Riverpark today.  My husband and I had the restaurant week menu which is full of options. My husband had the salmon for appetizer (absolutely delicious), the Berkshire pork chop for entree, super juicy and tender and flavor was perfect.  He ended with the basil cream puff, which was delicious as well.  I had the corn salad panna cotta for appetizer, which had a beautiful presentation and very refreshing taste.  For entree, I got the lamb chop and sausage, which I thought the flavor was a bit to strong for me.  The portion was quite small, and although I didn't mind that, it seems like there is nothing on the plate to balance out the strong taste of the lamb.  Everything else on the plate was part of the sauce, so equally salty.  If I knew the entree would be like that, I would order a side of mash potatoes or veggie to balance it out.  But overall, the flavor was good, just a bit too heavy by itself.  For dessert, I got the raspberry cobbler.  I enjoyed the ice cream that was pair with the cobbler more.  My husband did like it cuz he is more of a heavy dessert type of person.  I do think that all three of my husband's choices were better than mine.  Perhaps if I ordered what he did, I would be more satisfied.  Overall, I think Riverpark is a fine restaurant, and they always put a lot of thoughts and effort into each dish.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Had dinner here tonight. Although the food was good, it was a little over priced. One thing i really didnt like is that after being seated, the waiter came over to my table, and recited about 20-30 specials for 5 minutes. he looked like a school boy being punished and reciting a poen or something. MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT, AND WHAT I DIDNT LIKE OR APPRECIATE IS THAT AFTER WE FINISHED EATING, THE WAITER CAME OVER AND ASKED US IF WE WANTED DESSERT. I TOLD HIM NO JUST THE CHECK PLEASE.

"My mouth salivates as I write this post, which is long overdue as it has been three years since I first tried their Cuban sandwich and grilled corn. Since that first encounter, I have been back to NYC two more times and each time, Cafe Habana is a must, if not the first stop! I am not a big fan of ham nor cucumber, but somehow these ingredients sneak their way into my mouth with every bite of the Cuban sandwich. The special sauce is what makes this sandwich--a blend of tangy and spicy--it totally complements the pork, ham, and cheese all stuffed inside a warm, toasty bread. The best partner to this sandwich is the grilled corn, topped with what seems to be mayo, cheese, and chili powder. I've glanced at the other items on the menu, but not dare pass up a visit without having the ""usual."" It's enough. More than enough that every time I go home, I spend my last day making a stop here to load up on at least two meals worth of the ""usual"" to fly back home to San Jose.

Their White Pizza is a must for fans of ricotta cheese like myself, but I'd recommend the red sauce if you prefer something that's more moist and not as outrageously cheesy. I've never really had a pizza go wrong here and I must have come here more than 15 times in the course of some two years.

"Interesting crepe shop with some traditional combined with Asian inspired flavors on the menu.  Another distinguishing factor is that their crepes are served in a hand-rolled cone shape, which has its merits...and flaws.   By rolling up the crepe, you get a nice wide, cross-sectional view of what's inside, and every creation looks delicious.  It's also handier to eat, because you can hold it in your hands and walk around taking bites without making too much of a mess...there are also no tables in the shop for you to fork and knife it.   There are some negatives to this, however.   Because the pancake wrap is made first, then laid out to put the toppings on, by the time it gets to your hands, it is already cold.   Which is a shame, because they truly do look beautiful, and a clear effort is made.  Another minor problem is gravity.  Any crepe you order with sauce, ice cream, chocolate, or anything liquid (basically all of them), will have a disproportional concentration of it end up in your final three bites because it all drips to the bottom.   The ingredients used here are general of solid quality, and very fresh.  The menu is well thought out, and the toppings and flavors in each crepe is well-balanced and tasty.  However good, I just can't enjoy a cold crepe that much.  Unfortunately the feature sets  Eight Turn Crepe apart also is the cause of its biggest flaw.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The wine pairing was also perfect. Everything they recommended with each dish was flawless and truly complemented each of the flavors. The service was impeccable all around - from our waiter, to each person that served us with bread, refilled water glasses, etc. Our main waiter, Michelangelo, was impressive - knowing each dish to a t and describing everything so that you wanted to taste the whole menu.

"YES YES YES I'll start with dessert even though i love savory items usually. However, this dessert was spectacular. It was the fig and black pepper panna cotta. You stumble upon some good things in life, and I believe this is one of them, or at least is one of those things that make you remember other good things. In my case, I was with friends and shared this dessert along with a hazelnut mousse and an ending cheese course. I, however, pretty much stole the panna cotta (the others liked it but didn't see what the huge deal was). It's not hit or miss. You'll like it. But for a select few, that panna cotta will do wonders for you. I had shivers while eating it--the panna cotta of such a texture to be soft without airy and insubstantial; figs sweet without being saccharine (i found them to be woody and green, even); and the black pepper to be super fresh and just the right amount. I'll say that the pasta dish was well done, perfectly al dente. the fish was interesting, with blood orange, and not oily. and the salad was, well, salad. But I'll go there and eat dinner (perfectly happily, btw) just to get to the panna cotta!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I held my birthday here two days ago. Our party size was 14, and Sotto 13 was wonderful about it. They were very accommodating, didn't mind that I added a few people at the last minute, and the waiters were very helpful and accommodating throughout the whole night. The food was delicious - we ended up trying almost all the tapas and 4 or 5 of the pizzas, and everyone loved the food. The atmosphere was also perfect. There was plenty of space, the lighting was cozy and romantic, but not too dark, and the music and noise level were just perfect. No one needed to shout to be heard around the table, and we didn't feel like we were overtaking the entire restaurant. I highly recommend this place!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Absolutely love this place! Very small, I think it would seat 20 at full capacity.  I think it's about the size of my apartment. I had the duck soup with hand-pulled noodles.  So delicious!  I could eat there every day! I love how they have a squeeze bottle for soy sauce, and you can spoon in as much scallions and cilantro as you desire (from a quart-sized plastic cup). I want to try more and more items on their menu now! Now, if anyone could tell me how to eat noodle soup without getting my shirt stained, I would really appreciate it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Get yourself to this gem of a bar while it's still a relative secret!  The focus is on American whiskey but the overarching theme is all things comforting (without resorting to tired cliches... case in point: we've all seen our share of tin plated ceilings but have you seen a tin plated table top?)  With  7 years of food service experience under my belt, take my word for it: the booze selection, food, and service are all stellar.  Try the pickle bowl, replete with wonderful transformations to blackberries and peaches.   And if you're feeling under the weather, a  dram of smokey bourbon and a pipping bowl of beef enriched borscht will sustain you until the Spring arrives.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Tia Pol is an authentic tapas bar with pleasing food and that fun, socially conducive hole-in-the wall feel.  They have some nice wines (I'm always a sucker for a good Tempranillo), but I was certainly more impressed on intial visits rather than subsequent ones.  In the beginning, it may have been the novelty of finding a true tapas bar that really got me giddy since it had tasty food across the board and nice Spanish wine at okay prices.  However, as time has gone on, either they have been slipping a bit or the novelty has just worn off.  Dishes like the squid ink and rice never get old, but the pork loin sandwich is one of those dishes I realized is a rip-off at 9 dollars and can be easily be made at home.  It's definitely a place I recommend trying, but last visit's 120 dollar tab (2 ppl; tax and tip incl.) and long wait didn't exactly leave me yearning to return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Big Wong is one of those old restaurants in Chinatown that's been there for so long that nobody remembers when they first opened.  But there's a reason why they've been open for so long.. They're great! It's a great place for tourists (as it isn't one of those solely Asian restaurants as a lot of people come here because of how well known it is).  It feels slightly dirty in my opinion but that's Chinatown for you. The food is great- anything you order tastes awesome.  Sometimes they have a lobster deal (pay for ___ amount of food and you get two lobsters for $10) which you should probably try as nothing beats Chinese style lobster.  The congee is also great- try their tang gei congee (I'm not sure what it's called in English but if you say this they'll probably understand)- it has squid and pork skin and fish strips. As with any other Chinese restaurant they are also great with getting food out fast. Also, I've also come here often to purchase the pork and squid in the front- it's take out and it is amazing...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"THE NASTIEST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE!!!!!!! first of all the staff was nice but I got my plate and there was a hair wrapped around my shrimp, which prompted me to check my other shrimp and there was a bug with wings on another shrimp... The nastiest thing I've seen in my LIFE!!!! My boyfriend said his crab legs were so bland and dry, not juicy at all. My son's food was fine but I was so appalled. They have the golf outside and since we promised our son, we went to play after the food  incident and we didn't pay for that. As we reached the last hole.....

The tables sit right next to each other, so you can peruse your neighbor's food and comment. The waitress has excellent English with a lovely French accent. I think they have raised the food prices to compensate for the lack of liquor revenue, so it cost us $120 for a three course dinner for 2. It is small, crowded, noisy, and wonderful.","[0.0, 1.0]"
1st time trying this place out.  We ordered take out from here however when you first walk in there is a lovely looking bar and tables towards the back. The people working had smiles in their faces and we're welcoming. I ordered the fish tacos and the steak tacos. I liked the fish tacos alot more because it had more flavor to it and my boyfriend got the steak burrito. I felt like the burrito was so small for the price....I didn't think it was worth it however I loved the street corn...that's my favorite.

Although we didn't eat the food right away, it was still pretty warm when we got back to our hotel 10 minutes later. That being said, the food was absolutely delicious. We each ordered a combo and it was far too much for us. For $6, you get a lot more than your money's worth. A large quantity of delicious food? Yes please.

"In short: Great food, fun atmosphere, okay prices, crappy waiting. Details: I love the location and food. I usually stop by, put my name and number down, and then go wander around Times Square (stop by some bakery and snack) and the come when beckoned. This all means that you have to have a flexible schedule. The food is delicious and pretty decently priced. I got a HUGE bowl of umi (sea urchin) for $4. Not shabby. You sit at wooden tables/benches surrounded by loud Japanese business men chugging sake. It's an experience. The food DOES add up, but I like being able to try all sorts of nonsense with friends. Service is pretty standard; they're so busy that they don't have time to stay and chat, but everything is fast, efficient, and I've never had to ask for water. Good enough for me when I'm paying $20 to eat in the area. I pay that much for coffee and a fancy pastry. Also, I'm not sure if the restaurant is wheel-chair accessible.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Yay! I am a fan; is right on the money for this restaurant. I went last Saturday night. My cousin was in town from Cali and wanted to take her to a fun joint in the Village area. Most of my Saturday was consumed with doing work (yes on the weekend - yuck). I wasn't able to start searching around to about 4 pm. As fellow yelpers may know it is HARD to get a 8pm reso on a Saturday night ANYWHERE in NYC; most don't take them. Paprika seemed very well like by y'all so I thought I would give it a try. I loved the option that I could make my reservation straight through yelp! I made it for 4 people at 8pm. Of course we were all running late - I was coming in from Hoboken. We called before we left the house and said we would be 15-20 mins late. Paprika had no problem and changed our reservation to 830! Upon our arrival the place is VERY what you would say quaint. It was a bit noisy but we are a noisy bunch ourselves so we didn't mind to add to the chatter. We were quickly seated and were brought water. Drinks were ordered right away. Now this place only has a wine menu and a few beer selections. The glassware that accompanied are moderate priced wine ( $10) was a shallow short wine glass. Something you might get at a BYOB. Pretty much my only boozy comment I have to make. Menu isn't very extensive so we all knew what we wanted right away. Shared appetizers were: Tomato & Mozz salad, Corn Polenta w/fonduta and the Saffron Risotto Balls. DELISH!!! I was quite surprised how good the tomato's were. If you are not a fan of the saffron flavor as one quest we were with wasn't I would skip these, flavor is pronounced. Entrees: Gnocchi, Lobster Mac & Cheese, Ox Tail Ragout, Artic Char. OK going to throw myself under the bus here. I consider myself a pretty acclimated ""foodie"" and well I didn't realize Artic Char = Salmon; which is the ONLY fish I do not like. So I addressed my absent mindedness to the waiter and he happily took it off the menu and asked me if I wanted something else. I obliged but said please just bring me something that is prepped and easily sent out of the kitchen. He brought me about 8 minutes later a steaming hot bowl of the Ox Tail ragout. I was very pleased although slightly salty. The Gnocchi was amazing as my yelpers agree. Mac & Cheese was not your typical ""gooey"" dish rather delicate and very flavorful. We opted out of dessert as we wanted to catch the end of the Jets game ( which they won) Check came to only $150!! Two Thumbs up for Paprika!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Not only was their brisket perfect but their pulled pork was probably the best, if not at least in the top 3 we have had since moving here.

"What a fail. I was excited to try this place. I tried to order a sandwich without cilantro because I'm allergic and the staff told me they don't do any modifications at all. Okay, no substitutions I understand... But no modifications at all? I wasn't even asking for a crazy change. Nothing was pre mixed or pre made. All they had to do was NOT dip their hand into the plastic tub of cilantro and carry on making my sandwich. In fact, they'd be using fewer ingredients in making my sandwich.... They might even save a few seconds of their time, but no. No modifications. They care so little about your business that they can't even leave out cilantro even though it makes no logical sense at all. Guess that's why they had no customers at 8pm on a Saturday.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been a New York most of my life and have been hearing about Grimaldi's for years.  Last night after walking past and seeing there was no line my sister and I decided to give it a try and we definitely will never be back.  The pizza was just okay, but I've definitely had better.  Apparently they shut the oven's down for 30 minutes between 5-7 to ""reboot"" the oven but not sure why they wouldnt do it earlier.  They keep a line outside the restaurant almost to make Grimaldi's seem like a bigger deal then it was because there were plenty of available tables inside.  They only accept cash but both ATM's inside were down.  When I asked the manager for the nearest ATM, he sent me on a wild goose chase and after a solid walk turns out there was a small ATM right next door.  We were told when we went in that the ovens had gone down and it would be 20-30 mins.  About 30 minutes later we were told again that the ovens had just gone down and it would be another 20-30 minutes and that the earlier statement didn't factor in the pizzas they had left to make.  Trying to get change for our check at the end was also quite a process.  Crowds inside are loud and touristy, children screaming, bathrooms dirty.  All in all, definitely go somewhere else -NY is filled with good pizza, much better than Grimaldi's and for a lot less, and all without the hassle.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Actually, it might not be fair to rate it since I haven't actually eaten here, but I was really disappointed with the service my friends and I experienced. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and called the day before to clarify that we would be a large party of about 10 and that we wanted to come around 7:30. No reservations are taken, and that's fine, but we were told that it would be ok to come and that it might be a short wait. Anyways, we show up the next day and not only is the place incredibly small (very cute and charming) but it's packed. We were treated brusquely by the staff, told that there was no way we could be accommodated and that no one would have ever condoned a party of 10 (even after we told them we had called the day before). It was disappointing, especially since the food looked and smelled quite good. Now, I understood as soon as we saw the small space we weren't going to fit, but then we should have been told that when we called before. And the fact that we were treated harshly didn't help matters at all. This place is suppose to be very good, but there's too many good restaurants in this city to put up with this kind of treatment.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Maybe someday there will be real outdoor seating where you can sit with your crushed margarita. In the meantime there is often a likeable crazy man to keep you company on the bench. If you get him a taco he will tell you amusing stories. If you don't get him a taco, he will still tell you amusing stories. Oh yeah, it's a one tortilla kind of place. Sometimes you need a fork.

"Maharlika was freaking awesome! It's actually a 4.5 star in my book, but that takes nothing away from this place. I think Maharlika serves as an amazing entry to Filipino food. It takes some filipino classics and mixes it together in an American style. I came for brunch and it was very very good. The service is great and I really enjoyed just sitting at the bar and being there. (Remember to get there early, as there is a line, though there are plenty of things to do in the Village while you wait.) I had the Sizzling Sisig, while my girlfriend had the longsilog. The Sisig(if you can get past your initial disdain towards pork parts) was fantastic. Rich, savory, and delicious, it's one of those foods you really want to keep eating. The Longsilog was also very good and flavored perfectly. Both meals were hearty and I was filled up, though I would definitely eat more. The complimentary garlic rice is also fantastic and it really serves as a good contrast to the heavier flavors of the Filipino food. Maharlika also provides 3 different kinds of condiments(Filipino soy sauce, banana ketchup sauce, and Filipino Vinegar) which actually makes a huge difference when eating any of the dishes. The concept was great, the restaurant was trendy(great ambiance, surprising due to the small storefront) and the service was incredibly friendly. The only thing I would dock it points for was the fact that they accept only cash and that it's not a great place for vegetarians or those looking for healthier options.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Everything was going well within the first hour or so of our visit.  I thought that the shrimp Quesadilla was great and the Sangria was good also.  After paying over $120 for food and drinks, the Manager on duty told us that someone had a 9:30 reservation and that we have to move to the bar.  We kindly removed ourselves from our table and proceeded to the bar.  While my friend and I sat there, we became very disappointed with the way we were treated.  This was our first experience  here and we had spent a decent amount of money.  The Manager did not even offer us anything for the inconvenience.  I spoke with him about it and he denied admitting that he told us to move to the bar.  He quickly disregarded us and went back to performing his ""managerial"" duties.

"Popular places that don't take reservations are an anomaly to me. For   those that don't like to wait or show up early these establishments   can be a bane to their existences. I don't want to be seen. I just   want good food. If you like both aspects, then the Spotted Pig might   be for you. Here is one of the UK to NYC gastropub originators. This is upscale   bar food that rolls it's eyes at mozzarella sticks or nachos. The mere   suggestion of quesadillas might get you kicked out. Happy hour only   applies when you have waited for an hour and you are happy to finally   be sitting down at a table. All jokes aside, the food is pretty good here.

I read so many recommendations for the burger here but   I can't imagine waiting all that time for a table in order to eat just   a burger. Portions are a tad small and pricey but I know that going in. I've been here a couple times. Sitting upstairs is better than   downstairs but there's no guarantee.

"We made a specific visit here after a night out (aka the best time to go) and, as always, had an AMAZING time. Decor: The place is small, there are not a lot of seats, and it's pretty divey, but this is probably one of my absolute favorite spots in NYC. Yes, you will probably have to wait in line (outside...) before you can order and the chances of you getting a seat, let along enough for your group, are slim to none, however it is all part of the experience. And these ""hardships"" (I call them ""character traits"") just make the frites taste THAT much better. Bathroom: not for customers Staff: The guys are cool, FAST, and more than willing to let you try the sauces before you decide - what more could you want? Food/Drink: We come for the sauces and stay for the frites haha. Seriously, after a night out at the bars there is nothing better than stuffing your face with Belgium fries (think potato wedges, only BETTER) dipped in your choice of sauce(s). Pick a size based on your appetite at the time and go with whatever sauce sounds good - sample any you are unsure about - you won't be disappointed. My favorite sauce is the wasabi mayo and the staple (that we get EVERY time) is the cheese. A-MAZ-ING. Value: I really do not remember if it is pricey or not but really, after a night of drinking when you are starving, does it matter? For me? At this place? NEVER. I freaking love this place. It's the best. I will always come back, whether I'm near, far, or have to make a special trip. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm so glad that Mark Simmons opened up his place here in Park Slope!  I enjoyed his cooking from Melt so I knew that Kiwiana would be a great hit!  We were lucky enough to get dinner reservations for opening week back in August. To start off, we had the smoked and pickled green lip mussels with bread.  It was a nice delightful surprise because I never had pickled mussels before - in fact I really liked the different flavors mixed together.  Then we ordered the west coast oysters, as well as the salmon ceviche with wasabi avocado puree and lump fish caviar, which were both delicious and fresh.  My favorite appetizer was definitely the baby beets with lavender ricotta.  Who would have known something so simple could taste so delicious! The appetizers were a nice prep for the real deal, the entree! The manuka and marmite-braised baby back ribs with squash puree were oh so amazingly tasty and delicious. I had something similar when Mark Simmons cooked for my family when I had my bridal shower at Melt. I also tried my hubbie's entree, a milo-rubbed venison, which was also just as good!  I never had venison before (always too scared to try it) so I'm glad I had it for the first time at Kiwiana. Lastly, for dessert we had passion fruit and coconut cream caramel and chocolate molten cake! Both were scrumptious and a nice end to the meal.   I can't wait to go back and try brunch!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat last night and we found Becco's. I was very excited because I am a big Lidia fan. We did not have a reservation and we stopped in to see if we could be seated. The staff was amazing. So friendly and attentive. They had an opening and we were seated in a cozy corner. We ordered a $25.00 bottle of wine which was great. My husband ordered the pork chop which was huge, grilled to perfection so juicy and tender. I had the fish which they deboned and was delicious. Oh and a note to Omar from Virginia beach, I am white, Italian and blond and the attendant at the door stopped us from entering the restaurant too. She was controlling the patrons in and out of the restaurant due to a wind tunnel effect of cold air that blows into restaurant when the door is opened. It had nothing to do with your skin color.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Having been here for many a delicious brunch and sunday supper I am very sad to report I will never go back. Took one of my good friends here tonight, having ravedabout it to her. We walked in and there were 2 free tables and lots of room at the bar. Asked for a table for 2, only to be told that there wasnt room and that we couldnt take one of the free tables as they were being ""saved for bigger parties"". So short sighted: turning away repeat, local business on the hope of getting 2 extra covers. Maybe they got that tonight but they will be missing out on my many visits in the future. Fortunately, their loss was absolutely our gain: we went to Porsena on 7th and 3rd and it was out-of-this-world DELICIOUS (much much better than i've ever had at Northern Spy Food Co).

"Boqueria had been the missing cog in my Spanish tapas dining experience in NYC. I was excited I finally had the chance to come here with a large group. We got some sort of pre-set group menu where for $40pp we were able to sample a large variety of the menu. Unfortunately nothing really stood up to me. There was a generic spread of jamon serrano and cheeses, along with pan tomate. The patatas bravas were crispy and greaseless but buried under a mountain of spicy aioli. The setas were bland, but I do recall a pretty phenomenal cheesy, truffle-y croqueta that really stood out. I found the sangria to be kind of diluted, and the margaritas were weak, although what the hell was I doing ordering margaritas at a Spanish place. Truthfully, the food was all decent, but what killed Boqueria for me was the atmosphere. Bright lighting, cramped quarters, waiters and busboys whizzing by past an open-counter kitchen while your plates are served up rapidly one by one in assembly line fashion. That's not what I want in a tapas place; I'm looking for dim, slow, and sexy. If I'm paying $12 for three meatballs, I at least want to enjoy those meatballs in the most leisurely, European, I-just-woke-up-from-a-siesta way possible. So Boqueria, fine, I've been. There are many other more worthy tapas destinations in the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a really nice find and I'm holding out hope that the unglamorous Flatiron location will control the crowds. So far it's an extremely pleasant, almost neighborhoody pub with a great beer list (Ithaca, SIx Point, etc.), good wines, and very respectable nibbles. I discovered this place thanks to Yelp Drinks Week and its proximity to my office. The room is brand spanking new, clean and homey without boxing you in. There were several after-work groups in the dining area so clearly word is getting around. We sat at the bar and went through the Yelp specials: very good Malbec was pouring, as was a pink lady cocktail with citrus vodka that I couldn't resist refilling. For food, I tried the griddled montasio cheese (Frico)--salty, deep fried pleaser; as well as the roast pork and prosciutto mini-paninis. Both were really tasty (and mini, true to their name). I'd return to check out their more substantial offerings. And may I say I really like the whole small/medium/large plate movement?

"Just stopped in yesterday to try the famed Bistro Burger. I was walking around the West Village and found myself standing in front of the Corner Bistro. ""I'm hungry, I'm going to do this burger I've heard so much about...now."" In I walk. I'm pleasantly surprised with the vibe. It doesn't look like a burger joint at all. It just looks like an old-school Village dive bar, full of locals of all shapes and sizes. I saddle up at the bar next to a guy named Eddie, who in is seventh decade of life is finishing his burger and sipping on a double of some fine amber spirit. Peter, the no-nonsense bar-tender in his fifties, who's singing a long to ""Helpless"" by Neil Young, ambles over and take my order for the house's signature burger...a cheeseburger with bacon and the works. I relax and read a bit and a couple minutes later one of the chef's comes out and sets a small plate in front of me with the enormous burger on it. The Burger....it is a gargantuan hunk of meat. It feel like it honestly might have been a half pound burger. At least a third of a pound. Nice soft bun. Slice of tomato, lettuce, and several strips of yummy crispy bacon. I hit it with a touch of ketchup and dive in. It's delicious. Medium-rare, juicy, tasty, and wonderful. Now that said, it's so big as to be unmanageable. As I bite into it, the burger is trying to escape the bun in every direction. After bite three, part of the burger unfastens itself and plops down onto the paper plate. Another bite and other piece of meat falls off. Now...the burger is so big, I still have plenty encased in the bun to satisfy my craving. After I finish what stayed in my hands, I cleaned up the remains that had dropped to the plate. Finally, the bill comes. $9. For the burger and a coke. Wow. In New York City, it's a steal. And I went in on a random Tuesday afternoon at 5 and the place was not crowded at all. Great atmosphere full of real people and of course....one of New York's best hamburgers. Reputation=EARNED.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"EXTREMELY LET DOWN! I was there last night for my birthday. I had invited a whole bunch of people and spent a whole bunch of  money. During dinner there was a live band playing downstairs for another party.

He vVERY RUDELY replied with ""absolutely not!"" Once hearing  that reply I had mentioned that a  member of the band invited us in he than snapped at me and told me ""TO GO FU*K MYSELF"" can you believe that! I went to the manager to complain about the poor taste that comment was in especially after spending all that money. Not only was I told to fuck myself AGAIN. I was escorted out because of my further complaint. I was just trying to have a nice birthday with my friends and the entire night was ruined, NOBODY should be treated that way and Iam disgusted by the customer service provided by carroll place.

"One of my favorite local spots. I'll walk past 5 closer to home to come here. It's a coffee shop and a brunch spot and a bar, all in one. The food is tasty - the menu is wholesome and simple, yet imaginative. The ambiance is great, the decor is artful and budgeted. Nothing too fancy. And they finally got AC! The drinks are great ... and fairly cheap for NYC. $7 for quality classic cocktails. I'm looking at you, Mr. Margarita. Not you, Ms. Old Fashioned. For happy hour, they give you a free shot when you buy a beer ... usually $6. Everyone who works at Skytown is friendly, creative, open. I have yet to have a bad time. Ever. Even sitting by myself. Check it out, and you'll see what I mean. Bottom line: It's a terrific local spot to bring friends, or your parents - for brunch and for late night drinks. Bring your notebook and work for a few hours with a coffee or a beer in the afternoons, if that's up your alley. Been a bunch of times - at this point, it would take a lot to keep me from coming back. Top o' the pops. 5 stars. (Take Briana T's advice - don't order takeout. It's not that kind of place.

"I am completely enamored with this restaurant. Its trademark open faced sandwiches are a real culinary treat but what gets less attention is the awesome sides and out-of-this-world brunch. The chef(s) present innovative, healthy, and absolutely delicious versions of comfort foods. Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich Of Smoked Eggplant, Avocado, Aioli, and Tomato is but one example. I swear, everything I've eaten there (and I'm slowly making my way through the whole menu) has blown me away. Aside from the food, here's a top five list of things I like about the place: 1. gorgeous patio out back 2. really good musicians playing in the corner on weekend nights. (ok, sometimes they do get a bit loud for dinner conversation to continue) 3. wait staff that seem genuinely psyched to be working there and sharing this culinary adventure with you. 4. the fact that Maimonide is located in the hub--if not the heart--of Brooklyn. 5. Dessert. (sorry, i realize that also falls in the food category but i really can't leave it out.) My advice: go and go often. If you're not vegan and don't care about animal cruelty or the environment, go anyway. Your selfish mouth will be rewarded many times over.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"OKAY yes...i'll admit that the ramen here is super overpriced at 13 dollars but it was SO tasty.  the broth is so flavorful, it really made the difference. we also had the ""red"" ramen was was far inferior, but still tasty, to the original ramen. the side of pork belly does wonders...so amazing even at 3 dollars a piece. gogogogoog. i'm in china now, where food is a plenty and cheap but i'm still thinking about this awesome ramen.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So, I was all set to start booty-popping (read: twerking) all over this review/place based off of my first experience here...butttttt then I went back with a larger party. No. So, the Po'Boy is safely one of the only things you should order off of this menu...that and anything with honey butter, if you're of the artery clogging sort (I am). The Po Boy is THE BOMB. It is THAT good. The chicken entree is also pretty tasty, but nothing to sing home about. That said....THAT SAID!!!....NOTHINGGGGGG else on this menu has any flavor. Not the mac and cheese - for all 97 types of cheese they throw into it trying to be fancy, it's bland. Not the shrimp grits - hated it. Absolutely hated it, but I was starving so I scarved it down. Not the jambalaya....how the heck do you make jambalaya bland? With all the vegetables, meats, and spices, how is this even possible????? The biscuits, the breads, blah blah, don't even bother. The wait staff is very friendly ( ::prayer hands of thanks:: because Jesus knows I cannot stand a rude, entitled transplant lol) and try their best to be attentive, but seem to lack the proper training required to help the restaurant run smoothly and to bring plates quickly) Moral of the story is: Clearly someone had a great idea - to start a Cajun restaurant - but had very little idea of what Cajun food should taste like or how to cook it. They need to hire someone's fat old black southern grandma to throw down in this kitchen and turn this place out. #jussayin","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I visit the midtown east and Lincoln center locations pretty consistently, and I'm always happy when I leave. However, this location left me dissatisfied. First, I made a reservation for 9pm. We arrived and checked in at 845. At 9:10 I noticed the hostess was seating other couples without reservations. When we asked her how much longer, she said she didn't realize we were both there even though we had been standing right next to her. She didn't apologize and sat us in a super tight corner where I couldn't even hear the other person at my table. When the food came, my burger was raw. I don't mind medium rare, but I don't want raw meat. I never send food back but asked the waitress to please re-fire. It took another 20 minutes until I got my food. While the food is good and comparable at all 3 locations, this one is too small, tight and loud. You'll have a much better experience at the Midtown East or Lincoln Center location.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"No Spicy Miso? My friend and me was looking forward to having shabu-shabu for the first time with each other.  The experiences she had, made me want try it so bad.  I tried Shabuway in Mountain View, CA.  Yes, this was amazing compared to Shabu-Tatsu.  Why? Flavors: Shabuway had two types of broths.  Spicy Miso Broth and the original Seaweed Broth. Shabu-Tatsu had only Seaweed Broth -  I should call it Seaweed Water because That's what it tasted like actually, like Bruce Lee's favorite drink - WATAH! The Spicy Miso has so much more flavor than then Seaweed water... I am a spicy type of person so this can be one sided... or not... Condiments: Shabuway had freshly cut green onions, garlic, kim chi paste?(smelt like kim chi), hot oil, and the mixed peppers... Shabu-Tatsu had only garlic, kim chi paste, and hot oil... Again, this allows you to adjust the flavors to your liking.  We didn't have much to work with to adjust the broth... PORTIONS!: Shabuway had twice as much food, but for half the price...  They used kobe beef as well! Shabu-Tatsu gave us only one plate of meat which didn't come close to filling us up.  And there beef was only consider in the angus category... Kobe Beef vs Angus?  Half price for much more food?  What would you choose? In the end, we were still hungry but didn't want to spend the extra moola for a downgrade of quality in food...  We left and went for dessert and then filled up with a bottle of red wine after.  If you enjoy this place.  Come to California for higher quality of food for half the price...  You won't be disappointed. P.S. We were so disappointed with this place, when we got back to California.  I took my friend to Shabuway and she was so happy with everything.  She even said it beats her place in San Francisco...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Confessions of a Fake Ippudo Lover Okay, so don't kill me people, but I only LIKE Ippudo - I don't love it.   This place has an intimidating, obsessed cult-like following that I could just never become a part of (for them, not loving Ippudo is committing culinary sacrilege against the ramen gods).  I admit, I've even tried to fake it by pretending to love Ippudo in front of friends who constantly rave about it (shameful, I know).  It's just, I find the broth a little too salty for my taste, and sometimes a little too oily (seriously, put your torches and pitchforks away).  And really, its just a chain restaurant.  But overall, it IS a tasty place to eat.  I always thoroughly enjoy anything pork on their menu (esp. the roast pork over rice lunch special)  Worth an hour midday wait? Probably not. Anyway, I'm finally outing myself, and no longer will I live in the closet as a non-lover of Ippudo. However, if there's anyone out there with murderous inclinations as a result of this review, I was just kidding this whole time.  I LOVE IPPUDO. ALL HAIL IPPUDO!","[1.0, 0.0]"
This is by far the best burger joint ever. I have tried multiple burger places. I had such high expectations for this place and i was skeptical about it since i heard such high expectations. However the moment i took my first bite. I was in heaven. I had never tasted such a good looking burger that will melt in my mouth. Every bite was just better than previous and left me craving some more. The line is definitely on the long side but it is worthhhh every second! Every person in the world has to try this!

"WOW! Is how I'd like to start my review of La Follia.   My wife and I have been meaning to go since it opened and it greatly exceeded our expectations.  This area is severely lacking a good, warm, go-to Italian restaurant and now, at long last, we have one. We started with the eggplant caponata which had capers and raisins.  I don't normally even eat eggplant and this little dish was phenomenal!  We also had the chickpeas balsamico which was very tasty but paled in comparison to the eggplant. Next up were the Crostinis, which were absolutely out of this world!  The Ricotta with pesto was delicious and the mascarpone with clover honey was so good, I considered ordering it again as a dessert. For entrees we split two dishes so we could sample as much as possible.  The orichette with fennel pork sausage was incredibly flavorful and the penne with cauliflower and squash was an excellent, seasonal dish. We finished off the meal with a nutella, banana panini. OMG! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive and we can't wait to go back.  We're looking forward to the opening of the wine bar!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"An amazing drink list for serious beer lovers. If you prefer Coor Light or Bud then first of all punch yourself in the face and secondly this is not the place for you. We got a table among the busy after work crowd, which was a real treat, and had a very attentive waitress take our beer order. A big bowl of nachos were also requested by some people at my table and while they looked amazing, I was too focused on my drink menu. Just tons of interesting beers from micro brews from around the globe. Great music playing in the background that at first was so damn loud I could not hear myself talking...but later was toned down and lights were dimmed, which made for a great weeknight drinking spot. I really loved this place and had a blast for a happy hour that wound up lasting seven hours too long. The next day at work sucked, but it was well worth it! Note: Join their beer club. You drink 40 different beers from their menu in 30 days and you get a personalized beer mug with your name on it. Simply tell the waitress when you show up that you are in the club, they check off from that list when you order the drink and before you know it, you have yourself another container for your lushy ways.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Good food, but the service left much to be desired and ended up ruining what was meant to be a great dining experience. The order was messed up. Each dish was served in unsatisfying 30 min. intervals (too long when you're having five). None of the five wines we had were served at the right temperature. We found a hair in one of the dishes (which the waiter handled in a very poor way, insinuating that the hair did not come from the kitchen - it was black and frizzy, I am blond) and later a large nutshell, that could have broken a tooth, in another. How a restaurant can have a Michelin star and mess up so many things at one table is beyond me. This was far below the standard we have found at Michelin rated restaurants in other countries.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Everyone loves pizza. And why not eat at the first and best? Lombardi's is the first pizza in the United States. Their original location was about a block away from where they are now. They closed and reopned several years later at this location. Must say that the pizza is GREAT. They use a coal overn. My favorite part about the pizza is the sauce. Its fantastic.  Only downside? A bit expensive for pizza, but hey, it is wonderful. I believe this estabilshment is cash only.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here excited at the prospect of another cool new pizza place in the neighborhood since I'm a pizzatarian (not to mention I love Castello plan and Mimi's). The ambiance is nice and pretty romantic setting....except the fact that there's this HUGE table in the middle that seem to make all the other tables feel smothered around it. Doesn't make sense, but then again our table got stuck somewhere between that and the front door on a chilly evening. My girl and I ordered some wine, a pork and swiss crostino, a pasta,  and two pies, the margarita for me (the true test is how good your normal pie is) and a bianca. The wine as expected was great. Everything else... Ok but rather small for the price. Especially the pasta...think chef boardee to go cup size! my gf said she left a little hungry...no bueno. Mediocre at best. To end on a positive note though the staff was very nice and attentive but I guess I'll stick to their other spots and head elsewhere for pie.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been to Rucola twice now. I hope Building on Bond knows it has some serious competition - competition that is blowing their stale menu out of the water. Since I first went to Rucola a few weeks ago, they've already changed up their menu. The Bloody Mary's aren't cheap, but the mix is good and I love pickled fennel so I'll gladly part with $10 or maybe even $20 for that pleasure. The last time we went, my husband and split a pork sandwich and ordered all of the sides - polenta, Brussels sprouts, and pancetta. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was delicious. We spend around $65 (including tip) for three cocktails, one entree, and three sides. The ambiance is really nice at Rucola. It's a quiet block and the decor is the ever-popular rustic mix of old wood, aged metal, and handblown glass. It's very charming and unpretentious.

"Finally, an authentic Italian sandwich place. The food is unbelievable. Everything is imported from Italy. The bread is from a famous Italian bakery in Brooklyn. Their sandwiches are as good as they can be in the best delis in Italy. I am originally from Rome, and I can guarantee you that they use the best ingredients available on the market. My favourite is the porchetta sandwich, but I also like the prosciutto and the mortadella a lot. For the bread, I would definitely recommend the sfilatino. The price for the sandwich is extremely reasonable, considering that one sandwich easily feeds 2 hungry people. Overall, going to Pisillo is always a great experience. Carmelo and Antonella, the owners of the place, are very nice and put their passion for their work on each sandwich they make.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Accommodated last minute for a table.  Loved that.  Atmosphere, great......   After sitting at the table for 31 minutes I asked the server for a cocktail and mentioned that we had been waiting for a while hoping that he was our server and he said, ""ma'am, we are in Williamsburg, we don't rush here""  with an attitude worthy of the Movember man he was as if I was an impatient tourist.   Not much else to say on this one..........   Steak was rare even though ordered medium.  Offers to refill empty glasses were non-existent but they hovered after dropping the check.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of the best aspects of moving is exploring all the food options in your new 'hood.  No better way to get the higher-end ball rolling with Cookshop! 24 hours before an intended Saturday dinner, the only options were 600p and 945p, so book early.  That said, 600p was lovely as the large windows surrounding the restaurant let in a soft but bright indirect light that delightfully gave way to the interior ambiance as the evening progressed. Starting off were the cocktails, all of which were fabulous.  A standard Margherita in the rocks, a Manhattan on the rocks and two of their vodka cocktails did the trick for our table.  Specifically, the Saint & Sage and the Concord Smash were both delightful, with the sage bringing a soft herbal undertone to the lemon, but was not very savory.  The Concord Smash had a bolder juice flavor, which meant that even people on the fence about gin would enjoy this. To start, we got the Wellfleet Oysters (delicious, not too briny and the mignonette was on point), Deviled Eggs (the yolk mixture was whipped cream fluffy, and the smoked white fish (I think) was a nice change from roe), and a pot of mussels.  The mussels themselves were as tender as could be (one had the beard on :-/) but the broth was slightly less flavorful than I had hoped.  None the less I doused the accompanying crostinis in it. For our entrées we had the NY Strip, which was fatty but delicious (I prefer lean) and came with the most amazing fried polenta sprinkled with blue cheese.  The Lamb tasting was 3 types of lamb, with the small (too small) chop tied with the braised shoulder, vastly ahead of the lamb sausage which was dry (common problem).  The three cuts were all nestled in a Mediterranean bed of curried chickpeas with cucumber yogurt, cilantro and olives.  This made the dish and paired perfectly with the lamb.   Our other two dishes were less exciting.  The Rabbit Milanese was so-so, it tasted much like veal Milanese and I thought the delicate rabbit flavor was lost to the fried exterior.  The Pan Roasted Tuna was unexciting and in need of a different combination - the escarole had little flavor and it the whole dish seemed like a deconstructed and cooked Nicoise salad.  Meh. Dessert brought it back again with a fabulous Sundae (we substituted Dulce de Leche ice cream for chocolate - yum!) and the Cookshop Candybars which were amazing as well, very rich but the nougat was light enough to induce complete devourment (go with it).   All in all a great meal, though there was room for improvement.  I want to come back for the infamous brunch, and will likely do a follow up review then.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here for a group lunch.  Very nicely decorated space.  They even have an area to hang your coat! It was a bit awkward at first, because we came in a large group.  We called to let them know ahead and while they said their large table was taken, they could still seat us.  But they didn't mention that 6 of us would be in a booth and the other 2 would be at a table about 5 feet away.  Good thing we were a very loving group, because we decided to squeeze together in the sizable booth.  And they came out with puffed rice chips with tasty dipping sauces  which was a nice surprise at lunch, and diverted our mild discomfort.   But then came the lunch specials.  We pretty much got a little bit of everything and ended up sharing family style with the prixe fixe!  The lunch special comes with your choice of an App, an Entree (vegetarian or non-vegetarian) and your choice of dessert.  I enjoyed the samosa because it had some spice to it!  And the mixed pakora (mixed veggie fritters) - YUUUUMMM and it wasn't too greasy at all.  I had the chicken tikka which was tender, creamy,  had a good spice to it and wasn't too oily.  Also shared at the table was saag paneer, boghi jaipuri, chicken saag and chicken jalfreezie, all of which were very tasty and approved by all.  Also their naan and parantha were hot, fresh and perfect pairings for our saucy entrees.  There was so much food that some of us were able to box it up.   For dessert, we had rice pudding that had a nice touch of cardamom on top! Overall, this place is absolutely great for a group lunch - just RSVP earlier!  While it felt a little pricey to do lunch, it was a special occasion, and could not have picked a better place for everyone to enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Items sampled: Quattro Mani ""Toh-Kai"" 2008 from Primorie Slovenia Pan Fried Mashed Potatoes Three Eggplants - Thai, Italian, Japanese with Chevre Bobo Chicken - Tea Brined and Grilled House made Vanilla Ice Cream with Pork Cracklin' Brittle and Chocolate Sauce They don't have a website, they don't take reservations, and they don't use any fancy tools or tricks yet the team at St. Anselm - from my server named Margo to Chef Yvon de Tassigny and his two sous-chefs - managed to produce one of the most wholly enjoyable experiences on my most recent trip to New York.  Small, loud, and decidedly warm from my vantage at the chef's counter a concise menu was presented and without a cocktail list I decided what I would eat and allowed the bartender to suggest my drink - an orange wine full of minerality but light sweetness - and from there I sat back and watched the team turn out plate after plate of perfectly grilled cuisine, from crunchy cauliflower to enormous tomahawks, until my order came up - a troika of savories that rank amongst the best I've ever had in their respective categories; the eggplants smoky but tinged with brine from the cheese, the chicken crunchy and golden yet moist and rich, and the potatoes a buttery masterpiece inside of a crunchy hash brown shell.  Happy, and with more dinner plans to follow, dessert was almost ignored until it was offered on the house; a simple sundae with the rich vanilla ice cream garnished with Mast Brothers chocolate sauce and house made caramelized pork skin...how could anyone say no?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I wish I could have given a 4.5, but noooo Yelp won't le me do that. Got xtra hot chicken and flavor was great, but nowhere near ""Nashville hot"".  One of the owners, Craig, came out and took my precious hot chicken back and fixed it up for me. Was comparable to Princes med to hot. If you want really hot, tell them you are from Nashville and to make it Nashville hot.  They will spice it up considerably for you.  I think this is great that the hot chicken is spreading. My wife had the jalapeño pulled pork and was yummy. So were the black-eyed peas. The fries were off the chain. I would love to come back and try the rice bowls, but since I am from Nashville, this will be difficult. Chicken had a little sweetness to it, so again different than any of the ones in Nashville.  It was a nice change though.  Spread the hot chicken craze!!!!

"Met up with a few friends for happy hour on my last trip to NYC. It was a great place to start the night with their $6 lychee martini happy hour special. The lychee martinis taste like juice but definitely potent. They also have a few other drinks on happy hour and some awesome drinks that were not on happy hour but we stuck to the martinis. Loved that their happy hour goes until 10pm. Super chill spot, cute, dimly lit, good music (but not the main attraction). Great place for a chill night or to start the evening. Enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Oh soup dumpling. How I love you!! Ever since the thought of soup dumplings was put into my head our first day in NY, the mere mention of Joe's Shanghai and all its soup dumpling goodness made my mouth water. What I craved most, in fact, was dim sum and at a close second ran soup dumpling with a baton in its hand. When we were here, it was a Sunday evening around dinner time. The place was full of people but our wait was short(10-15mins) and the service was fast. Boom! We ordered pan fried noodles, the chef's special of scallops and shrimp, and of course the pork soup dumplings. Everything was delicious, and as much as I want to say we  polished every single plate. We wound up inhaling all of the soup dumplings(there's a total of 8 dumplings in each steamer), placing another order for more soup dumplings, and boxing up the other two entrees we had. I don't know about you but that should say a lot. Wow... just thinking about it is making me drool a little. Holy cow. Aww...

"I was SO SURE I would love this place, and man I wish I had been right. Let me explain: I love sauce. Doesn't really matter that much what kind of sauce it is. If I can dip any combination of vegetables/fried potatoes/fried meats/bread products/rice/really anything in it, I'm content. I just really like the process of dipping. In fact, when I played on what was quite possibly the most hurt intramural sports team ever in college, the official nickname on my team jersey was 'Sauce.' That's how much I like sauce. And gosh, I would have probably been ALL OVER this place when I was in college. Unfortunately, I am not, and neither is my metabolism. After I finally, finally, finally, managed to convince a group of people to go to Pommes Frites one evening after a few beers, we ordered up what turned out to be WAY too many sauces - rosemary aioli, garlic aioli, cheese sauce, lemon and dill aioli, 'war sauce' , pesto mayo, horseradish mayo...that might have been it. For sixish people. Afterwards I seriously felt like I might need to throw up. I know - this is not really Pommes Frites' fault. It's ours. One should know better than to order a cone of greasy fries and SEVEN different mayonnaise-based sauces and not expect to feel ill. But Pommes Frites is an ENABLER. I dare you to look at that sauce menu and walk away feeling good about yourself. If you're going to do it anyway...the rosemary, lemon dill, and pesto mayo were our faves and the fries were freshly fried.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great decor but food and service could use some improvement. I was really looking forward to lunching here, specifically for the pulled pork sandwich and brussels sprouts appetizer but something just missed the mark. The brussels sprouts I would assume were seasonally swapped for broccoli, which were delicious but was disappointed to find teeny square bits of pork rather than the big crispy pig ears I'd expected. After all, the dish is called Broccoli with Crispy Pig Ears! Despite all that, the salad was the highlight of the meal. The broccoli was beautifully roasted and lightly dressed with a delicious buttermilk and onion concoction. I really wanted to love the pulled pork but it was much prettier than it was tasty. The ""whisky pickles"", as described were more like pickled vegetables but I enjoyed the BBQ potato chips, especially when paired with the Kelso Smoky beer.

"We had our 2012 office Christmas party at this Chelsea location.  We were a party of 18, not a big party, but certainly not insignificant.  Beyond that, the boss is friends with the owners of Luzzo's for years, so the incident should never have happened.  Let me correct that, it should not have happened to anyone, especially with a guest who knows the owners, with a party of 18, visiting for a holiday celebration.  UNFORGIVABLE!!! We had 5:30pm reservations and seated in a timely manner.  By the time we settled in and were prepared to order appetizers, it was probably around 6:00pm.  It was close to 6:15 to 6:30 when we started getting food on the table.  We had a round of pizzas and various appetizers.  Ovest is renowned for the pizza, and they were good as expected.  But I was very disappointed by the meatballs.  They were nothing in particular in flavor and texture.  I suspect they were sitting in the kitchen for a while because they arrived at room temperature.  The artichoke hearts were again, nothing in particular.  I can't even remember the rest because they were all who-cares. We finished appetizers and they took our entree orders around 7:00 and were served by 7:30.  My entree was ravioli with mushrooms.  Again, arrived lukewarm and was nothing in particular.  Fine, we had our entrees and had pleasant conversation.  At around 8:00pm, a waiter just brings over a tiny metal bucket with a piece of paper in it.  We were distracted by conversation and didn't pay attention to it.  A few minutes later, someone noticed the bucket and was curious to see what it was.  It was the bill for the dinner - totally unexpected given they just cleared the entree dishes.  Take note, we just finished our entrees.  We were not offered dessert or coffee.  They wanted us out for the next party that booked the entire restaurant for the rest of the night. Rightfully so, the boss gets pissed and talks to the manager.  Come to find out, they booked the next party for 9:00pm and needed to clear the entire dining floor.  We confirmed the reservations twice with the expected count.  It is absolutely unforgivable that a restaurant would rush out a party of 18 without offering dessert or coffee.  If the schedule is tight, then do not take our reservations.  They knew it was an office holiday party.  And what office party is done within 3 hours between seating to paying the bill?  While all this chaos is going on, it was revealed they refused to serve someone in our party another glass of wine earlier in the evening (that would mean we would stick around for longer).  The boss demands either comp the entire dinner and we will leave immediately, or serve us dessert and coffee, and give the person her wine that she asked for.  They countered saying they don't have any desserts to offer us.  They would discount the dinner 30% and comp the gratuities.  My boss says the waitstaff was fine so we will not screw them on the tips - they worked for it.  He will take the 30% discount.  But they must serve us dessert and coffee. 15 minutes later, they served us these sorry pieces of cheesecake that were all oddly shaped - some were large pieces and others small, some were wedges and some squares.  WTF!!!  After another 15 minutes and everyone getting increasingly angry, and with mounting tension because the dining room is now cleared and guests from the other party are walking in, we just said let's get the fuck out of here. Never again.  It is truly sad they were so unprofessional.  Their pizza is good, but not good enough to be so utterly insulted and mistreated.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"***3.5 stars**** After personally spending what seems to be an ENTIRE day (too much) in Wlliamsburg....everybody (meaning LOCALS only) seemed to steer us and recommended Diner for dinner.  Naturally the Locals couldn't be wrong.   Naturally Yelp's starking 4 star review couldn't be wrong either...AND the fact that there is NO menu ...and it's set the same day exactly at 6pm? Sounded too good to be true and anticipated much of the suspense of what seems to be organically grown food.  are they killing chickens back there?  Apparently, they source most of their ingredients from Marlow & Sons...  the butcher shop just a few doors down.  Which, by the way, the owner owns.  Huh, makes sense in the grand scheme of things.   The Diner.... looked like a sub par trailer park... authentic in look, felt ultra cozy. Very chill...very williamsburg. No complaints.   Our waiter memorized the menu and wrote down on the table what the daily offerings are.  Apparently the burger was a staple.  The burgers were ordered as well as the fish soup, which was their version of a shellfish and fish bouillabaise. One burger ... ordered medium, was on the medium rarer side.  that had to be redone.  the waiter offered no apologies whatsoever....and dude, we know it's not your fault...but you basically REPRESENT diner.  and for that... we were left scratching our heads like WTF.  the burger while good was wayyyyyy too salty.  My poor gf, by the time she got her food, I was practically done with mine.   My bouillabaise was smoky, light, flavorful filled with mussels, a bit of clams and white fish and chick peas that i could have lived without... By the time all was said and done... my friend actually built up nerves to ask for the manager...and rightly so.  She let James know of her experiences...and he apologized profusely.  We thought an apology was the least he could do and we appreciated it.  Additionally, he had promise to write an apology letter enclosed with a gift card.  This is amazing customer service right there..

"Wow! That's all I have to say...ok I will say more. I went here with my brother and his friend before watching Interpol at Terminal 5 last night. I was there a bit earlier so I ordered some wine and put in the order for the crostini with goat cheese, roasted red peppers and pepitas. Pepitas are so hip right now! And for good reason! People focus so much on nuts and the seeds get forgotten.  My wine was bit sweet almost desserty and not fruity. But it was still tasty. When my brother and his friend arrived, the crostini came out. There were three of them so it was all set up for sharing. The bread was perfectly toasted and all the flavors melted together. I loved the pepitas crunch! I wanted to eat them all. My brother was so excited about the menu that he went on a rampage, we got the shittake mushroom tacos, short ribs, octopus with garbanzos and chorizo, the olives and brussell sprouts with squash puree and lime. The olives came out and my brother was more than excited! He was in heaven!! Lucky for us he was sharing. Then the tacos came out and they were absolutely phenomenal!! I wish I could get them everyday! My brother's friend even said he didn't miss the meat. There were three tacos but once, again I could have gobbled them up by myself. I couldn't partake on the short ribs or octopus since, I'm pescatarian but they were both getting rave reviews from the carnivores. I ended up getting the hamachi tartare with sweet potato, ponzu, wasabi and shiitake. It was gorgeous and the flavors were spot on. I loved the layers of flavor in the this dish. We stuffed our selves and will definitely be back when we are in the neighborhood. I will say this place is labeled as tapas but it's more like small plates and not Spanish. There was a very multicultural menu and it tasted super seasonal, two of my favorite things!  Also the atmosphere is great for date night or a small group. PS The service was so helpful and nice. They really helped enjoy the experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I don't think it's always fair to review such a new restaurant, though I've been three times. What really bothers me is the layout of the bar/bottles. There's such a huge bar, and so much wasted space. An entire side of the bar is taken up where people could be sitting, and it happened more than once that I continued to walk past seeing there were no seats at the bar. Although I understand why bottles need to be properly displayed, it felt cluttered and almost unnecessary the amount of stuff they have behind there. The dining room is nice, and felt spacious. I felt like they could fit more tables, but maybe they just arent' ready for that. t felt like they cared more about the decor that the flow and layout of the restaurant. Why is there a bike at the bar? Why is there not a place to sit by one of those awesome windows? The food came out in a timely fashion, and was good. Not the best I'd every\ had, not the largest, but good for a recent open restaurant. Service has been spotty, but I can deal with that for now. A new nervous staff is allowed some slack in the first few months...however both times I had interactions with what I assumed was a manager, well let's just say she was not very nice.

"Ippudo serves some of the best ramen in the city.  As a proud Nihonjin, I'm glad Ippudo can give New Yorkers a chance to try what real, non-Maruchan ramen tastes like.  While I wish they served more authentic Izakaya-style starters (like gyoza), you can't go wrong at this place.  It's slightly over-priced, but it's certainly not a rip-off.   But, if I'm not in the mood to deal with the long wait, I head over to Minca...a tiny, unassuming ramen place over on 5th and Ave B.  They have great broths (the miso is my fav) better-balanced pork belly than Ippudo, and awesome gyoza.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came here twice, once with my boyfriend and once with my family. First time, we ordered the Matsuri ($70 for 2 includes kalbi chuck tare, miso soup, prime rib eye steak ponzu, chicken basil, gyukaku salad, edamame, bibimbap and s'mores for dessert) Also tried the cherry blossom drink they had it was very yummy! If you're looking for a girly drink, that is definitely the one for you! Second time the Kando ($130 for 4 people including again an assortment of meats, vegetables, seafood, rice, noodles and dessert). I loved this because it came with lobster, salmon, duck, chicken, kalbi, asparagus, mushrooms etc. I had a good experience both times our servers were helpful and attentive. The food was delicious and savory. Just looking at the small dishes they serve, you wouldn't think that it'll be filling enough, but believe me it is! My only criticism is that the food is served very fast and if you are not a meat expert - it's very easy to lose track of which meat they are serving you, and also how long you need to cook each one for. My first time there, I really wanted to learn about what I was eating and the waitress was more than happy to explain it for us. However, the second time, there was immensely more choices and it became more confusing to keep track. Overall though, the food was great, each meat marinated in it's own delicious way, the vegetables were great and i actually really enjoyed the bibimbap because it helped to balance the saltiness of the different meats. Lastly, I actually really came for the GREEN TEA MILLE CREPE! Though it is on the pricey end ($9 a slice) it is absolutely amazing and completely worth it. It's the best dessert to wrap up a meal! Trust me the green tea mille crepe is an order you will not regret! *tip: they take your jackets in the front so that at least it will not smell like BBQ after so definitely drop it off! ~chow! ;D","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Much closer to a 4.5 but no such option and it wasn't enough for the full 5... Came here with the hubbs for my birthday dinner because he knows how much i adore tiny homey restaurants in the park slope/carrol gardens area..an absolute hit! Tiny little place (maybe 10 tables max?), no menus - they're posted on paper along the walls with delicious specials, great ambiance, super attentive and friendly service staff! Overall, all of the food was fresh and full of taste despite the uber simple ingredients. Here's a taste of our tastes: Skate fish -- very juicy white fish, similar to a Cod or Bass but juicy. Tuna Carpaccio -- very fresh slab of marinated tuna over greens, big enough to share for 2 but also delicious enough to enjoy by 1 fried oysters -- not sure why we even ordered this...we ADORE oysters but aren't huge fans of fried food...this was definitely a miss. The fried was too fried and the oyster too fishy of a contrast ; not for our tastebuds seafood chowder - hearty, fresh, and loaded with seafood. seafood ciappoto - lobster, scallops, shrimps, mussels all in a bulyon base...an absolute must!!

"I think it was a true sense of disbelief that kept me from reviewing Woorijip at first. How could Korean fast food consistently deserve five stars? How could it be? What they say is true. It's packed, the atmosphere isn't all that friendly, but just do your double-take at the price tags, and see how tasty it all is, and tell me all five aren't in order. Among my faves: glass noodles with generous onions, carrots, leafy greens enough for a light lunch $3.00. With tender, thinly cut beef, $4. Perfectly seasoned spicy crunchy bean sprouts, $2. Fresh ramen in thick salty yum broth with eggs, $5. I get overwhelmed at the fresh buffet, and I can only handle making a choice from the rest of the wide selection because I'm hungry and I have to get back to work. They have it all. Kimchi pancakes, scallion pancakes, with and without egg. Kimbap, all kinds of panjan, bulgogi, tofu stews, squid, and much more. Eye-popping variety.

"I've had four meals at Olea on three different trips to NYC and each one has been about the best meal of the trip. The wine list is fantastic, but every trip we find ourselves going back to the Lambrusco that's so much better than anything we can find anywhere else. The service, starting with the host, is top-notch and warm. They do everything they can to make your meal an A+. We especially like that when you ask for their suggestions or favorites, they always offer the perfect dish. They've never steered us wrong. I've had fish just about every way they do it and each one is damn near perfect....so it's hard not to get some for of fish each type I go. I've also been to Olea for a couple holidays (New Year's and Valentine's) and the chef's menu for each of those days was a great treat for the special occasion, so anytime I get the chance to put myself in their hands, I do it. It's damn near perfect...and when I go back to NYC in a couple months it's the only restaurant I can say with all certainty that I KNOW I'll be re-visiting.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let's start off that I came here cause I got a groupon and I always wanted to try Himalayan food. Plus it was close to 74th Jackson Heights; I haven't eaten at a lot of the places at Jackson Heights but the ones that I did . I loved and always came back to the place since the food were great. Himalayan Yak wasn't one of them - sorry to disappoint. Anyways, when we first went into the restaurant it wasn't packed (it was a Thursday night) the lighting were dimmed and sort of gave it a romantic feel to it- very cool  . Once we were seated we were given menus and there seems to be a lot of items on it. It was hard to choose what to get. But we ended up getting chicken lollipops , beef momos, chicken curry, and a goat curry.  We were given three sauces - not sure what it was but I gave them each a taste (cause I do that before putting it on my food duhh) Honestly, They didn't taste like anything special , not even flavorful actually. The chicken lollipops came out first and I was so excited since I never had a bad chicken lollipop before. Yeahhh.....this chicken lollipop sure weren't anything great. It wasn't dry at least but wasn't super tender. All the chicken lollipops I had were all different in taste and flavors and were GREAT!!! These weren't.  I tried using some of the sauces given , put some on the chicken and it didn't help but the sauces weren't good anyways. Beef momos came out- one order came out to about 6-8 dumplings (forgot how many) I wasn't sure if it was because we got the beef momos but I thought it needed more spices or something. I felt like they just shaped some beef and wrapped it. You deff taste the beef but that's all you'll  taste, No unique flavors or anything- super down about that. Last were the curries and when it came out my boyfriend and I agreed that it looked very homemade ish. It was very liquid-y and runny so to say the least  it  wasn't thick (i personally like my curry thick not super thick but thick) It didn't just look homemade it tasted homemade...it the bad way. The chicken and goat wasn't tough so that was good and there were plenty of big pieces of chicken and goat. So over all the food wasn't great (for  me) and I did not want to come back here at all since NONE of the foods we ordered gave me a good impression. I got to say something about the staff/service for this place because it was not good. The staff ( there were three that I saw in front) did not look happy . Our waitress was not helpful and did nothing other then bring our food. Did not come to our table to make sure we were okay or that everything with the food was fine (which it wasn't !!) Then when we got out check she told us what the total was with our groupon and had the balls to demand that we were to give her ""this amount"" of tip . .She sure as hell did not deserve it!! I don't even want to give this place another try, if it wasn't for the groupon I would had tried Himalayan food at another place around Jackson Height . But it was a groupon and from the yelp reviews it made it seem like it was good.....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What a great addition to the Forest Hills area!  My husband and I stopped by this past weekend to check it out and we were impressed!  This place has a cool ambiance, a great selection of craft beer, and an awesome bar staff! My husband is really into beer and he loved the beer selection.  I, on the other hand, have never really found my way into beer but I figured I should give it a try and see if within this large beer selection there may be a beer I would like.  I told the bartender that I'm unfamiliar with craft beer, and she was extremely accomodating!  She provided 3 different samples of beers she felt I would like and low and behold we were able to find a winner!   The only piece of my experience that wasn't top notch was the food.  We ordered a pizza and fried meatballs.  Not only did it take almost a half an hour for the food to arrive, but when it got there we found the pizza to be underwhelming and the meatballs weren't thoroughly cooked.   The bartender (chris) did warn us upon ordering the pizza that it would be small, but it was also soggy and the sauce was a little saltier in my opinion than it should be.  Also, the meatballs had far too much beer batter.   In conclusion- Station House has a lot of good things going for it.  Once the food catches up with all the other awesome elements this bar has to offer there is no doubt in my mind that it will do very well here in Forest Hills.  As far as I'm concerned- I'll be back for sure!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Really good food! The highlight of the meal was the dumplings- they are amazing and worth the trek from whatever location you are coming from. The pillows of sheep's milk ricotta melt in your mouth. The octopus is really amazing as well, and I actually prefer it to the octopus at taverna kyclades. Finally, we got the greek paella, and this was good as well if you are a seafood lover. The restaurant hostess has a bit of a chilly attitude, but the wait staff- particularly Christina- are lovely. Finally, I want to mention that the chef/owner went out of his way to make us happy. A truly classy establishment! I'll be back to eat the dumplings over and over again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My girlfriend and I went here for brunch yesterday and unfortunately we will not return. She had been there many times and always had a fantastic experience. Let me start with the good. The food was fantastic. Fresh and very tasty. My Bellini, while 9 dollars, hit the spot and the fruit puree used to make it was top notch. Unfortunately our waiter was the problem here. He was smug from the start and treated us like garbage. After we sat down i noticed that our table was very wobbly so I asked if we could be moved to another table or have it fixed. He said he would fix it and preceded to climb under the table and start jostling it all over the place. Our drinks were spilling all over the table so my GF and i grabbed our drinks and held them up for about 5 min while he continued to try and fix the table. After we had ordered, he proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the meal. My water remained empty for the rest of the time while we observed him filling other patrons glasses. After our food arrived he did not stop by to see how our food was or acknowledge our existence. We finished our meal and sat there for about 10 min waiting for our plates to be cleared but no such luck. I asked for our check and even when he brought us the bill no words from his mouth, a grunt, and the plates remained. When my GF was trying to sign the bill she had no room to do so as her plate was still on the table so I grabbed her plate and made a little noise as I did so and stacked our plates in front of me. Our server was at the table next to us and saw me do this and still would not come by to clear our table! We we left him a very generous 15% and got outta there. It is unfortunate as this place has fantastic food but this poor schmuck has soured my palate and I will not return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place just seems a little bit choppy and rough around the edges. It is friendly enough, but not completely welcoming. I went there for dinner with the parents and the gf and ended up ordering a mish-mash of small and large plates. The oysters were decent and a good deal at 1.50 a pop, the pork sliders were good as well. The burger was tasty. The mushroom ravioli was mediocre. The calamari was plentiful but a little too oily. We also ordered the cod and that came out not fully cooked (it felt like it was frozen fish that had not fully thawed) and so we returned it. While our waitress and then the manager were gracious enough about it they didn't tell us whether they were making another one for us or just taking it off the check- it would have been nice to be asked/informed since we sat around for another 15 minutes before asking for the check. The cocktails were generally uninspiring- The Pina was too sweet, The Red Root too beety , the Spritzer and Midsummer Night's Dream were fine. The decor is nice and there are plenty of seating options (bar, outside, inside etc) and its not a bad place but it just seemed like there was something amiss at every stage (even if minor). We had a nice time but I probably wouldn't recommend it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My place raved so much about this place on how it's so AMAZING, but I kind of lied to him saying it's good...  Sorry! This place is located in Chinatown in which there is definitely a culture of its own. The restaurant is in a small shop that could probably house maybe 15-17 people?  I got the chicken curry platter in which there was rice, chicken, curry, and lettuce.  You basically mix everything up in the curry sauce and eat.  The chicken tasted like something fried out of the frozen food section.  Overall, there was just nothing appetizing about it.  The only good thing it did was stop my hunger from a long day in the city. I probably didn't like this place because I have relatively sophisticated palette, and this place definitey doesn't scream high-end/luxury/good food, but other people seem to have good reviews on this place.  But if you're anything like me, don't go here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Well, first off, the food is tasty! They offer both mainstream rolls (spicy tuna, Philadelphia, etc.) and speciality rolls... and also feature daily chef's specials, bento boxes, etc. etc. Some of my favorite rolls from the menu include the Monkey Roll (shrimp tempura w/ avocado and spicy sauce) and the Crazy Dragon Rol (spicy crabmeat w/ eel, tuna, & salmon). Also tasty at Iron Chef are the appetizers, soups, and salads. I recommend the Yaki Udon chicken noodle soup! Awesome!! As for atmosphere, it's great, too.

There's one guy collecting the money and the other guy for ordering and getting the food. It's not their service I'm rating 3 stars though: it's the food. The chicken over rice came in a tin foil pan, okay, whatever. But the chicken was chopped so fine that it kind of just mushed into the rice and sauce. It's a personal preference, but I prefer my meat to have some texture so I don't feel like I'm eating something grounded, which, honestly, can be anything.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The (positive) reviews here did not let me down! Just back to Philly from a day trip to Chelsea district to check out galleries. I scoped out places to eat in the area online beforehand to see if there was anything not too fancy (i.e. cheaper). I still only expected 'NY cheap'. This was just what I wanted and expected based on the write-ups. A tiny, hole-in-the-wall place that was no frills, no fuss. Just straight grub big on taste. You dieting? Just keep walking. The guys in here were super friendly and it was obvious that most of the customers are regulars (always a good sign)! We got there at the tail-end of lunch, so managed to get seats at the small counter. I'm guessing there's a line out the door during lunch hour. The unexpected bonus? This food was cheaper than some of the cheap places in Philly! Anytime I'm even remotely in the area again, you can be sure I'll make a point to stop at Johny's for grub.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went to Gramercy for a special occasion.  We made reservations several weeks in advanced, and were surprised only 6pm and 10pm reservations are possible, but learned the reason why while dining:  it takes several hours to enjoy the tasting menu. I had the vegetarian tasting menu ($98).  Each course was served beautifully, in seemingly custom dishes, with fresh, perfectly placed silverware.  The roasted beet salad in buttermilk dressing was a real highlight; full of interesting flavor and texture combinations.  Carmelized cauliflower was also delightful.  I would say this menu could be improved by replacing the pole bean salad with a more concentrated protein; this is because this dish was not particularly flavorful, and I left the meal feeling much fuller than others who had the seasonal tasting menu- I think because I was inundated with vegetable fiber.  The celery, mushroom and polenta was gourmet comfort food at its finest; mushrooms nicely sauteed and salted, polenta like molten butter.   The deserts are not to be forgotten; starting with a decadent chocolate mousse, and then (without any decision to be made), dark chocolates, chocolate and peanut butter mousse pastries, grape macaroons and chocolate cinnamon truffles. The only strange part was our waiter's very strange lack of knowledge about wine.  We asked for certain varietals (which were on the menu), and were taken in completely different (mainstream) directions, for reasons that are unclear to me.   Overall an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"WHY WHY WHY? Waiting two hours for a slice? I'll tell you why. It is god damn good. mmmhmmm. Can I tell you about the cheeses? Three (I think) different generously portioned cheeses bless this pie, along with fresh tomato chunks hand scissored basil and perfect slightly tangy and doughy (if not a lil burnt) crust. I am awed. Clearly 5 stars for the pizza. BUT the wait. Fuck me, it is torture. And the poor (??) second in charge to Domenico was just doing a bad job keeping up with his own scribbled notes as to who was next and what was ordered. This is bad. Very bad business.

Bf and I went here over the weekend. The hostess said the wait was an hour forty five  but we were seated an hour and a half. Kudos to them. I've never waited  that long for dinner and they don't take reservations which I am not a fan of.   But overall I was impressed with a couple of factors. Food:   For appetizers we had the crispy pork belly and pork buns. I did not think these were good despite all the rave reviews.  I've had these dishes elsewhere and they pale in comparison here. For dinner I had karaka men with tamago added and they were excellent. I liked this ramen way better than shin sen gumi but the bf's akamaru modern wasn't as good. Food - 3 1/2 Service:  such excellent service.  The staff was awesome. I requested hot water because it was freezing outside and they were very accommodating.  Water was never empty and the food was out in matters of fifteen minutes of sitting down. Now if this was fine dining restaurant I would question the 15mins food but this was street food and I commend them for getting the service and food waiting factor down to the tee. 5+ Decor:  cool trendy vibe. 3 1/2 Now if only I can befriend the hostess or the owners is I wouldn't have to wait in the hour and a half line!  Would I come back?  Maybe when I figure out which night is a slow night for them. Perhaps a weeknight. But until they have a reservation system (which I doubted) I won't be spending another weekend night here.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's a diner. In Williamsburg. This means that they have normal diner fare, but also a full bar, faux-retro diner decor to go along with it, and it's run by people wearing flannel, not a hairy dude in a wifebeater. The bookshelf has literary reviews and graphic novel anthologies. We came after helping a friend move, and were so hungry we could just about eat the table. We promptly ordered tons of junk food including a plate of fried chicken and gravy, collards, and fried okra, which was my favorite. They have 'tater tots', but really they're closer to potato puffs or hush-puppies. It was all pretty excellent and the price wasn't that bad. The worst thing about it is that they don't have one of those intermediate entry ways so that cold air in winter doesn't flow into the restaurant. We were seated by the door and had to keep our jackets on. Other than that, seems like a good place to get your night started in the Bedford Ave area.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you are hunting for an old, historically significant restaurants in NYC, having  a meal at the pub where George Washington drank his beer couple centuries ago- is probably difficult to beat. There is even a live acoustic chamber - jazz music on site, during the brunch. Food wise- they are provably OK, at least from what I was able to see from my table. My chef's salad was an average ride, but the other party of my table loved her stake and eggs. There is an option of sitting in "" original"" low ceiling lounge. The place is a tourist attraction  so don't look for a specific ""neighborhood"" wibe. However Im giving it 4 star because Im a "" sucker "" for the preserved but living historic sites.

I came for a good friend's birthday party - a group of 14 of us.  We were seated at two separate long tables that were placed right next to each other.  Each table was served the communal Ssam Bar dinner.  We ordered drinks a la carte and then everything else was prix fixe, shared family style.  We had a menu at the end of the table so we always knew what was coming next. The first course was a light, refreshing ceviche of corvina with kumquat and hot pepper garnishes in a citrusy marinade, with these amazing rice puffs on top.  It was a great amuse bouche for the pigginess that ensued. Second course was this plate of charcuterie with delicious breads and spreads.  One of them was lardo, which I'm pretty sure is pure lard.  There was a gravy of some sort, and also sea salt butter.  By this point I could tell that no part of the pig would go wasted... Third course were Momofuku's pork belly buns.  Enough said, but I will elaborate.  Cloud-like fluffy white steamed buns.  Unctuously fatty pork belly.  Sweet and savory hoisin sauce and scallions inside.  NOM NOM NOMMITY NOM.  Along with this course, the servers brought out a lovely plate of all kinds of pickled vegetables that could be used as garnish for the pork belly buns or for the... Fourth course of PIG!  A seriously massive hunk of on-the-bone pork butt came out, looking garish and gruesome and altogether delicious.  Soft butter lettuce, 12 raw oysters, rice, and a trio of hot sauces came out with it.  Then, we looked at each other hesitantly and started pulling at the meat with our chopsticks.  As expected, it fell off in pure unadulterated porky shreds of goodness.  We made pork-veg-rice-oyster lettuce wraps, dipped, ate, and made more wraps.  And more wraps. One of our tables (mostly guys) picked the carcass clean and the other came away with pound and pounds of leftovers.  Hmmmm.   For dessert, which I think was the weakest course, there was a giant s'more.  The marshmallow inside had a very strange texture and was cloyingly sweet, and also tasted somewhat burnt.  I think the burnt taste was intentional but something about it tasted a bit artificial, like they used liquid smoke instead of actually toasting the marshmallows! All in all, a solid 4 stars.  I had a most enjoyable time and my husband is still on pork ban (policed by me) for the rest of the week.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Took me 4 trips to this place to finally be able to get a slice. First time: closed Second time: closed because of extreme weather(with what he charges  for his pizza, you would think the place would have an A/C 3rd time: closed because they ran out of dough(never heard anything so ridiculous before) 4th time: woohoooo! Finally I got a slice, and the moment I took the first bite I couldn't help but laugh and think about that famous PT Barnum quote. The pizza was garbage. Burnt, well, actually, more like charred, tasteless and just not worth even a penny. Do yourself a favor, and go to John's on  Bleeker, or any decent pizzeria in Brooklyn(every neighborhood has at least half a dozen of them) and stay away from this shithole.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"SO wonderful. I stumbled upon this place online and the menu and the aesthetic had me from the start.  A friend and I stopped by and it was packed, so despite the 65 degree weather, we decided to eat outside. Our server was awkward and charming, totally helpful, on top of things and a good sport about having to come outside in the less than comfortable temperatures. We started with the house made ricotta with honey comb, figs, fresh thyme, sea salt, and fruit nut bread. Perfect. Ricotta is a hard thing to fuck up, but it's also a hard thing to present in any sort of unique way and really make your own and Five Leaves succeeded on both accounts. My friend, who I was dining with, commented on how this isn't something he would have ordered on his own but was blown away by. For my main course I ordered a tagliatelle with seared leaks and mushrooms (the kind is escaping me at the moment) in a white wine cream sauce, and it was so delicious. SO SO SO delicious. We ended things with a rosewater pavlova served with whipped cream, a passion fruit curd, and kiwi fruit. This thing melted in your mouth. I would happily never eat another dessert again after this. This place is wonderful! The food and drinks are thoughtful, inventive, and well executed. The price point is completely reasonable and the service was wonderful. Being located in Greenpoint, the people watching was quite a bit of fun as well. I hope to get back here soon when I'll be able to get a table inside and experience the atmosphere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am from Tokyo and Ippudo is one of my TOP 3 ramen places in NYC. (others are Zen 6 and Totto Ramen) The recipe for the broth is a bit different from Ippudo in Japan but it certainly keeps a traditional flavor. Unlike, Ippudo in Japan, the locations in Manhattan offer a very tasty selection of appetizers. Goma kyuri and edamame are some light ones to snack with a beer while you wait for the ramen. If you feel like some heavier starters, Samurai shortrib and Hirata chiken wings are super tasty.

"I'm shocked at how high the reviews for this place are.  I went on a Saturday night with 3 other people, we all got different cocktails, and they all ranged from underwhelming to really bad.  The gin mule, which is relatively simple to make, had so much ginger in it that it actually burned my throat (and I normally love ginger drinks).  There are tons of bars/restaurants with 1000x better cocktails than this (including Rubirosa just a few blocks away).  On top of that, the bartender ignored us for 10 minutes while chatting with his friends and taking shots, and then when we finally ordered he didn't even acknowledge us or say a single word--just turned around and started making our (subpar) drinks.  Clearly we disturbed him by asking him to actually serve drinks instead of hanging out with his friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"

In one single meal, these things happened: -The bottle of wine had gone bad and had to be sent back -- the ONLY time I ever had to do that. -My pizza was ""dropped"" and the replacement pizza came out 20 min. later with no explanation until I asked. -The table was unclean with walnuts and oil on it until we asked for it to be cleaned and then it took 15 min. to make it happen, and when the waiter finally cleaned it, he sprayed Windex on someone at our table and in her water. Every time the waiter did these sorts of things, he'd say, ""It happens, you know?"" ...  No, these things don't need to happen!

"Honestly, I'm a bit baffled by the positive reviews because my friends and I had an AWFUL experience here. On first entering (btw entering through a garden gate does not a great restaurant make) it's a cute looking little place. Very tight on space, but visually nice looking. That's where the good times stop. Crowd: Not the most attractive. In fact, pretty bridge 'n' tunnel. Couples full on making out at the bar and pushing into our table. So yes, not exactly a classy crowd... Food: appetizer and main where OK, fairly standard. Desert was downright BAD. We all had  one bite of each of the 2 we'd ordered, and couldn't touch any more. Service. Pretty much the worst service I've ever had. Have never felt so rushed. Our food came out at different times. They then removed plates when we were still eating! The waitress literally took my plate while I had food in my mouth. She was hovering over us so obviously trying to get us the hell out of there that it made the experience feel so hurried and unpleasant, when a good meal in a good restaurant should be relaxed, easy and fun. To be fair to the waitress, I think she was under ridiculous pressure to keep the crowds moving and the tables turning over. I think she (or her boss) even called for back up since we had guy waiters coming over to help clear etc. Towards the end of the meal (when we finally gave up and left) they cleared our glasses still filled with wine and water! I swear we were not taking an abnormally long amount of time. Yes, we were a few minutes late for our table, but that is all. This crazy ""service"" started from the moment we sat down and progressed on the crazy scale for the duration of our hour and a half meal. I think at least one of the owners was there. Shortish weasely guy, floppy lank hair, badly dressed. He flitted about with an unpleasant arrogance and an overbearing attitude. Not nice. Will not be going back. Will not recommend. In fact, will warn all of my well moneyed influencer-about-town friends to stay well away.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Needs improvement, but overall, 5 stars. Hands down, the best sandwich in New York.  Panini and crustini options are creative, yet the ingredients are simple.  Everything you eat gives you that wholesome feeling, but never makes you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed. Must try the PuPu platter the first time you come here, because it's your chance to sample different flavors and find out what taste is right for you. The decor and atmosphere is cabin central United States Americana meets pre-hipster Brooklyn.  Not pretentious, very genuine, warm, pit-stop-during-a-long-road-trip-through-Colorado kind of feel to it. That said, there's plenty of room for improvement.  First, one sweet wine on the menu?  Try throwing in a Bartenura Muscato di Asti, or a 20 year old Port. Second, drink options are standard and limited.  The panini and panna cotta are the main attraction, but a few out-of-the-ordinary-but-not-too-crazy hot chocolate, milkshake, or even egg nog options wouldn't hurt. Third, the menu is not in compliance with the NYC administrative code - it doesn't break down how many calories everything is.  That aside, people use apps like MyNetAppDiary to track what they eat.  If what they're eating is hard to input and keep track of (grams of fat, carbs, protein), they'll move on to something more standard and easier to input.  Try making the menu easier for the conscious eater friendly and those customers (mostly in Queens & Manhattan) will love you for it. Lastly, the panna cotta is absolutely amazing.  I would keep ordering more of them if those chocolate covered corn flakes were smaller or ""pre-cracked"".  I feel like Julia Roberts with the snail in Pretty Woman every time I try to actually break those things into a manageable size.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My $14 pie was, in my opinion, worse than your average on the street slice in NYC.  We sat in the back greenhouse area, which is very cute, but it was too loud to talk.  Wine selection was also weak.  My Nero D'Avila, usually a decent bet, was pretty unpleasant.

"Joya is on the way from the F train stop on Bergen to my boyfriend's digs on Warren Street, strategically placed about 100 paces from the front door.

4 words. DAMN THAT'S GOOD CORN! The corn here is downright amazing. Probably the best corn I've ever eaten in my life. I would definitely come back here just for the corn. The Cuban sandwich is also really good here. It's the perfect amount of juiciness and size. You definitely don't feel like they're skimping on the meat in the sandwich but at the same time it isn't so overstuffed that there's no way to possibly eat it cleanly. But there are downsides to this place and it's tragic because none of the downsides are food-related. The wait here is terrible. The place is pretty small and almost makes you feel like you're actually in Cuba. I'm sure that kind of atmosphere is great if you're actually in Cuba. But we're not. This is Manhattan and there are a lot of people here. Maybe it's better to come here with less people because I came with 6 other people and we had to split into two groups in order to get a seat. The people here are also not the greatest staff in the world. They all look like they love working here but they don't really seem to care enough about the customers. It kind of feels like the waitresses come here to hang out instead of coming here to work. But I just want to emphasize how amazing the food here is. The food is amazing and it's definitely worth going to at least once. I would definitely come back here...with maybe just one other friend.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sadly, this once great place is going downhill.  I've been a long time patron now after having brunch with friends their over 8 years ago.  I have even had the pleasure of seeing a few famous faces every so often when I dine there.  Each time I return, the service seems to go down a notch, the prices go up little, and the food stays about the same.  Now, I have no problem paying for overpriced pancakes and eggs as long as the service is decent, the food is up to par, and my overall experience is enjoyable. However, on my most recent experience, I had the unfortunate experience of having a server who had a ""could give a crap less"" attitude, which didn't make for the greatest start to the meal.  But that's fine, I was still going to enjoy my meal there. Luckily on this occasion I only had to wait 5-10 minutes for our table.  In the past, depending on how late you got there, a wait for a table of 2 could be over an hour. But I digress, I thought I made my order pretty clear asking for one of their signature dishes - my usual (Banana Walnut Pancakes) - without one main ingredient - nuts.  I'm deathly allergic and just ask for the order without walnuts.  Pretty simple, right?  Unfortunately not if your server isn't really paying attention.   After getting our food and knowing what the order is supposed to look like, I knew that the server had gotten my order wrong.  We tried to find the server, who seemed to have disappeared.  We finally tracked him down and waved him over, to which he assumed we wanted our check, since this was the first time he came in the vicinity of our table after taking our order.  Apparently, it would be too much to expect that he check-in to see how everything was after we received our food.   I explained to him that I wanted the Banana Walnut Pancakes, without walnuts.  To which he responded ""So you just want sautéed bananas.""  I agreed, not realizing what he actually entered my order as.  He was kind enough to come over after returning my order to the kitchen and said it would be out in about 3 minutes.   My order reappeared in about 1.  It seemed right, not taking a bite out of it initially.  However, it seemed that the raw, fully sliced banana that was sitting on my pancakes a few minutes ago had merely been replaced with sautéed bananas, about 3 slices to be exact - it usually comes with about 6 slices, as I could tell from the indentation made by the initial banana.  As a patron (and past employee) of any good restaurant, returned food should NEVER be merely replaced, if not thrown out all together.  It should be completely re-done and made to order as requested by a customer.  This would have been something that the server realized had he ever come over to actually see how our food was, especially after being returned to the kitchen.   I ate about half of my meal, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as I usually did, but I couldn't completely put my figure on why.  The pancakes just seemed different.  After receiving our check, I finally realized why my usual delicious order of Sautéed Banana Walnut Pancakes just didn't taste as good.  Instead of getting the Sautéed Banana Walnut Pancakes, I instead received sour dough pancakes with bananas added.  Interesting, since I didn't even know I could add-on fruit. My husband found the eggs to be a bit runny and the food overall just OK.  The biscuits were delicious as always, although smaller than they have been in the past. To say the least, we won't be returning to Bubby's any time soon, if ever.  I would love to give this place I once used to love another chance, but I find it difficult when it just seems like too much to ask for your food to be what you ordered and actually have servers who care and work for the gratuity that they are getting.  There are WAY too many good restaurants in this city to waste our time waiting in line for overpriced, mediocre food here.  Especially when our brunch for two of pancakes, eggs, juice, and soda, not one ounce of alcohol drank, ran us $65.  I can get much more bang for my buck somewhere else.  And their cash only policy seems quite shady.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We had a very good dinner at La Follia. They don't take reservations so we went relatively early on Saturday night (about 6pm). Both the wine bar and dining room had people already enjoying themselves and while there were several empty tables remaining in the dining room, only one was specifically for two and we were lucky enough to nab it. Good thing too, because within 15 minutes of sitting, the rest of the tables were filled. The wife was instantly loving the decor, the music playing at the perfect volume in the background and the menu. We shared a salad (which was split for us in the kitchen). She had the pasta pomodoro, cooking to a perfect al dente. I had the Papardelle.  Both were real good, as was the service and the reasonable cost of the meal.  The good news is we loved the meal. The bad news was there could have been a bit more of it. The food was great. I just wish there had been a little more on the plate.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I just moved to the area so I keep finding little things that really warms me up to my new home. Dekalb is certainly of those places a hidden gem. My friend and I were looking for places that would accommodate her special diet. Saw a sign for warm soup. From the outside look like all the other apartments near it just with a garage door not to far from the door making a slight difference. Well I'm glad they had that little sign up. We went in to find a warm place with warm colors of wood and the smell of fresh coffee just brewed greeting us with friendly people at the bar drinking from their coffee cups. A beautiful deity amazon woman with big hair greeted us and gracefully took us to a deeper area. A room completely made of windows ambient lightning and soulful music playing. I sat down on a church pew really feeling the sacredness of this place. We looked at the menu to find things that my friend could eat. I got the endive and she got the braised salsify to start. Then I got a almond stuffed trout and my friend got a vegetable burger. Followed by the parsnip yogurt dessert. The endive was savory and refreshing. I tasted the braised salsify assuming it would be salty but was happy to find a subtle sweetness. The almond trout was big enough for two people to eat but bc of this snow my appetite was large enough. The veggie burger she enjoyed saying she would come back for it again. The dessert was a masterpiece with the pyramid shape topped with a glass like caramel, a rare taste that wasn't overly sweet but just right. Got the check totaling $66 before the tip this had me and my friend nodding at each other yes we found our church of food. Usually food like this is easily $120-$160.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Eataly to me is one of the go-to places in New York. Although I have never been to Italy, the ambiance and the food here can easily trick me into thinking that I was in Italy if I was blindfolded. Eataly is huge, it has a deli, a market, a restaurant, and a gelato store! It's like walking in a town of its own and the people there are very nice and upbeat about everything. My sisters and I had the the porchetta and prime rib sandwiches there which were both uber tender and juicy. I must say though that the porchetta was very well seasoned even though the prime rib was supposedly more popular. The prime rib to me seemed really thick and just fatty in general. The roll they served it in was not too dry either, it complimented the meat very well. After eating the sandwiches, I could not imagine either sandwiches with veggies and other add-ons, they just seemed to go well without them. After walking around through aisles of imported italian goods and watching workers HANDMAKE their pasta and other italian noodles, we ate some of their gelato. We had three scoops, hazelnut, mint chocolate and tiramisu. I think this was the thickest yet smooth enough gelato I have ever tasted. The consistency was right and the flavors definitely had a shared sense of sweetness. The hazelnut flavor tasted like melted ferrorrieoarochers (whoops i mean ferrero rochers). The mint chocolate was as usual... minty and the tiramisu was just straight up chocorgasmic ""what the fuck did they put in this it's too sweet but it's so good"" kind of deal. Overall... we really enjoyed it! I would definitely come back here again and probably buy one of their market pastas that they sell on the shelves!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Very fresh food served with a smile! We were around the area with my wife & parents, and noticed this new place at the corner of 6th Ave & 14th St.   For starters, we shared the Barbabietole salad, the Salumi & the Polenta to start.  All were very fresh and tasty.   We also shared the pappardelle, the risotto Maialona and Selvagio.  If you like homemade pasta, you must try their pappardelle, it will not disappoint you!  I am not a big fan of risotto, but I must admit that both ones we ordered were well above my expectations! Servings were well sized and fairly priced.  We were too full for dessert, but had espresso to finish. They told us it will take a couple of months for their liquor license, but in the mean time you can BYOB.  I went to a liquor store on 5th Ave and grabbed two bottles of wine and saved big.  :-) The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive.  Will definitely come back to try their other dishes!   Highly recommend this to everyone in the area!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love living in New York, however living here has made me expect exemplary service. This...was anything but that. Got here for a 7:15 reservation and we're not seated until 7:35. That was understandable and plenty of room at the bar to sit and wait. Once we were seated, our server came quickly to get our order. Appetizers took quite a long time, we had to ask for them twice. Once they arrived, we finished them quickly (the salt and pepper shrimp was actually a little cold---which means it WAS sitting out waiting to be taken up). At 8:55 we were YET TO SEE AN ENTREE, and actually another server came to our table to ask us ""if we wanted anything else,"" I almost lost my mind. We cancelled our entrees, and left. (Everything was comped, thank goodness). But we are never, ever coming back. The moral of the story, is that I understand that a restaurant can become busy...but it was the utter lack of acknowledgement that we had been waiting, that everyone just walked past while we stared at an empty table. Not okay.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I avoid places in times square like the plague but a good friend of mine decided we're going to celebrate his b-day here so it wasn't a question of choice. We were a group of 10. I'll start with the good: * A really good chocolate mousse cake And now the bad: * No menus. There's a menu on the wall but a friend of ours that is shortsighted couldn't see it so he had to go with whatever people were ordering. People who sat with their backs to the menu also had a hard time. Not cool. * Cold bread served with no butter or olive oil for dipping. In one average size basket for a table of 10, so at any time if someone at one side decides they want some bread, half the people on the other side can't get to it. * I did not taste the fried calamari that was ordered for an appetizer but everyone who did agreed that it tasted very bad. I don't know how you can ruin something that's deep fried in batter, but as I said, I didn't try it. * After our round of appetizers, the crew that was sent to collect the plates before they bring out the food seemed annoyed with us not handing them the plates. One of them even yelled at a friend of mine for not noticing they're collecting the plates and not removing his cutleries. * The cheese ravioli was WAY too salty, and there wasn't enough tomato sauce to cover it all (we got a plate of ravioli with sauce only in the middle) * When it seemed like some people are done eating, the same careless crew asked one or two people sitting on one side if they're done and then took away all the plates, some of which were still half full. Other people who were still eating were surprised to find out that the central plates were gone when they got their heads up from their plates. The food was already thrown away. No one even asked us if we wanted a doggy bag. * I mentioned this was a birthday - one person got up and went to the waiter discreetly and asked him for a chocolate cake with candles for the birthday boy. When the birthday boy tried to look at the dessert menu (they brought one for the entire table), the waiter informed him that someone already ordered dessert so he should not bother, and took his menu away. By this he both ruined the surprise and left 10 people with one dessert that is meant for 2-3. * We ended up ordering another cheesecake because the first dessert was not enough for 10. The lemon cheesecake had such a bad aftertaste of lemon that no one had more than one bite and half of it was thrown away. As if all this wasn't enough (at this stage we were discussing how we would rate the place and the average score was between 5 and 6), when we tried paying with 5 credit cards, the waiter said he can't do it, as there is a maximum of three and the computer won't let him. I insisted on seeing the manager, who told me that it's their policy not to take more than three cards per party. I proceeded to explain that I don't think five cards are excessive for a party of 10 and that I expect them to figure out how to do this because this is how we're going to pay. They miraculously found a way to charge five cards, while informing us, again, that this is a one time thing and it's against their policy. I couldn't care less. If they did not add the 18% tip automatically to the bill, I'd leave around 10% or less. I'm not even complaining about the outrageous prices because it's times square and I expected to pay a lot more than what the food is really worth. I will not be returning to this place anytime soon. There are a million good Italian places in the city and there's absolutely no reason to keep going to the bad ones.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We chose Glasserie for our annual Christmas dinner with friends and are so sad we did. Our experience was a disappointment from start to finish. The room was unwelcoming and poorly lit, the folding chairs were horribly uncomfortable, and the choice of music intrusive and blaring. The service was substandard in every way. Our server--a tall, intimidating woman with a French accent and a sour attitude--rolled her eyes when we asked for assistance ordering, then quickly disappeared. She couldn't explain the concept of the menu. Our drinks alone took 20 minutes to arrive, and when we inquired about our appetizers after waiting 40 minutes, our server snapped, ""I don't know where they are, I'm not in the kitchen, am I?"" When the food finally did show up, nearly every dish was overly seasoned. The Lamb & bulghur croquettes were overcooked and tough. The fried cauliflower was too salty. The grilled potatoes with Spanish cheese was the universal favorite, though we were so hungry at that point we could have eaten the flatware. Getting refills on our drinks was next to impossible and came with a price: a pissy look and a finger in the air that translated to ""You'll get your drinks when I'm good and ready.""

"SoCo calls itself ""Southern Fusion,"" and I'm sort of confused as to what that means, or rather, why it makes a point to call itself fusion. I think it means Southern, soul food, cajun and creole all at once, but don't all the restaurants that serve this food up north sort of count as fusion, then? They're all a mishmash of the regional cuisine. Came here for a late dinner, and boy, does this place look like a scene! Looks like a trendy spot. I felt a little underdressed. The service was slow. We arrived a little after 10pm, and our drinks probably took 15 minutes to arrive, and all we ordered were beers. It took a little longer to get our orders put in, too. We started with some appetizers, which included greens, corn bread, and mac & cheese. The greens and corn bread were unmemorable, but the mac & cheese was stellar: perfectly crusted on the top and gooey in the middle. It came piping hot from a mini-cast iron skillet. They do have a free cornbread Yelp deal here if you order an entree, which is nice. After polishing off our appetizers, we waited another long time to get our entrees. The service was just slowww. Our entrees, when they did arrive, were great. I had the fried chicken and waffles, which were incredibly good. My wife had the mussels, which she enjoyed. Others had the salmon burger, which they polished off neatly. Everyone was happy, except for the slow service. I don't quite know how this might be solved. More bartenders? More servers?

"Came here on a Saturday night after my boo-ancé and I showed up at Locanda for our 9:00 reservation that was on...Sunday.   We waited about 15 minutes and were seated at a cute table near the window (the whole restaurant is open air in the summer).  Our server was polite and helped us select a bottle of wine.  I wasn't particularly moved by the appetizer selection, but we ordered the grilled calamari, which was good.  Anyway, up until this point, I was all, ""3.5 solid stars.""  But then the spinach gnocchi arrived and my life changed.  For real, I would go half on a baby with the spinach gnocchi.  Nothing more needs to be said.

"Terrific pizza and Caesar salad! My roommate and I went here on a Thursday night at around 6pm and it was not very busy. We ordered drinks, a Caesar salad each, and we each got our own 12 inch pizza. The owner came to check on us frequently. The servers were very attentive. There was a wait between drinks and salad but it was well worth it. The salads were HUGE and only 8 dollars. My roommate and I could have split one. They were delicious. There was some time between our salads being cleared and our pizzas coming out but I like that. Our pizzas were delicious. My roommate got the Bianca ... A white cheese pizza. She enjoyed it. I got the Rucola and prosciutto pizza. White pizza topped with prosciutto and arugula. It was very good. A man leaving asked me what one it was because it looked so delicious. We had plenty to take home and warm up for lunches. We will for sure be returning.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Where to begin,   We walked over here on a Sunday afternoon after the storm. We were getting cabin fever over the local fare in our crown heights neighborhood and thought this would be worth a shot. We sat at the bar ordered the prix-fix brunch comes with brunch cocktail and coffee or tea. My steak and eggs, was pretty amazing , steak was cooked perf medium the black bean sauce really added to the flavor it came with two eggs (mine were cooked over medium) they were eggs and not much to say about eggs hard to mess up. Also with came with fries for 14$ I can't complain price was great bartender was so welcoming and friendly to our questions about the "" hood"" . Also ordered the veggie omelet. ,my gf really appreciated that they use real egg whites not egg beaters. Also veggies weren't typical veggie omelet they had asparagus,tomatoes,onions,and mushrooms. It came with home fries they were also really good.the bloody Mary's that came with both our brunches were really good, spicy nice poor on vodka and not too much Bloody Mary mix. Overall we can't wait to come again ! great food great service and most important great price ! We can't wait to come for their happy hour ! Nice addition to the neighborhood","[0.0, 1.0]"

My bf knows the owners and he is the only person that I would beg to head over there, bc that line did not get any shorter from the day they opened. The artichoke slice is generously topped with sauce, and it is eff'n fulfilling, but a little too thick on the dough if you ask me.

I highly recommend Perilla...as I plan on returning with a few friends for some really good food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here last weekend with a couple of friends for brunch. We had the option of sitting indoors or outdoors. We chose indoors because the outdoors seating didn't look to appealing for us (it could use a little bit of more decor). The indoors dining area is beautiful with an amazing view of the east river and the city. I definitely need to come back for dinner to see the amazing view at night. A few guests and myself were biased in regards to getting mimosas or sangritas, so our server Michelle gave us samples of the sangritas to ensure that we would be satisfied with our drink orders (that was extremely nice of her to do). She was amazing..very cordial and gave us great recommendations. We were just going to order guacamole, but she suggested to order the crispy arepas (which also have guac on them). Boy were we all super satisfied and happy that we listened to her. I had the green gazpacho soup which was delicious and tasted refreshing like she had described to us. Followed by the border burrito which was also a great choice. My friends all ordered churrasco and eggs..they all enjoyed it, but would have liked a little bit of more flavor for the steak. The ambience was great..good music..we felt relaxed.. and Boolent one of the managers passed by our table to ensure that we were having a good time. Which was very much appreciated, and definitely made us feel more welcome than what our server had already done. Overall great food, AMAZING staff, BEAUTIFUL view, and definitely a place to come back to.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We had a nice meal, big portions.  Tried the ceviche mixto, chicken al ajillo, bocadillos, spicy beef empanadas (my favorite) and shredded beef dish with rice and beans.  The food all tasted good but for some reason was brought out all at once (three of those items were appetizers.)   $14.95 for the ceviche mixto is highway robbery.   There were bits of calarami and a few small shrimp, maybe some pieces of fish, in a light ceviche-like sauce, nicely presented in a clam shell with some taro chips on the side.  Sadly, that warrants a 1-star deduction.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Also used a Groupon and were not made to feel like 'poor relations.'  Our lovely waitress even told us what most everyone orders, and accordingly , we both had the rib eye, which was a great steak - perfectly prepared, crispy charred on outside, medium rare inside as ordered, with generous veggies. House wine that came with it was just fine, along with nice desserts which, if there was any flaw there, it was that after the awesome entree they were somwhat of an afterthought (this from a 'dessert' person.  Only quibble is the menu price of the steak, which we of course didn't pay, seemed excessive at $30. I'd say it was a $22 or $24 steak, tops. Not in terms of quality, but it's not huge. All that said, point of groupons, from the biz's point of view, I believe, is to draw new customers. We never would have known of this place, but both said we would come back without a 'deal'. Great new find.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had dinner here for a friend's birthday.  Supper doesn't take reservations, but accommodated our party of 14 as long as we were seated by 7 and out by 9:30.  As the night approached, the party dwindled down to just 8.  The staff at Supper didn't give us a problem and seated us promptly upon arrival, slightly before 7, even though one member of the part was late.   The food was excellent (i had the Saturday Night Special Rabbit) and we all had a great time.   Unfortunately, after dinner, we all ordered another round of drinks and got the uneasy feeling that the staff wanted to move us out to turn over the table.  It was 8:30, well within the time we promised to leave by.  Although nothing was said directly to us, the service was noticeably more absent after that last round. All in all, I enjoyed the experience but wish it didn't feel like we were getting the cold shoulder at the end of the night.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What do I expect from a well-reviewed restaurant? Excellent food,  a comfortable experience,  and adept service. Now, the food is excellent.   Wonderful small dishes, great twists on old chestnuts,  and really quite well done, indeed. Fantastic wine choices make pairings for those not wishing to become inebriated are fairly easy to find here, for which I was grateful. But in NY that isn't such a great big deal, as so many places have excellent food and good wines at a reasonable cost.  I need the whole package to consider a place special and this place does not deliver. The seating isn't intimate. It's cramped. The stools are uncomfortable and the tables are tiny. Some inexperienced noobs say this is Parisian. Having been to Paris several times, I can tell you it isn't. Parisian dining, as varied as that in NYC, can be quite cozy, but never invasive. These tables were so close that if you spoke above a whisper your neighbors would be a party to your  entire conversation and you a party to theirs if the converse is true. Service? Beyond meh, it's awful. We weren't seated but pointed to a table..actually, I don't mind that much, but a little common sense should prevail. I was entertaining an out of town guest. We wanted to catch up and it was clear we were not impressed by the tight seating. So where did they point? In between two already crowded tables. Duh! It only went downhill from there. My wine was spilled on the table, our second plates were brought out before our first ones were finished. When this was pointed out, the young waitress said ""That's when they came up"". A smart server would have told the kitchen to slow up. But she didn't and there we were, seated at a 20 inch table, on two hard stools that was now cluttered with china,  tiny wine glasses, a tiny carafe, and tiny utensils. I felt like Gulliver in Lilliput and I am of average size!  Since tastes vary, I can't say anyone would find the small size of the dishes and utensils objectionable. But I do think the final effect is more of show than utility and comfort and thus defeats the purpose. The service was just  very rude and clumsy. What would like to see changed before I think of coming back or telling friends to try it is to have one or two less tables and the presence of a properly trained staff. Not servile but professional, confident and friendly.  A pro would have said ""Oops"" when they saw we were still on our first plates and returned the other food to the kitchen. Because any dining establishment, be it a small cafe, or a 5 star spot atop a skyscraper isn't about the owner and its staff. It's about the patrons and their experience, and sadly, ours was not very good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm still a big fan of Taqueria Diana but I think their service and setting definitely lack refinement vs. some of their peers. It's a competitive block with San Loco across the way and Ottos down the block. For late night, they get pretty overwhelmed; long waits are typical and they have run out of tortillas a few times, which is a hard thing to hear from a taco joint. Still, nothing beats the value of their nachos or the zest of their tacos - I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The Thursday special here attracted me inside: 1 1/4 lb lobster + beer for $27. I've been obsessed with seafood this summer so the bf and I had to check it out! We started with the special calamari appetizer that was fresh, not fried, and accompanied by a frisee salad. Next, he had the mussels and I had the lobster. The lobster special came with a choice of draft beer so I happily chose a Stella. Both entrees came with fresh crispy fries and a homemade lemony mayo that I'd kill to replicate. My lobster was a great size and fresh, but the best part of the dish was the melted herb butter that added an incredible flavor to everything I doused in it. I was pretty blown away by the meal from a seemingly simple cafe. I'd definitely recommend!","[1.0, 0.0]"

They have that sexy ambiance lighting that you may appreciate on a date.   Getting to the food...for appetizer we had the oxtail empanada...tell the truth and shame the devil that thing was good! Meal I had the lomo saltado...a bowl of rice, fries, short rib, and veggies.  I'll never understand the need for two starches..but it was still yummy. I wish there was a little more short rib in the mix. My friend had the fried chicken, which she wasn't thrilled by. It was just okay to her. Y'all know I'm particular about my chicken so I took her word for it. For dessert we shared our seasonal obsession of pumpkin pie... the pie was definitely a nice end to the meal. The only issue we had was the pomegranate on top...it was just out of place to me and I could see myself choking on a seed in an effort to devour the pie. Sorry I don't need fancy presentation on pie. Get the Peruvian sangria...it'll give to you wings. This place will definitely get another visit in the super near future.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The feeling of contentment emerges within me as I finish my last bite of this truly crafted masterpiece. The taste of this work of genius created a thrill upon my taste buds and emotions, as happiness took over me like a child trying candy for the first time. The ingredients were truly unified and the quality emulated excellence. The bread and meat were soft as clouds; both were flavorful and concise, practical and effective to each other. Made for each other, one cannot simply exist without the other, and if one did exist without the other, life would be unfair, unjustifiable; this masterpiece would be incomplete. The manner of which this burger was intended and the basis for which it was created, is perfect the way it is, as simple as that.

"Now, I'm no ramen expert. But I bet you aren't either. I bet you just like good food and you're looking for a nice meal in a nice restaurant with nice servers and nice atmosphere. Chuko fits the bill on all counts. My only previous experience with ramen was through a different restaurant on Vanderbilt which shall remain nameless--a more casual spot that shuttered rather quickly after its opening due to the mediocrity of its food. Based on that experience of overly salty strange-tasting brothy vegetables, I couldn't quite imagine what all the hubbub over ramen was about. Chuko convinced me halfway through our appetizers that it could deliver seriously delicious food in unexpected combinations. The spicy pickle special wowed me, as did the surprisingly complex and savory kale salad. My dining companions were bowled over by the brussel sprout dish, of which I only had a small though tasty bite. Then came the ramen. I opted for the vegetable broth with market veggies and soft-poached egg. Two sips in and I totally understood the hype of ramen. The broth was utterly satisfying and flavorful without at all being overly salty. The egg gave a lovely richness, and the veggies which included some kind of green sprouts, winter squash, and what appeared to be roasted parsnips provided texture and a pleasant subtle sweetness. I may know nothing about ramen, but I do know that I finished every last morsel of food placed in front of me. Two hours later I was craving for more and when I woke up this morning my first thought was about how much I enjoyed dinner last night. I can not wait to go back to Chuko. And I can not wait to see what kinds of wine and beer they serve after they get their liquor license.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hmm. So far, I am not impressed. Stopped by to grab a sandwich for take out. Woman behind the counter clearly wished me to hurry up and make a decision. I placed my order and she gave me the total: $8.15. I wanted to give her exactly that amount but she would not take my five pennies to make up the five cents in 15 cents. ""Oh, no pennies. He doesn't like pennies."" (Who is ""he""? Am I supposed to know?) And who doesn't accept pennies? Aren't pennies money? So you'll take my dime but not my pennies? Wtf? I gave her a quarter instead, and of course I got back a dime. Just what I need: more change. She told me to sit outside and that my sandwich would be brought to me when ready. Fine, as there were no seats inside anyway. Sat outside on the bench. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. 15 minutes go by, and I""m wondering seriously how long it takes to make a bloody sandwich. So I go inside to ask about it. Turns out my sandwich has been sitting on the counter this whole time. The girl (a different one now) behind the counter says, ""Oh, is this yours?""   What, do employees not talk to one another in this place? I mean, I could sit all day on the bench outside and watch the yuppie families pile their DKNY-sporting toddlers into their luxury SUVs, but I think I ordered a sandwich because I'm hungry! The sandwich, as it turned out, was really good. Lovely ciabatta bread, fresh ingredients (I ordered the marinated sandwich), and all-in-all delightful.

Nothing like a delicious dinner after 11pm, without having to eat typical bar fare. Be sure to ask the waitresses for the food specials, as there are some hidden treats that shouldn't be missed. Love the atmosphere and the staff, and the crowd always seems to be having a good time. Will keep going back until I drink all the bourbon!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So apparently this will be a new tradition for any trip to NYC I ever take... Luckily, the falafel sandwich is good. I was concerned because all of my past experiences with falafel have been dry. Yuck. Mamoun's is not - it's moist and crispy and tasty. However I think I prefer the shawarma and the yogurty sauce. Yes, the hot sauce is hot... A few drops per level of your sandwich should suffice. One of the better cheap eats overall on my trip so far.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Halal carts have taken over NYC.  What happened to all the hot dog vendors?  Are they now halal vendors?   Some of the other halal carts have spits and they carve the meat off for you.  This famous 53rd & 6th cart doesn't have that and the price seems to be $1 more than other carts.  It's still a good value though, because you get plenty of food.  The line for the 53rd & 6th cart seemed to be the longest and they even have a website (and four or five employees manning the cart).  It's funny to see people parked in their cars right by the cart, digging in to those aluminum take out containers they use.   The menu is simple: rice, meat & salad, $6; pita, meat & salad $5; sandwich, $4.  They have chicken and lamb/beef.  Customize with white sauce, BBQ sauce and/or hot sauce.   * Meat:  I liked the chicken better than the lamb and beef.  The lamb and beef are chopped up too finely to the point that they seem like ground meat.   * Rice vs. Pita:  The long grain rice is decent but the fresh, soft pita is better.  That's why I recommend the pita, meat & salad option (or the sandwich) over the rice, meat & salad option. However, if you're hungry, choose the rice.  Special tip:  If you like their pita, you can buy the same brand, Kontos, at SF Safeway stores (or maybe outside of SF too - I don't know). * Salad: The salad isn't really salad - it's just chopped iceberg lettuce but it adds a nice crunch to the plate of food.   * Sauces: The white sauce is thicker than I'd like and also a bit bland (though it is tangy).  The hot sauce is much better as it packs a punch.  Mix it with the white yogurt like sauce to liven things up.   They keep the sauces on the side in squeeze bottles, so you can add more if you want (they do tuck in white sauce and hot sauce in your bag).  Regulars ask for extra sauce, extra meat, etc.  I'm not sure how they price that.  For some reason this type of food really hits the spot late at night.   Cash only.  Open from 7:30 PM - 4 AM.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The only grilled cheese/coffee/beer place I am aware of. Grilled Cheese: Points for some inventive sandwich combos, but in my case, all I'm really looking for out of grilled cheese is buttery goodness and American Cheese. So while I respect it, this aspect of the Queens Kickshaw is not for me. Coffee: I will pretty much drink any swill put in front of me as long as it has caffeine in it. So again, they seem to be good at what they do, but I'm not the best judge. Beer: Great beer menu, a huge selection of bottled beers, about 4 or 5 beers on tap. The crowd: Not for me. I, and many others, overuse the classification Hipster for things we think are trying too hard to be cool. I don't want to say that this is a Hipster place. I really don't want to. But, ultimately that seems like the crowd that hangs here. So there, it's a grilled cheese/coffee/beer/hipster joint.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I contemplated eating the fries and rice together but WOW!! What a delicious combo they made out of it! The Beef Short Ribs were so tender, they felt like they were melting in my mouth! Really! The next day, I gave the leftovers to my husband and he thought he was eating short rib flavored tofu because it was THAT juicy and tender!!

"I'm giving Marlow and Sons 5 stars because...isn't it obvious? The food and atmosphere is maybe the best around. My comment is related to the morning coffee scene though. I've lived directly across the street for the last 5 years and have witnessed many changes to not only the neighborhood but the coffee too. First of all, as much as I love this place, why is the daytime service so bad? Just because you're behind the machine doesn't mean you can't at least say hello or acknowledge the presence of the customer.  This doesn't speak for everybody, there are some really great people there too. Second with all the new options in our own amazing city, even borough, why does such a establishment with local and sustainable focus still get their coffee shipped out from the west coast? Maybe the FedEx truck gives it that extra special flavor? One of the commenters below even proclaimed it's like SF in Brooklyn. As a customer living in Brooklyn and not a SF tourist, that's not a positive win for me. Will I keep getting my morning coffee here? Given it's close proximity to my studio, mostly yes. But I should probably keep my visits for the meals and get some morning exercise and walk a little farther down the road if for nothing else, supporting my local community while getting my cup of joe. The food at Marlow & Sons is amazing. Local, creative and simple all at the same time. No guilty pleasure there!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went to Distilled for a private event, so there was a wide range of selections. Luckily I got to try quite a few items on the menu: Popcorn is delicious (and on the house). They spice it up with cumin, garlic, and brewer's yeast. Some standouts: I'm not crazy about wings but these were SO GOOD. They're crispy on the outside The watermelon gets upgraded with basil and pickled mustard seed - the flavors go really well together and is probably one of the healthier items on the menu (i.e. not fried...) The Country Fried Duck & Waffles...oh. my. god. And with the syrup. And whipped honey butter. My two cents: you may want to split it. I don't think eating that much duck would sit well, but oh does it taste good. So good that you don't care about how many calories you're eating. Because it's so good. The Glazed Pork Ribs and so tender and fall off the bone. That's another entree I could just eat forever. For the desserts we had a deconstructed s'more which was very good (with ice cream) as well as a deconstructed warm apple crumble pie. The drinks: the Mead is REALLY GOOD.

"I thought this was pretty overrated. First of all, we had a 9:15 reservation (on a Wednesday, no less), and didn't get seated until just after 10pm. And while the hostess was apologetic, I thought it would have been a much nicer touch if she'd actually offered us a glass of wine on the house for our inconvenience, which I think is something most restaurants tend to do. It would have been especially appreciated it in this case, considering we racked up quite a nice bill in the Rose Bar while we waited, where cocktails are $20 a pop. Don't get the fig and ricotta crostini. They had sort of a medicinal aftertaste which we couldn't totally identify. The rest of the food was good enough, but my bucatini al amatriciana was only okay compared to the insane, go-blind-from-deliciousness version at Lupa (where you also get more of it). Our water glasses remained empty for much of the evening, which is a personal peeve of mine. As typically devoted Danny Meyer fans, we were disappointed.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is what I love about the city - finding that hidden neighborhood gem, dive bar, or in this case, an awesome food cart. Thanks to yelp, I have another great lunch option to add to the list. The food here is delicious and tastes homemade. It's a no frills cart - not much signage or decor - just a banner displaying the menu items, and a small chart showing the variety of side items available. Each order comes with 2 sides and an option for a small or large portion. Unless you're extremely hungry and we all have those days, the small portion is more than enough for a filling lunch. I got there a bit late around 1:30/2 and many of the menu items/sides were sold out already - so get there early! I got a small stewed chicken with rice and collard greens - so good and only $6! The chicken was flavorful and tender - fell off the bone. The collard greens were really good too - some of the best I've had. The rice and peas = rice and beans - so if you don't like beans don't make the mistake of thinking the peas are the green veg type like myself lol The wait can be a bit long if you're in a lunch rush but if you have an extra few minutes - it's definitely worth the wait!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Though I was there with several friends, I'd say this would be a brilliant place for a date night as well, the dim lighting and rustic setting wonderful for an intimate dinner. We did have a reservation, so I'm not entirely sure how feasible it would be to just walk in (I went on a Saturday night, so it was pretty busy), but I'd suggest calling ahead anyway.

"Unfortunately, this joint is 0 for 2 with me.  Style-over-substance, bigtime. Went there for brunch the first time last month and dinner yesterday.   BRUNCH - I was horrified to be denied my request for a bloody Mary because it was before noon!  Been in this neighborhood almost 10 years, and this was a first.  I didn't kick up too much of a fuss though, our waiter was a nice enough guy and service was prompt and courteous.  They brought out the bacon smoked almonds they make there as amuse-gueule.  The bacon flavor can't save this thing: almonds are essentially binded together in cold congealed bacon fat and the nuts themselves are soaked through and mushy.  If there was any bit of crunch left in them at all, these things would be ten times better.  Ordered the short rib hash - which was a disaster.  Gristly and flavorless.  Did not think it possible to make short ribs taste bland, but somehow they managed.  There is at least a dozen places in the hood I'd sooner go to for brunch, top choices are  Char 4, Frankie's, Luluc, Pit Stop, Patois.  Even the overrated (but well priced!) Alma is a better bet.  Brunch was a D- DINNER:  Atmosphere had that nouveau-Brooklyn reverse b&t vibe, but was ok, I'm getting used to that (*snif*).  Service was once again very good, very friendly and prompt.  They have a good front-room staff for sure, would be shocked if the same person was responsible for hiring the kitchen staff, however.  Was there with 5 other friends and was able to taste and observe other people's food, which led me to conclude that the problem in that kitchen isn't the inability to put out decent food (not great, decent) but to do it consistently.  Popovers were good!  Then they came out with those godforsaken mushy almonds.  I ate 'em anyway, I was starving.  Cheese plate rocked.  Some good choices there.   Wifey had the brook trout (which they assured me was wild and not farmed, major bonus) and it was pretty tasty, unusual choice with cabbage side and the grain-mustard but somehow it worked pretty well.  Then came my dish.  the special (Tuesday) leg of lamb.  This is when I lost it.  I was given a plate of thinly sliced gray and dried-out (i mean DRY) pieces of top cut lamb.  Not one drop of juice was left in there, and the thing had been garlic-poked by an insane person.  You just do not serve the outside cut, this is 101, people.  And the side was this grilled cauliflower in a very sour balsamic reduction that they tried to save by adding a lot of sugar and salt, (yurk).  I returned it, didn't order anything else.  That being said, I distinctively saw some pink in the lamb that my buddy had on his plate, which leads me to believe that I got the runt of the litter and that his may have been somewhat more palatable. Dinner gets a C- Next review I write (for somewhere else) will be a good one, promise!  I'm not a bitter, cynical foodie by any stretch, but I do think over-hyped joints need to be put in their place because that's how sheep-herd mentality ruins neighborhoods. peace.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food should be rated as 4 stars by itself, but when you consider the price (nothing over $10), this place is definitely a 5'er. Came here on a Friday night around 7:45-8 and only had to wait about 7 minutes for a table to open up.  I would suggest trying to get here before 8 as the line gets long when people are attempting to sneak in before the 9 PM cutoff. We had the Hungarian Pie, fried potato and cheese Pierogies, and the Polish platter with a side of pickled beets.  I though the Hungarian pie was amazing and the perfect filling dish for a crisp fall evening.  The filling of stewed meat (goulash?) was delicious and well worth the $9.00.  The Polish platter's stuffed cabbage and sauerkraut were the real surprises as we were both expecting something meatless and bland.  In fact, these two were flavorful and really enjoyable. Everything seemed to be made by hand in the back kitchen and the service was pleasant and efficient.  I would go back here in a second for lunch or dinner.

Although the long wait, the food came out really quick. We even got our burgers before our drinks. Service was good, very attentive.

"My review is biased because I didn't try the food but I did have plenty of time to stand in line and watch everyone eat their meals. I left after waiting in line for breakfast for 15 minutes...This was after standing in line outside for 15 minutes. We squeezed our way into the door to find another line to wait in. After 10 minutes inside watching people leisurely eat - I realized I just could not subject myself to this type of dining experience. I would never feel comfortable eating my breakfast with hungry people standing over me next to my table wishing I would hurry up. The decor further realized the nightmare that was this place. It looks like someone broke into the back room at TJ Max after Xmas and looted everything that was going to be thrown away to finish the macabre haphazard 'interior design' at Tom's. Just because it's ugly doesn't make it 'cute', it makes it 'ugly'. This is what it must feel like to be a chicken at a chicken farm. Except this place seemed a little more inhumane.

No matter what you order, EVERYTHING IS RIGHT. I usually order 4-5 dishes and share tapas style with my company. A great way to be able to try many different things. Dishes I reccommend: house made ricotta, line caught tuna sashimi, housemade ricotta ravioli, shaved raw fluke. My #1 restaurant in all of NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm so glad I found out about a gem like this near work.  If you work in FiDi and need a crepe to hold you over until 5PM strikes, this is definitely worth making it outside to get.  Even after walking in the rain to bring this crepe back, I thought it would've been soggy by the time I got back to the office, but it was still crispy!! I got the Nutella & Bailey's crepe which did not fail to satisfy my craving for sweets.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great ambiance, nice space. Friday night, they were able to accomodate my party of 8 very quickly. Their sangria is delicious. Chicken Pio is okay, I was expecting a little more. Papa Rellena was an interesting appetizer dish. Deep fried mash potato stuffed with meat sauce. Lomo Saltado was very good. Flavorful. Camarones Cuzcos tastes amazing. The sauce is great with the rice and shrimp. Mero Con Salsa de Porto, my favorite dish. Amazing Chilean sea bass with a nice serving of vegetables. Overall, great experience. Waiters were all very nice and accommodating. Food is great. Amazing ambiance. Would definitely return.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is another place you can resort to instead of wasting the time equivalent of a screening of the Titanic waiting in line at Grimaldi's.

I been to Mominette a while ago when it first opened but this weekend I found myself back at the same restaurant looks very different I so happened to try the salmon tartare I fell in love with it. If I was ask if there was any place that is to have  something to eat I would without a doubt recommend this restaurant. Indeed there must be a new chef because the food was done to perfection.  Great job and well done Chef.   It is also have a romantic atmosphere with a group of friendly staff in which their service can be a little better.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"We were seated in the smallest of spaces on a super long table that separated the room. That's pretty much the worst of the best. The pork belly sticky buns taste the way I want heaven to feel.

"Tasty food. Decent prices. Sketchy health code. Went 6/20/14 and they had ""grade pending"" as their health code grade. Hmm... But I was hungry and didn't want to look for another Turkish restaurant. Casual place. Food is out, buffet style, and ready to serve. Mixed chicken and lamb gyro platter was good. A lot of food for 9.95 and served w veggies (tomato, lettuce, red cabbage, onions), white or brown rice but when it came out it looked and felt more like bulgar wheat (?). Good flavor and not greasy. The hummus was ok. I felt like a citrus aspect was missing - either lemon or use a more citrusy olive oil.  The pita bread was amazing! I would go there just for that. Fresh and light. Although I enjoyed my food, I felt like I would have enjoyed it more had they received an ""A"" for their health inspection.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I love that everything feels authentic. And you know what, they do one freaking mean steak frites! The fries are not greasy and perfectly crisp. The sauce on the steak was perfect. And the cook and temperature of my steak was perfect and consistent. I just have a preference that I like to cut my own steak, and they pre-cut the steak, but that's just a me thing.

"Oh Black Label Burger! Oh Bone Marrow! I shall be returning to have a taste of you both again... People say the burger is overrated.

Yes, $26 for a burger is too much, but then again you're not gonna have this every day, so what the hell... The place itself has a nice ambiance. But I think it's a bit overrated, too expensive, service isn't the best (as other reviewers were saying), it's annoying how need to reserve a table 3 weeks in advance...

We brought some wine in and drank a bottle (there is a $5 corkage fee, as someone else said) and sampled plenty of their wares. The goat cheese crostinis are great, and the basil paninis was out of control good. The low point was the cupcakes, which were only so-so, but the brownie was great -- moist, dense, and not too cloyingly sweet. The staff was friendly (if a little sluggish) and overall we were super impressed with the food. Great atmosphere, great food!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Review is only for industry night - Definitely one of the best deals in NYC for upscale pasta right now. On Monday nights after 9PM, all bottles of lambrusco are $28 and all the pastas with the exception of the lasagna and the risotto are $10. Faves include: Garganelli - lots of truffle flavor, rich and decadent Torcia - squid ink pasta is very flavorful and the toasted breadcrumbs are a nice variation in texture Tortellini panna - incredibly rich but only in the best ways. if you love liver and cream (and who doesn't?), this is amazing Didn't love the Spallina and another pasta that was in a spinach sauce that seems to have been taken of the menu. We also got the seafood salad, which is not a special during Industry Night, but is a fantastic order. It's very acidic and the seafood is cooked perfectly. It's a nice break from carbs and cream.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First of all, I love dumplings! I was walking in the area when I thought I should definitely give this place a go, since I heard it was good. and, to tell you the truth, after I managed to squeeze in to that tiny (yet very sweet!) place I was quite pleased. We had a couple of sesame pancakes with beef, and a dish of pan fried pork and chives dumplings to share. it was brilliant, very very tasty, and also very cheap. All in all good  value for money and really really TASTY! Love it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I love this place. The sandwiches are terrific (esp. the pork/broccoli rabe, but also the eggplant, and the steak), the staff is friendly, and there's a cute back patio. Pricey, but the neighborhood is getting pricier in general (which is another story), so that's not unexpected. It's kid friendly - there's a little play area in the back and, as I discovered this morning, they're trying out a weekday morning sing-a-long for kids (with a super talented and adorable singer/guitar player). I probably won't bring my laptop here to work, because the seating is a little limited, but there's a few nice bar stools in the window, and it's a great place to stop in and pick up a sandwich on the way home. I do wish there were a few more prepared food options - I assume they're rolling them out gradually as they find their footing - but the ones they do have are solid. Overall, great place, and I hope it does well.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I must say I really do like this place....    I get delivery from here quite often.   -Steady, simple italian food w/ fresh ingredients -Portions are a nice, medium size (portioned correctly so we don't get too fat) -Fresh simple recipes...   Nice vegetable sides... with say their Lemon Chicken ... it comes with spinach but they will gladly substitute broccoli...also simply cooked with fresh garlic... which I like -They also make their own fresh Focaccia .... Not amazing bread but who doesn't appreciate freshly made bread?   -Prices are reasonable .... for example Lemon Chicken w/Spinach $11.95 w/ fresh bread.     -Plus it's a a place I have confidence ordering from,    which says a lot in the constant russian roulette NYers play with their stomachs.   I know I have ordered food from them for over 10 yrs and I have never gotten ill.     That ranks highly in my book. -Owners seem to be very nice people. -Last but not least....  I'm not a big soda drinker but I do like that I can get a nice little Chinotto soda...   reminds me of my childhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"

After we were seated, it took a long time for someone to come take our order. Once we made our order, it took about 28 min to get our orders. I knew this because there was 28 min left in the 1st half of the World Cup match. We ordered Buffalo Tater Tots and Pizza ToTs. We ended up getting Buffalo Tots and Chili Tots. I didn't care about the mistake at that point because we were starving. Unfortunately the tots were served cold, cold, and cold.

"Recently, I was invited to dinner at Minetta Tavern by a certain gentleman, who I've bumped into a few times around the city. We'll call him Mr. Niceguy. You know the type; he's ambiguously ""older"", absurdly short, has chronic halitosis (and is a bit of close-talker to boot, which makes him nearly impossible to bear), but he is also the absolute nicest foodie on the planet. Generous to a fault, always ready with a compliment or a clever quip about the latest cocktail craze, Mr. Niceguy is just that, a nice guy...not my next love affair. But, a week ago, when Mr. Niceguy asked me out to dinner at Minetta Tavern, I couldn't say no. I like to think of myself as a nice girl, and hey, Bruni just gave 3 starts to Keith McNally's most recent foray into trendy comfort food. Mr. Niceguy doesn't drink red wine, and so our meal began when we were forced to order our vino by the glass, something akin to heresy for the sommelier on the floor that night.  The minute I informed said sommelier we'd be ordering individually, ""We have very different tastes...you understand,"" it was clear that he didn't.  I literally watched the enthusiasm drip out of his smile like a slow leak in a flat tire, and this was only the beginning of the evening. We decided to skip the much-lauded Black Label Burger and instead each had a Tavern Steak (a New York strip, served bloody, as requested), potatoes Anna (buttery and delicious) and two glasses of wine (me, a California Zin; he, an Austrian Riesling...with steak!). That's when I knew that, even if he weren't so goddamn nice, it could never work. White wine with steak is a deal-breaker for me, and Rieslings, well let's just say I didn't like grape juice as a kid, and I still don't. All in all, Minetta Tavern reminded me of a poor man's Waverly Inn; the food was solid, the crowd was über trendy, the décor was Old New York revived, the atmosphere was brilliantly alive, but the bill was a hell of a lot cheaper. I told Mr. Niceguy, and he agreed. He suggested I blog about it, (which I did, at kimberlybelle.com/2009/0…) I thanked him for dinner and told him I'd best head straight home to start writing. He responded, ""Nice."" -Kimberly Belle kimberlybelle.com dinnerbelleny.com","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is transported from my Smorgasburg review, but this is THE place to go there. Mighty Quinn's has the longest line of the place and it could easily take 15 minutes. It's a big smoker with two men slicing large hunks of brisket and lamb. They offer a lot of meat for even their small sandwich, a great deal at $5. After the meat is packed on a brioche bun, the brisket is served with a BBQ sauce and pickled onions, while the lamb comes with a white sauce and chiles. The brisket is incredibly tender, but I've had great brisket. Shredded lamb this good though? Never before. It really was packed with a flavor and the burnt bits added so much smokiness and texture. The last time I went, they were sold out by 4:00. Be early and the wait is worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You bet we didn't pay full price , but to even have to  ask for a 10% compensation after watching the rat prance around all during our very mediocre and over-priced dinner....

"Came here for my sister's birthday last week and had a pretty good time.  First the good.  Service was great, decor is cute, food is decent.  The only thing is, for a place that specializes in fish, none of us were blown away by the fish at all. Started with two types of chowder, seafood and crab, and both were excellent.  Both were tasty enough that we were licking the last drops from the bowl.  We also started with the appetizer of the sauteed mushrooms (quite good), and the fried oysters (juicy, flavorful and delicious). Then our main entrees came out..the mustard crusted salmon, the cioppino, the cod, and then the special of the day, which I can't remember.  All the fish items were pretty mediocre..generally fresh I guess?  But rather bland and not in the good sort of, ""this fish is so fresh that it doesn't need any accompaniment"" lack of flavor.  Everything just was sort of eh.   Dessert was also a little mixed.  Both fruit tarts, a cherry and a mixed fruit, were pretty mediocre.  The flourless chocolate cake, in contrast to what another reviewer said, my whole family found to be really delicious.  It was rich, chocolately and dense, just the way I like my flourless chocolate cake to be.   So, generally alright food (though somewhat disappointing fish for a seafood restaurant), but ultimately, for a place that's so far away from any subway station, I'm not going to be rushing back here anytime.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"WHAT. A. DISAPPOINTMENT. We were a party of 4, all looking forward to the food here.  We get there around 7pm on a Saturday night and decided to tough out the ""walk in"" since they told us on the phone that ""they didn't take reservations"".  We get there and told that it's about 30~45 minutes wait. We expected that so we waited on the uncomfortable stools they provide along the walls behind the bar counter. After 50 minutes of waiting, we're told that it's going to be ANOTHER 30~45 minutes of waiting. WHY? The table we were suppose to get kept ordering additional foods (which, at any yakitori place, is normal).  To make things worse, groups of 4s coming in AFTER us were sitting down before us.  We were the ONLY group waiting for a table the entire time, while everyone else was getting seated. Who knows, maybe they made reservations 2 days beforehand, like they suggest on their website.  The worse part about this was that the hostess was a TOTAL DITZ. She was probably the whole reason why the entire night was a disaster because she couldn't do her job right. When we had asked why we had to wait so long, she giggled and told us that the customers were making additional orders. No apologies, nothing. In the end, we split into two groups of 2 and ate in this miserable little restaurant.  I'm not sure if it was because we were a mixed crowd of Americans and Japanese, that the hostess thought she could giggle her way out of the scenario, but I made it very clear in my Japanese that I was NOT happy with the service. Thinking back, I should've asked to see the manager, complained and walked out, and not spend my hard earned money here. Do yourself a favor, and go somewhere else, like Tori Shin; although more expensive, they accept reservations. I am NEVER going back to this restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Um, nom?  Last time I wrote a review on an indian restaurant it was in a desperate attempt to keep their doors open, but this place is packed usually! The food is really, really good.  Actually, gonna change the 4 to 5 stars because it is my new indian restaurant.  Not sure if it is actually culturally legit, (although I did spend a couple of months in india) because it tastes slightly different (indian food on steroids?).  Maybe saltier, and heavier.  Papaddum tasted totally different than I've ever had, but in a super delicious, ridiculously unhealthy way. Luckily, I am not on a diet, (yet -- although I HAVE just found this place so maybe mid-summer), but the palak paneer was oozing flavor (aka oil), and the chicken tikka was incredibly rich. Everything is on point.  I love raita and they make theirs with veggies and perfectly seasoned.  Naan is steaming and soft and delicious!  The samosas were ok.  Also portions are huge; the lunch is an unbelievable deal because you get like 5 things and dipping sauces for 10 dollars!  Mouth watering.  Must go now.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Been this restaurant for years. Always one of the fun places to dine out with friends because of the atomosphere and the food.   I always come here at least once or twice a month. I decided to write the review today sadly because I couldnt't help noticing that the tasting has changed in a bad way, they started serving dishes that are too spicy, too salty, and too strong since my dining there in Autumn.   I won't come back for a while untill they fix this issue.  I even assumed the chef lost his palette or they are not even tasting. I had a Coconut Soup as a starter, and this was too salty and I couldn't finish it. After the soup, my entree, Panang Curry Dish came which came out too strong with peanut sauce and salt. I couldn't have the second bite.  This was really bad. After discussing with a friend, we decided to inform our waiter that we can't finish it because the sauce was too strong and salty.   It was nice of him that he took off from the bill, but all I ask is to fix this issue so that I feel safe to come back and order. I know Thai food, but what Room Service is serviing isn't Thai.  Sorry.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I ate here the other night for a friends b-day. The other reviewers were spot on when they said the ambiance / atmosphere was awesome. We came late on a Saturday night, and were able to sit outside on the patio, after having waiting inside at the bar for a table. The food was good, but nothing note worthy. Between our table, we covered the entire entrée menu (duck, pork chop, steak). None of us were ""wowed"" by the food, but weren't necessarily let down. The one plus is that for a West Village restaurant, it's not terribly expensive. Entree's average about $25, with cocktails being ~$14 and decent bottles of wine going for ~$60. I will definitely come back here, mostly for the ambiance. Great place to take people from out of town, and/or for a date.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Really incredibly hard to get a table here. Tried calling in to make a reservation but they were booked til 10 but was told there might be a free table for walk ins if we got there early. Got there 30 min before they opened at 5:30 and was second in line. When they opened, only us and the party ahead of us got in. Sucks for the couple behind us that was waiting! Having gone through all that I had high hopes for the food but unfortunately it came up a little short. Had the Gyoza and the Hakata Tonton Hot Pot which seemed like the two more popular items. The Gyoza was really good and would def eat that again. Didn't really taste the pig's feet at all. But the hot pot wasn't anything special in my opinion and wouldn't crave it again.Thought it had too much vegetables and not enough meat. Broth didn't really blow me away either. For dessert, we had the Soba Creme Brulee. That was delicious! 3 stars is probably a little low but when it's so hard to get a table and everyone else is giving the place 4+ stars, you have to have very high standards. And it's not a good sign either when the appetizer and dessert are the highlights of your meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here recently for a friend's birthday. I've heard friends of mine -- particularly real bon vivant types -- rave about Brooklyn Star, and I wondered why I'd never been. Once we were seated, I realized why not -- I don't eat meat, and meat is, like, kind of the point of this place. Even the mac & cheese is cooked with bacon by default (but you can order it without bacon, no problem). There's a kale salad in there too (good if you like raisins) and a garden salad. Anyway: Meat. Couple friends of mine who felt adventurous were really stoked on the marrow. Couple friends who were feeling ambitious ordered the chicken fried steak, which is gigantic -- surprisingly, one of the less pricey main entrees on the menu. Comes with mashed potatoes and onions, and it must've been like a foot in diameter on the plate. Very impressive. I had two friends who split a pork chop (comes with onion rings stacked on top, very visually appealing) and got by just fine (add a few slices of jalapeno corn bread -- very fresh, right out of the oven). Oh, yeah, about the mac & cheese -- it feels really decadent, but that orange-brown crust of cheese around the edges is so worth it. Overall, the menu's a bit pricey, but you can probably get away with splitting an entree with someone else and still be full, if you're not a complete glutton. However, complete gluttons are in a pretty good place here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came on a cold and rainy day at 11.30am and made it into the first seating when the restaurant opened at 12 on the dot. The chicken-based broth is a bit different, lighter than the standard pork and tonkotsu soups found at most ramen places, and it's 100% delicious. I ordered it with miso, which thickens the soup and adds some small chunks of pork as well. Noodles are chewy and curly, perfectly cooked by the dedicated noodle chef. The chicken char sui was a bit dry (all white meat), though the pork version was succulent and very fatty. I tried both the hard-boiled egg, which was still a little bit soft in the middle, and the poached egg, which was plain and completely runny, but enriched the soup even more. One of the best ramens in NYC for sure.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Love of the ingredient is evident in everything Scarpetta has put on our 8 person table. Starting from the freshly-baked, still warm and crusty breads that were used to frenziedly mop up the delicious starter of olive oil and eggplant tapenade, it was clear were were in for a treat. Scallop appetizer was contained and rather simple, but every single bit on the plate, from the ocean-tasting scallops to the roasted garlic was delicious. The famous polenta and truffled mushrooms stole the show however. Buttery and decadent, the first taste created a personal Ratatouille moment as I have gotten that warm and fuzzy ""I don't know when was the last time I enjoyed anything that much"" feeling. Pastas- Ravioli with shrimp in a saffron broth (more like saffron water) was good, very flavorful but nothing ethereal. The hyped up spaghetti with tomato sauce tasted a bit too..hyped up. It was good, no doubt about it, but I've had the same in most trattorias in Rome and Tuscany for $12 not $24. The rest of the pastas however shined through their hefty price tags. Black tagliolini with seafood was superb. Elastic, perfectly made and cooked pasta with carefully selected velvetty uni, plump mussels, briny clams and translucent shrimp. Bowtie special pasta with sweetbreads was great as was tagliatelle with spring vegetables. Savory, perfectly balanced and deceptively simple. Wines by the glass were excellent, both reds and whites. Deserts- dark chocolate cake was good but nothing special, I've had much better. Olive oil cake was more interesting and the ice cream and tangerines that came with it complemented it perfectly. Although next time for desert, I'd probably just order another pasta. Service was attentive, non-intrusive and efficient.","[1.0, 0.0]"

If this is your first burger in a while (which if you gave this one more than 3 stars, it is) just know this: burgers are not supposed to be dry and flavorless. Ground beef, which I assume at this price point is factory farmed (that's another issue) with this reputation should be better. There should be salt, pepper and eggs in your patty. This is cheap, sure. The atmosphere is fine. But by God, this is the most overrated yawn in a bun you'll have in this city.

"We tried Marlow and Sons last night with our daughter, who lives in Brooklyn.  We took the subway there from midtown Manhattan, and it took about 40 minutes, plus a 5 minute walk (in the rain, unfortunately).  (Cab ride back was $20). It was Sunday night at 7 and we waited about 40 minutes for a table.  Fortunately we were were able to sit at the bar while we waited.  Later there were people waiting outside (it stopped raining but was cold).  This seems to be an accepted part of the experience.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected.  Because they pack the tables close together, I'm guessing they can seat about 40 people (40 seems to be the theme number of this review).  Most of the clientele seemed to be 30-somethings, a few with young children in tow.  Noise level was high and the seating, on low wooden stools, fairly uncomfortable.  But the good news is that the staff is extremely nice and the food is definitely good.  We had 3 different starters, entrees and desserts.  The clearest big hit at our table was the german chocolate cake with pecan ice cream.  We liked it much better than the chocolate caramel tart, which was too dense and dark for us.  The brick chicken was excellent but it was fairly simple, just well prepared.  There was a special of spaetzle with rabbit that had some interesting flavors.  The starter of broccoli rape with sausage and white beans, topped with a fried egg, mixed flavors creatively and represents what I was expecting from this place.

"This place is the best!  My boyfriend and I were regulars at Life Cafe, in its former incarnation, for about three years.  We've had dinner at 983 four times in the last couple weeks since reopening, and we are altogether very, very impressed.  Higher quality food at the SAME PRICE - what's not to like?   The decor is different but most of the staff are the same - as far as I can tell, they brought everybody back, plus a few new hires.  One of the two new owners was actually the manager at Life, a very sweet guy whom the employees obviously adore.  Everyone who works there seems extremely happy with the change-over.   Did I mention that the food is much, much better?  The old Life was the kind of place you went to for the atmosphere, not so much the meal.  Now they offer better quality, healthier ingredients - farm-fresh greens and grass-fed beef - and the preparations are more subtle, too.  Their new vegetarian burrito is as good as it gets.  And if you're anything like me, the broccoli-cauliflower dish will actually make you want to eat your vegetables.

"I should preface this with saying that I usually don't enjoy Yelp. For many reasons, I've avoided the prospect of rating any of the places I've been to simply because most weren't out of this world or, if the place was that good, why ruin it with overcrowding? However, since the Black Crescent opened, I've had a change of heart, and, along with many other places I will soon review, want to share this place with the rest of New York. The man behind the bar I've noticed from both Booker & Dax and The Beagle, though I believe he's here full time now. Among the myriad bars I've patronized and continue to frequent in the city, this man has always kept my palate on the run, trying to catch up to his craft. Along with having a robust and healthy understanding of the classics, Reynolds can also whip up many variations of these cocktail staples, including his own spins on such favorites as the Old Fashioned (give the five spice Old Fashioned a try), Negroni, etc. So far, my favorites on the menu are the Hempen Halter, The Dinglehopper (made with ginger and cantaloupe granita), and the Elysian Fields. As for food, the chef has whipped up a menu to complement both the cocktails and the insane wine list that you can check out on the other side of the bar. (Did I mention that there was an extensive and somewhat improbable wine selection along with beer parings if you're into neither wine or cocktails at this place? Talk to Carlos). If you're not into smoked pastrami salmon (if you're not, however, then what kind of life choices are you making?), then give the peruvian ceviche, octopus carpaccio, or wide array of oysters a shot. Oh, and then there's the poached cobia with chipotle pepper oil and chorizo peppers cooked to the hardness of croutons. Yeah, I cried too. House punch is always a surprise, as well, because it's always delicious and readily available. The crowd, too, has also been an absolute pleasure. Every time I go, the staff, along with my fellow patrons, are always ready to share and talk, which is honestly one of the best things a bar can offer: great company and a hospitable atmosphere. That said, I look forward to a long relationship with BC.","[0.0, 1.0]"

They have great food but the only flaw is that it takes a while for seating and after u order, it take about half an hour maybe more for the simplest thing like grilling a burger or having a salad.

"Me and my friend were walking by the Bleecker St today, we were shopping all day, so decided to try some new restaurant. Yelp was our helper again. After reading good reviews here, we decided to go to Carroll Place. Good thing that we did. I was so happy that we gave this place a chance. I want to come back here again already. Caroll Place is very cozy and has that romantic feeling about it. It would be a perfect place for a date. You will find candles everywhere. The size of the restaurant is also very impressive, its huge. So is the wine list here. Great selection of red and white wines. The waiter helped us to chose the wine for our meals, and they went great together. I kind of wanted to try their cocktails too, but maybe next time. The short rib that I ordered was well cooked, tasty and smelled great. I also got a salad, my friend had pizza. We finished everything with a dessert and headed home. well fed, semi-drunk and happy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Given the location and trendy logo, I was ready to be let down by this posh little tapas spot. Not so! What a delightful surprise, and perfect date spot! Charming patio, simply sweet servers, reasonably priced menu. But the biggest problem I had with this latecomer is deciding between the long litany of delicious small plates. The menu really offers a great range. Don't be afraid to try their cheapest item, the glazed carrot,which were an explosion of flavor in your mouth. They also provide a complimentary amuse bouche and palette cleanser in between course. I greatly appreciate the pacing of the meal at this joint. The reviews don't lie, the airy but sinful bacon donuts make this not just another bite, but a destination.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"First of all let me tell you that I had plenty of Lebanese food, good food. This place didn't do it for me. I took my husband there so he could try Lebanese Food. I wish i hadn't done that. The place was way too small to be called a restaurant, a take out place maybe. The food was not good and overly priced for no good reason. The tables were a joke when it came to size. literately, each table was no more than 18 inches wide.  We ordered an appetizer and half way through it, the waiter came out with the main dish. There was no place to put the plates so we had to get rid of the appetizer so the food can fit on the tiny table. That says so much about service. Normally even at an average restaurant, the waiter would wait for you to finish your appetizer before they dump on you the main course. And the worst of my experience was the waiter who reeked with cigarette smell. Really? What happened to a non smoking restaurant?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place has a wonderful ambiance and the presentation, from the decor to the food, is fantastic. I knew the reputation of this place before dining there, but I was still somewhat hesitant for fear of it being over-hyped due to its supposed exclusivity.  However, I wasn't disappointed.  And as stated many times already, the cocktails are really worth it. The dishes that I would order again are: - Beef sliders (succulent and dripping with beefy goodness) - Uni croquette (a favorite) - Veggie Fondue (the anchovy flavored dipping sauce was addictive) - Cucumber pickles (comes with a vinegar-based jello, sounds weird but very tasty) Things I wouldn't order again: - Washu beef tartar (the cheese stuffed toast was much too strong an accompaniment) - Tofu gnocchi (odd flavor and texture) - Sake Panna Cotta (Nope. Just nope.) - Something w/ icecream in it.  Clearly also didn't work for me.  I think they do savory a lot better than sweets. Overall, a really great experience.  I do have to say though, I'm still more of a fan of Sakagura and while the two provide different experiences, I'd say the quality and consistency of each menu item is better at Sakagura.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"came here after the News station showed it. Well, I guess i should have known better. First the staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was clean and very nice. Definitely a place you can bring a date. Now, for the food, it was mediocre at best. I had the all you can eat pasta. In fact I would say it is not much better than school lunch or Olive Garden. Ravioli was ok, penne was bland and the other one was so forgetful I forgot what it was. Now, maybe their regular dinner menu is better, but if they make pasta that taste like that, I dont really know how they can make any of the other dishes better. The 2 stars were basically for service and decor. There are way better Italian for the same price around the neighborhood. Won't be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We waited outdoors, awkwardly on the sidewalk, and the hostess wasn't even there when we went to see if a table was opening up or we've been forgotten. Ordered the fried calamari, pork kebabs with rice, and the pitcher of house white wine. Fried calamari was soggy. The marinara sauce was tasteless. Pork kebabs were extremely chewy and dry. The rice could have had more seasoning. I really wanted to like this place. Redemption was the wine- pretty good price for a whole pitcher and better than expensive wines that I've had.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Looking at all the reviews on yelp, I thought this place would be pretty popular but we walked into a half full restaurant for lunch on a Friday. Also it's in an alley street just south of Canal street. Surprised that they make you share a larger table with another smaller group. It makes sense when it's busy but there were other empty tables. Anyways ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings right away. Then we decided on the seafood chow mein as our other dish. It was just enough food for three girls without having to take any leftovers home. The dumplings came out quickly. I, of course, couldn't wait to try it so I actually burned my tongue a bit on my first slurp of that soup. I liked the skin was thin and there was plenty of flavorful soup inside. I couldn't really taste the crab so I would maybe just stick with the pork ones next time. I still gotto say my favorite xio long bao is still from Din Tai Fung here in California. The chow mein was a bit oily but I liked the sauce and the thick noodles. And they put a lot of seafood in there - shrimp, scallops, and squid. I felt like they should because it's like $13 for that dish and twice as much if we had just gotten the chicken or beef version. I would totally eat here again for their soup dumplings.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We started off with a mixed salad; bruschetta with tomatoes, polenta with shaved leeks and the complimentary rustic breads with garlicky bean salad -- so good. The salad was enough for three people, very simple and clean. WHERE DOES THIS PLACE GET THEIR TOMOATOES? Seriously, I wanted to lick the bruschetta plate clean. The polenta wasn't really creamy, but the large slices of cheese was enough for me to really like it.

"This place satisfied  my craving for smoked bbq. I had the brisket with the Coleslaw as a side. My friend had the pork belly with smoked black beans. The brisket was tender and smokey as it should be was easy to cut and fall part . Distinct traits that I look for in good bbq. The Coleslaw was different  than what I have ever had. Instead of the traditional mayo vinegar salt pepper than I make it seem to just be mixed in a peppery vinegar mix. So it has the bitter sour hit of vinegar with the spicy  of pepper afteward. I did try some of my friends food. I must say that the smoked black beans were delicious as was his pork belly which was just as tender as the brisket.  The service was very friendly. The employees were very friendly I only wish I asked their names. The decor is fitting for a smokehouse. Quaint and dimly lit creating a nice atmosphere  at night. The guy we spoke with did tell us that during the spring and summer they will have a bar setup. Curious to see what it will be like I believe it maybe outdoors in the rear as they have outside seating. They do catering, so if u want to have bbq without having to cook it you definitely  can. Love that I feel full but not overly. So I don't feel sluggish. It was just the right amount of food for a great price. I will return in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Get your crepe on! Cafe Triskell occupies the former space that was Lil Bistro 33.  As I mentioned in a previous post, I loved the Lil Bistro-can't stand the new one AND Cafe Triskell is not to be missed! The space is small, real small but the food is delicious with big flavor and generous portions.  The wait staff are helpful and the chef-owner knows what he is doing.   Savory crepes are HUGE, filled with fresh ingredients and take up your whole plate.  There are many options to choose from but I keep going back to my old standby crepe-delish!  Salads, also huge, are creative and filled with fresh ingredients.   If you are still hungry after your entree crepe, try a savory crepe.  These are off the hook!  Even if you think you are too full for dessert, the owner may surprise you with a dessert crepe and you will definitely find room for it (this has happened several times).   This place is great for brunch, lunch or dinner with friends or a romantic meal with the love in your life.   What makes it charming is its size but, that can also be a negative.  It gets crowded in here quickly and the air conditioner does not work that well so, it can be a bit muggy but, order a glass of something cold and relax.  Your meal will more than make up for it!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Three things I liked: 1.  Extra salad that came when food was running late. 2.  The person I ate with. 3.  The peach soup. Ten things I didn't: 1.  The waiter failing to apologize for stepping on my friend's feet twice. 2.  The temperature.  Seriously cold in the basement where we were seated. 3.  The food took forever. 4.  The attempt to serve us dessert as first course. 5.  The duck wasn't rare.  It was raw. 6.  The bread person didn't come to our table until we flagged her over. 7.  The flowers on the table were not fresh.  One rose actually fell apart onto the table.  Not sure roses at the table is a good idea anyway. 8.  The VIP table nearby which commanded all of the waiters' attention to the exclusion of everyone else. 9.  Took twenty minutes just to get our order in upon sitting. 10.  That I vouched for the place based on my last visit.

"I held my husband's 40th birthday dinner here.  The co-owner worked with me to come up with the perfect menu.  They were flexible and accommodating and the prices were more than fair.  The night of the party the staff was wonderful, the food delicious - - they did everything in their power to make it the perfect evening.  This is a popular restaurant and they don't need to go above-and-beyond to fill their seats -   the fact that they do makes them even better.  I'm sure we'll be back soon and often - I'm already craving the schnitzel.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Being from Cali, it's unusual for me to see restaurants open 24 hours that don't have $2.99 specials or scuzzy bathrooms, let alone gourmet comfort food! Service was good, decor was cute, and the prices were reasonable. I had their Peach Lemonade (couldn't taste the peach) and their Crab Burger. The crab cake was pretty good, and the ingredients were fresh. The sweet potato fries were just ok, and I let other people steal most of them. I wasn't super impressed by the crab burger, as it didn't taste too much different than burgers I can get on the West Coast. I did get a bite of my friend's turkey dinner, and the mashed sweet potato were OMG divine! I heard Cafeteria won Best Comfort Food, and maybe I should have gone for a comfort food standby...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I must say I really enjoyed this dining experience from start to finish. The host was incredibly nice and courteous, and grateful as we looked wide-eyed at the very posh and modern decour, stating ""How awesome is THIS place??"" Low-lighting, very comfortable and deep booths, and great tunes playing, although now I fail to remember what exactly. We had cheese curds for an appetizer. Amazing. Like, really, didn't think I'd ever like anything with Curd in the name, but I was SO down. Delicious. Pork nuggets. Also appetizer. Also delicious. I had a hot toddy. I was freezing. It was really hot and delicious. Check plus. My entree I had fish. Fish wrapped in bacon in fact. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. STICKY PUDDING FOR DESSERT!!! If you don't have this, you have a screw loose. SAVE ROOM!!!! All in all, one of the best meals I'd had in a long while.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had two large gatherings at Supper and each time me and my friends were treated like kings. We had about 15 people for each celebrating dinner and they went above and beyond to help us out. We originally were told we would have to do Price Fix but when we got there they said they could make us anything that we wanted. Also, got to do unlimited wine and beer which was amazing. Each of us ended up shelling out about $100 a piece but it was well worth it. We even got to play our own music from my iPod so it was pretty cool.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I mostly come back for the mixologist, Anthony, but I always wanted to try the food. Thankfully, I managed to snag a savored reservation and made it to bar seats on a Fri night. We had a cocktail each, mini rice balls, the spicy calamari and the chicken pan that comes with either a salad or pasta (we opted for the salad). My friend loves chicken parm, and after tasting the one here, he had a giant smile on his face. Perfectly cooked, the right amount of sauce and melted cheese, so I couldn't ask more of a chicken parm. The side salad was a little over dressed, but nice since it had some cherry tomatoes and carrots atop mixed greens. The rice balls were piping hot and crispy on the outside. However, I found them to be okay...mainly because they were a bit too mushy inside. The sauce was lacking a bit, but not bad for a marinara. The spicy calamari had great flavor, but note that this is fried calamari mixed in with sauce...so the breading becomes soggy. It's not a bad texture, but go into it knowing what you're ordering. Food wise, this is kind of 3-3 1/2 stars, but I really loved the service. Very attentive and sweet, occasionally asking how the meal is going etc. Thank you!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Bravo! Well done guys! Some may say I am hard to impress but I know a good business when I see one. I have noticed this place for a few months now and I have been wanting to eat here to see how it is. As soon as you walk in you see a counter, with bagels behind the workers. It is a bit reminicant of a bagel store. As soon as you sit you are greeting by a lovely young lady. Very respectable people here. The food is second to none, the presentation of the food is beautiful and I think this is where they win. Many places these days just plop food down in front of you anddo not care about presentation. When I eat something, I feel better when it is brought to me in a beautiful way. Keep it up guys, don't ever slack on presentation cause this is where you win. Also I am a neat freak and would love to point out how clean it is here. Food was great, service was great and I only paid 9.95 for lunch :)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Honored to be DP's 100th review!! Been a fan since 1985. The best Italian food without a doubt in NY.  The linguine and white clam sauce is by far the best of its kind. I won't even order this dish outside of Don Pep's as I know nothing will ever compare. The biggest compliment one can give any restaurant is to say that they are consistent.  Since 1985 I have not had one bad experience. Every time they get it right. Waiters are a trip, casual gourmet dining at its best.   Top picks are zuppa de mussels, baked clams, chicken parm, and of course linguinie and white.  House red will set you straight to. Highly recommended for any occasion as my family and I have had many good times at Don Pepe's. A home run","[0.0, 1.0]"

"What more can i say about this place! i read a couple of the reviews and atfirst i was apprehensive about coming! But i can tell you that I am glad i took the chance. The feel of soco alone was enough to make me come back. It was totally Brooklyn Chic..I tried the famous chicken and waffles which was good, but the Pecan Crusted Pork Chop was soo good. I enjoyed the texture and the different flavors, it was a new feel but one that felt oh so good! I must admit im in love..we tried the mac and cheese and that alone shouldve had its own menu! It was delicious, with a nice crust and soft on the inside. Rob (the server) suggested that i try the mardi gras which tasted like a rum punch from the south!! Where do they do that at??

"What a hip place! The staff are extremely friendly and wait time is quick even on a busy Saturday morning.

After 6min of ordering our food, it was served to us.

Could not get into little owl so made a reservation here. Nice neighborhood restaurant with big windows and exposed brick interiors the only negative was the noise.

I tried the Ginger Swizzle, which is ginger beer (nonalcoholic) mixed with mint and lime and lots of crushed ice.  Very much like a mojito, and it was quite refreshing. I had the sea bass entree, which came on a bed of amazing orangey spaghetti squash.  The fish was absolutely perfect, and the squash was wonderful.  I had never had anything like it before. For dessert, we shared the chocolate bread pudding, which came with vanilla ice cream with cocoa nibs.  The kitchen thoughtfully gave us not just the standard one scoop of ice cream, but THREE so we could each have our own.  Awesome.  They also gave us a little plate of petit fours to try.  Yum, though we were too full to finish all of them. The service was truly impeccable, which is of course expected at a restaurant like Gramercy, but it was also friendly and unpretentious, which I really liked.  Reminded me of eating at the Four Seasons, where the service was similarly fantastic. The decor of the restaurant is very warm and classical, and though it was late, the restaurant was relatively full.  Would highly recommend making reservations in advance, particularly if you want to go during meal rush hour.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings for an appetizer and the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodle for my main entree. Although I was expecting a different and ""healthier"" dumpling, these dumplings were a little too mushy for my taste.  I wouldn't order these again.  The main entree on the other hand was really good.  Portion size was just enough to fill me, but I know it may not fill the average appetite of a man.  The egg noodles were handmade... they were thinner than usual and looked almost like ramen.  It was a really good mixture of light sauce, crab meat (real), and good pork pieces.   The atmosphere seems to imitate what it would be like in Thailand.  Although I've never been myself, I'm saying this based on my coworker's word that has been there.   The service was very quick and friendly.  After tax and tip, it was $13 for lunch... which I'd say is pretty good for the quality lunch in midtown (will probably be cheaper next time since I'd skip the dumplings).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"What a cute little place! I went there for brunch last weekend and really liked it. The service there was great. I was greeted by the owner when I first walked in who made sure we were seated promptly. The waiters helped my friends and I take off our jackets, which is rare for a brunch place to do. My friends and I all ordered the huevos rancheros which I thought was really delicious. I do admit it wasn't a ton of food. If you are looking for a big brunch I would suggest ordering a side of fries or splitting an appetizer. I thought it was a good enough portion that didn't leave me so stuffed that I couldn't move, and left some room for dessert. For dessert my friend and I split the churros, which was soooo good. I would definitely come back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is 1 of my favorite places in the city. I've tried almost all of the empanadas on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. Some are a little greasy, but that's kind of what you want.

Don't come expecting authentic, authentic Korean fare, but enjoy the unique twists on classic dishes. My favorite item is an appetizer with a piece of sashimi on a sesame leaf (aka ""perilla"" or in Korean this is called gaen-ip) called ""yellowtail on the green"" -- this is a must try in my opinion. The wings are also great: extra crispy, not too sticky or spicy. At happy hour, they're a great deal, too.

I don't think any food is worth waiting 2 hours for, so as long as we visit New York, we'll continue to try to get here at an off-peak time like 5 or 5:30pm Monday-Thursday. Not even gonna touch it Friday-Sunday. We ordered hirata buns, miso, shoyu, and a daily special ""spicy"" ramen. Two thumbs up!

"My wife and I moved into the neighbor a few months ago and Station House quickly became our go to neighborhood bar. The atmosphere is loud and inviting, not the greatest date bar but a most go to for the beer and whiskey connoisseur . The rotating tap list always has something interesting and fun to try and fall in love with. And just like the weather if you don't like it wait a few minutes and it will change. I especially love the digital pour on tap board that let's you know how far along a tap is and when it is about to kick. The food is delicious especially the burgers. Now a personal note and observation: When did the buy back become extinct? I have noticed this a lot lately. It started here but ironically enough last time I was here we got a buy back. I thought the rule was after 3 or 4 beers the next round was on the house. Did this change and I miss it?

"I wasn't even sure I was going to remember the name of this place. It's discreet, and rather tiny. The only reason I found this place on Yelp was because I remembered I was near 1st Ave and 1st Street. I was on a trek from St. Marks Place and 3rd Avenue and walking downtown until I found something that I liked for lunch. By the time, I got to 1st Street, my fellow guest got tired of walking around aimlessly and decided to use Yelp to find some place (she still has yet to review, but it's a start). All signs pointed to V-Nam Cafe, and so that's how I ended up here. The place wasn't empty, but it wasn't brimming with people either. Which is fine by me, because I like being able to sit anywhere I choose. I ended up ordering a medium spicy Banh Mi Ga. What's a medium spicy? It's Jalapeno peppers and sriracha in your sandwich. And in case that's not enough for you they can put Thai chili peppers in there. And of course, there's a bottle of sriracha that's waiting for you. I don't think many sandwiches I've had compared in intensity, texture, and flavor as that Banh Mi Ga. And considering the price (5.25) you better believe this is a huge steal. I will probably take this trek again in the very very near future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We all got an order of regular fries that were really well seasoned.

"This has to be one of my favorite places in NYC. Beer + Bacon...How can you go wrong with that? I came here with a friend on a Tuesday evening and we had a blast. Ordered 2 beer flights and Bacon flight. The variety/crispness of bacon was spot on and topping that with beer was quite an experience. While the beer flight was awesome, we noticed that there was a Whiskey flight on the menu too! So there we were, beer + bacon + whiskey. I walked out of this place smiling hard. Highly recommend if you like bacon and beer. If you don't, well...give this place a shot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After having a mediocre meal at Cafe Habana, my friend and I were caught in the crazy downpour that hit the city last Tuesday. We ducked for cover inside the cozy atmosphere of Cafe Gitane before we were carried off down the street by the rushing water and street trash. I was actually happy that this happened. Cafe Gitane is a cute spot. It's a little in the middle between a cafe and a full fledged restaurant. I got the cafe' creme which was delectable. My friend got the cafe mocha, which when it was presented to him, had a little paw print (the Cafe Gitane logo) made from coco powder nestled in the foam. Oh how manly he looked sipping his mocha with the coco paw print. :-P We sat at the bar since we were only getting coffee. You could tell that the waiter was saving the tables for dinner patrons. Totally fine. We got to watch the chef create this couscous tower that I have made a mental note to go back and try. :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We tried to go to Sugarfreak a few times before we could actually get a table due to typical new restaurant stuff like ovens going out, and things like that. Whatever, that's fine, I get it and that sucks for everyone--don't hold it again them at all. Then we tried to go one weekend, and they were closed for some holiday, which seems insane for a new restaurant, but again, whatever. We had basically decided to not look forward to it and just pop in if we happen to be hungry and walking by sometime. Eventually, we sat down with a group of people there, and things started well. The menu was a little light, but sometimes that's nice. The peanuts at the table were a nice touch, and a good tactic when you have a new restaurant and are still figuring out your systems. My girlfriend ordered a hibiscus lemonade after we had to send the first drink back for being WAAAY too sweet, which given the name we found pretty funny. The hibiscus lemonade was a beautiful dark purple color and was absolutely delicious. It was part of the reason we went back, which is why we were so disappointed to find that upon our return the drink recipe was totally different! It was a completely different drink that had zero flavor. Our server, who was awesome, informed us that the bar staff has a bit of disagreement over how the drink should be made. These are the kinds of things that need to be worked out before I want to go back. But the decor is cute, and it's not a style of cuisine that you see a lot. The owner, Al, is a really nice guy and I'm really pulling for them. Once they get all the kinks worked out, it's definitely a place I'll recommend.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"the restaurant is TINY - like 4 or 5 tables - 3 of which are for a 'communal' dining experience, so you are sit with other people. which can be awkward if you arent expecting it. we were sat with 2 other couples. once you got used to it, it was actually pretty cool because we were able to see what they were eating, ask them what they liked and didnt like, etc. i woudnt go here with more than 2 or 4 people. as far as the food/menu. the menu isnt large - but just enough - there are 3 price ranges - 7, 12 and 15 but all the plates are about the same size, served in a sharing / tapas style...usually 3 or 4 portions.we ordered a few things, and then a few more, each time an item is brought to you (everything is served one at a time, so you arent overwhelmed and you can really really enjoy each dish to its fullest) the waiter would describe what it is served with, because the menu doesnt go into much detail. each plate is the perfect amount of food. not too much not too little kinda making you want more, but not needing more. each plate had crunch which i thought was brilliant, bc who doesnt love crunchiness! anyway i did a little research before hand and knew that i wanted to try a few things already.... so here is what we had: -the mango paneeer served with flatbread. wow this was delicious. the bread was so warm and so fresh. the taste was zingy and spicy. -the zucchini and hummus pizza (this was my 2nd favorite thing we ate) you would think that this would be boring and not so good but wow it was delish. its served on a puff pastry as the pizza dough - crispy and yummy. then the hummus followed by the zucchini which must have been grilled or something. then on top of that is crushed wasabbi peas which is just enough crunch and spice. man i want some of that now -the pork dumplings - these were delish but not my fave - they were served in a big bowl with all these crunchies on top. the crunchies were explained to us as being chickpea flower crunchies. they were delish -the duck with portobello mushrooms, and goat cheese. the duck was cooked perfectly. damn it was good. -and the best thing we ate all night: the grafitti burger served with chipotle mayo and fingerling garlic potatoes. there are 2 slider (4 big bite) burgers, on it are a few onions (maybe lettuce? cant remember) the mayo is on the side. seriously when i took a bite of this burger, i had a foodgasm. never have i had a burger so different and tasty. it was seasoned with indian spices and prob other spices. the bun was perfect. crunchy and butter. the chipotle mayo was so freakin delish. and finale - the WARM TRUFFLE ALMOND STRAWBERRIES, PEPPER ICE CREAM the strawberries are in a white truffle syrup and the icecream is peppery. it was different and delicious. all and all this was a food experience like ive never had and ive eaten many amazing meals. this has to be in my top 3 meals ive ever had just because the flavors were like nothing ive ever experienced. the meal was $108 (with 4 glasses of wine!) and totally worth it. i will 1000000% be going back.

"Oh, Keith McNally. You have a mini empire in NYC. Paulino's is excellent. Schiller's great too. Pastis, so sex and the city. Minetta Tavern... water and oil. Pros: Amazing Bone Marrow. Seriously....so good. Tartar... 2/3 stars (veal and beef were awesome...although I feel sorta bad eating veal in general (irony), however, the third, aka the lamb, should stay on a skewer). Black Label Burger was very tasty. Cons: The service was just OK. It started out great but our food and drink came 1 hour after we were seated: Error 1. Error 2: The trout smelled like a dirty jockstrap and tasted like wine, butter and toe crumbs. It was so horrible I'm shocked they even had the audacity to serve it on a plate and not in the trash can on the corner of the duck warehouse on Grand and Mott street. All in all, Minetta tavern was necessary for a foodie, but an unnecessary repeat. I don't agree with the hype, I think all of McNally's  other restaurants are by far better. Especially Paulino's.

"i don't go anywhere else in nyc for bbq because i'm afraid to have a bad experience and eat bad bbq. the line is always out the door but it's worth the wait. you end up spending the entire waiting time thinking about what to order (and you will still over order). great atmosphere inside. the table situation is a little nerve-wracking. it's one of those places where you order your food, pay at the register, and find a seat. i've been seat-lucky and got seats immediately the two times i visited. i've ordered the same three meats (listed in order of deliciousness): - brisket: so tender/melts in your mouth; was a little fatty this time around - burnt ends: tad salty and little tough this time around but still very good - spare ribs: great flavor in every bite for the sides - i've tried: - pomme frites: nothing special. save your money/appetite and order the other sides - sweet potato casserole: good. but think it has too much maple for my liking. i'm not a fan of sweets so i might be biased. - burnt end baked beans: very good but always a tad salty - broccoli salad: delicious and you will feel less guilty because it's probably the only green on your plate the free add-ons are all good. i finished all my cucumbers and not even the meal itself. the bbq tastes just as good the next day so don't worry about over ordering! also do they sell the bbq sauce??! so freaking good. i want to use it as my new salad dressing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The empanadas are so good that this place was hopping even at 4am this morning, a Tuesday! The customers were a fun mix: a bachelorette party (with one participant announcing ""I can't believe I have to be at work in two hours!""), a bunch of guys who'd just been clubbing, some workers getting off their late shifts, and us tennis fans just off the 7 train after an epic US Open night match. Everyone was in a good mood, congratulating the bride-to-be, and enjoying the piping hot empanadas. Vegetarians: The veggie (carrots, potatoes, lima beans), mozzarella cheese, and broccoli/mozzarella cheese empanadas were my favorites. The rice/beans empanada was a little too dry for my taste. But that dryness didn't matter because our table was given generous cups of tasty, addictive red and green sauces. Consider trying a side of green garlicky chimichurri sauce for an extra buck. In fact, the sauces really were the best thing about this place. I chose the corn empanadas, because I like the crunch. I hear the wheat empanadas are softer and flakier. Tip: At peak times, consider delivery instead of takeout. We got a table easily at 4am Tuesday morning, but at 1am last Friday night, this place was totally packed, with a large waiting crowd. So we ordered takeout, and waited about 20 minutes! Waiting outside on 9th avenue on garbage night, with steaming trash bags piled high on the sidewalk, was not the most pleasant experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cute Café Triskell had attracted my attention a few months back walking past after another meal. It went straight into my notes though, and a recent nearby event made it very convenient to go back and eat. The inviting yellow inside and out as well as French cottage decor make a very inviting place overall, but on this Sunday's mid-afternoon, loud bass was pumping from next door, making the audio of the place a bit disorienting. I could not help myself with the first item on the menu, immediately ordering up the French onion soup ($5.75). Grandma has set the bar impossibly high on this item, but the rendition here is far from disappointing, with crispy cheese oozing over and around the crock. The broth is spot on, and only made me sad to reach the bottom, picking and spooning tiny morsels until my bowl was finally removed from the table. In between courses I inquired about the origin of the triskell, a symbol used prominently in the signage of this place, and obviously its namesake. Mr. Fallait, the chef and owner didn't seem used to the question or was very busy, but alluded to the Celtic influences in the seas north of France and in Bretagne, the origin of the crêpe. I was lucky enough to be joined for this meal by five others and we sampled quite a variety of items, including the behemoth chicken, vegetables & goat cheese ($9.75), by far the largest crêpe of the day, and quite tasty in all its peppery goodness. The cheese was nothing out of the ordinary, but goat cheese never needs to be to satisfy. The second favorite was the button mushroom, Swiss cheese & herb butter crêpe ($7.95). The Swiss is in between the fold, while the mushrooms are loaded on top and full of flavor. The butter is quite subtle, but all the herbs bring together the rest of the tastes quite well. Also on offer are a set of three sandwiches, of which the croque-madame ($9.95) is the most awe-sinspiring. It's a basic ham & cheese sandwich served on delicious thick and fluffy bread and topped with an egg, making things interesting. The sandwich is tasty and satisfying, but sticking to the crêpes here is probably a better idea. We also ordered a lemon & sugar crêpe ($4.75) for a dessert to share and were treated to a butter & sugar ($4.50) on the house. The two thin and sweet crêpes made for the perfect ending to a thoroughly enjoyable meal. It was so comfortable inside that it almost made me sad to leave the quaint place, especially since the pounding bass from next door had subsided.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"GREAT PLACE FOR LUNCH! This place is probably the only place around the area where $5 can get you a legit lunch. The gyros and sandwiches are made with a 6 inch pita. They also give you a variety of sauces for dip. I had the pork souvlaki sandwich and feta fries. I thoroughly enjoyed both. The pork was juicy and not dry at all. The mama sauce adds a nice kick to it. They also put a few fries in the sandwich. It can get a bit sloppy though. The feta fries were delicious. They were very generous with the feta. I had the mama sauce on the side and drizzled it over the fries. I had the chicken skewers in the past and they were alright. The chicken was kinda dry. They also offer a wide variety of pre-packaged Greek desserts like baklava, rice pudding and other desserts I can't pronounce. Overall, probably the best lunch spot around Lenox Hill Hospital. I guess it's crowded for that very reason.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Di Fara has really made a name for himself in the NYC area and for good reason. As New York's first $5 a slice pizza, It's truly a title that Di Fara of all places has earned with their testament to consistently delivering a quality product. The lines out the door really speak for itself when it comes to their pizza. People aren't kidding when they say be prepared to wait, overall from getting in line to shoveling pizza in my mouth, I think we waited a good 1.5-2 hours. Inside you'll find old man Di Fara diligently and lovingly making each pie from scratch. From spreading and tossing the dough, layering on sauce, adding fresh cheese curd, cutting up fresh basil via his vintage kitchen shears, and setting each pie in his circa 1986 pizza oven. His son will take your order on a legal pad with a pen and a system that clearly only makes sense to himself and tell you exactly how long you'll have to wait for your slices. As for the slice itself, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said. crusts are thin, well done on the bottom, but nice and firm on top while retaining all of its flavor. The sauce is really savory, it's hard to describe really but I could taste it on my tongue for 20-30 minutes after I ate it. It plays well with the cheese and basil which were just cooked to absolute perfection. There's something admirable about a man who takes it upon himself to truly master the art of doing one thing and then ensuring that it stays consistent no matter what. If you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Di Fara and his fine establishment is like a more toned down, Italian version of Jiro.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm all about the Kamo Seiro (cold noodles, duck slices and tokyo negi in a hot dipping sauce). When you finish your noodles they provide you with hot water so you can drink the dipping sauce like a soup. I'm also a huge fan of the (complimentary) matcha green tea, and the fact that they make the soba right in plain view (though it's a little weird that they keep them behind a glass like a zoo exhibition - I guess it's more sanitary?).

Long line by 6:30pm, but luckily for us, they had a table for 5 right away so we got to skip the line. Amazing service (way better than Grimaldi's).

"First of all, I'm not a big fan of really spicy food, and Thai isn't exactly high on my list of cuisines I enjoy frequently.  But when I compare SriPraPhai to the other Thai restaurants I've dined at over the years, this place in my neighborhood is the tops.  The long wait is a testament to the delicious food, and while it can take a long time to get a table, be patient. First, the Crispy Chinese watercress salad (I get it with just chicken) is out of this world.  True, the fried nature lends to high calories, but who cares?  The roasted duck salad is also excellent.  Combine the two sans the crispiness with the roasted duck with Chinese watercress over rice.  Happy, happy, joy, joy. . . . . .   I also really like the Saute Chinese broccoli with crispy pork.  The Panang Curry was also very good, until my mouth caught fire.  It was funny watching my friends eat it too, because we were all sweating and red-faced.  But nevertheless, it was tasty. The dining room can get really crowded and noisy, but at least it's a really nice place, and the sign over the men's room is funny.  Anyway, if you're in Manhattan, make the trip out to Woodside (get off at either Woodside or 69th Street).  Walk east on Roosevelt (if you get off at Woodside) or west (if you're at 69th) until 39th Avenue.  Oh, and they are closed on Wednesday.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"my shirt is delicious!  i was at Fette Sau last night and the smell of the place has attached itself to my clothes...shirts, jacket, jeans and hair.  but i'm not complaining.  i might even try to taste it. pork by the pound, and an exciting selection of beers, bourbons and ryes...this place will undoubtedly be a great place for summer drunkenness and the gorging of oneself, especially with all the benches outside.   we sampled some of the brisket, pork belly and pork loin with baked beans and pickles on the side...all excellent.  a half gallon each of the chocolate lager and one of the heavyweight beers, as well as a few snifters of bourbon and rye were great to help wash it all down.  the only thing missing was the corn bread.  CORN BREAD!!!  you call this BBQ?!?! actually the food was so good that we weren't satisfied with our initial portions. so hepatitis C be damned!...we stealthily pulled an unfinished tray of pork chunks freshly left behind by two girls.  quitters! the decor is simple and interesting.  it looks like a cross between my high school bathroom and something out of the movie Saw (especially with various knives and torture devices for beer taps), however they don't serve urinal cakes.  so much for high school nostalgia. the place was pretty great, but it's not the type of place you'd want to eat at too often.  your belly will get fatter as your wallet gets thinner.  and make no mistake about it...a half hour in this place and you WILL reek of BBQ!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Good food not so good price. I guess you're paying for the niche of chicken fingers covered in off the wall toppings and glitter? I didn't really get the point of the glitter bang option but I guess in this superficial day and age it's better to have a little sparkle in your belly. Still the food itself is decent. I got a single portion of the fire flame which is spicy and curry flavored as promised and truffle fries. I didn't really see the ""glitter bang"" but it tasted lovely and the chicken is fresh. I didn't really enjoy the amount of stuff on the finger itself as I like minimal breading on my fingers so this is not the ideal place for someone who likes the same. The truffle fries are more subtle than I expected but were good in the same. Overall it's an interesting experience. They have a dollar wall to leave your mark in this little fancy diner that only offers fried chicken and fries.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Nifty little bar in Greenwich Village which is pretty cool and classy, if you can snag a table/couch.  We were lucky enough to get a place to sit.  Otherwise, standing up here isn't too much fun, and there aren't too many tables in this tiny bar.   The drinks were good and inexpensive - 3 drinks for $19.  Good deal.   My only major complaint is the lack of air conditioning - we were sweating bullets in there the entire time!   Still, all in all, it was a fun experience and I wouldn't be averse to visiting Shade again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to Blue Ribbon a few times before  years ago (good experiences) and knowing that both of our moms like seafood, my husband and I decided to take them there, albeit with some delay, in celebration of International Women's Day. In the past, I ordered from both meat and fish sides of the entree section, but this time around we all went for fish dishes, and also had oysters (special deal for $1.50 apiece) and two salads to start. Moms were not the fans of oysters, but then it's an acquired taste. I did not think they were bad, I just thought that two out of the three sauces that came with them were completely useless. They did not, in any way, add to the flavor. The only sauce that gave a little kick to the oysters was the cocktail sauce. Perhaps coming up with some interesting condiment for the oysters would be a good idea? [wink] Caesar and Greek salads were standard salads. We got Chardonnay and Riesling (local)  to drink, and the latter went much better with the fish offerings on the menu. Chardonnay was not memorable, sadly. Now onto the entrees - moms each had the red trout with mushrooms and greens, hubby had the sweet and spicy cat fish and I got the skate. All fish was absolutely wonderfully cooked, although moms had to peel the skins off their trouts. I tried mushrooms that came with the fish and they were really good, although I would have paired that  particular fish with something more grainy, like rice or buckwheat (may be mushroom fried rice? [wink]). Husband was also happy with his entree and mashed potatoes. Now as for my skate, I appreciated the opportunity to try this creature (it was cooked in some kind of batter, so it was crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside :)), but the side it came with - vaguely described on the menu as ""potatoes, bacon and shrimp"" - could simply be called ""lots of bacon"". ""Potatoes"" were miniscule hash browns, and there were few of them. ""Shrimp"" were tiny mini shrimps you see in Ramen noodle soups. The side was overwhelmed by bacon fat, while, I thought I'd have more potatoes and shrimps, sprinkled with a few pieces of bacon. That would have been a logical combination for me, and probably for most people [wink]. Profiteroles we got for dessert were really good and we also liked how our tea was served in individual pots. We had to dip tea bags into the pots ourselves though. :) Also, pots had openings for the bags and no lids, so the water got cold pretty quickly. Service was, overall, fast and more or less attentive, though our particular server was sort of ""in the clouds"", and had to be called to the table twice. For a dinner worth close to $300 for the party of four, I would have really appreciated more creativity in side dishes and a more attentive staff.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of the places where ""patience is key"". Such a precise and dedicated artist the pizza maker is. When you want to rush the guy, you hold back knowing you'll get exactly what you smell, see, and experience you get from hearing the other customers can't be imitated. Everyone loves their order! Although the price is slowing rising, I still order a pie (best deal) and then share amongst friends or just for myself. Whenever I know guests are coming, I always place an order at least an hour advance. (the guy really takes his time). In the end, patience = one of the best slice of pizza you'll have in NYC.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Well if you have read my previous reviews you know I loved Traif so when searching for my next dining adventure I was excited to give Xixa a try. They did not disappoint! One really cool thing they do that I wish Traif did was the 10 course prefix for $40 per person. I was a bit nervous to try it at first because hey they could give you anything and maybe we wouldn't get to try the stuff we wanted the most. They were great and happily took our request when I asked for no fish. I even mentioned that the only fish option I would be up for trying is the ""fish and chips"". They were so great he even had them bring us that as one of the 10 courses. When we saw the 1st course they brought out we were confident we would be full after 10 - they do look small but well planned to make sure you are nice and stuffed by the end. Also, we definitely got 12 dishes, not 10. AMAZING! 2 desserts - hell yes. Here are a few things we tried that stand out in my mind: chicken sopes - tasty little tortillas with chicken liver which was surprisingly delish (I've never had liver!) foie gras - DELICIOUS - very sweet/savory type dish I adored it but it was a bit sweet for the BF fish & chips - it was not as I was expecting, kind of ceviche like duck lettuce wraps - SO good, this is how duck was mean to be tasted. The lettuce was crisp and the duck so juicy carnitas of pork belly - I am so torn about pork belly as it is usually too fatty for me but this was my dream come true.. perfectly succulent meat. churros with jalapeno sorbet - separate the sorbet was weird but all together it was amazing and very fresh One thing I am really sad about is no carrots for us to try! Oh well, just means I have to come back for a 2nd visit! Definitely make a trip to Xixa, you won't regret it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So right. So So Right. When a restaurant gets it right it is possibly the nicest thing to experience. And Monumental Lane does just that.  I went there with my lovely lady and another couple and we cleaned our plates. Honestly, not a bad dish between the 4 of us. Our server was knowledgeable and recommended additional dishes without being pushy and she was right on the money with what to order. We placed our orders for the Main course and she asked if we wanted any ""snacks' (small plate beginners). It was a great recommendation. We enjoyed our 2 dishes that we ordered for the table - a ham biscut trio and fried chick peas. The main courses of steaks and Shortribs (separate  dishes) were cooked perfectly. All in all it was the best meal I have had in a long while. On a side note - by far the nicest bathroom I have ever seen in a small restaurant.

We waited for 30 minutes for a tiny appetizer and finally the server (our real one)came over to our table and asked us to order our entrees so he could expedite them from the kitchen.  We ordered more appetizers to tide us over...they never appeared.  Nor did the waiter for another 30 minutes.  No drink refill, no nothing, just more bread.  Finally when the waiter re-appeared I mentioned that our appetizers never came to which he ran frenzied into the kitchen and brought them out, along with our entrees.  Still no drink refills. Then the endless apologies started....which became very tiring.  I dont know of the issue was with the kitchen or our server..","[0.0, 1.0]"

"When I can stuff myself like a fat pig on delicious cuts of pork for $20 even, I don't give a damn if this is authentic bbq or some strange German hybrid. Pass me that pure-fat pork belly, some smoked pork sausage, pulled pork, and juicy brisket, and I'll happily deal with cramped picnic tables and breeding hipsters and their spawn. We got all that plus two cups of delicious baked beans with burnt ends, a pile of potato rolls, tasty german potato salad, half sour pickles, and one lone spear of overly red peppery broccoli, and we were all stuffed to the point of explosion. Did I mention it only cost $20 a person? What a steal. I would say that ordering everything by the pound is tricky, because it is easy to over or underestimate how much you need. In our case, we ordered too much, and overate as a result. I'd rather their be a standard ""order size"" that you could work with, because I think that could help alleviate the problem. As it was, I was super excited to see Steve's Key Lime Pie on the menu, but by the time I was ready for dessert it was no longer a possibility, thanks to my swollen stomach. In any event, we loved our family style pork feast, although we did feel compelled to walk all the way over the williamsburg bridge and up to union square in order to compensate for all the fatty goodness we had consumed. Eating at Fette Sau is definitely not for the faint of heart!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A good surprise.  Went here on a Saturday night for dinner.  Atmosphere was modern and good for a date and for groups.   Food was surprisingly good (I like the other Burke restaurants but didn't expect much from looking at this menu).  The taste nevertheless was great.  We ordered the mushroom flatbread which was flavorful and cheesy goodness.  Entrees were the lamb ribs and burger.  The lamb looked pretty good and came with a side of crispy well seasoned curried shoestrings.  The burger was the best though.  The flavors of the burger were delicious.  The bun wasn't that great, but they seasoned and cooked it well, and the cheese plus whatever else (bacon? Onions?) were great.  The side of pickles that came w the burger was okay.  The fries could improve; they weren't very crispy and I expect more from David Burke.   Overall downside is that the menu prices were expensive.  The drinks were expensive for this type of restaurant (18$+).  I would expect that for DB a Townhouse or Fishtail, but not here.  The menu prices were kind of pricey for midtown west location (food items were about $3-6 more expensive than I would expect), but I guess hotels are usually more expensive.  Flatbread was $15, lamb was mid30s$, and burger was $18.   I also know that people on yelp have raved about the candies bacon.  I saw a neighboring table order it.  It's three strips of bacon for 15$--again too pricey in my opinion.  Presentation looked cool, but not worth the price. Service was okay; nothing to rave about but they were fine and attentive and polite.  I'm terms of service, a long blond haired lady was nice but the other lady who walked us to our table came off as snobby.  Not a fan of her vibe esp since she's one of the first people guest see. I would go back.  My only hesitation would be the prices. Unfortunately it's just $3-6 too expensive but it would cause hesitation in returning.  Nevertheless, flavors were overall fantastic!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I visited New York for a long weekend. As it was my first time, it was not nearly long enough. We went to Swift with a friend of ours from the area, and I was not disappointed in the least. My only qualm was that they wouldn't light any drinks on fire for us. I'm not entirely sure about that law in NY though. The beer selection was vast, the bartenders were amazing, their Irish Coffee is not to be effed with, and I had my first Irish Car Bomb. It was an Irish-y themed adventure for myself apparently.  All of the libations I consumed were impressive. We ended up going back to Swift our last night in the City, and I was feeling like there was one last adventure in our trip that we needed to solidify the fantasticality of this trip. After a few drinks at the bar, our bartender, Shane, was taking exceptional care of us. We got to talking, and I asked him, as a couple of Californian's and it being our last night, what we should do. His answer? To see the Brooklyn Bridge. So we did, and we walked across. It was a very memorable night, all beginning at Swift. Not to mention the general atmosphere of this bar was very pleasant.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We enjoyed our dinner here the other night - we cancelled our Dirt Candy reservation to come here.  I've heard about their steak for a while and have been meaning to stop by and try it, and boy were we glad we did. It was around 6pm on a Wednesday and there were only a few tables left.  We chose to sit at the counter and watch the experts in action in the kitchen.  Our waitress Diana was very through explaining the specials and recommended a nice bottle of Malbec (I was deciding between the cab and this one). For starters we got the sardines and clams with butter and garlic, as the entree we shared the amazing ax handle rib-eye, we got the fried mashed potatoes and Berkshire bacon.  We were having such a lovely time we decided to extend our stay and also to get the salted caramel chocolate pot de creme for dessert.  Everything was delicious, the sardines was fresh and the pickled root was a unique and welcomed accompaniment.  The clams were succulent and they gave us bread to dip with the garlic and butter which was thoughtful.  We saw our ax handle rib-eye from the moment it hit the grill until it cooked to the perfect temperature.  I'm not typically a fan of the rib-eye because of the fat to meat ratio, but this one was nicely seasoned I was glad I tried it and I would recommend it to steak lovers.  The Berkshire bacon was thick cut and flavorful without being too salty.   I'm on the fence about the pan-friend mashed potatoes.  It's a novel concept, and I did enjoy it.  I don't know if I would get it again - if you do order it, be very careful - it tends to retain a lot of heat so 10 or 15 minutes after it gets to the table it can still be very hot on the inside. We were debating between the olive oil cake dessert or the classic pot de creme.  Diana suggested the pot de creme for first timers.  It was rich and decadent but not too sweet, there were salt flakes in the chocolate and caramel creme.  It also went well with the rest of the malbec.  I'm happy we went with that one. There was a wait for tables starting around 6:30 - the place is small and casual - it is a fine choice for anyone looking for simply prepared fantastic food.  As for groups I'd keep it to 4-6 people.  There's a cute outdoor area too in the back.   We will be coming back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Best slice in my world!! I'm far away Dom, but your pizza is my permanent reference when it comes to... well, pizza:) I use to live at the top floor of that magical little corner of Brooktown, and I can't remember a day passing by with me not stopping automatically at Di Faras to long lines for that divine slice. It's like a pizza from another planet, and a good planet (I thank u Steve Jobs)! You are a true artist Dom. The sauce, the cheese (3 or 4 kinds of those, including real bufala mozzarella and imported parmigiano reggiano), watching you pouring that olive oil before you send it to the oven where she is slowly, wondrously brought into being. You're putting all of that love into each pie, and taking your sweet time at that.. the lines are long at Di Faras but only cause Dom can stop time. Expect about 1-2 hours wait, and in the summer you don't want to wait inside since the place can get blazing hot and that shitty ceiling fan wont really help. I had a lot of pizza in New York, and there are some really good other spots (L&B Spumoni if u like sicilian, Lucali, John's in the village, Grimaldi's...) but I really think that Dom is the thin crust Leonardo Da Vinci of our time.

"This is one of like two Filipino places left in Manhattan. I've been to all the others over the years, but for some reason, they have all closed down. That's a shame, as Filipino food is extremely delicious and affordable. This place is pretty small inside, like five tables or so. It's one of the nicer looking Filipino places I've been to, as in its clean and has a slightly more upscale look inside (the black dress shirt/black dress shoes servers kind of place) I went here for lunch with a friend. The lumpia shanghai were excellent as usual. Each of us also had a lunch special, a chicken adobo with rice, and a bistec with rice. The portion size was a bit small - much smaller than the Filipino places in Queens. We actually ordered an extra portion of rice, because what they gave us was not enough. Then again, this is Manhattan, so you have to take that into account. And the lunch specials are only $8. Otherwise, the food tasted fine and the waitress here was also attractive!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My husband wanted to celebrate Father's Day on Saturday so we headed to Brooklyn Crab. After reading the reviews I had very low expectations. Keep in mind that restaurants need at least a couple of weeks before they figure out how to work out the kinks and we went on the first week. We waited an hour and a half to be seated. Feel free to have one or two cocktails at the bar because even if you are driving,  if you stop drinking just before you order it will be at least two hours before you have to drive.  Feed your kids before otherwise  your day will be very long. The kids, my husband and I had an awesome time. The food was really good. Fred, our waiter, was fantastic. Great fried oysters and the crabs were perfect. I know all these items are much more inexpensive in other places but this is Brooklyn and it was fabulous.  Great afternoon!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So after years of saying I'd do it, I finally did it. We took the trip to Midwood and tried one of NYC's best pizzas! We got there a little after 6pm on Sunday. There were a few people ahead of us and Dom was taking a break in the back. They were only doing Take Out because he was tired and didn't want to open the store. We waited about 35 minutes for our large margherita pie and 4 squares. Now on any normal day, I'd choose a thin NY slice over sicilian, but I was totally taken aback by a DiFara's sausage square. Delectable. The bottom was crispy, not overdone with butter and oil. Enough cheese, and the sausage phenomenal. LOVED. The regular margherita was great, although for me not quite perfect. Amazing flavor, much saltier than the square.The sauce is unique, I can't put my finger on it. The greatest part is the ton of fresh basi; it makes such a difference! You can watch every pizza being made. Yes, you'll have to be patient. If I was in the area, I'd be here all the time. Is it worth the trek? You need to decide for yourself. This pizza is fantastic and lovers will definitely enjoy it. Those who come to analyze their business model might be annoyed. SO LUCKY - five minutes before our pizzas were ready, they randomly opened up shop for us to sit. Life is like a box o' pizzas. Ya never know what yer gonna get.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I wish I lived in the neighborhood because even though Middle Eastern is not my favorite type of food, I would definitely like to go back and maybe sit outside.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The only downside is the wait time... if you go during normal brunch hours on a weekend, expect an hour or more. My suggestion is to go late-night after some quality partying, since they're open all night long. Nothing better than blueberry pancakes at 4 am!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Impolite and unprepared hostess, we were disrespected I went to Spotted Pig on May 15th and had the most terrible experience with an employee of the restaurant. The hostess was very impolite, spoke very loud, and had no patience in answering doubts. We had to wait in line for almost 2 hours because she was unprepared on managing the list, and also because she noticed that my wife was upset so I believe she did it on purpose as well, because she was sarcastic all the time, calling my wife a delightful person, and after a almost 2 hour wait said that would buy drinks for us given the wait which never happened, she was really being sarcastic and making fun of us... Off course it is a famous place and the lines are big (but we were early and had no one waiting outside, just some couples inside), but we were a party of 4 and instead of putting 2 tables together every couple that came in got a table (when we finally got a table, we saw many empty tables in the second floor, because the hostess is not a good manager). Also, we saw at least 2 parties of 4 arriving after us and she gave them a table before us. We complained and she spoke loud saying that they arrived before us, but we had been there for almost 2 hours so we saw the face of everyone in line, and it is not like they have phone msgs to alert you on the table... We were tremendously disrespected in this place by the hostess, I sincerely wish that management do something about it. In order for them to know which person I am talking about, I am giving her physical characteristics since I never got her name: she was African american and overweight. I believe I only got a table because the hostess overheard me talking about a web review. I am glad tools like this exist so persons like this don't get away with mistreating employees and management can know what is really going on in their restaurants. After this bad experience, even a Michelin restaurant food would taste bad. Many thanks","[0.0, 1.0]"

"24-48 hours later, I'm still thinking about this meal. *Love* it. I'd go back in a heartbeat. In short, the food was outstanding. 4 meat-heavy dishes (plus bread & butter, which we requested) were shared between the 2 of us: 1) Sea urchin with bacon on focaccia. 4 delicious (yet small) bites. Total flavor explosion. I don't recommend sharing. 2) Agave Glazed Chicken Wings. How do you elevate the chicken wing? Like this. Loved the blue cheese emulsion. 3) Braised Short Rib of Beef. Does it get any better than this? (Answer: NO.) The short rib was so tender. Paired well with taglierini pasta (and somehow Not a textural disaster)! Portions were very generous. 4) Roasted Pork Belly Confit. They had me at pork belly. Yes, the menu is a bit visually overwhelming. 40+ plates described on 40+ single-spaced lines. Take your time, and ask the knowledgeable and friendly wait staff for recommendations. Great atmosphere. Loft-like space. 2 levels of seating. Dim lighting.

"So I am a bit conflicted about giving only three stars here. The Bacon Royale is a good burger. A really, really good burger. Yelpers are not wrong about that. And the onion rings were crispy sweet little buggers. And we walked in right before happy hour ended, so we got awesome half price beers. And we got to sit outside on a pleasant little patio. So far so good, right? Unfortunately, we also had to wait a dog's age for food. It took nearly an hour for three burgers and one order of onion rings, and we were pretty much ignored during that time. I was super hungry, so this did not make me happy. I can understand delays, but it didn't seem particularly crowded, and the staff did absolutely NOTHING to improve the situation. If you're going to make me wait, I can wait, but I appreciate a little something in return, you know? At the very least, you better grovel a bit! Also, we had to move tables when we were initially seated under a leaky air conditioner. Sure, a deliciously juicy, meaty burger with all the fixins goes a long way towards erasing any ill will I might have, but it just isn't enough to make want to trek out to avenue C again. It's a good burger, but unless the inconsiderate service was just a fluke, I can't recommend going out of your way for it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Preface/background: I am now more focused on quality and am always looking for a great deal (read: value). Less meat, no more 2 Chipotle burrito eating. Got the basic burrito aka veggie burrito for $8.25 - I like the rice better than Chipotle's - tastes a little more authentic and not as cilantro-y and lime-y. And their fresh veggies are tastier than Chipotle's too. Got the mild sauce and no cheese or sour cream. Even though I didn't get those ingredients, it still tasted good and I was stuffed. I'd say it's a little more flavorful than Chipotle - the ingredients directed my taste buds to understand what the flavor was trying to be. Whereas Chipotle seems more like a middle school classroom with all flavors of awkward with no real direction. Not that I don't like Chipotle, but I kinda just wanted to make an analogy. I'd come back here. I got lucky and got a seat, but the place seems pretty small so it's a risk. But the table turnover seems pretty quick, because by the time I came in, all the tables were taken, but by the time I got my burrito, a table freed up. I'm getting hungry again...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So this is what real ramen tastes like..... Sorry my red packages of shin ramen, you guys are no longer at the top of my list.  Ippudo is regarded as one of the best spots to get authentic japanese ramen in NYC..... it better be since there's always at least a 2+ hour wait.  We put our name on the list and went to a nearby pool bar to waste some time.  After 2.5 hours, we were finally called to dine in the restaurant. The inside is very nice and modern with japanese flair.  We sit in our round booth and look at the menu,  Pretty straight forward, the menu makes sure ramen is the star.  I ordered the Miso Ramen but spicy with extra braised pork belly.  Service is fast... minutes after you order you're bowl of hot steaming ramen comes to you.  You look down at your plate and you can smell the broth.  Taking my first slurp, i knew this is what Naruto felt like after eating ramen in all those filler episodes.  The broth was infused with porky flavor and spices.... the noodles had fantastic texture and bounce to them.  The chashu pork was tender with the right amount of fat.... the pork belly was just awesome. Ippudo sets the standard for ramen for me in my book.... thank god Dallas is getting a dedicated ramen joint in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is a hole in the wall with a soup kitchen in the dining room--I'm using that term loosely lol. The soups here are good and cheap--for $7 you can get roast duck and noodle soup. The noodles aren't homemade but they're still pretty good. The regular Chinese dishes here are also good but if you want a standard entree like sesame chicken, it costs like $14. Not worth it. The thing that really upset me the last time I was there was that they  automatically added a tip to the bill. I'm pretty sure that's illegal unless you have a party of 10, which we weren't. I wasn't going to argue with them so I just paid the added on tip. I was going to voluntarily tip them more than the service charge they added on but instead, they ended up getting less money. It was weird because I had been there a few times before and they never added a service charge until this time. The food is good but i haven't been back since","[1.0, 0.0]"

The soup base was a little salty, the ramens is ok ( the noodles are a little bit raw) and the meat was a little bit over cook. I think they are more famous for Char Siu Pork than their ramen (so this is like a must order item). The spicy tuna don was delicious, it is a little spicy, with hot rice on the bottom. Overall, the food was ok. What I don't like about this place is that it is really crowded, and they try to rush you out the minute you sit down.

"Thank you yelp! I was under pressure, supposed to book a dinner reservation for a planned outing with colleagues from out of the country, yet at 2 pm I still hadn't told them where we were going. Ofcourse this was coupled with me being bratty and not wanting to go to a place that I'd been to before. No worries, I did a quick search on yelp for a nearby establishment and came across Vitae. The food was delicious and the service was immaculate. No seriously!!!!! My colleagues were thoroughly impressed and loved the food. That's pretty much all that you can ask for when you are the dinner host. To start with I had artichokes and lobster as an appetizer, followed by a whole bass. The Vitae staff does a great job of offering small tasters throughout the meal as well. Clearly they know how to entice me I come back. Smh. I loved everything! My colleague even said, ""I know where to go for dinner when I am next in town"". Amazing. As I sit on the train- while full,happy and prepare to sleep, I am also thinking of when I next will return. By the way, even though I came here for a work dinner, I will definitely return for a social dinner. It was comfortable with the hip background music remaining audible without deafening those in the restaurant. They also made a concerted effort to ask about allergies. This was much appreciated since we had someone with severe allergies in the group. More trout, more lobster, more artichokes please. I'm not often impressed with the full package in midtown east. Wow!","[1.0, 0.0]"
I went to G Lees with a friend and we both agreed that the BBQ is first rate. I  ordered  the dry rub BBQ which was moist and tender - quite enjoyabe to the palate.

"My favorite brunch spot in Manhattan.  I adore this place.  The beer list is incredible if you're a fan of Belgian beers, the wine list is great, the omelettes are to-die-for.  I make it a point to go on weekdays for an early lunch, as weekends can be a bit hectic.  It's an out of the way location for a quiet meal for two.  And the specials are terrific!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's not too often that I will go to the same restaurant twice, but on our recent trip to New York, I discovered Juventino's. We sat outside in their lovely garden and had a lovely brunch. Their menu is very interesting and had a lot of options which I could actually eat, which is not often the case for brunch since I like to be gluten free. I enjoyed the food so much, especially the salad my husband ordered, so when I was looking for somewhere to go two days later with a friend, we went back there and I ordered the same salad and though it was prepared differently, it was still delicious.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Yes, we did you a reservation however since two people (the guess of honor & the person bringing him) wasn't there at the reserved time we could not be seated and our table was giving away.

Whole branzino was a hit and someone got the stripped bass.   The wait staff was attentive and really nice, but really so young. I mean not one of them had ever even heard o the Poseidon Adventure!

"Having been to Thailand, this place is as close as it gets to the real deal. Bold flavors, no pulls punched dishes, and in-your-face spice! The dishes that most exemplify this place are not on the ""regular"" menu. If you ask the staff, they'll hand you a ""Thai"" menu which has some of the more adventurous fare, such as papaya salad with raw crab, jungle curry, and sour soups.

"I absolutely adore this place.  Habana Outpost has a cool, multicultural, diverse, neighborhoody slightly off the grid vibe.  Wow!! This is that place you wish you had in your neighborhood where you can get a drink, an inexpensive meal, listen to some music and catch up with friends.  First of all, the place itself is adorable, painted in bright pastels and hues with a Caribbean favor.You stand in line to order your food (there is a separate line for drinks, bring your receipt to the food truck on the outside deck. Yes, a food truck...this place never stops surprising, grab a seat listen to the live dj's ecletic playlist and wait for the cooks to holler your name for pickup.  I don't think I have seen as diverse a crowd anywhere in New York.  I mean young, old, hipster, preppy, people from the neighborhood, fashionistas and toddlers running around.  It has such an unaffected and authentic community vibe.  IIt's also funky,fun and eco-friendly.The aesthetic of the outdoor space, the artistic renderings (huge colorful murals splashed against exposed bricks walls) and the egalitarian way of ordering makes for an unpretentious but still hip chill spot. And the food?   Very, very tasty. Excellent tacos, burrittos and quesadillas. but you feel equally comfortable just sipping a spiked lemonade, a mojito or grabbing a bucket of beer.  It's only open in the summer so catch the vibe soon before it's gone.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Ok I think I might actually like it better than Ippudo, I know, that's like insane.  I loved this place.  The wait was a bit annoying (30 min Sat. 6pm) but kind of expected since Ippudo have 3 hour lines sometimes. So the place is extremely tiny, they pretty much have bar seats and only a few tables. The pork is amazing! It is fatty but it doesn't make you feel like it's too oily at all, just mouthwatering deliciousness. The broth is also quite good but not overwhelming with salt and fat. Compared to Ippudo, I liked the pork here better and the broth as well.  I also tried their squid skewers which again was amazing.  Very very satisfying all around. Side note, they don't do take out, delivery, or even doggie bags, so only order what you can finish. Very ODD! And cash only, which again, very annoying!   It was also awesome to watch the cute boy work his way around in the kitchen because it is totally open to the bar so you can see everything. =)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What can i say 'Dirty Chinese' cuisine but in the best sense possible.  Hand made noodles & dumplings made to order with flavor and texture you won't find in 4 star restaurants, it just ascertains the fact that the Chinese invented pasta.

A meal for 2 can run anywhere  from $12-$15 whoa! The man making your noodles or dumplings(right in front of you) from scratch turns the experience into music, poetry and performance, the woman serving you barely expects a tip, even their hot sauce is not generic tasting.

My friend said it was my bad luck cuz she had a good dining experience there before.  I would say the food is good, but not for that price.  It's a bit too expensive and hyped up by the Soho area.  Though, they do have a fine selection of wine, again overpriced.  I would say go buy a bottle from Astor Wine and take it to a BYOB place instead.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went here a week or so ago and MAN was I disappointed. I eat thai food everywhere and any where I can find it. And I usually always order the same dish...Basil Chili sautéed sauce with tofu and veggies. So first off the place is sooo small your literally dining with the table next to you and when they have to get up to go to the bathroom or leave...so do you ! I found that extremely uncomfortable and awkward. Now I understand a lot of thai places are small and make do but this was unreasonable. Now for the food part, my boy friend and I placed an order for my dish basil chili, his dish of tofu pad thai and a som tum for us to share. The salad was ok but left much for me to be desired . Next our dishes came .. My dish was as dry as the dessert!! there was no sauce to mix around or put any rice with. Also there was like no basil in the dish, so they basically gave me stir-fried veggies because it was all weird veggies it seemed like they through in what ever they had not the normal bell pepper ect.  So I call the waitress over and she doesn't think they can do anything in the kitchen for it because all the sauces are all premade..... But she goes and asks the chef and came back and said ""ok we can do it but its going to be very salty""...And I just looked at her and was like uhmmmm and I thought in my head so basically your telling me the chef is going to dump a bunch of soy sauce on my meal and call it a day! But I didn't want to make a scene because my poor boyfriend was already crunching down in his seat from all this fuss. So I left my meal sitting there....and they still charged it for us ...End of story being don't waste your time here when there are tons of great thai places in NYC , SKIP AT ALL COSTS!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Love that they have 2 different size pies to choose from. 3 of us opted to order a few of the smaller pies so we could sample more. The classic pie was very good. Not sure I'd call it the best in NY, but it was really good. My favorite was the Speck pie. Basically a regular pie with crispy speck and some shaved parmagiano.  I loved the bite and saltiness of the speck and Parm. We also had a white pie with truffle pâté, mushrooms, prosciutto and a balsamic reduction. Great combo, however I would have preferred some ricotta cheese on there. All in all, top notch nyc pizza. The rave reviews are pretty much on point.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I heard about this place from a somewhat unlikely source, one of my fiance's professors. Apparently he comes here all the time and loves it. Cant say I blame him either. to start we got the red, white, and blue special which, as every one here says, is a great great deal. I don't drink so she got a glass of the white and we shared the oysters which were fresh as can be plump (seriously two were as long as my hand) and briny and just delicious. We also got the angels on horseback because honestly why wouldn't you. If you like oysters and you like bacon you'll like these. And if you don't like oysters or bacon ... get that looked at cause there's something wrong. So yeah that app is raw oysters wrapped in bacon with a cocktail sauce on top. Absolutely divine. The salty bacon with the fresh sweet oyster and the spicy cocktail sauce... it has everything. For the entree I had the fish and chips and a bowl of the lobster bisque. She had a pan roasted snapper with BBQ shrimp and cheddar grits. first the portions are big which is nice. Second the food is top notch which is better. My fish and chips was the best I have had yet. The batter was light and crispy the fish flaky and tender and the tartar sauce was really good. It was sweet and tangy and I think (as does my fiance) that they put a little apple in it to give it the sweet. The fries were also very good. I'm not one to rave about fries, but as far as they go these were nice and crispy outside and smooth and fluffy inside.. so yeah just right. Her Fish was perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned, the grits were great, the shrimp though .. kinda lacked. They were maybe a little over done and their BBQ sauce wasn't that great. But that was the only misstep of the night. Service was great always checking in just to make sure things were okay and clearing as things were finished. Its a bit cramped inside but despite that it was still very comfortable which can't always be said for small restaurants. Will I come back here ... you bet I will and we'll probably get two RWB specials this time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"These guys SAVED me this Sunday. I had a meeting with 10-20 people happening on 43rd when the original location cancelled on me 4 hours before the start time. Bea was on the same block as that spot. When I gave them my sob story they gave me the atrium, closed and reserved for us for the night, no minimum or deposit or anything. They assured me that it wasn't a big deal as it was a slow Sunday night, they don't mind, etc. but really, they did me a huge favor and were really accommodating of all our little requests and arrangements. The servers and the managers I interacted with were all really  lovely, even though we weren't the biggest ticket party they've ever had, I'm sure. On top of that, the food was really, really good! I got the mushroom pizza - it was a delicious vegetarian option (in addition to being one of the cheaper items on the menu). Everyone else was really enjoying their food and drinks as well. They told me that normally there's a 25 person minimum on that atrium, so if you have a party of that size, I'd definitely recommend it - they close the doors and windows so you have a very private space with lovely decor, and apparently you can also arrange to have access to their projector. So yes, sending a big THANK YOU and five stars to Bea!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Decided to try them again because went before a year ago and there was a line.  It was also a Saturday night so I should have expected it, fast forward to now and I was driving down Washington and saw there was no line and a parking spot available so I go in.  Small on the inside, not a big deal to me because I was ordering take out and I already knew I wanted chicken but I have my go to place for jerk chicken so I decided on stew chicken.  Normally I eat stew chicken with white rice, but I got it with peas n rice and green salad.  The lady behind the counter was a dear heart to deal with so big ups to her! :-) She hooked me up with a fulfilling serving of food that was almost not able to close.  I was the only customer at the time and she and I were shooting the breeze she was devine.  Now to the food! Stew chicken was thigh and drumstick and was seasoned well as was the chicken was so tasty and tender.  The gravy was nice and velvety and spot in.  The peas n rice was cooked perfectly and was just so nice and seperated which was a plus.  I didn't think this food would be good, but it was a very great meal and I was pleasantly surprised.  As I was leaving several people started filing in and I was happy to have gotten my food because if there was a line and no parking, I would've kept on to my destination and not have had the opportunity to check this place out.  Thr Islands is solid! Next time will try oxtails and see if it is good as it looks.  ""~""","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pure Thai Cookhouse has quickly become one of my favorite Hell's Kitchen Thai spots. It can get fairly crowded and I'm impatient so I usually opt for take-out, but the food is just as good and stays warm for the short journey to my apartment and they're good about making sure to package toppings and sauces separately so that nothing gets soggy. The Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Noodles are amazing! I always have them dry with the egg noodles. This is their claim to fame and the reason I keep coming back! The noodles have an incredible consistency and unlike lots of other types of noodles, this one doesn't leave you feeling bloated and doesn't rely on oil to be delicious. Also really enjoy the Steamed Fresh Roll appetizer. The Roasted Baby Back Ribs have a bit too much sauce for my taste and although the Nakorn-Patom Duck Noodles are good, they pale in comparison to the crab and pork noodles. I'll be back for more egg noodles!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had really high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately it wasn't up to par. Little Owl is a cute place; small and cramped, but it wouldn't be a hidden gem if it wasn't. I called two days ahead to make reservations for a party of 4 and was told they were already booked for that night (a wednesday) but i could try getting a walk-in table if I came by early to leave my number. I walked in with my sister at around 6:45 and the Host was so nice! He told us that a big table was currently paying their bill and the next reservation for that table is 8:30 so he jokingly said that he would give us the table if we ate fast! A hour and a half is more than enough time to eat for the party I was dinning with. (Including the time it took for the food to be brought to our table, it took us about a hour to finish!) Now the reason I say this restaurant wasn't up to par is because my expecations were not met. The four of us ordered different things, I ordered the pork chop that includes butter beans, and although it was good, I was not a fan of the beans. Maybe it's the asian side of me speaking, but I would have preferred some sort of carbs like rice haha. Unfortunately I was the only one out of my group who enjoyed the food. My sister ordered the NY Strip Steak and was disappointed, my cousin ordered the lamb chops and the presentation was meh and it was too gamey for my taste, and my other cousin ordered the monk fish with spinach risotto, a special for that day, and in my opinion, the worst of all. The fish itself was lackluster and the risotto was undercooked and watery! When she was done, there was a huge pool of green water at the bottom of her plate. The next day she shot me a text saying how she was disgusted because the fish was hideous! (Search up monk fish and you wouldn't want to go near it, let alone eat it!) I'm giving Little Owl 3 stars because of the fries that we made an appetizer was delicious and the service was great! The pork chop is a must have if you decide to give this place a try!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The spicy chicken empanada deserves 6 stars. I wont waste my time describing the emapanadas; they are simply the best in New York. The spicy chicken is a personal favorite. The restaurant is tiny and the service slow. I've dined in the restaurant and have called in to pick up food. Dining here dangerous. As in, ass in your face or a  bruise on the side of your head that's shaped like an elbow. They've packed this place with too many tables and have neglected to come up with a system for the pick ups. The other day, I called them to order a few empanadas while still in Astoria. I was put on hold for a bit but was able to successfully place my order --eventually. I was told that my order would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes. After the call I got on the train and made my way to the restaurant. After 25 minutes I finally got there. It was lunch time and the place was overflowing with people. Determined to get my empanadas I braced myself and went to the counter where I paid for my stuff and got a ticket. I then awkwardly stood among other people also waiting for their take out. After a while there was too many of us blocking the only walkway in the restaurant that was about 3 feet wide. We were then told to wait outside. We wished each other good luck as we got our orders. My order took another 45 minutes from the time I go to restaurant. Yes folks it takes over an hour. After over an hour of waiting I left still excited about my empanadas. I would definitely come back for empanadas. Maybe at 3 in the morning if I can stay up that late, they are open 24 hours. I would, however never dine in again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food is nice but beware if you pay with your credit/debit card. They overcharge you with the tip. I had a very nice brunch over there and happy with service and food. However, I paid for the bill with my debit card and tipped them more than 15%. That night I checked my bank statement and realized that they overcharge me! The amount that is overcharged is not much (about a dollar extra) but it is not nice to get this kind of advantage over customer. Imagine that if they usually do something like this with a lot of customer? So they will end up by getting extra tip (small amount from many customer can combine to a lot of money) and no one want to waste his time to complain with this problem. So I recommend to carefully check you bill or pay them with cash.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm not a big fan of thin sliced pizzas, but I have to admit, Lombardi's has made me a fan. We were there Halloween night so we got a table quick. Everyone was out at the parade,lucky us. We just went with a simple pizza with pepperoni and sausage. We also got a white pizza with meatballs. The regular pizza was delicious and the toppings were soo flavorful. I didn't like the white pizza much.  There was so much ricotta cheese it really killed it. The meatball toppings were good though. Overall, it was okay and im a new fan of thin sliced pizzas. I don't think it would be worth the wait though. There was only 1 server for a packed house. Suprisingly, she did a pretty good job. Busboys are cleaning up your table quick to get you out.

"Best sandwiches ever!  I've tried almost every type of sandwich they have, but hands down, the pork belly is absolutely heavenly.  The bread is always perfectly toasted (not too soft, not too crispy and never soggy) and the mix of condiments is an explosion of flavor in your mouth. I usually grab one of these bad boys with a can of coconut juice and head over to Union Square or Washington Square Park so that everyone can see me bask in the glory of pork belly and cilantro.  If it's cold out, I'll hang out in the upstairs dining room and enjoy some old Wu-Tang and Nas tracks with my lunch, since they only play 90's hip hop (bonus points for that). As other reviewers have mentioned, the sandwiches are not large.  If you like to feel really full after a meal, one sandwich will probably not cut it for you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pleasant addition to the UES.  Clean bar going for (and succeeding in) a Southern, hipster feel.  Could easily think you're in Williamsburg and the UES (but you don't).  The music was loud (a lot of The Grateful Dead, Rusted Root, Mumford &Sons, etc., etc.).  Lots of craft beer, a long whiskey menu, and a cask beer option.  I tried and enjoyed The Figgy Tonic, a spiced rum tonic (and as someone else, mentioned, the cocktails are STRONG!).  IPA fries hit the spot (they're infused with thyme).  The pulled pork sandwich special was good, though I prefer my pulled pork more shredded than in chunks.  Cole slaw was fresh.  Overall, we enjoyed the place.   Something to know: the servers bring food from the kitchen and pick up empty plates and glasses but otherwise there's no table service and you have to order everything at the bar.  Not a huge deal.  I guess it allows you to sit for a while without being bothered which is nice. My only complaint was that they kept taking the menus from us to give to other patrons as they trickled in--but it wasn't crowded and there clearly were at least a few empty seats if not talbes.  IMO, this isn't the best business practice, especially when you're clearly not overcrowded and you don't have servers attending tables to keep you buying another round.  Maybe they just didn't print enough menus, but in the future it'd be great for them to have more menus to leave with customers so they can keep perusing and trying different drinks or food options.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"No no no! A tourist trap at its worse. I took my husband there when he just moved to NY to show him the true new york place. I remembered Grimadi's from ten years ago, back when they had only one floor. Our pizza was unbelievably salty and almost impossible to eat. We asked for olives and they put too much which definitely added to saltiness and screwed the whole taste - we had to manually remove the olives to get it to a manageable and palatable level. But what really got me was the host - the old Italian men is undeniably and unbelievably rude to the customers. I understand that you got the name and all but there are some borderline of decency you should not cross. He was really not accommodating about our table preferences :-( On top of it, I just really hate place that dont take credit cards - it always ticks me off a bit.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After trying a few other pizzas in Brooklyn I decided to try Lombardi's. I wasn't expecting too much as I already knew it was more tourist-oriented than most and was not the best. An early plus is that it is easy to get to, a short walk away from the subway. The service is friendly, it didn't seem that busy but we were taken through the kitchen to a back room (nice to see the coal burning oven). After ordering the pizza was delivered very quickly, probably within ten minutes of arriving. We ordered a large Margherita with no toppings. Overall I can't say that it wasn't good, compared to what you are going to get in most of the country it is great. But the crust is a bit too thick in my opinion, the sauce doesn't blow you away, and neither does the cheese. The basil is applied sparingly here, not like Di Fara where there are full leaves on the pie. The char you would expect from a quick bake in a coal oven is not really there; you can taste the char a bit but not too much. Overall it's just a good pie. It tastes good but nothing blows you away. Now if you came to New York and had never had anything but chain pizza you'd think this was god-like. But all it takes is a trip to various other places in the city to find much better pizza. I guess if you're a pizza fan you have to come here once, although the history doesn't have much of a presence either, considering this isn't the original location. In conclusion it's a good pizza, just overshadowed by places like Motorino or Di Fara.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Except halal is an experience, lol. the flat rice noodles or ""chow hoh fun"", was mediocre at best.  it looked like the soy sauce that covered each strand of noodle made it look flavorful, but false. the spicy salted pork chops were probably the best, but not the best I've had.  you could tell the oil was a little off. the service: lackluster at best.  like some canto chinatown restaurant, they give you that ""pay up, or we'll kick you outta here!"" stare, as you just receive your food. ............Mehhhhhhhhhh.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great little spot in Hell's Kitchen. Food is tasty without also being super expensive. As a new resident in town, this was one of the first good finds.

Small space but the staff was very gracious and patient. However, WARNING: Do not order the sangria. $8.50 for a fairly bad product. The food made up for it though.

Deserves more than 3 stars because the cons were bearable for the most part. If you do decide to go, don't go just for the drinks. You can find a more comfortable bar in the area.

The dips are interesting but I am not a fan of ""crazy/unusual"" stuff, so I still prefer the old ketchup concept (call me old fashion). After I had 1 small thing of french fries I felt heavy and swore french fries off my diet. But I had to experience this place at least once, and I did it!

"I have never posted on here but frequent this site for advice. I am writing in regards to artichoke in the meat packing / Chelsea area on 10th though I have been to other locations. Six of us bought a few slices and were eating them outside. A random person that appeared very shady started yelling and screaming at us that we were in the way and blocking the side walk. We were just standing eating pizza not doing anything. We were very skeptical that he did not in fact work there. We asked him to get the manager. He went inside and a guy in a black suit came out. He stuck up for the shady man and told us to quick causing a scene. The shady guy started yelling that he placed his private parts on the pizza we were eating. He then said that he was going make a call to have us "" eliminated"" and "" taken care of"". He proceeded to get on the phone, give his whereabouts and a description of us. We walked away, very confused. As we were leaving we walked back inside just to say that as a paying customer we felt that they were being inappropriate. The manager stated that the "" shady guy "" didn't actually work there but they were trying not to cause a scene. Instead of sticking up for paying customers the management took the side of a very sketchy man whom was yelling that he wanted to ""eliminate us"" and "" placed his private parts"" on our pizza.

"Our office typically orders out on Friday's for lunch. Given what we have learned from Bubby's in the past about how slow their delivery is, we decided to order for pick up. We called around noon today, placed our order and were told it would be ready by 12:45. Once we arrived at 12:45 or food wasn't finished, apparently. We then waited for an hour inside the restaurant until it was almost 2 hours since we initially placed our order. Not only are the prices ridiculous for mediocre food (our fault we know, but they do have a decent chicken sandwich though!) but after waiting almost 2 hours our food finally came out, no apology offered and not even a thank you for waiting that long for a $200 order. Regardless, our entire office was starving so we rushed back to eat our food only to find everything was cold. Our soups, our sandwichs, our fries... Everything. Oh, they also forgot to include all the additional sides we ordered too. Needless to say, we should've learned the first time. Once bad food, always bad food.

"We walked into Barbuto on a Sunday afternoon to grab a bite to eat before going to a memorial service. So, we weren't looking for a dining experience, but rather something to eat. On our way to the church, we saw Barbuto, and walked in based on the menu and seeing empty tables. It didn't hit me that we had walked into a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef, until I looked over and say Jonathan Waxman's books. I am glad that I hadn't known because I would have thought the place would have been too extravagant for a simple meal. So our accidental encounter with Barbuto turned into a great dining experience. The food was great, the atmosphere felt upscale but casual, and the sunny room was cheering. We didn't have to wait when we arrived at 1pm, which was crucial for our plans.

"Horrible experience last night. We were excited to try Public for quite some time now, but were quite disappointed with the service and rudeness we experienced with one of the servers. It took an extra long time for my entree to come out, when the fish finally got there the crust was soggy, left a horrible taste in our mouths, and was COLD. We notified a different waiter that it needed to be remade, but then quickly changed our mind and asked him to not re-make the dish at all. We were done. Our waitress never came back regarding the incident. Before the check, I pulled her aside to let her know that the fish was cold and soggy since she never came by, however the waitress got defensive and started saying ""well the fish here is served medium-rare"" implying a level of unsophistication... Excuse me, I eat fish multiple times per week in many restaurants, and medium-rare is my preferred temperature. Never have I had a cold soggy fish or a waitress to argue with me about it. Aside from that, ambiance and appetizers were great, but the fish is all I remember.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Hmm is that Wolverine doing it with Pocahontas in the corner? I think I see what they're going for with all the off-beat designs, but I'm not sure what to make of it. In the end, it still comes down to the food. And the food was good. But I think I was expecting to be wow'd..and I should probably never do that in general, in life. We got the potato chip nachos, which tasted the way you'd expect potato chips to taste after being covered in cheese and pork fat -- like you just undid 3 hours of cardio exercise that you failed to do in the first place. I got a pork belly cube with spicy cabbage on the side. Both tasted really Asian. The pork tasted like something my grandma used to make, and the cabbage reminded me of the complimentary kim chee appetizers at Korean restaurants. I tried Elsie W's bone marrow and brisket burger and seasoned potatoes that were disguised as fries. It was really hearty and delicious, but I didn't really taste the bone marrow or brisket. Another hungry friend received 3 scallops for her meal, 1 of which we ate, leaving her with only 2. For dessert, we shared a bacon ice cream with a piece of chocolate covered bacon on top. It tasted like vanilla ice cream. But instead of bacon, there were ice crystals inside. The chocolate covered smoky bacon was a bit too much for my mouth and I accidentally said, ""oooh I don't think I like bacon..."" just as the waiter passed. He was not amused.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of night, short of breath, cursing 'why why why can't I be in Manhattan right now' to have a plate full of heaven. It just doesn't taste as good in my dreams... I need the real thing. I need to be there. If i had more (or any) money, I would fly to NYC now and march to this truck. Of all the places I have tried in Manhattan, all the glamorous and ritzy fine dining, all the traditional and authentic Japanese sushi, all the desserts and snack specialty spots, nothing compared to the animalistic guilty pleasure that is devouring a plate of lamb and chicken with the amazing white sauce. This begs a philosophical question: why is dining civilized? Why do we dress up in fancy clothes and eat neatly crafted yet fulfilling food? Why do we pay so much money for meals some writer recommended in a travel magazine? To eat is to survive, so why doll it up in some aesthetic experience that at times, compromises pure taste? If the greatest tasting food came in ugly clumps, plopped onto a tinfoil tray, served on a corner next to a Hilton hotel, would you care? If it's lack of artistic qualities fails to be presentable for your painstakingly created tumblr blog, would it affect it's taste for you? If you didn't have to dress up, pick up your date from her house, and be served by a fancy waiter with a bottle of champagne tucked under arm, would the food not be worthwhile for you? Taste comes before all in food. Think of the other senses as marketing ploys that draw you to the food, but always remember what is most important. Eat here.

I love the fact that they have a large bar thats complimented with a dance area in the back which is great when you're drunk and feel like dancing.

The DJ plays great music, pop, hip-hop and R&B mostly new stuff, but he likes to mix in some great old school. Last but not least, I know most people don't mind, however I absolutely love how the lights are dimmed down in this place.

"This place actually serves Japanese food in LARGE portions and very affordable prices. That's the yakisoba, it's for at least 2 people. The food comes and is cleared away by attentive staff. Since I tend to order a lot of food, what happens is that the table gets quickly cluttered when all of it arrives at once. I would suggest that you keep a menu on hand and then order a little at a time. That way you can eat at a more leisurely pace and chill out. They recently re-did the bathrooms and the men's room is nice and clean. Also nice is that they will take your phone number and call you when your table is free, so you can go wander the area a bit.

"I've wanted to try this place for a while and finally was able to have lunch there yesterday.  Absolutely delicious! The restaurant is small, rustic and perfectly cozy for a cold day. I started with the squash and apple soup (a special) which was so thick and creamy and amazing. It was a large portion and definitely filled me up. My brother had the pasta fagiole soup which looked hearty and was served with a wonderful piece of garlic toast. We then split a slice of the vodka pizza which was thin crust and just really fresh tasting. Perfection. I then had the octopus salad which was a nicoise type salad with grilled octopus, olives and potatoes - very good.  My brother had the chicken francaise panini which was decadent to say the least.  It's very rich but the field greens salad that's served with it is a nice balance.  We were so full that we didn't save room for dessert.

I got the nutella french toast and I'm pretty sure it's the best thing I have ever had. The bananas on top complemented the nutella perfectly.

"This past Saturday was my first time dining at Swine. Chances are, I'll never go back. It's my belief that most of the people on Yelp who are leaving 5 star reviews and typing in CAPS and exclamations(!!!) about how ""AMAZING"" the food is, must be employed at Swine or somehow affiliated with it. First things first... nothing was ""AMAZING"". I didn't leave satisfied. If the price point was lower, then possibly it would have been justified, but not in this case. I got the Prawn Salad, which is listed as the Poached Maine Lobster Salad on their online menu (same ingredients: radish, artichoke, grapefruit, vinaigrette, etc... price remains the same tho... no price cut for replacing a more expensive crustacean with it's cheaper, more abundant cousin.). The printed menu at the restaurant have this listed as the Prawn Salad. The ""prawns"" were regular, nothing special, shrimp that were not even deveined and tasted like they were frozen beforehand. This is misleading. There is an obvious difference between a Prawn and a Shrimp in the context of a meal (I understand from a marketing perspective that ""prawn"" makes the dish sound slightly more exotic than ""shrimp"" and it's debatable what is a prawn vs. a shrimp, but it's common knowledge that a prawn is larger than a standard sized shrimp you would get in an order of shrimp cocktail). We started off with the Bread and Butter and Spicy pickles. That's what they were. No need to rave about them. They were good. They were pickles. Nothing too complicated. The Deviled Eggs were ok but I've had much better. The yokes were bland and the egg whites were over done and too mushy. A friend of mine got the Bone Marrow and Brisket Burger. I didn't try it but she was happy. I did try some of her potato wedges that were served as a side dish and they were waaayyyyy too greasy. Waaayyyyyy too greasy. Another friend of ours got the Grilled Cheese. When asked what he thought of it, his response was, ""...... yeahhh, it's good"". Another guest of ours jokingly, but not jokingly, asked if he could get his money back. The menu was too adventurous for the average person. Yes, Swine is in the West Village and in a hip setting, but the menu will end up being their demise. Some of items were too ridiculous (Duck Fat Cashews, Potato Chip Nachos.... why??) It's almost like their head chef needs to turn off Chopped and come down to reality. I guess if you're a young professional with cash to blow on an overpriced, mediocre meal to tout your ""Foodie"" street cred to your date, then this is the place to go. I highly doubt this place will be around for long. Overpriced, ""Foodie"" versions of traditional meals like this are a poor business venture because people will usually opt for the cheaper, real version from somewhere more traditional and well-known instead of something the Food Network would try to sell them. I highly doubt this place has any repeat customers.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The chicken biscuit was an amazing combination of sweet, spicy and savory.  Jesus.   Fried chicken in a biscuit - with honey and a lil kick. It's as good as it sounds.   The black eyed pea salad was surprisingly good (not a huge fan of those) and the grits were OK.  I'm a southerner and think those grits could come up a few notches on the yum scale.   Only real bummer was that the brunch menu didn't have mac n cheese or collard greens  that they usually have, which are two of my favorite Southern staples.  Guess that just means I will have to go back. If you need some space when you eat this may not be the place for you.  It's often packed - which you means you will be very close to your dining neighbors.   But the wait and lack of space will totally disappear when you are high on FRIED CHICKEN!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went to Marc Forgione last night and i LOVED it. I love restaurants and rely on yelp-ers to guide me in the right direction. But this is the first restaurant that compelled me to write a review. The place is a really good size 1/3 dedicated to the bar area and the rest to the dining + outdoor seating. The place is nice, comfortable & well designed; love the wood & openness of the space. I started at the bar with a white sangria with blackberries & raspberries - refreshing and not too sweet. Then moved to a table and our waitress was attentive but not overbearing and very friendly. I ordered the bacon wrapped pork chop with   onions and a potato puree (with a bit of wasabi). AH-MAZING; meat was cooked perfectly and the onions gave it a delicious accent flavor. My date had the steak with red wine & peppercorn sauce - the sauce was the perfect compliment to the steak. Again perfectly cooked flavorful and so delicious.  For dessert I had the ""peaches & cream"" which was sort of a deconstructed peach tart - not so great.  But the banana dessert was really good!

The desserts....Oh my goodness. Just the best desserts ever! The lemon meringue (which they sent our complementary) which would never have interested any of us we devoured happily. The chocolate cake, cheesecake, and bread pudding were unbelievable. Our table of 5 devoured each dessert. Truly some of the best dessert any of us had ever enjoyed.  The coffee was exceptional.

I know it's called the ""meatball"" shop, but I was impressed by the fresh local greens. The chicken and beef meatballs are tasty. I liked the spicy pork, but didn't love it. It wasn't as flavorful as the others. Downside is the small space, long waits and voices carry so It can get super loud. In warm weather, you can just get take out and sit in the park.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"To say it at the start, Crescent Grill is, without a doubt, a gem.  I believe it easily serves the most high quality, delicious, diverse cuisine in all of Queens.   I have eaten at some of the finest dining establishments in the entire world and can honestly say that Crescent Grill can compete at an elite level.  Chef Shaun Dougherty is a master.  Every dish I or my fellow diners have had has been cooked to absolute perfection and garnished with the most appropriate, locally-produced, savory sides.   I do not say this lightly - CRESCENT GRILL'S NEW YORK STRIP DONE MEDIUM RARE MIGHT BE THE ABSOLUTE BEST STEAK I HAVE CONSUMED IN MY LIFE. As if that were not enough, the Crescent Grill's vibe is completely refreshing.  It is never overcrowded and the management and staff (Daniel Dougherty, the owner, in particular) exquisitely balance genuine, friendly attitudes with the certain seriousness required for nothing-short-of-excellent customer service.   I am so lucky to live down the block, but I cannot encourage people to put in the effort to visit Crescent Grill enough.  It is just a 10 minute walk or so from Queensboro Plaza subway and it is more than worth it.   A lovely benefit of Crescent Grill's location comes in the form of reasonable, dare I say comparatively inexpensive, prices.  I would estimate the restaurant could markup its prices about 1.5x if it were located in Manhattan. Go to Crescent Grill and experience this all for yourself.  Tell them Keira sent you ;)","[0.0, 1.0]"

I can't think of any better way to spend a $6 meal than this joint's chicken and lamb combo with rice, pita and lettus.  The white sauce is a must and you should go easy on the hot sauce (unless you like feeling miserable).   This combo has your proteins, carbs and vegetables so you feel like you had a balanced meal (though i'm not sure if i really want to know the nutrition facts).  This is an unforgettable dish.  I enjoyed every bite till the end.  If you are visiting NYC, this is a must visit for a late night.  If you are in NYC and you never had it, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?  Since they are open till 4AM, call up few friends and let's get moving.   Few tips: Though the line is always long, don't be discouraged.  It moves fairly quickly.  Bring your own drinks since they don't sell any unless you wanna buy it from the cart 70 feet from this halal cart.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My sister lives on Long Island and I was visiting her from Pittsburgh - we were going to a Sunday evening show on Broadway but needed to find some grub first. So we were walking down restaurant row looking for something interesting to eat pre-theater. I kept stopping to glance at menus, but for whatever reason she kept on walking. Finally at one point she turned around and gave me a look that only sisters can give one another (the ""what the hell are you doing, get your butt moving"" look) and I started yelling down the street at her the way only sisters can do (""I'm looking at the menus! How the F are you going to know where to eat if you don't look at menus???"") - well, fortunately for us, we were having this exchange right in front of the Hourglass Tavern. Their host happened to be standing outside to witness this sisterly love and pulled us aside to try to coerce us to come in. Now, let me tell you, I do not like when people do that - I hate being put on the spot.  It was a really, really hard sell and that almost made me tell him to shove it you-know-where and walk away. BUT he was charming and the other staffers hanging out outside were really nice (later I found out one was the former owner and the other was the current owner - they were having a baklava lesson!), so after perusing the menu for a few minutes we decided to go in. Fantastic decision. The menu is large and varied and uses the word ""snacklettes"" which I love! We went with the Prix-Fixe menu - so we got homemade bread, a spanikopita, a salad, an entree and a dessert. She got the mascarpone penne. I got the shrimp catalina. Both were excellent. The bread was excellent. The salad was phenomenal. The spanikopita was really, really good (and I generally do not like spanikopita that much).  I had tiramisu for dessert and it was wonderful. My sister had the cobbler and she said it was very tasty. The Hourglass Tavern is definitely on my list of places to visit again next time I'm in the city. It was delightful.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Chela & Garnacha is a perfect addition to 36 ave! Not to knock other small Astoria businesses, but if you're still going to Arepa Cafe (next door), you're doing it wrong. The tacos, specifically the tinga and al pastor are my favorite, but you should try them all. Super tasty and fresh ingredients, paired with different salsas of all heat levels. Not sure if tortillas are made in-house, but they are perfect size and softness for the amount of meat served on them. When they offer you crispy cheese for your tacos, say yes, you won't regret it. As for the other menu items, I've tried the ceviche + intrincadas, all delicious and fresh. Tacos are definitely the star of the menu, curious to see how it will expand once they incorporate brunch and lunch later in the year. I would've given this place 5 stars if they opened with their beer + liquor license, hopefully I'll see micheladas on the menu soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I accidentally stumbled upon this place late on valentines day. My bf at the time didn't even want to go inside, he said it reminded him of a nursing-home. I guess it was because most couples there were over 50 w/a few exceptions. I dragged him anyway. He was right in a sense, there is nothing glam, trendy or pretentious about this establishment. Instead, it is an old-fashioned french classic, warm, cozy and welcoming. We both walked out most impressed. Food is fantastic, regardless of your preference. It's been 7 years and I don't think I've ever had a bad meal. The owner/manager always greets us with a smile. I tend to see familiar faces every time I'm there and staff has not changed much, that says a lot about the way they run their business. Good bartender as well. Some of my favorites are; monk fish, mushroom or carrot/ginger soup, lobster risotto, tuna steak and seared scallops. The flour-less chocolate cake w/hazelnut ice cream takes about 20min but totally worth it. One of my favorite restaurants. I will continue coming here with my family and friends.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Server said they do seafood well, but this was lackluster...didn't taste all that fresh. 5) Squid Ink Paella: skip. Bland and boring. Seafood was overcooked.

A bit too much game for my taste, but I can imagine a goat cheese fan appreciating it more. 7) Sangria and any of their cocktails pack a punch: good and strong. Get the Sangria.

"Before coming here, I read all the reviews and wondered if it was really that bad. It actually made me very hesitant to come try it out BUT in the end I am glad I did. We arrived Saturday night and put our name down with the hostess. We were told that the wait was about 35 minutes, so we went to the bar at the mid level. The bar was well stocked and had a great selection of beers on tap and bottle. The bartenders were plenty busy which is to be expected on a gorgeous Saturday night. She was quick to get our order (got two draft beers) for $11 bucks. Not too expensive. Before you know it, we were walked upstairs to our seat (ended up being a 25 minute wait). Our waiter was super friendly and explained how everything worked. My girlfriend and I ended up ordering the mussels (they were small but cooked well-spicy) as an appetizer and we shared the Southern Steam Pot (Blue Crabs, Shrimp, Andouille Sausage, Red Potatoes & Corn on the Cob in Old Bay). The crabs were super juicy and sweet. We both had an excellent meal. After we were full, we walked around on the Red Hook Pier and went food shopping at Fairway (Best Supermarket ever!)

"I watched this show on Food Network that tested if one's environment has an effect on how food tastes.  It proved to be true...food can taste better or worse depending on factors that have nothing to do with the quality of the meal itself.  Perhaps that is what happened with this particular experience?   Since all of our party wasn't there, we ordered it to go.  We walked a bit down to this area where you can get a great view of the cityscape, but we sort of had to eat it on a bench and the pizza had cooled some.  It was alright.  It was similar in style to Lombardi's, except the bread is much softer.  Lombardi's is kind of crispy.  We got the pepperoni and mushroom.   Honestly, I think it's good but not mind-blowing.  Maybe it's because I had to squat while eating it in the dark.  I dunno.  Either way, I would go to Lombardi's over Grimaldis ANY DAY.  Lombardi's - we didn't have to wait to be seated.  Grimaldis - 1.5 hour wait. OH.  I would suggest eating here first and then walking the Brooklyn Bridge.  The view is much more beautiful since you're walking towards the city, not away from it.  Also you can sort of walk off what you ate.  But it's been 4 hours and I'm still not digested.  I did stuff my face I won't lie.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The family style dishes are more than generous.  Started out with 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and ended with the Titanic dessert.  Overall all, I give a A for the service (waiters saw we were thirsty and provided us with a pitcher of water), B for the environment (floor to the restrooms were slippery) and a B for the food (tasty, but nothing memorable).  Food coma.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I really don't want to dock Station House a star, but my last visit was a bit disappointing and not up to the high standards I've experienced numerous times before.  Perhaps I set myself up for disappointment by thinking all day about a few beers and the delicious duck confit pot pie, but alas, they were out of that item for the day.   Things like that happen, and while I was excited for it, there are other things to be excited for on the menu, so I ordered the chili; a few minutes later, the server comes back and informs us that they are out of that as well.  Ok...how about the soup of the day?  Nope, out of that as well, which was especially strange because it was a daily special and it was only about 6:30PM. While I was disappointed with the fact that they were out of several items I wanted to order, I was more disappointed with the way in which it was handled.  The server took at least five minutes each time to come back to the table and tell us that the kitchen was not able to produce that item, and only after the third time it happened, did she come back and list everything that they were not able to make with no hint of apology in her voice.  I will certainly continue to come back on a regular basis, but if incidents like this continue and the service continues to be poor, I may be forced to reconsider.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Osteria Morini was highly recommended by a foodie of mine. I needed a Christmas Eve dinner ASAP and Osteria was the first to come to mind and surprisingly available on that night. On a cold X-mas Eve night we were greeted by a warm host and quickly showed to our table for 2. I've heard great things about their pasta dishes and didn't think twice about what to order. For appetizers we went with the Polpettine ( prosciutto & mortadella meatballs baked in tomato sauce) and the Sformato ( parmigiano-truffle custard wild mushroom sugo ). Both were super yummy!!  The intense flavor of the truffles went hand in hand with the custard and mushrooms. Sformato didn't look like anything special, just 4-5 medium sized pork meatballs and on top covered in tomato sauce and cheese. But sooo tender Entrees: CASONCELLI ( squid ink ravioli, shrimp, scallop, passata, calamari, white wine ) and GARGANELLI ( pasta quills, cream, radicchio, truffle butter, prosciutto ). Small portions YES, but what lacked in quantity was easily defeated by its taste and quality. If I have to give  a simple tip: ::You can try the fish and the meat dishes but if you can please try any of their pasta dishes. You won't regret it. Service was friendly and very attentive to your needs ( the way it should be ). Our server took his time to recommend us some wines and gave us plenty of time to choose.

The food for appetizers my had the seared sea scallops - very good though only one side was seared, and I had the tuna susci - excellent melted in my mouth. For entrees my wife and I had the special white truffles with tagliatelle the cost was worth it ( $85 per plate ) that is the first time the entree was more then the liquor bill. Anyway I highly recommend the restaurant great food, service and decor.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Absolutely amazing! The pork belly buns, squid, and ramen were out of this world. All the servers work as a team so you don't have to wait around for your own waitress/waiter to receive service. If the menu is confusing, they will explain everything to you in a clear manner because the servers are very well trained and know everything on the menu. This restaurant is immaculate all around, including the restrooms and decor is great. Only negative thing I'd add is that there's a bit of a wait (and you cannot make reservations) but the food is very much worth it. Stop reading and just make your way there NOW!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This really is a small wonder. The croque monsieur is absolutely delicious! As is the Mediterranean salad that it comes with. The staff are very personable and helpful - both times I went I was alone and they couldn't have made me feel more comfortable. Only negative for me was that although it could be the perfect place to spend a day working, there's no wi-fi... A real shame. The place itself is an absolute delight - it feels a little like sitting in a secret greenhouse, that may or may not be the gateway to Narnia. It's higgeldy-piggeldy, hard to find (persevere!), welcoming, cozy and - when I was there at least - quiet. Find it before everyone else does!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Don't listen to negative reviews on the quality of the food. All burger meat is ground on site.  This is the freshest slider you may ever have.  Guinness Shake is top notch and, if you're feeling adventurous, the Candied Bacon shake kicks butt. Fries are great as well.  Try them with chili and/or cheese. For the most part, service has always been good (and I go there A LOT).  If you have a problem with a waitress or a server, tell a manager or a supervisor.  This is not how MarkBurger typically is. And in response to the ""wait time"" for these burgers... if you want something fast, go to McDonald's.  Quality takes time.  And 10 minutes is not absurdly long.

"It had been years since my previous visit to Public for its succulent and unusual Grilled Kangaroo On A Coriander Falafel.  I did not recall loving this zany starter, but I did remember loving a prawn entree, as well as the sexy atmosphere.  I recently had a colleague in from out of town and thought it would be a great place for her to really experience the Manhattan ""scene"". We were shockingly able to snag a same-day reservation and walked over from our neighboring office.  She was immediately in awe of the elegant decor and trendy crowd.  We were quickly taken to a cramped table, but managed to experience very helpful service during our uncomfortable stay.  We chose a white wine from their ""Unique Whites"" list that we had never even heard of - a 2010 Stadlmann ""Tagelsteiner"" Rotgipfler from out of Thermenregion, Austria.  Its accompanying description (""red apple and green pear scented wine which also shows herbal spices and creamy texture"") had been intriguing and spot-on.   For starters, we enjoyed the a smooth and creamy Rabbit Rilette, which was served with buttery toast.  We also sampled the Marinated White Anchovies, which were delicious themselves, but the quinoa croquettes that they were served upon were pretty dry and crumbly.  For entrees, we loved our plates of Salmon and Venison. After seeing the menu for and pictures of the Public brunch, I will definitely plan on heading there on a weekend afternoon next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'd note it's not cheap... but it's also not the crazy tourist trap I would have expected.  I'd go back, but after I get around to the other top notch NYC pizzerias on my list to try...","[1.0, 0.0]"

The salads were fresh and not overly dressed.   I had the scallop and shrimp risotto which was FULL of shellfish and very delicious.  Wished we had saved room for dessert which looked great.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I walked into this place Saturday night around 7pm without a reservation and was able to be sat within 10 minutes. I found this place after walking around little italy while my parents were in town. The hostess was very helpful. She even told me when we walked in exactly what the situation was for getting a table. She told me that she had one table that was eating desert and another table had asked to look at the menus and depending on that we would be next for those tables. I appreciated her honesty and realistic estimation of time based on these facts. As a Server in the industry I appreciate honesty for something like that instead of just a random time with no understanding behind that time estimate. Once we were sat we ordered tap water and my mother ordered a bottle of the Garlider Sudtirol Eisacktaler Gruner Veltliner 2008. Very dry finish, minerally, and clean. We started with the Chef's choice of Salumi and formaggi. It was exactly that. 3 italian meats and 3 cheeses, Although the food runner said the different things on the platter and ran off again so quickly that I did not get the names of all of them, which I would have liked to know! Then I had the Parpadelle Special with Lamb and I am unsure of the sauce, but It was amazing! My father had the mustard green and ricotta ravioli with walnut sauce. (also very delish) and my mother had the Setaro Mezzi Rigatoni alla Gricia guanciale, sweet onion, pecorino, black pepper (she loved it, I tried it and however not something i would have ordered or even liked to be honest). We finished our meal with a tiramisu to share, cappuccino, latte, and a coffee cordial that I cannot remember what it was called. The tiramisu was ok, but not spectacular like the rest of the meal had been. The service was excellent from the moment we entered until the moment we left. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and come back to try other options on the menu. Oh! and please NOTE! the pasta noodles are all made in house from organic eggs! AMAZING!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I remembered a friend of mine raving about the razor clams from Casa Mono, saying if I ever went there I had to order them. And I did. The plate was playfully presented, the clams arranged like Jenga tiles. The ""mantle"", or fleshy part, was of course the more tender and flavorful. The 'a la plancha' technique added nice caramelization, but I found parts of the ""foot"" to be rubbery. Good use of garlic, herbs and finishing oil to brighten the dish. The Atlantic Calamares with Harissa and Squid Ink was definitely Iron Chef-worthy.  The electric orange harissa oil contrasted sharply against the black squid ink backdrop. The calamari which came in two different preparations was perfectly grilled and fried. Smokiness and heat from the chilis played well with delicate flavor of squid and not overpoweringly so. Sweetbreads are best when fried and usually just with a dusting of flour.  To my surprise the Sweetbreads with Fennel Al Mono were done almost like fried chicken; coarsely chopped nuts in the breading added a lot of crunch. The interior of the sweetbreads was soft and creamy with a subtle hint of lemon from the sauce. The braised baby fennel, however, added very little flavor to the dish. The Fois Gras with Cinco Cebollas was a beautifully layered dish of pickled onions, grilled scallions and onion halves beneath seared fois gras toast smothered in a rich sesame seed studded teriyaki sauce. Without the pickled onions, the dish may have been too sweet, but I'd still eat the fois gras and toast all day. I chose the Lamb Duo with Black Barley and Preserved Kumquats simply because I love duos and the idea of two different meat preparations on the same plate. In this case, both were loin chops, one bone in and one boneless. Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The black barley added a chewy texture that finished with notes of citrus. There was some sort of chickpea salad, perhaps a riff on the classic combination of lamb with yogurt, but for me was dry and uninteresting. The Tamarindo Pork Belly and Octopus with Butternut Squash was a busy dish with lots of competing elements: three blocks of pork belly, a couple random pieces of octopus and some grapefruit segments doused in a rich tamarind demi glace and dollops of squash puree. Unsure of how to eat this, I sampled all of the ingredients separately and then together in different combinations. I could appreciate the use of the grapefruit to cut the fatty richness of both the pork belly fat and the sauces, but it was unanimous at the table- the octopus was completely out of place. Which brings me to dessert and the Chocolate, Olive Oil, Sal de Mar. I loved the rustic presentation of dueling quenelles of ganache and ice cream. The olive oil flavor was astonishingly prominent, so much in fact I thought it had been drizzled over the entire dish and thought to myself, ""that's so Mario Batali!"" Bits of chicharron and salt flakes made the ganache even silkier in my mouth. A very well executed dish.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Definitely one of the best food trucks that I have had.  The main thing about food trucks is the price point, and then you are left thinking what kind of quality of food you could be getting for the price.   This is not your typical Chicken/Gyro Combo and rice truck/stand.  For $6 I got the Combo platter.  The chicken is not butchered like other street meat carts. The pieces of chicken were actually identifiable as chicken and not just scrap meat. You could taste the quality in the marinade as well. Next the judgement on the yogurt/cucumber sauce.  This is LEGIT sauce.  You can taste the freshness and quality of ingredients that went into making this sauce.  It's all about the tartness and the consistency that has me giving this place two thumbs up.  As with any sauce, it should not overpower or mask the flavor of the food, but provide and complimentary flavor enhancing profile to the main star of the show.  No complaints on the rice either.  This place is a must go.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"IN SHORT: A modest yet darling restaurant on an uncommonly quiet corner of the West Village that frames a meal so irresistibly thoughtful you might think you were finishing a special dinner at home. THE STORY: The Little Owl is little. But the compact, 30-seat space is by no means wanting for flavor, hospitality, or style. For appetizers, the Eggplant Parm with herb marinated tomato salad hits the perfect balance of light, yet sumptuously warm flavor, while the Ricotta Cavatelli with kale pesto are rich, creamy and melty bites of comfort. My date and I told our waitress that we were splitting the appetizers, and the kitchen even split the portions for us on two plates, a special touch truly reflective of the thoughtfulness inherent in the restaurant. The entrees themselves were nearly perfectly cooked, particularly the dense Broiled Halibut resting on a bed of corn, peas, and sprouts, served with a warm pesto vinaigrette. Yet the Pork Chop with butter beans is undoubtedly the star of the menu, cut into massive, juicy portions and seasoned with a rich balance of spices that include cayenne and cumin. We finished our meal with a local cheese plate that our waitress lovingly guided us through, making sure we didn't miss out on any bite. We left full and passionately invested in the nicety of the space, because somehow between the large windows and smiling, earnest demeanor of the service, a dinner at The Little Owl feels like coming home.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The lasagna is everything it's hyped up to be.  Very nicely layered with vegetables and al dente pasta sheets.  The fried artichokes were served with parsley which I was indifferent about.

"Note: 3.5 STARS (let us add half stars, Yelp!) I had no idea about the hype and fanfare that rotates around ABC Kitchen before my girlfriend told me we were going with Eric R. and Sandrine E. Apparently reservations are hard to come by.  I really hadn't even heard of it before I read somewhere that Barack Obama had dinner there during his 2012 campaign.  So I had no expectations going in.  I was just excited to go someplace new.  And their hook is all the food is local / organic? It's good to eat a nice guilt-free dinner that's prepared healthy. The restaurant is very spacious.  And bravo to whoever was in charge of the decor.  It has this modern urban rustic thing going on.  After grabbing a beer up front while waiting to be seated, the hostess offered to hold my beer on a serving tray and walk it over to the table with us.  That was a nice touch.  I liked the in-house music too.  They were playing stuff like Amerie, Phoenix, Jay-Z, Timbaland & Missy...a smart blend of hip tunes.  It added to the social energy of the restaurant. Now in general, as a whole, the food was good. Was I losing my mind over it and calling random people on the phone to let them know that my life was changing?  Definitely not.  I had the pretzel-dusted calamari for starters (really tasty), lobster with a side of mashed potatoes for my entree (just okay) and the apple pie w/ cinnamon ice cream for dessert (extremely good).  I washed all of this down with a couple bottles of Southampton Double White.  Their beer selection is on point. In respect to the lobster, I've had much better elsewhere.  It was a little firm but it did have some flavor.  I definitely finished it all.  The best dish on the table was ordered by Eric R. - roast suckling pig with smoked bacon marmalade and grilled baby leeks.  Glad I got to taste that.  So I guess it depends on what you order.  Some meals are stronger than others. However, the service was top notch.  There were a couple of small hiccups with some items we ordered.  But we weren't going to complain or anything.  We were enjoying the ambiance.  It was a Wednesday night and slightly busy.  Everyone's sides came like 10 minutes after the entrees did.  The staff did recognize that immediately and comped all the sides without hesitation.  We didn't expect that whatsoever.  That was pretty cool of them. I would definitely try ABC Kitchen again.  Because the menu is pretty extensive and there's more I'd like to sample.  I know the potential is there for me to go back and have an amazing meal. Because the prices dictate that you're about to have your world rocked.  I'd just consider this an off-night.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Fried Chicken was very nice. I had the hot (mild) fried chicken with mash potatoes and my friend had blackened chicken with mac and cheese. Both were very tasty. The heat of hot fried chicken was perfect for me but my friend almost died, the chef had to bring him a glass of milk. SO if your cant handle heat order the regular friend chicken. The mash was damn near perfect and the corn bread tasted like home. The bill felt right...did not feel like we were overcharged at all. I would def return.

"Absolutely my go to neighborhood inoteca.  As a first generation Calabrese, the number of italian restaurants I am willing to pay for are far and few between.  This is one of them.   Standouts include the octopus salad :A sauté of potatoes, micro greens, octopus, and dressed in a light herb infused olive oil.  I could eat this every day!  The octopus is artfully cooked and never tough, probably due to a sighting of the prep-cooks massaging the octopus legs into perfection.   Other standouts include the lobster risotto and ossobuco.  Fantastico! At this intimate two room hole in the wall with long communal tables, surrounded by a library of vino, you can expect great small plates, a good Vermentino, and fun conversation with locals from the neighborhood.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We visited on the recommendation of a barkeeper in Midtown on a chilly Sunday and warmed ourselves up with Eggs Benedict and a chicken Pot pie, washed down with a highball and 15 year old Glenlivet, all really good. It was a pity we were too early for the Sunday roast but we plan to return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The best place for steak in Williamsburg.  If you go with friends make sure to get the sharing meats like the handle and the lamb.  The lamb is unlike any lamb I've had before.  Everyone seems to want the pot de creme for desert, but I prefer the ice cream with pork cracklings. The only downside is they don't take reservations, so the wait is always an hour + unless you get there early.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Lamb Shanks were bland, fatty and gross. Apple Crisp was raw.... like not fully baked. I gagged literally. Seafood dish ws pretty good, but they put these vinegar onions all over it that made it soggy. the point of deep frying and breading is for it to have that texture. Why ruin it by making it soggy. Altogether after spending $80, I actually ate maybe a fifth of the food I purchased. The yellow plantains and the rice. The read was unedible. No wonder the place was a ghost town when I walked in. I would suggest you walk around. In park slope there is too much to choose from to overpay for nasty food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Use the words best and steak and Brooklyn in the same sentence but fail to conclude your thesis with the name Peter Luger and even the palest vegan in the audience will wonder whether you might be better off in a home of some sort. But eight blocks north of Luger's, at St. Anselm, we have a contender. They call it a butcher's steak (you know it as hanger) because there's only one per cow, and back in the day, butchersgreedy bastards to a manwould save it for themselves. Here, it's the most popular item on the menua great beefy thing of beauty. It's simply salted, expertly grilled, sliced across the grain, and loaded with flavor. A drizzle of garlic-steeped melted butter doesn't hurt a bit. The coup de grâce, though, is the $15 head-scratcher price tag. Both Peter Luger and low-budget beefery Tad's in midtown: Consider yourselves put on notice.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I don't really care about  the location, service, long-wait line, but the taste of the food. it just tastes so authentic and delicious. It is very difficult to choose only one dish since everything is tasty .. hmm i would say the fried water cress with seafood is one of the best!

"I have heard great things about the food. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to even eat because of the HORRIBLE excuse of a hostess they had. She said her name was Jennifer. Incase she was lying, she was a petite rude Hispanic with a sock bun. She took our name, said it would be a half hour for a table for 3. I was confused because she didn't write our name down but I stood there anyway. 5 minutes later a man comes and asks how long for a wait for 3? She says a half hour but if this reservation doesn't show up in 2 minutes they can sit in 5 mins. Ummm excuse me we were here first. So she rudely gets in my face and continues to tell me how she's gonna ""go by her list"" (which she never even put me on)  and how that man was here before me, but how would I have heard their conversation if I wasn't standing there waiting...? My mom asked for a manager and she claimed she was in charge, right after the bartender told her there was no one currently there in charge.

We waited for one hour and maybe 20 minutes and finally got to order. The place is pretty huge. Great customer service! The food was delicious, especially the pork buns.

"Very no-frills interior and casual service, but cheap prices and great food.   I got the Domino arepa - black beans & cheese (only $4).  The flavors were excellent, and it wasn't greasy in the least.  But the star here is the cilantro sauce - just squeeze it on anything you can find; though the hot sauce is also quite tasty and packs good heat. The arepas here are similar in style to Guayoyo, but the arepa itself is a bit thinner, causing it to fall apart more easily.  But that's what the fork and plate are for on the back-end. Now that I've officially Arepa Challenged the Big Three, I'd choose Guayoyo as my favorite, especially for dinner/drinks out with friends.  Arepas Cafe is a better bet for a casual lunch/takeout.  But I'd say both trump the greasy and cramped Caracas.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We ordered the pork buns and they came very promptly.  Tender, juicy hot pork with greens, hoi sin sauce and add a tad of srirracha and you have yourself a pretty fan-worthy pork bun! If you're thinking of making a meal of this small, i think not.  Definitely plan to order other items if you want a meal.  For us, this was the perfect taste for us to know that they make some very awesome food combined with some very terrific service.

"I have eaten at Piccolo Angelo twice.  The very first time, I enjoyed the bread, food and service. The place was busy then, with a wait to get in.  This was  some time ago. The one thing that really stuck out in my mind, however, was they would sell you a bottle of Spaten beer. OK, nothing wrong with that.  I ordered a second beer, and it was a different beer!  Different bottle, cap, etc. No label on it.   When I complained to the server, she swore it was a Spaten, and got me another one.    Look, I know my beer and it was a different beer! Maybe something really cheap and American. Anyway, other than that, I like the Italian food they do.   They are friendly with the owner, and old guy, stopping at tables. Their Indian bartender empties big bottles of wine into smaller ""house"" bottles which seem to be popular, mostly for the prices I think.   I didn't try the wine.  This last time I had a chicken dish topped with cheese and  prosciutto which was good, but a litle salty. The escarole was good.  Their homemade pasta should be tried, its the best thing they do.  I want to bash them, but they are too nice and the food is decent. 3.5 stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place reminds me of Bar Sardine, which I absolutely love!   The drinks are fantastic and reasonably priced.   I came here primarily to try their grandma pie.  It opened my eyes to a whole new style of pie.   Although, I'm afraid I'll be seriously let down if I try a grandma pie elsewhere.   Everything was perfect with this pie.  The tomatoes in the sauce were slightly sweet and acidic and the pepperoni is the type that slightly curls and is super crispy. I had to have dessert since they're also known for their ice cream.  The brownie sundae was good but nothing different than you would find at most places.  I was just happy that the ice cream didn't melt after a minute like my banana split at Morgenstern's. I'll be back to enjoy more cocktails and try their pasta.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"(Note that this review is only for the vegetarian banh mi, i.e. the buddist.)   Finally made it to one of, if not the most raved about banh mi shops in NYC.  It was crowded, which was not wholly unexpected given that I arrived around 1:30 p.m.; but I didn't mind because of all the reviews raving about the mind-blowing sandwiches here.    From the reviews, I knew to head to the counter where I gave my order, stepped back, and waited... and waited... and waited.  I know it was a peak time, but honestly, does it take *that* long to stuff a sandwich???   Also, why is that it takes extra long for probably their simplest sandwich?  My order number was ""39"", but I didn't get my sandwich until we were up in the mid-50's.   By the time I finally received my sandwich I was weak at the knees from a combination of hunger and exhaustion from standing around for about 40 mins.  However, I was so happy to finally get the sandwich that all the discomfort melted away.  That is, until I bit into the sandwich.  To say that it was awful would be like saying a root canal can cause one discomfort.   It was like someone took a warmed over can of ""vegetarian duck"" from the grocery store, added some baby corn and a few mushrooms, dumped it onto a baguette, and called it a bahn mi.  Uh, no. So if you're ever thinking about it, don't.  And tell your vegetarian friends to skip this joint; and instead go to down the street to Banh Mi So 1 and get their vegan selections.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love dirty Chinese food. There, I said it. If I Chinese restaurant (especially in Chinatown or Flushing) is TOO clean, I get suspicious. The food must not be very good if they have this much time to make the place sparkle. If the table is not a little sticky I get slightly nervous. Places like Lan Zhou just back my theory up. It's small; it's dirty. The condiments are all on one sticky table. Some of them are missing caps. When I stop to think about it, is it really ok for them to bang the noodles on the table in the dining room?  How clean can that table be? Once your chosen noodles arrive, you won't be wondering if the broth is reaaaaaaaalllly hot enough to kill the germs on the noodles. You will be slurping the noodles and the soup down your gullet. You won't be talking to your friends, because you will be enjoying perfect hand pulled noodles  in a light broth or sauce. The broth's flavor is not  intense, but it's an excellent foil for the noodles, and you can always throw in some pickled cabbage or hot sauce to perk it up.  And then the fried dumplings will come out and you will be fighting your friends to get at the perfectly fried, crazy flavorful dumplings.  You might order a second order. And then the bill will come, and you will smile at the fact that you got full and happy on the cheap.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"La Sirene has that certain je ne sais quoi... DAMN.GOOD.FOOD. Bring your cash and your wine and plan to walk home to work off the calores -- it's so worth it. Overall: 4.5 stars. The place is tiny and quirky and adorable, and the waitstaff even have French accents. And the food...my god, the food. The goat cheese tart is perfection. Do not miss it. The curry mussels -- amazing, a generous portion of fat, juicy mussels in a cream-based sauce with a subtle spicy curry flavor. The shepherd's pie -- light and fluffy, with a spectacular browned crust and moist chunks of pollock and veggies. We also had one of the specials, duck confit. Duck's not typically a fave but holy crap, this was wonderfully tender and juicy and in an incredible red wine sauce with hints of cherry. A quarter star off for the desserts -- we had the first and last items on the dessert menu, some kind of cream-puff ice cream profiterole things -- they were delicious, yes, but I just wasn't as blown away as I was with the rest of the meal. And we felt like both desserts were essentially the same thing, except one had chocolate. Next time I'll try some of the other desserts -- the peach melba sounded yum but I was outvoted. The other quarter star off is for small lags in service -- we felt our waitress's interest in us dwindled as the meal went on. They did get busier, but still -- we had to ask her to open our second bottle of wine, for the dessert menu, for the check, etc. Still very good service overall, though. And the prices are quite reasonable -- a big plus. We will SO be back. And you should SO make sure to check it out, too. Bon appétit!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here with a Groupon for dinner for two - quite possibly the best deal in NYC. For $23 ($29 Groupon with e20% discount), we got two drinks (choice of house sangria, house white/red wine, or any beer!), two entrees, and two desserts. I ordered the house white and my dining buddy got the red sangria. Both were more than serviceable. For entrees, we shared the lamb shank and the salmon fillet. The salmon was excellent and the lamb was fall-off-the-bone unbelievable. Portions were generous. Dessert was apple pie for me and the affogato for my friend. Both were great! And an unexpected addition: our meals came with a solid house salad and truly excellent crusty bread and butter. Service was great - we didn't feel like the cheapskates with the Groupon deal, as sometimes happens. The only catches? Not super convenient to the subway; cash only; and no reservations accepted (though we didn't need them, even at 8 pm on Saturday). Would return again in a heartbeat - even without a Groupon!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"You will probably think I am exaggerating, but this is very possibly the best restaurant in NYC. How do I backup a statement this strong? Well, I can't. I'm no foodie and I haven't tried every (overhyped) superchef restaurant in the city...but this place is everything I love. Great cozy atmosphere, really caring service from a staff of one, and food that seriously makes your head spin. The bacon mac n cheese cannot be overhyped. It is a revelation. So is the crab dip...and the shrimp tacos...and the date pudding...and every special I've ever tried. Seriously just go.

"Apps: Spare Ribs wrapped around Sugarcane are fantastic and really something special. Crispy pork belly is cooked to perfection. Chicken skewers are served with delicious sauces that make a seemingly ordinary option extraordinary. Drinks: The Fig-a-tini was ridiculously good, and very refreshing. Not sure how the boys' beers were, as I was not straying from my drink. They seemed perfectly happy though. Entrees: We each ordered a different protein in a different curry broth. The duck was succulent and there were lychees in the broth (an added benefit in my opinion). The beef was tender, not dry. The sea bass was cooked perfectly. Ambiance: Some of my favorite interior decorating in the city. Noise level was just right. Service: We went here before going to see Macbeth and let our server know ahead of time. Everything came out quickly, but never before we'd finished our previous course. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommend.","[1.0, 0.0]"
What Grimaldi's used to be! Started by the same owners who became disillusioned with the commercialized pizza business.

Just not worth the money. The salads are a joke: beet salad was maybe 14 slices of beets arranged around a plate. No lettuce.  The sprinkle of goat cheese was +$1.

We did the mistake to order the wines pairing (4 different wines pairing with the 4-dish menu): It was overpriced considering the quantities served and most of the wines were not in line with our taste. Finally, the restaurant was half empty, what we found strange considering the good critics appearing here. Probably there are better options in NY for this price.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ive eaten at Five Tacos a few times.  For me personally it's a hit and miss.  Sometimes I have incredible tacos and sometimes they lack flavor.  I am not sure if it's due to the cooks shift changes, but one minute they are amazing and one minute mediocre.  I will say this, when I do come back and I do get a great Taco I am so happy.  The tacos are cheap (around $3.50) and are good for a quick bite.  Don't take my word on it, try it for yourself.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I come here frequently with coworkers.  The selection changes daily and choices are top notch.  Adding to the fun is that each week has a different theme (this week is east coast vs. west coast IPA's) giving you a chance to really explore a beer style.   Menus are printed with beer advocate's rating for the beer along with the % ABV, so you know what you're getting into. The food is good to very good - nothing outstanding, but consistently tasty. It gets crowded on weeknights - especially thurs-sat.  Be nice to the friendly and knowledgeable waitresses and they'll work to find you seats.   I prefer RnH to Gingerman which is a couple blocks to the north.  Better selection, better beers, and better prices.  I like the more casual vibe at RnH a bit more as well.

"Holy God. This is the best food I've ever had. (Also this is how I broke a liquid diet of three weeks. It was heaven.) We called them at 10 after another reservation forgot our reservation, got a reservation for 10:30, *which is when they close the kitchen* and then they kept the kitchen open for us to get our food. The atmosphere is beautiful and subtle. Dim lighting, huge flower arrangements, wide expanses of white, huge cantilevered lights. We ran into a beautiful friend of ours who we had lost touch with. I don't know what all we ate. There was taking pictures of food, and we are really not that type of diners. There was white chocolate with basil and yuzu. There was salmon with chili sauce. There were other things. I don't know. This might not be a detailed review, but the amazingness might be conveyed by my helplessness.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Not very welcoming for a place that doesn't have really have anything going for it while also having relatively pricey drinks and food.

"Wow, what a great find!  I came here for a leisurely weekend brunch and was thoroughly impressed.  It happened to be a particularly gorgeous day, so the restaurant's outdoor seating area was open and packed with boozy brunchers.  I started off with a bloody mary (tasty and just the right amount of booze) and enjoyed the crispy beet salad for my entree.  It sounded so simple, but the ingredients were extremely fresh.  The chocolate toast is also fantastic.  The service was impeccable.  There it is.  Short and sweet.  If you're in the area, The Farm on Adderley is definitely worth a try.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow. Wow, Wow, Wow. This place is far more stronger in its Salad and Rice/Noodle courses than the main dishes (seafood/meat). I thought the service was excellent (though I could sense they were trying really hard). No complaints about the interior either. On to the highlights of the night... Rose of Sharon (Cocktail) - Definitely something different and finally a cocktail that isn't a simple soju-fruit mixer. They used to make this with egg whites, not sure if they still do because their drink menu seems to have changed. Bibim - This dish is an adventure in texture. It's cool, refreshing, and makes you wonder if you're enjoying salad or shaved ice (in a good way). I absolutely recommend this dish. 5/5 Spicy Kalguksu - I enjoyed their reinterpretation on a classic Korean dish. Nice kick to the dish. I was tempted to slurp... 5/5 Sea Urchin - The best Uni is always fresh, and it passes the test here. The crispy quinoa pairs well with the uni. If you enjoy sea urchin, this is a must dish. 5/5 Summary: The main dishes (both fish and meats) were weaker than the appetizer and rice/noodle dishes. But it was probably because our table enjoyed the beginning courses so much that our expectations were raised to unrealistic levels. It's not that the main dishes were executed poorly, it's just that there wasn't anything special compared to what we were served. We enjoyed the amuse bouche (they serve a TON). Jungsik is worth the visit simply because it's cuisine and style is so different (in a good way). It's been 9 months since my last visit (this review is long overdue) and I find myself craving for their food. It's left a lasting impression and that's hard to do for someone who's dined at most of the Michelin starred restaurants in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here for the first time a number of years ago when I didn't live in the city. I was young and impressed by everything, but there were MTV VJs eating a few tables over, and they had good mac and cheese. Basically I thought it was the coolest place ever. I went back yesterday for my birthday work lunch and it was still great. Instead of MTV VJs, Chris Rock sat next to us, which was entertaining. It was torrential rain outside so I got the soup & sandwich, which was plenty of food and super delish. Its half of a grilled cheese (with bacon & tomato) and a cup of soup (lobster corn chowder was soup of the day - SO good). While its not the best food ever, its all good comfort food. I also had a strawberry basil soda which I've been craving since I got back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"i wish i had words to adequately express my experience at yasuda. yasuda101. there is no omakase. it's just, sushi. you sit at the bar, greeted with friendly introductions.  we had a lovely elder chef who slightly reminded me of my grandfather. there is no ice water. it's green tea.  the real deal. let the sushi flow forth like manna from heaven. one does not use chopsticks. just fingertips. mind the tiny, shallow mini-bowl by your plate; on it a small towel to gently wipe after each morsel. there is no dipping. just a dab of wasabi & delicate brushstrokes of soy sauce a la chef. ________________________ the fish. think: ""melt in your mouth, i-could-die-happy-right-now"" variety of salmon variety of tuna toro variety of yellowtail squid sweet shrimp - ebi variety of mackerel eel sea bass cherry stone clam scallop uni orange clam* yellowtail handrolls uni handrolls (im sure im forgetting a few.) i will just make one note. the orange clam. i love uni.

"I had the Pollo Al Forno, which is Roasted Chicken & Salsa Verde. This dish was excellent and was featured in an episode of Food Network's Best I Ever Ate by Tyler Florence. I also had the Patate, which is Roasted Potatoes, Pecorino(Italian Cheese), & Rosemary. And I ordered Broccolo, which is Broccoli, Currants, & Colatura(Anchovy Sauce). The potatoes were so good. They were like gourmet french fries because they were crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. And the broccoli had a very sophisticated saltiness to them, I'm assuming that is a result of the Anchovy Sauce. For dessert I had the biscotti to-go. The flavors and textures of the various biscotti were perfect for a late night snack after being out at a bar.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I live just down the block and as I was running to catch the 6 one morning, surprised to see the signage for the previous restaurant -- Double Crown -- removed and Saxon + Parole going up. That night I was actually going to a friend's birthday at Madame Geneva next door and thinking it still had the speak-easy entrance (Note: it doesn't) made my way through the restaurant and furiously tried to open the door to the bar. After about a minute a waiter came running up and let me know that was no longer the set-up (and assured me that it had JUST changed) Chatting with him I learned that the new owners of the restaurant also did Public -- to which my ears perked and I let him know I'd definitely be back! And I have. Both nights -- a Tuesday and a Thursday -- were popping though we were seated right away (with reservations). I've started with a grapefruit gin and tonic which was super fresh and crisp. The wine list is also impressive and errs on the pricier side. Given the other reviews, we've started with the pots (REALLY good) and also the seafood tower which was incredible. If you like seafood, definitely treat yourself to the large tower (if there's a few of you) It had smoked mussels, massive prawns, salmon tartare and gorgeous oysters. Everything I've gotten for my main has been incredible, too: surprisingly the roast chicken is one of my favorite dishes and goes great with the gruyere cauliflower gratin. I've also gotten the pork chop and had a bite of my friend's burger. Also, do yourself a favor and pre-order the chocolate souffle -- hand's down, the best one I've EVER had. The service can be a little disjointed (we waited close to 30 minutes for our entrees) but I think they're still finding their feet. Overall, a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and especially looking forward to frequenting it more this winter!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ward III is fantastic. Went to this bar by chance while waiting for my friend to get out of work. 6PM on a Monday the bar was packed with a few empty tables just behind it. I wasn't expecting that. Nevertheless, lucky for me -- I found a stool in a short amount of time and met Ward III's owner, Kenny. Complete sweetheart. Even though he was busy making orders he kept up small talk with me. I always enjoy talking with seasoned bar tenders, so I appreciated this. As for the drinks: I tried the Bespoke Cocktail I heard so much about from other Yelpers, but I had no idea what I wanted. Kenny delivered a great drink, regardless. Strong, very strong. Next order was the bar signature, a Ward III. It looked amazing when the guy next to me ordered it, so why not? Loved it. Kenny is an excellent mixologist. I definitely recommend trying this drink. The bourbon made me skeptical yet it was a pleasant surprise. Also worth mentioning: this bar has a great vibe. You walk in and get the feeling you have been transported somewhere else. I love a bar that can take you in like that. Bottom line: The drinks were expensive -- absolutely worth it, though! P.S.: Finally got an account on Yelp just to post this! It was that good.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"SriPraPhai Thai is overrated. I had such high expectations for them but they were just okay. I came over here on a Friday night around 6:30 and there were seats available so if you come early there is no wait. I was also surprised that there is an extra room to the right for more seating. This place was bigger than I thought it was. PROS: - Coconut Rice - very flavorful and delicious. I don't know what they put in it but it tastes so good. - Fried Soft Shell Crab with pineapple, pumpkin, and green curry. The sauce is really good. It pairs well with the soft shell crab. THE OKAY: - Papaya salad with seafood - [contains mussels, squid, and shrimp] I wasn't thinking straight when the waitress asked me how I wanted this and I said medium, and medium spicy turned out to be a little too spicy for me. I gave me a tingly burn on my lips and I had to drink lots of water. Other than that the seafood was fresh. - Shredded Green Mango Salad - the shredded mango pieces were very crunchy and this dish was pretty good in general. The chef added to much sauce in this one and it was VERY SOUR. I am not sure if it was the fish sauce or some kind of vinegar. I felt that this was very similar to the papaya salad with seafood except not as spicy. - Green Papaya Pad Thai - Pretty Good but it was standard Pad thai flavor. I didn't really taste the papaya. I think maybe because it was the unripe crunchy papaya shreds. Note: CASH ONLY","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Marlow and Sons with very high expectations.  The restaurant exceeded all of them. Food -- Just delicious.  Here is what we had, with a short commentary on each: - Oysters - I am not an expert on oysters, but these (particularly the variety from Mass.) were amazing.  Not all fishy, not too big/small.  Perfect. - Meat and Cheese Plate - I will not get into all the types of meats and cheeses, but I think they really excel here.  The portions of meat were large.  Order accordingly.  For two people, two meats and three cheeses were just right. - Halibut - Amazing.  Cooked in an oyster stew. - Brick Chicken - I thought this was excellent, but I prefer chicken breasts, and it was both a breast and a leg. - Side of Cauliflower - Cooked with capers, cheese (provolone?), this was the highlight of the meal.  Subtle, but so good. - Chocolate Tart - topped with sea salt, which cuts nicely against the sweetness, this was a perfect end to a perfect meal. Atmosphere - the space is very cool.  Tucked in back with a grocery store/market up front, it feels cozy without being cramped.  Great music, mature and cool crowd.   A little loud, but realize that going in and you won't be bothered.  I guess I would prefer to not sit up front, as you are near the door and you are not by the bar/main room.   Service - Very knowledgeable.  Not over bearing.  Just right. Wine - Great selection of wines. Value/Price - This is not a cheap place.  But again, realize that going in and you will not be disappointed or shocked.  You can also order something less than a full blown meal (glass of wine and meat and cheese plate), and you will have an excellent meal at a very reasonable price. All told, this has landed on my top 5 restaurants in NYC list.  It is the perfect mix of food, atmosphere and service.  I would take a date here, hang out at the bar solo or with a friend or go with small (4-6) group -- no business, no family.  If you are tired of the same old restaurant scene in New York (Manhattan, to be specific), go here, and your interest in going out to eat in New York will be revived.  Fantastic place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"As a Japanese major and former exchange student, I have been looking for a place like Yakitori Totto for years since I left Japan.  Granted, it's not hard to find decent Japanese food (run by Japanese folk for those of us who want to keep up our language skills!) in New York city.  Still, this is a fantastic place, even for Manhattan! Why? 1) Atmosphere - small, crowded, full of Japanese = just like Japan (but in a good way) 2) Food - Smells right, looks right, tastes right! 3) Waitstaff - Japanese; doesn't blink at a non-Japanese ordering in Japanese = just like Tokyo! 4) Price - Well this is slightly un-Japanese;  while not cheap, by New York (or Tokyo) standards, it is certainly not expensive!  House sake is about $12, which is a bargain considering how many servings you get. 5) Japan-ness - close your eyes, listen to the J-pop, smell the good food, and listen to the Japanese being spoken around you.  Welcome to the real Japan, Manhattan Island Ward. I know where my first stop will be on my next trip to New York! Only downside is the wait, but they will call your cell when you're table is about to be ready!  Worth it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stay far away! The first time my office heard about this place was when a co worker got food poisoning and called in sick for three days after having a lobster roll at the Brooklyn Flea one Sunday. We chalked it up to chance and decided to still be brave and try the acclaimed lobster roll one day from the lobster food truck. Well what a mistake. When we arrived this week all we saw in the trucks "" serving window"" was a fat guy with his ass crack staring straight in our faces. When we tried to get his attention he seemed to busy talking to his dude co workers and jumped off the counter rolling his eyes at us as if we had bothered him so much. They then informed us that the grill was still heating up and they could have food for us in five minutes if we paid them the $16 right away. We did and the dude grabbed our money not even saying thank you- and went right back into his conversation about ""last weeks pussy"" and complaining about his ""crazy bitch boss"" with the other workers. After a bit the rolls were ready and he practically threw them at us without saying thank you. Back in our office we unwrapped our tiny portions of lobster on a toasted hot dog bun and were less than impressed. Not only was the flavor lacking but my lobster roll had A PIECE OF SHORT BROWN HAIR TOPPING IT!!! After nearly vomiting up what I had eaten we have all decided never to step food near Red Hook Lobster Truck or Pound again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Wow! Its a shame that if I could, I would give this place 0 Stars after my last experience here. Let me begin by stating, I LOVED Verlaines, LOVED it! Past tense. Within the last 3 months, I had probably been there about 8 times and each time, I brought a new friend to experience it with and EACH time, the said friend enjoyed it just as much as me! The same way I fell in love with the ambiance, the drinks and the food, so did they. It also goes without saying that every-time I visited, not only did myself and my guests order multiple drinks and platters, but we were ALWAYS generous with tips. This past Saturday I visited Verlaines with yet another new patron (and friend). Friend and I entered the restaurant at about 8pm, as expected, the place was packed but there was at least 1 open table available in the back. This table did not have any reservation sign, nor was there any indication it was being held. It appeared perfectly OPEN. Not even a minute after we had sat down, a guy with spiky blonde hair approaches us and informs us we cannot sit there for long because, it is ""reserved for 8:30PM"". At this point, me and my new guest are highly confused. Amid our bewilderment, the spiked hair guy assures us that he can serve us, but we will only have ""30 minutes"" to eat/drink. Now this is where I got PISSED. I inquired as to why, if literally every table in the restaurant was booked up, why were we not informed upon entering the restaurant? Had we known there was a waiting list upon entering we would have just explored other options! The guy again, dismissively, informs me that there was someone at the door informing customers of such and we must have just missed them. Now this was a flat out lie. At this point, I got up and began actively looking for this ""host"" I seem to have missed upon entering the establishment. I end up encountering this small brunette girl, I inform her that me and my guest we not made aware the place was entirely booked and there was a ""waiting list"". She assured me the waiting list had ""just began"" and me and my friend would be the 1st chosen. Ok. Fine. Returned to the table, and by this time it was about 8:20PM and the guy comes back and informs us the guests had arrived and we would have to move to the lounge. Again, we are reassured that within the lounge we will be served. The lounge hostess guides us over, I attempt to sit in one spot and she quickly taps me and says, ""No, no, no that's reserved too"" and then ushers me over to another seat. WOW. Even in the most high end restaurants I have never been made to feel like cattle. My friend and I are then left with menus, being that my friend was new to the restaurant, she needed a moment to make up her mind. Please let me emphasize, she needed a ""moment"". Not nearly 20 more minutes. By this time we were both starving and I was mortified. Never have I experienced such careless, flippant customer service. I was SO embarrassed for even dragging my friend a long, especially after speaking so highly of it beforehand. My friend was not impressed whatsoever and after more than 45 min of being bused around, with no drink or food, she asked me if we could just leave and we did. I can count the number of times I have walked out on a restaurant on one hand. With Verlaines being the 1st NYC restaurant I have ever walked out on. Truly, truly disappointing experience. I really did love this place!","[0.0, 1.0]"

My recent trip this week went from the manager asking me 3 times at the door how I am this evening which was a little over bearing but maybe he was just being enthusiastic or on something!! The food was still enjoyable which was great to see but the attitude of staff and management was not one of fun and professional service like the past, there was an air of unhappiness there. I will probably give them one more chance as I have had great experiences in the past but it will take something magical to change my recent experiences.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have eaten at numerous spanish restaurants...and by far this is the worst restaurant I have eaten in NYC!!! My food (Pork feet to be exact) was spoiled and had a foul odor! Furthermore, there was a piece of hair in the chicken rice as well!!! When I notified the waiter of both incidents (told him both in Spanish and English) he stated ""Sorry you shouldn't have eaten the food""...how rude!!! There was no apologize and I was still charged for the food. In addition, upon exiting the restaurant I noticed the letter grade was missing... To my surprise on nyc.gov/health, I discovered that as of 3/6/2014 this restaurant has 4 major violations totaling 20 points, which is why their grade is pending. I rarely write a review on a restaurant but when I do it's because I find that it has unsanitary food and it's not worth one's money nor time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Had a really delicious dinner here at a very reasonable price.   Our appetizer (the eggplant parm dish) was stellar.  The presentation was gorgeous, as it was a stacked eggplant tower surrounded by a beautiful, delicate green pesto and then a light tomato sauce, with large parmesan shavings placed on top of it.  The flavors blended together perfectly, and I was really excited for the main course.   I think having such a fantastic appetizer almost ruined the main dish for me, which would have been good in its own right.  However, it paled in comparison to the first course.  I got the gnocchi with proscuitto and sage and my dining companion got one of the specials - black linguine with shrimp.  Mine was delicious and I have no complaints, although again, not the culinary delight that the appetizer was, and my dining companion enjoyed his, although thought that the shrimp was slightly overcooked (something that often happens when shrimp is served on a piping hot bowl of pasta).  Still, to have food like this at such a price left us completely satisfied.   All in all, our food was excellent, extremely affordable, and we were absolutely doted on by our waiter and the rest of the staff.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So I've been here many times before and generally liked the food and service. However, this time around I was very disappointed. The food: I ordered the dip plate (hummus, tabouli, babaganoush) and it came with warm bread. The hummus was so dry and had a weird after taste maybe it's because it had olives in it. The babaganoush was too creamy for my taste and the tabouli was not authentic at all. They gave us generous portions of all 3 but not enough bread. I asked our server for some more bread, mind you this was regular loafs of bread. She notifies us that it would be at an extra charge. I responded with ""well you guys gave us large portions of food, it would make sense to give the same amount of bread"" Besides who charges for your standard table bread?","[1.0, 0.0]"

We were dining during Brooklyn Restaurant Week which was a good deal since their entrees were pretty expensive. Their homemade bread came in different varieties and tasted very fresh.  I had the scallops which were just succcullllent! Also had the Hake as an entree, which filled me up completely. Portions, I must say were very generous.  I tried my bf's duck and found it to be good. I enjoyed the place so much it was sad when it was time to leave. I would definitely return for another RW.

"East Village is a magical place. Land in any Japanese restaurant there and you get amazed. Wow. Honestly I was not expecting much from sobaya when I walked in, but it truly outdid its appearance. We had the uni tororo (sea urchin with yam) and goma (sesame) tofu as starters. I was driven speechless by the uni tororo - the yam is grated and cooked to such perfection that it kind of ruined yam from any other restaurant for me, not to mention the magical effect when it's mixed with sea urchin. I'd strongly recommend this dish for people who are afraid to try natto (Japanese soybeans fermented with Bacillus subtilis; I had to pull this definition from wiki) because of its strong flavor. This is the closest resemblance you could get to Natto in texture, but it doesn't have Natto's strong smell that drives people crazy. Seriously, this dish alone makes the restaurant stand out. Goma tofu is a house-made tofu that's chewy in a good way, and very tasty. For the noodles, we had a duck udon called kamo-nanban with extra sea urchin and egg, and a seafood soba with extra slices of duck meat. Loved both. Not a single reason for complaint. The chef used scallions and miso/soy sauce in a masterful way and made duck meat, which is normally overly rich an fatty, taste really good. Guys, definitely try this restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was really excited to go to PT since it had so many great reviews! My boyfriend was getting back from a work trip late on Saturday which happened to be our anniversary so we wanted a nice place but a place that was also low key and close to home. After reading the menu I was pretty much sold once I saw the asparagus gratin. There was no problem getting a reservation and the place was pretty crowded for late on a Saturday night so I'm glad we made one, but they didn't even ask when we came in - just sat us. It's like whats the point? What if they sat another couple who didn't have a reservation? But really it kind of went with the whole vibe of the place - ""hello we have a table waiting for you, welcome friends!"" I got the mixed green salad and we split the asparagus gratin. Salad was delicious, I mean you really can't mess up a basic salad. The asparagus was really really good but when I think of gratin I think of something more casserole like - this dish was literally 5 pieces of asparagus on a plate with cheesy sauce over it. Like I said, it was really good - but also $14 for a handful of asparagus stalks. The boyfriend got the carpaccio, and said it was awesome once he seasoned it a little more. A lack of seasoning is really what brought our meal down. I got the spinach ravioli and he got the pork osso buco and we were both really satisfied but we both thought the meals were bland. I always thought salt and pepper should be to taste, not to season in general. With our meals I definitely felt like there was no thought put into the seasoning which is sad because everything was actually really good. Just bland. The wine list was really extensive and had a wide price range. Went with a carafe (cause I didn't really need to drink a whole bottle myself) of a wine I've never heard of before. I like carafes, I think it's better to take a risk on that rather than a full bottle. Overall, the service was great, the food was good (but totally had potential to be better) and the price was totally reasonable (minus that stupid asparagus gratin). Plus the space is really cute and cozy - I would go back for wine and appetizers at the bar anytime! I would much rather give this a 3.5 and the service is definitely worth a 5 - but I think the lack of seasoning brings it down to a solid 3 stars overall.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The smoked brisket is off the chain... Just melts in your mouth. With the homemade BBQ sauce. Reminds me of TX BBQ. Ohh man my mouth is so happy! Same with the pork belly. :) Unlike most dry and under seasoned chicken. The roasted chicken is juicy and perfectly seasoned. But, you have to try it with the dirty rice. Delicious!!!! The mango cheese cake is creamy and the sweetness is just perfect. Commercial cheese cake is too sweet and extremely heavy to eat. I will definitely be back. Next time I can't wait to try the homemade wafco.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Iconic pizza location in NYC. The restaurant location recently expended in the last few years to provide additional seating for the 100s to 1000s of customers per day. The pizza is top notch. Baked in a coal oven and brought to your table in sizzling perfection. Prices would seem a touch on the high side but what can you expect from one of the first pizza places ever. Never had a disappointment in the food on the wait times which could reach in the hours. Which is the only reason for not a 5 star location.

On a very cold December eve in the middle of blizzard season I took a train ( was the only passenger on my car over) to Bushwick hoping to god the visit from the city was worth it ...and my goodness it was. Joined some friends and a potential work collaborator who frequent this spot and we split 3 different types of pizzas varying from sweet to savory accompanied with a bottle of red wine. The food and wine warmed every bit of my iced over body and cynical soul. Can definitely envision this place getting even more crowded as the weather warms. The ambience was toasty and reminiscent of a ski lodge meets biker bar in a very cool way. The people working here were young adorable and super helpful.

Walking by the kitchen to get to the main area of the restaurant had a Ray Liota in ""Casino""  feel to it! The place has a ""Great Gatsby"" feel with its decor/lighting and staff attire. Food was great! We order the Tomato Bisque with Bacon, The Hummus Platter, Fried Oysters to start with and everything fantastic. The cucumbers that came out with the hummus platter hit the spot for me!

We had bussers and servers constantly checking on us to see if we need anything else or to clear out plates that were clearly done. Very attentive! The Specialty drinks were out of this world..I have never been a fan of cocktails...usually I just drink Captain or Johnny Black on the rocks.

"I had been a regular visitor of this place. However yesterday I took my parents (my dad is 74 years old and my mom is 65 years old) to this restaurant along with my husband. My husband was going around the Hell's Kitchen area to find a parking spot while my parents and I reserved a table for 4. I was told the wait is 20 min. After about 20-25 min when we didn't get called, I enquired about the table. And hence I get told by Bill and Fa (the host at the entrance) that the restaurant does not entertain incomplete parties (my husband was still searching for a spot around the area to park the car - it was taking longer than usual as it was a Saturday). I asked bill and Fa if it wouldn't be better if they could have informed me about this when we were waiting. Fa seemed least concerned and started entertaining other customers while Bill behaved indifferent. Since my parents are pretty old and my mom was a diabetic I asked for a table then and there even telling them that I will order for my husband. Fa said 'ok' so i waited for the next 5 min and when I check back again, Bill and Fa remain firm on not giving us a table and entertain other guests who have come after us. I then said I will change the table number to just 3 guests if they could give me a table right then. Both bluntly replied without even looking at me : 'we do not have a table ready right now' .. After my husband entered the restaurant (finally after finding a parking spot in the city) they made us wait for another 10 min before giving us a table. Room service host doesn't not have courtesy for their customers or even mannerisms on how to treat the elderly. I guess they are getting paid for being rude.as much nice as their food is, i am never turning back there again!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Having a mother who is a great cook and growing up eating really good Filipino food, I'm very critical of Filipino restaurants.   Based on the reviews here I had high expectations of Maharlika.  I went with a friend on a Monday night and we were seated right away.  We ordered one of their bubbly drinks with honey kalamansi and it was really good.  I grew up eating kalamansi and it was a nice to have that  familiar taste in a cocktail.  It was quite refreshing.  They have a very interesting and creative drinks menu. While waiting for our drinks our waitress gave us a small plate of friend chicken skin (similar to cracklings) for the table.  This is accompanied by vinegar and hot peppers.   To start we ordered the lechon kawali and lumpia.  I liked that the lechon came with mustard greens.  I think it complemented the pork very well.  It reminded me of a dish my mom used to make.  The pork itself was a little dry but the lumpia was ok. For our entrees my friend and I shared the kare kare and chicken adobo.  I have to say that the kare kare was excellent.  I would come back just to have this dish again.  I loved that the vegetables in it were caramelized.  I think it definitely added something extra to the dish.  The oxtail was nice and tender.  The sauce was very peanuty and flavorful. The chicken adobo was average.  The sauce was very thick for my taste.  Maybe because this version of adobo had coconut milk in it.  But the chicken itself was tender and the portion size was pretty big. Our waitress was attentive and did a good job in explaining the menu and the different sauces that came with it.   Overall, we had a great meal. I would definitely come back to Maharlika and try other things on their menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The place is super cute, I read all the reviews expecting an amazing meal. It was nothing special. We started with the white sangria it was good. It's $5.50 for a glass but $30 for a pitcher. There is about five glasses in the pitcher. Lets do the math, thats $27.50. Why are you overcharging for less? All the food was over salted. We had the mushroom and asparagus salad, the pan seared duck and the hanger steak with a side of couscous. I did like the food combos/side on the entrees. The couscous was the pasta kind not the grain which i'm used to (which should be specified). Then we got the dessert trio. The chocolate cake was really good, the cheesecake shake was ok, the bread pudding was dry. I think it is too expensive for the area they are more like manhattan prices, which I do not mind paying if the food is worth it. The service is non-existing, the waiter was very confused.  The chef and prep guy had to serve food and clean tables. Let me tell you service is very important it can take a good meal to a better one. Once they work out these kinks I think it can be a good local place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Boqueria is a very solid choice. I went there for a birthday dinner for my sister with 2 other friends. This place is simply a tapas restaurant. You order a number of tapas and they bring them out one at a time which I like.....you are able to take your time. So lets review. Atmosphere: Even despite NYC being in a snow storm all day today. Business was closing early and companies were letting employees leave work early. Even after all this, Boqueria was still open and it was busy inside. This by itself says something about the restaurant and its reputation. It had a very lively atmosphere which I think is essential for certain dining excursions to enjoy. Decor: The decor was nice inside. They use off white and wood trimings with lights...very fitting decor for the cusine. Service: Service was on point. They had a busser come by our table and clean the crumbs off of our table (we made a little mess with the paella). They were able to bring one tapa after the other when we were done with each one. Timing was perfect. Also, we didn't even mention it was my sister's bday and we got a complimentary dessert and glass of wine. It shows that they are attentive. Food: Ok....I'm not really sure how to judge spanish food but here is what I can say. We had Cream of Mushroom (fried in small balls) and cream of chicken (fried in squares) and it was tasty. Next tapa we had was brusselsprouts with chorizo...nothing special....chorizo made it taste better. After we had that, they brought out flatbread with goatcheese with chorizo and I believe it was argula on top of it. What I liked about the flatbread was that the goatcheese was not very strong but mild. I'm not a fan of goatcheese but I like the goatcheese that came with the flatbread. Our last tapa was paella with mini clams, oysters, chorizo, and shrimp. The paella was buttery in a good way and very tasty. For wine, I had Guiellerma (sp?) or something like that...spanish version of pinot noir. It had a very sweet smell with hints of honey and wood. When tasting it was more bittersweet not a traditional pinot noir. Overall....Boqueria is a solid choice to eat at or take a date to.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The best sushi I ever had!   I saw so many pictures of this amazing sushi on yelp.  I've been meaning to try this place for some time.  I finally tried it and it's so good! Usually when you get vegan sushi it's just boring avocado or cucumber rolls.  What you get at this place is creative and well though out sushi rolls, that are made with real fresh ingredients.  The presentation was really high end too.   I ordered the special January roll which had grilled eggplant, black rice, and an olive sauce to name a few ingredients.  I also got the piece of the month which was a Roasted Caviar with Dehydrated Kalamata Olive.  I also got the Mighty Mushroom.  Everything was full of flavor. Also the staff was really friendly too.   My favorite sushi place in NYC.  It's such an awesome concept.  FInally healthy creative vegan sushi!   Can't wait to try more things from their menu!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My first time having Himalayan cuisine and it was pretty good. However, most of the items and sauces were a bit spicy for myself. My spice tolerance is low. The delicious mango lassi helped the heat. Aside from the spice, the chicken lollipops were delicious. I expected more from the garlic nan, a bit bland/saltless but I guess you are supposed to dip in sauces but they were too spicy for me so I ate it plain. Had the Yak momos, half steamed and half fried. Great to know we had the option. My first time having a momo and the meat was a bit dry/hard since the meat was so lean. Maybe I expected too much but I was not wowed. I do want to come back and try the chicken momos. We also had a sizzling plate with spaghetti and pork chop, probably mad a bad decision to have pork chop because it was super dry , the sauce gave it taste but it was dry and overcooked. Might try Chicken sizzling platter next time instead. The menu had many varieties. I will give this place another try in the near future. But I must say the service was great and I liked the ambiance.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love that there are so many vegetarian options (about half the menu, a rarity for a tapas restaurant). I come for two things: the fried brussels sprouts (I have unsuccessfully tried to recreate the dish at home) and the sangria. Also good: the fried goat cheese with lavender-infused honey and creamy truffle gnocchi. The only plate I am not a fan of is the chicken wings because they're bland. Desserts are so-so (they don't have churros, my favorite!).  Overall though, Alta never disappoints! Try to get seating upstairs for a bit more privacy.

"The first time I ate at this place, I was delighted by the fresh taste of the seafood. I have gone at least 3 more times and the service and freshness of the food has since plummeted. The last time I had gone was the last straw. The calamari was rubbery, we were seated by the kitchen in the back of the establishment when there were plenty of open tables available in the front of the restaurant. I didnt't mention that there was an air conditioner dripping water onto my friend. My friend just ordered a side of fries because she wasn't in the mood for much else since she was just accompanying me so that I could satisfy my calamari craving. All of the french fries that was served were tiny BITS of fries...no long fries. The fries appeared as if they were the last of a large bag of fries. The waitress didn't seem to happy to bring me another container of tartar sauce either. I must mention that I am a Black woman because I feel it matters upon watching my waitress and where others were seated. I am over fish.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"3.5 stars. This place is a tad bit more expensive than your typical halal cart. Chicken over rice is about $6. The white sauce is actually tahini sauce; it's not the typical white sauce that most halal carts have. And the salad included pickles. Oh, and each gyro comes with 1 piece of falafel. I thought the food was good. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The falafel was crisp on the outside, and had great texture on the inside as well. The guys are pretty nice. I asked them to put more chicken and less rice in 2 of the gyros, and they said they can do it for all 3 if I'd like; I thought that was pretty generous of them. The food wasn't incredible/amazing, though, and so I don't quite understand the hype. Granted, I still need to try the other things they offer, so I will be back when I'm in the area. Warning - stand back when they are chopping the chicken on the grill. Things tend to fly...","[1.0, 0.0]"

I enter the one room dumpling house salivating.  I came here with two friends and the GF who felt claustrophobic in the room with only 5 stools.  I place an order for the group and the chow down begins.  The dumplings were tasty but ive had dumplings just as good.  If you dont know about dumplings, get the boiled ones if you want a soft exterior wrap with a juicy center while the fried gives u a little crunchier outside while the juicy pork center sends flavor all over your mouth(sorry if its too sensual). The sesame pancakes were by far the best thing on the menu.  We tried the duck, chicken, and beef triangular morsels of goodness.  The inside also has carrot and cilantro with the meat.  It was nice to see the gentleman make these on the spot, we were there for a while, he makes it just like a pizza. The prices was prob the best part with the diverse crowd.  while we were there the crowd had two IB bros, a guy on crutches, a grandmother with her daughter, and a bunch of other people to make a massive melting pot.   Grab some siracha and have a nice fulfilling cheap meal in chitown.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Stopped by on an early Wednesday evening with my friend, and although we were seated right away, it was literally at these communal style tables where the group next to us refused to move their things over so that we were kind of sharing an end side of the table with the door constantly closing and opening on my back.... kind of annoying, and my friend stuck in the walkway between a big guy at the bar and the big ( mean literally a big block of wood) table. Decor is great, kind of English country meets French cafe meets Italian food. Haha! I'm sure if I had a better seat I might have given it a better rating. The food was pretty good, but very very minimal... it's almost like a very gourmet way of cooking where they say minimal and natural is best.  For example I ordered the mixed salad with mozzarella, and it literally was mixed big leaf greens, a teaspoon of oil and a lemon with two small chunks of mozzarella. Good, but not great, and waaaay to overpriced. Garlic bread was literally a baquette with toasted cloves of garlic on top! Hahaha! Salmon for entree, good, but you really can't go wrong with salmon. Overall it was an A-OK experience for me. But not worth the price. I'm not sure if I'm cheap, but $50 per person, and no alcohol and still hungry afterwards doesn't  really seem worth it to me. Especially since I had such a crap seating experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Me and my friend went to Arepas Cafe on the strength of reviews from Yelp. We like to try different restaurants a week and this place did not disappoint. The arepas were fresh and crisp and to my surprise very different from others I have had. I was used to the yellow corn and not the white. But the way it was prepared was definitely different and satisfying. The pernil, avocado and white cheese stuffed delight was a fave thatt I plan on venturing to again. With that, the passion fruit sangria was A-mazing. It was the exact amount of sweet with the exact amount of alcohol. The place itself is cute, a cafe that is small but  not cluttered.  The staff was friendly and our server was cool. There are tons of eateries in this area, but I'm glad I listened to Yelp reviewers on this one. Big Smile.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Lots of hype surrounding this place.  I looked forward to going as I've been in the neighborhood for 15 years and have seen more than a few restaurants retire from this ideal corner.  The food overall is probably better than 3 stars.  The watermelon salad was bland old melon pieces; I've had better from the deli. However, the duck breast and beet salad were phenomenal. Although the server was friendly, she tried to BS us on choosing a wine.  If she doesn't know a lot about the wines, she should just not offer advice; I would appreciate that more. The worst part was the music; the space is small, and they were playing very loud hip-hop. The place is more suited for mellow sounds.  I'll try to go again, but if I get there and hear hip-hop, I'm leaving.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I live in this hood, and the guac here is as good as it gets. I've tried everything on the menu, and my all-time favorite is the quesadilla. It's so gooood that even my gastroenterologist would disapprove. I'm not a huge fan of the tacos, but they're generously stuffed in case you're wondering. I also enjoy the burritos, but I wish I could replace the rice here with Chipotle's cilantro, lime rice. Anyway, I like this taqueria more than the one in the West Village. Why? Because it has A.C., and exudes this ""hole-in-the-wall"" feel. Side note: There are some ass-hole patrons here that will not only harass you, but demand you to get up if you're just saving the seats and you haven't ordered yet... just call up your homegirls and tell them to #@$# off. After that, inhale that burrito and be happy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Solid and welcomed concept but LOTS of work to be done here. Decor looks as if their designer quit half way through the project and was taken over by someones girlfriend ( or boyfriend for that matter )- wall of faux-aged photos and grinder part assemblages are so contrived, theyre almost beneath contempt. For a meal that is largely prepared in advance- meatballs, bread etc- the service was painfully slow. Made slightly more irritating by one of the apparent owner/chef types in whites, sitting on a kitchen counter- chit chatting. Meatballs (beef and pork) had decent  flavor but were somewhat under seasoned- pork was quite dry. No veal option on the menu seems strange for a place specializing in meatballs. Red sauce tasted like it was from a can or perhaps a jar- Could easily be improved upon by cooking it for 3 hours or so. Sides were soggy and lacking in variation. A selection of starters- assortment of mini meatballs perhaps- would have been welcomed. Ordering process, with customers filling out a 8.5x11 sheet of paper, is absurd and a waste of time- and paper if you're into the whole tree thing. After filling out our individual sheets, 2 out 3 of our orders were served wrong- not a huge deal to fix but slightly frustrating given the wait.This place will probably do well given its location- but with adjustments could absolutely do Great- start with the food, add service to taste and garnish with decor.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Once upon a time, Cho Dang Gol was my favorite Korean restaurant.  Those were the days before they opened three hotels on the same street.  Since then, the prices have risen significantly, the portions have dropped to abysmal sizes, and the banchan offerings are pitiful, to say the least. Consider that the ""tour of Korea"" was comprised of six tiny (read: bite sized) pajeon -- and cost $21.00.  Seriously? The only thing on the menu reasonably priced now is the soondubu and those, I'd say, are relatively top-notch if a little skimpy on portion size. I would absolutely avoid this restaurant at all costs.  It saddens me to think that once I could dine here and have mountains of banchan piled on, buy an appetizer and a main course and tea, and still have my bill come to less than $20; since the hotels have opened they simply don't cater to the same audience.  Avoid, avoid, avoid. The only reason I think this restaurant deserves more than one star is because the quality of the food is high.  I admit that much.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Manzo.... was a tremendous disappointment.  The ego of the place is just unnecessary and unwarranted as are the prices.    I was told by their manager in a snotty condescending manner,  when i made a suggestion that if they wrote all their rules down they would have to write a book.. this IS a restaurant is it not?   not school? Are they aware that they are a restaurant sitting inside a giant gourmet grocery store?  essentially that is what it is after all... I have eaten at 5 stars all over the world, and NY especially is known for its good food.. Why would anyone return to this place? Portions are small, prices are high, food was very good but... not outstanding... service was surly and slow and management worse they offer a tasting menu for 90 dollars which is nice.. but if you want to order it, your entire group is required to have it otherwise you have to sit by yourself.   my brother in law is from torino, and he lives in the states now.  he has waited a year to come try this.    and they refused to serve it to him..   we said we didn't care if his meal was timed differently than ours we just wanted him to get this as it was for him that we were there for... they not only were not accommodating, but very rude about it..","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Queens Comfort brings exactly what the title offers to the table, comfort food.  The chicken and waffles were comparable to some of the best I've had and that includes Amy Ruth's, and Rosco's.  They have a little spice kick to it, which I do enjoy, but felt a little TOO heavy on the artery clogging side.  The Disco Tots are amazing.  What hipster establishment isn't complete without the soon to be extinct Mexican Coke?  For the food, easily a 4 star in Queens. The dining room has a large communal central table with smaller tables encompassing it.  There is another square table in the corner to fit a couple parties near the entrance and there is also bar seating.   Service, once you are able to be served, is top notch.  Waitress is very helpful and accommodating.  Most everyone here is young and enthusiastic to please you with their food.  However, this is where youth is a shortcoming. Queens Comfort is open mostly in the afternoon, then closes and reopens again in the evening.  Sunday it is open only for brunch.  If you have the unfortunate chance of coming here for Sunday brunch, god help you.  Queens Comfort isn't the place to go to on a whim.  Premeditated planning is required and especially on Sundays.  Yes there is often a line and no the ""estimated"" time they give you is no where near the actual time.  To avoid this, come as early as possible, and I'm talking about close to opening time. It was a balmy October Sunday when I had experienced this Queens Comfort.  The grips of winter had not yet squeezed the life out of the city.  2:00pm, my friends who were visiting and I decided to give it a try unaware of the ride we would be put through.  ""Party of 4, probably like a 30 minute wait.""  This was not a problem and it would have left plenty of time for them to make their 5:00 appointment at ground zero.  15 minutes pass and I peak inside to assess the situation.  The bar seating was empty, so I asked the host if it would be ok if we just sat at the bar and ordered.  As if the available seating manifested upon him like a bright idea, he stated that he would need to ask others before us if they wanted it.  I thought we should have been rewarded for pointing it out, but at least it'll make the line go faster.  Total of 30 minutes have elapsed, so I check on the progress.  With a clueless expression he surveys the room, ""Maybe like 30 minutes?""  So 30 minutes later, with the line shorter due to the now available bar seating, it's going to be another 30 minutes?  Upon further inspection of the dining area, there were plenty of tables with guests who have finished just chatting away or even worst typing up stuff on their phones.  Essentially they were holding up the seats that would have been available to the other people waiting.  I understand you want to keep hospitality by not ""nudging"" them away, but you're forcing others to wait for no reason.  Finally after a total of 1.25 hours (that's 1 hour and 15 minutes in case the guy who can't tell time is reading) to a near empty room.  Essentially being the very last group to be allowed to eat.  We were the privates of the army, the rookies of the team, the dog begging at the table; only after everyone else gets their fill are we allowed to pick the scraps.  Not surprisingly some items were sold out, but thankfully not the best. We had all agreed the food was great, the service once served was excellent, but the wait was not worth the trouble.  If the wait was truly 30 minutes as first advertised, it would have been a flawless brunch.  However since we were baited with a carrot on a stick to linger around for over an hour, it made the sweet taste of syrup just a little bit sour.  I do not advise going on Sunday afternoon unless you feel lucky.  I will have to try another time to really gauge the wait time.  We might have been unfortunate, or maybe an hour is a really good wait time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is pretty new.  The decor and lighting are very hip. My friends reserved a table downstairs because they wanted the self service beer on tap (table side), but when they arrived they were told there was no more room.  So they reserved 4 tables for on the 1st fl.  Meanwhile the downstairs was crowded, so it all worked out. There's a private room on the 1st fl in the back (separated by beaded metal chains). The drinks were mixed well and there was several selections of beer on tap at the bar on the 1st Fl.  On a Saturday night, the music was weird.  It was country and what I would describe as ""old people music.""  My friend said she came on a Sunday for brunch and there was hip hop and new pop hits, so it was very weird.  The DJ looked like Jesus and had a cowboy hat on.  I guess music depends on the DJ they've booked. Everything was good, except when we approached the bar for more drinks.  The female bartender was not nice at all.  She told us we had to open a tab because it was getting very annoying to keep charging us.  I thought it was really rude the way she said it.  The male bartender, the times we did get him was really nice.   I'd suggest calling ahead to see what type of DJ they've got booked.  We didn't get to try any food but noticed quite a few people eating at the bar.","[1.0, 0.0]"
My husband and I showed up at 3:30 on a Sunday & were able to get a table immediately. We both ordered the salmon Benedict.... It came out quickly but our plates were very different. Mine had half the amount of salmon on it. And neither Benedict had much hollondaise sauce on it. I told the waitress & she listened & just walked away. She brought more salmon & hollondaise. But never said sorry about that or anything. The problem was fixed but kind of odd. The eggs Benedict were tastey. Home fries were good. The only other negative is the brunch drinks are pricey. They don't reflect the atmosphere or food prices. I would have ordered cocktails if they had been reasonably priced. FYI this is coming from a former waitress.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"SO DISAPPOINTED!! My friends and I came here today for brunch to celebrate a birthday. The Hostess and Bartender were so nice and professional and the wait for the table of 4 was maybe 20 minutes. We sat down and eventually ordered our food, the waitress was all right but you could tell she was working a lot of tables and trying to accommodate everyone, so when she forgot something it was not a big deal. It came time for the bill, which came out to $92.00. I handed the waitress (Nicole) 2 Twenty Dollar Bills, 2 Five Dollar Bills, and 8 Singles in total $58.00 in cash (which I counted out loud THREE times) and told our waitress to place the remaining $34.00 on my card.  When she handed me the receipt to sign she charged my card $54.00 dollars which was incorrect. I assumed maybe there was a misunderstanding so I informed the waitress about the bill. The waitress (Nicole) said I only gave her 1 Twenty Dollar Bill, 2 Five Dollar Bills and Eight Singles, she was almost arguing with me before she went back to check how much I initially gave her. TEN MINUTES go by and we're just waiting at our table until a guy comes over does not introduce himself and says, ""there appears to be a discrepancy with the bill""...Yes, because where is the 20 Dollars that I gave you guys. We tried to tell him what happened but its as if he ignores what we said and then gets defensive and says to us "" YOU ONLY GAVE HER (waitress) 1 Twenty Dollar Bill, 3 Five Dollar Bills(Now its three 5's and no singles?), YOU GUYS WANNA GET UP TO CHECK TO SEE IF YOU DROPPED THE MONEY ON THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING"". At this point my friends and I become upset and then we ask for the Manager, and he informs us His name is BLAIR and he's the Manager. A proper Manager is supposed to uphold certain standards of the restaurant and ensure customers do not leave the restaurant with a negative experience. After I say I've never experienced this type of service I'm never returning, he goes ""OK!"" and walks away. A friend of mine stops the Waitress to ask her what happened she replies ""well I don't know I counted $38.00, sorry"" smiles and walks away nonchalantly. As we're leaving totally upset, another friend of mine asks BLAIR (THE MANAGER), ""What kind of service is this and aren't the customer always right?"" BLAIR responds ""In certain instances"".  The Manager does provide a mediocre apology for what he said to us at the table, after we stated we we're offended. The Manager then begins to argue with my friend (A Paying Customer), and says to us ""IF IT'S THAT BIG A DEAL I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET...BECAUSE I GOT IT LIKE THAT?"" The money so rudely offered came out of his POCKET, was the exact missing amount of money in the exact fashion, which I initially handed the waitress....you can be the judge on that. Also, then the Manager and proceeds to tell us to NOT COME BACK! Never have I ever been so mistreated in an establishment. I really wanted to support this place, because the food is good and the overall vibe of the place is mellow and kind of relaxing. But, the situation could've been addressed in a different way if the MANAGER would've listened to the customer instead of coming to our table with a one-sided point of view. Overall the MANAGER BLAIR and WAITRESS NICOLE left my friends and I with a terrible feeling of being disrespected, we will not EVER be returning!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After waiting 45 mins at Tia Pol down the street only to be told that it would be an additional 25 min wait, my group of 4 and I decided to head down 10th Ave in search of something better, something to show tia pol, HA! And also, we were getting pretty hungry. No surprise, after veto-ing the diner across the street, we were sold by the cookshop, pretty much the first restaurant we passed by. We were seated pretty much immediately, in a booth and within first 5 minutes of being handed the menus, a list of amazing entrees were listed and in-decisions soon followed. Everything sounded wonderful - the menu seemed innovative, definitely new american. In the end, i settled for the suckling pig, which was an absolute delight to eat. The peaches were the perfect compliment to the dish, and the balance of flavors were fantastic. The greens on the plate also provided a tangy-ness, more acidic balance, which somehow made the plate lighter. My fellow diners ordered scallops, lamb (soft, almost fall off the bone with great flavor), and duck (delicious!). The portions were huge, and by the time we've licked our plates clean, we had no room for dessert....but this simply means that i'll be returning to sample more of their deliciousness.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In Japan, Ootoya is cheap and fast Japanese food chain restaurant; so I was very surprised when I came to Ootoya in NYC, it was a very nice surprise, as the venu and presentation was much nicer and the food was delicious as well. I came here twice for weekend brunch, unfortunately both time the queue was very long. So be prepared to line and make sure that you were not starving when you arrive. It's very likely you gonna wait for an extra 30 - 45 minutes before you can sit at the table. Each time I came with a number of friends and we all tried different dishes and to be honest, they are all very good. I don't think any dish would let you know down!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"1st experience w/ Malaysian food & Nyonya definitely set the standard!! i'd say malaysian is like a fusion of chinese & thai food, even their menu offers blatant chinese & thai options so I singled out the malaysian dishes! ----roti canai: like a PAPERTHIN indian naan w/ yummy dipping sauce ----BEEF RENDANG: stewed beef w/ the tendon! Mmm MELT IN YOUR MOUTH meat in its own gravy ----chow kueh teow: malaysian noodles w/ a spicy kick & JAM PACKED with flavor ----nasi lemak: the curry chicken was flavorful & i liked the crispy fried anchovies, comes w/ a HUGE mound of rice.. but i wish the rice & ingredients were wrapped together so the flavors would infuse ----free tea for the table!! service is QUICK & for such a well known restaurant the prices for the noodle dishes are pretty cheap! meats a little more expensive but that's expected!!

"another flawless experience at The Little Owl! A group of four came last night to celebrate one of my best friends birthday's - so obviously i wanted everything to be perfect.  We got what I think is the best table in the house......well in the tiny dining room!  We had the corner table and a fantastic server who looked straight out of a 1940's movie. love it. I can't remember what wine we had, it was a Sangiovese, but i do know that we had three bottles of it so apologies in advance dear yelpers - if i seem hazy in this review! once again we started with one slider each - they are seriously amazing.  the perfect size - the meat is beyond tender, flavorful and moist and the sauce...ooooh the sauce.  little owl i dont know what you do, but you do it well. I had a really interesting seared foie gras salad with pears, greens, currants (maybe they were cranberries?).  What an innovative and interesting way to serve foie! i loved it, although i would have prefer more pieces of the diced foie....as every  bite with that was a surprise and the silky, creamy texture paired with the cold, crunchy greens, tangy dressing and fruit was an amazing combination.  I also had a few bites of the deliciously light ricotta farfalle in tomato broth with greens.  I think it was the exact same recipe as the ricotta gnocchi i had this summer and it was ah - mah - zing. i shared a plate of the crispy chicken and the lamb with my girlfriend and GIRLFRIEND! i feel like walking in to little owl, doing a catwalk turn with some snaps, and saying to the kitchen ""that, bitches, is how you do some crispy skin chicken"".  I'd be wearing high heel boots and some sort of fabulous coat - obviously. anyways, back to reality. the chicken was beautiful.  crispy, succulent skin, moist meat and served with potatoes and brussels...yummers!  The lamb was amazing as well - i shared my half with someone else and i think i gave him the best part, which is cool, but the piece I had was a ltitle boney and not alot of meat but what I was able to taste was deeeeelish.  The boys both got the ENORMOUS pork chops, which were cooked to perfection! dessert was apple crisp with ice cream and i made sure to confirm the brown sugar/butter/crispy goodness crumbly top when i ordered and i was NOT disappointed! the little owl is a fabulous spot for a date, a celebration and i sort of have a little dream fantasy now to rent out the restaurant for a private party....sigh. next up--- little owl brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We were wandering around my old neighborhood on my birthday, and looking for a nice happy hour spot where we could sit outside...thanks to my amazing happy hour phone app, we kept going into places to see if theyd let us do the hh specials outside, so we could sit in the sun...after about 5 places said no, only at the bar, we were about to give up. Walked from Riviera (vomit from past experiences) across the street and thought we'd give this our last ditch effort, and if they said no we'd just sit at the bar... SUCCESS! they said we could sit outside! and it was pretty empty since early for HH, so we had our pick of tables.  We'd just had margaritas/coladas at my favorite, Tio Pepe, but i don't like tequila, otherwise would have for sure tried the Cucumber Margarita she said was their specialty (actually I ordered it, but changed it to a glass of the house white). We had dinner in 2 hours, so didn't want to get anything to eat (plus honestly i dont get how people can eat when its hot as F outside??), but the white was a good quantity, and as I'm not a huge wine fan, as good a white wine as anywhere else, and only $5 (which many of the other places who wouldnt let us sit outside had as their prices also).

Anyways, I ordered 1 chicken, and 1 beef/lamb gyro. Turns out they ran out of fries (8PM on a Sunday night?!?). So i continued the order without the fries and went home. The chicken was ok, the tzatziki needed more of a bite (more garlic?) however the beef/lamb was very bland and to top it off a hair appeared from it.

I love their thick-cut bacon, and the day I went they offered a duck confit hash, which was buttery and savory and had that full duck flavor.

Staff is there to take your order, serve your food and give you your check asap. The overall experience of eating chinese food in chinatown is all about the FOOD. It's never about service, decor, nor atmosphere. Otherwise, it's not considered authentic chinese. You can goto PF Chang if you want the later.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Definitely a good spot for a nice atmosphere, diverse and delicious tapas selections, and great sangria.  I like this spot because it's more overall european/mediterranean tapas instead of strictly spanish like some places.  The food was excellent.  The brussels sprouts side was even more wonderful than the enthusiastic waiter suggested.  We had a great duck breast dish with a foie gras mousse that was perfectly prepared and delicious with the duck breast wrapped around scallion (like a negimaki at a japanese place) and a big artistic smear of the mousse  on the plate... very nice.  Also a sea scallop dish with caviar, artichoke puree and a lemon beurre blanc was beautifully prepared and perfectly cooked.  Prices were reasonable, and so was the wine list.  Will definitely go back, but FYI they are cash or AMEX only.  Good date place, very romantic with lots of candles and cozy atmosphere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Johny's doesn't have extraordinary food, and it doesn't have an extraordinary atmosphere. So why all the five star reviews, guys? I don't understand. I had a pretty fierce craving for a breakfast sandwich and I needed to stop by The Container Store on 19th St. anyway, so I figured I'd use the opportunity to check out Johny's, which has been sitting on my bookmark list for awhile now. I ordered an egg, turkey bacon, and swiss cheese breakfast sandwich on an English muffin. No big deal. What I received was an egg, turkey bacon, and American cheese breakfast sandwich on an English muffin. That's pretty close to what I ordered, so I just shrugged it off and ate my sandwich. But still: a five star (or even four star) diner shouldn't be making mistakes like that. It tasted ... pretty much how I expected it to taste. Here, we'll do a visualization. Close your eyes -- wait, no, then you can't read this. So don't close your eyes. Just relax. Now imagine you're eating a slightly soggy English muffin with some totally average eggs, too-greasy turkey bacon, and a slice of bright orange processed cheese inside. Got the idea? Then I think you'll know what to expect at Johny's, where the food doesn't exceed expectations. And one extra thing: I noticed that the cook was using the same big knife to cut everything. That's a pretty standard diner thing, right? Except apparently earlier he had cut a sandwich with a disgusting ton of mayonnaise and hadn't wiped the knife, so the thing was absolutely smeared with the vile stuff. I sat there, in tense horror, watching as he inadvertently added mayonnaise to two, three, four orders before mine. My muscles were all prepped to spring out of my chair and stop him from defiling my breakfast in the same way, but luckily he plopped my sandwich on a plate without cutting it. My point: mayo-phobes (like me) might want to keep one eye on the cooking area to make sure your food doesn't arrive befouled. As for the atmosphere, I guess the whole formica-and-fluorescent thing might be ... what, a refreshing change of pace (maybe?) for people who, like, grew up on the Upper East Side and never left. But for those of us from the Great Unwashed West, it's really not very exciting. If you're looking for a diner with a fascinating, fun, five star atmosphere, try Stage. I might come back to Johny's to try a few more things, like the pancakes, just because there has to be some justification for all of the high reviews. But I'm not certain. After all, I've got a lot of restaurants to try and only limited real estate in my stomach, so it might be awhile before I give Johny's a second chance. Onward and upward, right?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a lovely neighborhood restaurant. I love that Zizi Limona does not adhere to one med country's particular cuisine, but rather includes tastes from a variety of countries.  The beer and wine selection also represents a mix of med countries, and my husband and I were very appreciative to sample a variety of beers specifically. First, they greet you with warm pita and tahini.  It's very tasty. For apps, we had the grilled eggplant, the gravlox, and the shishito peppers.  Of the three, the gravlox was the best.  The grilled eggplant app was smaller, so I'd skip it next time.  It still tasted delicious, though, so it doesn't decrease my star rating. We had a special salad that included grilled artichokes, black olives, yogurt sauce, arugula, and anchovy aioli. Then, we had shakshuka, which was equally scrumptious. Our servers were cheerful, attentive, and knowledgeable.  It's clean, relaxed and homey.   All in all, I highly recommend checking this place out!  We will be back...and soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Fetta Sau is a very good representation of Northern / dry rub BBQ.   Love the hole in the wall conversion of the old garage.  Walk down the narrow driveway with a few picnic tables and pray that the line is not a mile long.   Now wait....and wait.....and wait for your turn at the counter.   During the wait pray that the items you plan on ordering do not get erased from the board.  Finally you get your turn......like all others have said you order by the pound so you can order as little or as much as you want.   We had been eating all day so stuck with the Berkshire pork shoulder and the Angus brisket.   Added an order of burnt end baked beans and rolls for a nice mid-day snack.   Food was very good.   Not a real heavy smoke to either protein, but an excellent, heavy (almost charcoal) bark.   Both were moist with the internal fat left and a nice caramelization  to the out side.  The dry rub is not overpowering as to leave the nuisance of the meat.   The table has two sauces.   The vinegar sauce is very acidic and does cut the richness of the fat.  The tomato based sauce is more on the sweet side then spice.   The beans are very meaty and the burnt end flavor comes thru strongly.   Overall:  I ate every last ounce and enjoyed each bit.  It was very good, but just a step under excellent.  Personally, I like a bit more smoke and spice to the dry rub.    Main Pro:  love the room and high quality of the food.  Cons:   price is high and the wait must be brutal when the line stretches to the street.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am extremely happy to have visited such an amazing restaurant. Not only was the service great but everything we ordered from appetizers to dessert was exquisite. It was my first time there as well as my first date with my significant other and it was the best place we had ever visited hands down. The enviornment was beautiful, classy, romantic and if your into jazz then you will enjoy it themore, that was the cherry on top! We had spinach dip for appetizer, first entree was spicy tuna roll sushi and another tuna sushi with a japanese name. Second entree was Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and brocolli and crab cakes with cole slaw and french fries. Dessert was the apple pecan pie, which was so delicious! Anywho, I loved the waiter, the food, the food presentation and the enviornment. We will definately go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Vesta has a rotating menu and you can always be sure that the food will be great! They source a lot of their food locally (Brooklyn Grange Farm in Astoria and upstate wines) and they are always friendly. Highlights (of late): the poached eggs for brunch are divine and their pizzas are always good (crispy crusts and the toppings are not held in lashings of cheese). We often come away feeling good after eating here. And, when we lived close by, would often order pizzas to go. The worst thing about moving from Astoria: no Vesta!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"No. 1 with a little bit of spice. This is the place to get a Vietnamese sandwich. I seriously can't imagine anyone giving this place under 4 stars.

Everything about this Vietnamese sandwich is PERFECT, I've had only one bad sandwich in the 10000x that I've been here.

"DINNER REVIEW: Is it weird that I had no idea that Japanese-tapas restaurants existed prior to my dining experience here? This place is exceptional!  I was third-wheeling here for dinner and I have to say I was expecting to order from a Sushi menu.  Of course not every small plate dish is going to be good, but it's about the options you get! There is a variety of small plates to order from so don't expect to try them all on your first visit.  I do recommend ordering the TAKOYAKI KARA AGE (deep-fried octopus balls), HOKKE SHIOYAKI (grilled hokke fish), and my favorite of course, TAKO WASA (marinated raw octopus). They also have a nice selection of drafts, but I wasn't drinking that night. As for the ambiance, I really enjoyed great lighting and trendy atmosphere here. It does get very packed during dinner hours, but the wait wasn't very long so no need to worry about that!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"An Iberico ham, it's prickly boar hairs still intact, greets you at the front entrance... how cool is that? I love this place. The bocadillos are amaaaazing. I've tried the Navarrico (spicy sausage, Roncal sheep's milk cheese, and piquillo peppers), the Picante (chorizo, Mahon cheese, spicy piparras, tomatoes, and aioli), and the Quijote (dry cured pork, Manchego, and quince cream). I'd say my favorite has been the Quijote... I like the salty-sweet thing. The pinxtos are yummy as well. A few of my favorites: boquerones (baguette slices topped with lightly pickled anchovies and tomato), sardina picante (baguette topped with sardine and hot tomato sauce). My favorite one, however, is the baguette topped with baby eels. The baby eels are tossed in olive oil and are not fishy at all! I was also pleased to see that Despana had opened an extra room with 3 communal tables since I had been there last. No more lurking around the solitary table hoping to secure a seat. I love that Despana has bottles of good olive oil sitting on every table so you can drizzle oil into your soup, on your sandwich, or on your pinxtos as you desire.   A selection of meats, cheeses, marinated fish, olive oils, and other imported Spanish items available for purchase.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We went to have a drink with the intention of going elsewhere. This is due to our preconceived poor attitude - ""oh it's Bobbly Flay, can't be that good. (given how touristy Mesa Grill / Bar American are in midtown)"" However, the space is beautiful with vaulted ceilings and a sizable bar. The glass window into the kitchen revealed Bobby himself hustling away. So after the first cocktail we realized that the food actually looked pretty good, and smelled even better, so we opted to stay. We were not disappointed. Bar snack trio (great pairing for cocktails at the bar) is sociable and fun. The eggplant, layered potato were highlights. Then we moved along into the crab risotto (amazing) and spicy octopus salad, finishing off with the juicy pork chop. One of the other signature dishes is the rabbit - which on Friday night was sold out. The wine list is impressive and unique, yet approachable. All in all, Gato is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Check your attitude at the door and enjoy. Loud, social and bustling make it suitable for big groups.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is probably one of the better Italian places in Murray Hill (at least in my opinion).  The main reason I go here so often is because it is close to where I live.  It has a very modern atmosphere and many well-executed dishes, and they have outdoor seating in the warmer months of the year. This is also a great place for people with dietary restrictions (not that it applies to me).  Service has been good on the several occasions I have gone, and you can make reservations online ahead of time for groups.  The portions for the entrees do run on the smaller end of the spectrum, so I usually order a few appetizers in addition to the entree to make it a solid meal.  This could be a plus for people looking for a lighter dinner at an Italian restaurant.  Overall, it's a decent place for dinner, but perhaps a bit overpriced based on the amount of food you get.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you're coming to Jane for brunch, definitely make a reservation. I've always had great service here, from getting seated immediately to constant coffee refills. The best way to approach brunch is for one person to get the french toast and another to get a salad (the seared ahi tuna is quite tasty). That way you don't feel like a cow after finishing all 4 bricks of french toast goodness. The benedict Johnny (corn cakes and chicken sausage) is also very good. One issue though - the tables are rather close to one another so if you happen to sit next to a 4 top ordering 4 benedicts, you will suffer the wrath of the hollandaise.

"Baby Shower. The pregnant girl should not leave her party hungry. I do not recommend having a party at the ""hip"" Palo Santo in Park Slope. I thought this would be the perfect venue for a small baby shower in the back room, but I was mistaken. I have had 2 lovely brunch experiences in the past year, so I expected to be happy with the buffet provided.  Upon arrival people were sitting in our room and we were not greeted by anyone. It almost looked like we were an hour early for our party. This would not have been such a big deal and would have been forgotten if everything else was well executed. I come from a family of caterers and have worked in the restaurant industry for years so I expect a certain level of service when sending top dollar. Onto the food. Basically, there was not enough of it. The buffet looked like we were given left overs from another party. The server put out small platters of food. The only meat option was pork belly. I over heard a guest say it was 85% fat. This was accurate and embarrassing.  This is an odd only meat option to put out for a brunch/lunch buffet. Not many women would choose to eat pork belly fat ever. My mother and I booked this party and didn't actually get to try everything because the buffet ran out of food and was never fully replenished. I asked the manager to please refill the buffet bc everyone has not had enough to eat and he said sure. It was refilled with rice, beans, plantains, bacon, and asparagus. I asked if that was all they were putting out and he explained that once that is eaten he would replenish. At this point I knew we had made a bad decision to have the party at this location. He assured me that no one would leave hungry. He was snide and unprofessional. At the after party at my apartment people had a few cocktails and admitted that they did in fact leave hungry! Luckily, I had snacks ready because I know how to entertain.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here for Restaurant Week because their menu seemed more interesting than the usual Hanger Steak/Chicken options.   Appetizer: Braised Rabbit Legs- I somehow expected this dish to have an actual rabbit leg with bones and all but it was already deboned and very tender.  It was a very generous portion of meat for an appetizer but unfortunately was a bit too salty! Entree: Crispy Neck of Colorado Lamb- Again, I expected bones but I guess this place really likes pulling the meat off the bones for you! The lamb was good but not what I had expected.  It was a log shaped roll, fried and crispy on the outside and filled with meat on the inside.  Was not really a fan of the eggplant puree- didn't really seem to go with the lamb too well and I thought the greek yogurt just tasted like sour cream... Dessert: Vanilla Cheesecake- The cheesecake was delightful!  Not to sweet and very soft and fluffy!  The blood orange sorbet however was such a disappointment!  I love blood oranges but this sorbet somehow tasted like Flinstones chewable vitamins.  Blech.   I like that they give you snickerdoodles with your bill but I'm sorry- those snickerdoodles were NOT good.  I've made better ones.  It was a nice thought but such a fail.   Restaurant week menus are not always the best so I would probably be willing to give this place another shot.  It wasn't an awful meal but it was no 5 star experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

As requested the nice waitress brought me a pitcher of water, and humoured me when I had no idea what to order. Turns out, the pork chops with tons of salad instead of rice and a side of the grilled asparagus was EXACTLY what I needed. DELICIOUS, tons of food, and all for $15.

"Well, first of all we were going to go to Carmine's but they did not accept reservations, so someone recommended Tony's instead. That being said, I would definitely wait at Carmine's next time. The place was loud and crowded. The waiter had a heavy accent, yet non-Italian as one may expect at an ""authentic Italian"" restaurant, if you added something or changed your mind, he became annoyed. All he wanted was a quick turnover on his tables.....the menu says each plate serves 2-3 people, so with 4 people we decided to order a pasta dish (since each entree comes solo, no sides), chicken piccata, and a calamari/shrimp combo appetizer. The calamari was tough. What a disappointment. I mean rubbery, chewy tough. Seemed to take a while before the entrees came after that. Don't know if that was the crappy waiters fault or the kitchen. The chicken came with 4 half breasts, and the pasta was a single piling across the plate, not the heaping platefuls we were used to at Carmine's. Did I mention that the food was luke warm at best? It seems the suaces had flavor but the temperature of the food took away from that.Very disappointing. Once we had placed our entree orders our waiter became non-existent. We had to flag him down to ask for dessert and then again to get the check to get the heck out of there. I do have to say, the tiramasu was authentic and one of the best I have had. And I have sampled a lot across the country. Dessert was the saving grace with this place. It, too, was enough for the table to share. In closing, I would say for approximately 29.00 an entree, even though it is supposed to be enough for 2-3, it was disappointing. I would def. reco, the wait at Carmine's over this joint.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After recently hearing about the opening of a fresh seafood restaurant in Red Hook, my wife and I (two Brooklyn natives) decided to give it a try. Unfortunately we were told by the two unfriendly hostesses that it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait when there were plenty of open empty tables both upstairs and downstairs. It was 100 degrees out, like many Brooklyn natives and unlike many of the hipster migrants that frequent this establishment, I refused to wait in the heat when there were so many open tables available. It is a shame that many of the new restaurants that are popping up in Brooklyn are being dominated and frequented by droves of hipsters.

"Don't get me wrong: I am an ardent fan of Gaia's food. The sandwiches are absolutely delicious (try 'Bubi' or 'Elegante') as are the pastries (especially the chocolate filled croissants). The pasta is not for me but the fresh baked bread, Italian meat and cheeses are sent from heaven. The salads are great too and Gaia is one of a few places in town that is actually serious about serving freshly squeezed orange juice (no Tropicana added). Alas...were it not for Gaia's (the owner) temperament, I would go there again. The last three or four times I went I clashed with Gaia's bad mood and felt myself moving back in time. Remember when you were little and your parents would scold you for bad behavior? Only this time I had not come home too late or dropped one of my mother's favorite dishes. Instead, I had asked Gaia for some extra bread, walked in during lunch hour (a capital offense it seems) or 15 minutes before closing. I certainly understand that Gaia is busy. And if there is no extra bread or she's already in closing mood, a simple heads-up would suffice. However, being shouted at in a condescending and abrasive voice is not my thing. It puts me back into my ten-year old shoes, which I kicked off a long time ago - and purposefully so. In sum, the food is great (and underpriced). The service is slow and often in a state of confusion, which I can deal with. But Gaia's mood swings are too much. Maybe I come back when my parents are in town.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Cheryl's makes my absolute favorite brunch in the whole entire world. There are a ton of reasons I'm sad I moved away from Brooklyn, but looking at the pictures of the gorgeous wood-paneled walls and unbelievable pancakes makes me wonder if I miss Cheryl's to a truly unhealthy degree. If you find pancakes more fluffy and incredible than Cheryl's, please tell me where! Everything I've had for brunch there is delicious. Notably: salmon hash, french toast with caramelized apples, a brie-and-apple omelette, a brie-and-fig baguette sandwich, and did I mention the BUTTERMILK PANCAKES with mixed berries and chantilly cream?! The staff are always kind, funny, and attentive. The space is beautiful (although too small for the crazy-busy brunches! The wait can be long). The patio in back is such a lovely surprise in the summer. Dinner is also delicious (and not crowded!), but ideally I would wish the vegetarian entrees were a little more interesting. They have moroccan vegetable stew and a portobello burger - both are delicious but underwhelming creatively. Overall: Pure love.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is a great little lunch spot!  I must have walked by this place a hundred times going to and from work, but always thought it was just a bakery or something.  So I finally tried it out for lunch and I have to say it was great! Service was timely, friendly, and very helpful.  Food was very tasty.  I had the croque madame and my fiance had the grilled chicken sandwich and we were very pleased. Looking forward to coming here again and trying the other things on the menu! A great place for lunch! I recommend it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My first NYC commenced here and i was excited to discover new york city in the eye of a gastronomically curious chef like me. The night before i was intending to go to momofuku but lo and behold, yelps review was not really appetizing on my first nyc food trip. And came across ippudo which is basically the original when it comes to pork buns and ramen making momofuku just a copy cat. The day was perfect for ramen as there are flurries outside and i feel like i was a native new yorker walking on westside. After a few hit and miss finally i found the place which is just very near the Qnr train stop. I was thinking from the outside looks quiet but once i got in, the queue was intimidating. Lucky i was all by myself and the host told m i can get my table in 20 mins and thought SWEET travelling alone has its perk after all. When i was walked thru my table all staff greeted me with a traditional japanese greeting despite the loyd music in the restaurant. The ambience is pretty rustic japanese and using all antique wood. Restaurant is pretty warm and cozy. Service is fast and basically wait staff knows the menu by heart. So for starters i ordered the famous hirata pork buns, which honestly i dont know what new yorkers are raving about these buns, im saying if your asian you must be really familiar with cuapao or pork bun. So its a mantoux bread wi a sliver of delicate babrbeque pork and some cos lettuce and japanese mayo. Then i had the te akamaru modern with extra chasu pork for entree. Its the usual tonkatsu ramen with soy umami dama miso topped with cabbage, mushroom scallions and fragrant toasted garlic oil. For the price and the authenticity of the taste you cant go wrong with this michelin endorsed ramen house. Definitely coming back there on my next visit..","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It pains me to leave such withering feed back for a once great restaurant.  Our last experience was so horrible I have waited nearly 8 months to cool down so as not to be too scathing.....where do I start.  The evening started out well actually.  Due to heavy rains throughout the day and early evening there was not the usual line and wait.  We were seated immediately.  When does that ever happen?  We felt that we were in our own Seinfeld episode where everything was going our way - we only experienced that feeling for a nanosecond.  Though the whole restaurant was basically open we were seated in a dark corner under a malfunctioning speaker that was crackling and snapping.  The music was blaring - not the usual music but top 10 teen music that would have been tolerable if the volume/speaker crackling weren't so loud.  Our waiter was a total jerk.  We couldn't get over how obnoxious he was - he was 25-30 with dark curly hair.  We thought nobody could get away with treating customers the way he did unless he was the owners son.  The rest of the workers seemed aware of him and ignored him at the same time.  He was repeatedly rude to every customer who came in.  He actually yelled from the bar area at a few people (while he stood their with a self satisfied smirk on his face singing along .....""you'd better run baby run faster than my bullet"".  We moved to a table that put some distance between us and the speaker so we could have a conversation.  Soon a small group of Asian business men sat next to us.  They had some problems reading the menu and asked a few questions.  There were so very polite.  One of the gentleman asked a question but due to the blaring music the obnoxious waiter actually screamed at him in the most scathing manner informing him ""We only speak English here buddy, if you want something you have to speak up and tell me straight"".  All four of the gentleman just stared at their thug waiter with dropped jaws.  If our food had not already arrived we would have left on the spot, the treatment was just that disturbing.  Our pizza suddenly became as tasteful as saw dust.  We felt stricken for the gentleman.  It was one of those rare moments when you are ashamed of being an American because your fear the victims will  think you too are in on and in agreement with such shocking behavior.  For a moment we thought there must be a hidden camera and this is all a joke.....maybe we are in a surprise Jersey Shore episode....We have come to Grimaldi's for years.  It was one of our favorites.  The service has hardly ever been good - with the exception of a delightful polish waiter that was around for years though we did not see him during our last visit.  In the past we came for the great pizza and found charm in a rather jaundiced way.  It pains us to say we will probably never go to Grimaldi's again nor bring our friends when visiting.  I can never in good conscience ever refer anyone to Grimaldi's again.  Even after 8 months my jaw clenches when I recall all the shocking details.  Grimaldi's really has an inflated measure of their worth if they imagine people should/would be treated in such a fashion.  If that belligerent customer distaining  twit worked in my restaurant I would spank him then give him the boot.  If this treatment continues, tourists will continue going for a while but the tide will eventually turn against Grimaldi's and a newer pizza darling will arise elsewhere providing gracious service along with wicked good pizza.  I sincerely hope it never comes to that.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they don't really know my name at Jimmy's Diner, but I feel like they could. Jimmy's has the personal homey feel that is MOST like ""the original Williamsburg"" in the 90s compared to every other place in the area.  Kookie, smallish, with great music, super-friendly staff, and a menu that has the aura of kids playing in a kitchen, producing many 'experimental' dishes... some fun, some foul. Hamburger, eggs, fries, pancakes...all safe bets. Sweets usually worth trying. Coffee superb. Milk shakes, out of this world.

"Trudged out to Lot 2 on a cold, snowy Friday night for a first time meal there with friends. I was not disappointed. The cocktails are a nice blend between standards (Manhattan, Old Fashioned) and inhouse creations (Derailleur, Mount Tam). The bartender thoughtfully gets the drinks JUST right - muddling, chilling glasses, giving the glass a nice zest rimming. Lovely. And the drinks were so much better (& cheaper) than Pegu Club or Hotel Crosby! But it's a small bar area ... and the night we were there, quite a few folks were also eating there. On the food front: the menu was quite limited - probably 5 apps/salads, 6 main courses. And it all looked like standard fare (except maybe the vegetarian fekkeh, which sounded rather unusual). But the dishes we ordered were lovingly made - and transcendent. All 4 of us raved about the spinach salad with lardons. Two of us had the short ribs, one the chicken & biscuits and I had the burger. I wish I had nabbed the last order of chick & bic instead of my friend, as it looked incredible ... and she left not a morsel on her huge plate! The short ribs were delectable, and I had order envy for them. My burger was tasty, served with a side of duck-fat fries. But when I go back, I'm definitely going to try the Sunday supper. They had the menu for the next one posted on the wall blackboard (pork loin!) If this meal was any indication of what Lot 2 can do with ALL comfort food, I might have found a new neighborhood favorite! (Sorry, Grocery - I can't always afford thee ....) The only caveat: the place can get very loud. Lots of hard surfaces with a full house of lubricated, happy diners raises the decibels. Not a big deal for me, but I know that if I tried bringing older family members here they would not be happy. With the food, yes. Volume, no.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Visiting friends in brooklyn, we decided to give this place a try for brunch. The staff was friendly but seemed stressed out. The mediocre experience here wasn't due to the bad service. The dishes on the menu were quite boring and not very creative, and neither was the design of the restaurant. No originality. Maybe they need to get a new chef. I came on to yelp to read other's reviews and wasn't surprised to find someone's link to former employees speaking out against their mistreatment at this place. I am a firm believer that the owners of a business is reflected on the staff and energy of a place. Wish I could give this place ZERO stars. Won't be coming back here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Hands down some of the best Frites I've had in NYC. Pommes Frites isn't the kind of place that you'd sit down and eat (although you can between the busy times), but rather a place to pick up and go somewhere else to enjoy (for me that's the benches in front of the Church about a block or two away). I don't know what their business hours are, but they're open pretty late, so you often see people coming out of the local bars on line. The place is pretty small and unless you know what you're looking for (or just a random line of people) you'll find it. They twice cook their frites and serve them with some of the most delicious sauces that I've tasted! The Vietnamese pineapple sauce is incredible, the mango chutney, the peanut satay, the black peppercorn, I mean I could go on forever. They're generous with the frites and stuff the bag with about 4 potatoes worth of frites, so unless you're committing ""carbicide"" I wouldn't suggest getting larger than a single; besides, the frites don't taste the same reheated anyways. All in all, I'd give them a four out of five stars. While the size, lines, and crowd of people may seem intolerable at times, those crispy golden frites with their delicious sauces make it all worth the while.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Note: Their bottles are cheaper than their drafts for the most part. Used a Scoutmob 50% off/$30 off deal -- making our $110 meal only $80 (sweet!). Prices still very good, even before discount.

"Vesta is the perfect example of how behind we are in Astoria on good restaurants. A restaurant that would have not even been considered better than ok in other boroughs, here, in our poor Astoria, has received the most amazing reviews and highest rates.   I went there the other night so eager after all the reviews. It was a disappointment. Very small wine selection although they avoid the predictability of wine lists of red sauce italian restaurants. The pastas were decent, but nothing I could not do at home. The pizza had its moments when you did not chew on the burned black dough. Which was the case 80% of the time. The fish was poorly seasoned the side course did not add on the overall flavor of the meal. The service was warm though and there is a conscious  effort to move away from cliches and stereotypes of ethnic restaurants in Astoria. I guess that is what everybody else is appreciating here, but to the extreme though. Please guys try harder you have the idea down.

The owners were so nice and friendly (pre long lines and ample yelp reviews). Been back a couple of times after that and i've always been happy. What happened? What once was a nice and cripsy crust became a charcol unedible mass of dough. Literally all the burnt charcol was all over my hands and face. My bf and i went back to artichoke and i told the worker that my pizza was unedible and black and i showed him the lump of coal that they sold me. He simply said, the sicilian pizza is ""supposed to be burnt."" Really? i've had silician pizza before buddy, and never was i able to use my pizza slice to write on the sidewalk as if it were black chalk. i would give them one star, but call me nostalgic for the good old days where i thoroughly used to enjoy their pizza.

"What can be said about Tom's that has not already been said. I've gone there and had so many different experiences and loved each one. I've gone there at the crack of dawn. I've gone there for lunch. I've been there with a large group of people. I've pulled a Susan Vega and been there alone. Regardless of the scenario Tom's never disappoints. I promise if you go early on a weekend (7-9) you won't be waiting long, if at all. On a weekday you can go even later without a wait, I'd say up till 11. You might have to wait on line at other times but that is part of the Tom's experience. What will you be served as you wait? Hot Cocoa? Coffee? Maybe burning hot french fries with a zesty/spicy dip? Whatever it is, it's fucking free. Grab a stool if you're by yourself (and pray Susan Vega comes by to sit next to you) or wait to be seated. You can sit in the main room which has two parts. The front could be tight but cozy. The back has booths and famous mementos of the diner on the walls. I personally like the second room with a view of the outside. You get to laugh at those suckers who are waiting outside in the cold. Get their attention and eat slowly in front of them, taunting them with the smile that only a meal from Tom's can provide. Now for the food. Milk shakes amazing. Pancakes best EVER. Pumpkin Walnut. Banana chocolate chip (not on the menu but they will make it for you if you ask). They're all great and they come with amazing spreads of jams and butters. You'll be in heaven. Crab cakes with my eggs? Yes please. Meatloaf sandwich, where have you been my whole life? Disco fries, the way disco fries were intended to be made. With cheese covering every fucking fry. Along with a cup of gravy which can be used to dip everything in the world. Cornbeef hash, sides of bacon, more crab cakes all wrapped up and dipped into my gravy!!!! I may gain five pounds and lose a year off my life every time but I don't give a fuck.

"This review is long over due. I took my friend here for her birthday and before she arrived, I told the owner (who is the sweetest person ever), that it was her birthday and was looking for a dessert to order. I told him she didn't like chocolate and even though all he had for the apple pie, was chocolate ice cream... he had someone run out to get vanilla. So nice. We then started to eat, as I'm sure you've gathered by now, it's BYOB (which is awesome). The food is really homey, simple, and refined - very good. We tried the mushroom cigars, which are HIGHLY recommended. We also tried the salmon and crab cake special... both were really delicious. After dinner, Ramon was banging on his glass saying ""Can I have everyone's attention please, it's Grace's Birthday, please help me sing to her"" and he whips out a beautiful apple pie with vanilla ice cream and a candle... the whole restaurant sang to her. It was the cutest thing ever and my friend was so surprised and delighted. The service is totally exceptional here, the food is lovely, and the place is very cozy and intimate. Make a reservation since it's small, and bring Cash only and some wine :) I can't wait to come back for brunch. What a stellar experience, just writing about it puts me in a good mood.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Personally I've been impressed with what the Farm tries to accomplish in terms of serving fresh local food. The interior as we walked in was very welcoming as everyone looked like they were enjoying the experience. Our hostess was nice and quickly situated us in a cozy corner. The shade grown/organic coffee was deliciously bold. I was very tempted by the mimosas though... Anyway, I had the sausage and eggs platter and the serving size was perfect. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy, the fresh salad were good too. The homemade sausage was good though I thought it was a bit too lean for my taste and the home fries were ok. I had a bite of my boyfriend's omelet (Ham & Gruyere) and amazing toast with homemade (?) butter and jam.

The three of us sat at the bar and ordered up anything and everything that looked different and ""exoctic"" since we all don't do Mediterranean that often.  We had Mujadarah, Mousakaha, Okra combo (Veggie platter for $10), a side of grape leaves ($5 for 6 but they gave us like 12), split pea soup, chicken shawerma, and two lamb shawerma ($8 each). Though they didn't have some of the things we originally intended to order we understood the owner's perspective on not wasting food - as it did seem they were closing up.  It also appears more of a take-out/ delivery spot great for hot lunches (the lamb shawerma was awesome).  The best was their bread as when I think falafel type sandwiches, I dread that thick dough, but theirs was not.  Thin yumminess. Gave us some free dessert - that phillo dough was mad flaky and we left a generous tip.  Definitely will be back to pick up a shawerma again (spicy!) next time I'm in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have travelled in the Middle East extensively, espeically the Levant/Meditteranean region. So I know the taste of good Falafel when I eat one. And Mamoun does a worthy effort in competing against the amazing flavor of the Middle East's Falafel. I don't think its fair for us to strictly compare the New York Falafel on the same par as the falafael in the big ME. However, it should be taken into consideration that even my Middle Eastern friends (whom have been raised with the aura of authentic falafel) have noted that Mamoun does remind them of the divine taste of the truth (true falafel). Food in New York will never taste like the originals back from old country (of wherever that specific ethnic dish comes from). But we should less harsh on the food that does a fine challenege in trying to preserve the authenticity. and Mamoun does exactly that.

"Was very surprised to find this tapas gem.  Food was great, atmosphere was bustling, and service was attentive.  We went on a Friday night around 7 and managed to only wait about 15 minutes for a table.  The place is tiny so you expect to be waiting forever.  All the dishes were excellent.  We had the patatas bravas, fried garbanzo beans, chorizo, artichoke wrapped in ham, and spanish tortilla.  It wasn't a huge amount of food, but enough to feed three of us.  Minus one star because it was so tightly packed.  I heard way too much of the conversation going on at the neighboring table - was tempted to chime in from time to time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was having trouble deciding if I wanted to do something restaurant week, like S was suggesting or go to a regular spot. I decided to try a new place that's been on my list, since I have been dying to try their charcuterie. S and I ended up sharing the following items: gravlax - I was not much of a fan of this smoked salmon. It was one of the fishiest gravlax I have ever tasted. I love fish, but I definitely not into the fishy flavour. merguez - this lamb sausage was good with the accompaniment mustard. duck prosciutto - I have to say this was S and I's most favourite one. I am sad, I only ordered one order....I wanted a lot more of this delectable goodness. chicken liver mousse w/ cornichon relish - this was okay, not the best liver mousse I've tasted. counrty pate w/ tin whole grain mustard - the pate was a bit bland without the mustard. My only gripe about the nice spread was the bread. I feel they should provided a thinner cut of bread and offer some variety of carbs, rather than just that one standard thick slice of bread. Of course, when I saw bone marrow - I explained to S how much I adore the stuff. bone marrow & brisket burger - the burger was okay, didn't taste too much of the bone marrow. I guess, I expected more...I expected it to change my life. Well, this burger didn't! Service was good and I guess I expected a lot more than what this restaurant was able to provide after hearing about them.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm not one to bash places or be completely negative but after hearing all the wonderful things about this place, I was dumbfounded. I kept hearing about this ""place under the brooklyn bridge"" that supposedly had the BEST pizza in NYC. My friend and I ventured all the way to NYC for a day trip and resolved to get us some Grimaldi's. I'm a loyal Lombardi's lover and I only eat Pizza when I'm in NYC and I only eat Lombardi's... until this particular day. We waited in a line like elementary school kids as some cranky older italian guy picked people at random by pairs or in strange numbers, splitting parties up, adding strangers together etc... My friend and I were about 3/4 to the door from the back of the line up, he pointed at us and some girl who was by herself and rushed us in, had us sit down together as we were telling him we were not a trio. He finally listened, snapped his fingers at my friend and literally said ""C'mahn, whattya doin'?"" as he angrily trudged us up the stairs, sat us, tossed menus at us and walked away. Right away we were put off. So, the waiter comes over after about 15 minutes, we order a regular margarita pizza. The pizza comes and I kid you not, I've had better at papa johns on a decent night. The cheese was tough and tasteless, like they melted those nasty craft mozzarella cheese sticks on the pizza, the sauce was overly sweet and the crust and dough was chewy. We each ate 2 slices and decided to give the rest to the first homeless person we saw (which we later decided against as that would have been cruel). The waiter never checked on us not even once after giving us the pizza. So after 25 or so minutes of looking at our terrible pizza, we flagged another waiter down, got the check and booked. Terrible service, terrible food. Don't do it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The secret to getting the most out of this place is to sit at the bar.  I prefer the better light there (the food is beautiful, why not see it), and the bartenders, while busy, know their stuff.  Ask for their recommendations and try whatever they suggest.  As for the quality of their Italian fare, the only place I've been in this city that does it better is the uber-expensive Il Mulino.   My single and mild criticism is that, now and then, you'll catch a whiff of elitist pretensions from some of the tables that have gathered around you; that's one dark aspect of finding yourself in the West Village.  Sitting at the bar carries the added benefit of helping you to ignore such problems if and when they come up.  And it's not a bad place to meet some interesting people who are either eating there too, or stopping by on the way to their tables.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"One word: YUM. I have been to The Gander now twice; once for dinner, once for brunch. Both experiences were fantastic.  As a pregnant woman, food is very important to me right now (well, it always is, but especially if I can't be enjoying my libations along with it), and I was beyond pleased with our selections.  I had the duck breast for dinner. Incredible. Flawless presentation. My friend had the branzino and it was so pretty it was almost a shame to devour it (which certainly happened). My entire party shared all the dishes and everyone was fantastic.  Now to save the best for last: the burger. PLEASE do yourself a favor and find your way to The Gander for brunch or lunch and get the burger. Best burger I've ever had. No joke. Perfect meat/bun distribution, perfect seasoning.  In fact, after that delicious meal, I went home to put my feet up (because why the hell not), and my baby girl kicked for the first time! Enough said, right? Oh, and the bread basket was insane, too.  I think I ate 7/8ths of it, leaving very basically nothing for everyone else. Oops. Even my friend's baby was served the best scrambled eggs I've had in years, how wrong to waste such deliciousness on an 18 month old :) Not to add this as an afterthought, (I just get hung up on food lately), but the service was great and the ambiance is lovely. Bottom line: run, do not walk, to The Gander.  It's an experience you won't regret.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Oh - and amazing Serrano and Iberico ham - go just to see the kick ass slicer guy.

"My wife and I had reservations for this evening at 6:00 at Lupa.  We arrived at 6:18, and apologized for being late (a common occurence in NYC).  We were then told that our reservation had ""already been no-showed"" but we could be seated as long as we didn't mind forfeiting our OpenTable points.  Our seating was also contingent on the table being returned by 7:30.  When we said that an hour and twelve minutes was not enough time for a comfortable dinner, we were offered to ""wait for something to open up"" at the bar.  As a fifteen-year veteran of food service (and nearly five years working in Michelin-rated NYC restaurants) I found this simply unacceptable.  We left and went to another restaurant.  It is disappointing that with such a first impression we will absolutely NEVER patronize another B&B establishment, despite my wife's good experiences at Lupa, Otto, and Del Posto.  We understand that reservations arriving late are inconvenient.  For the maitre d' to act as if they are an air traffic controller with a sensitive and delicate queue is just ridiculous.  Avoid at all costs.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I told myself over two years ago that I'd never eat another Subway $5 foot long as long as I lived. It had become a problem, almost an addiction of mine while I worked in the garment district. They were cheap, loaded with mystery meat, and could become not only lunch, but dinner if I were so inclined. But after eating countless horrible Subway sandwiches I promised myself I'd never do it again, and swore that there had to be an alternative. Cut to two years later, I now live and work in Williamsburg, and I haven't had a Subway Sandwich in years. Does this mean I eat $10 lunch specials on Bedford? No. Does this mean that I pack my lunch everyday before I go to work? Seriously? It simply means I found an alternative to the ultra cheap Subway Sandwich. Except this time the food rocks, and it's even a few dollars cheaper. The $3 falafel pita is a staple not only on meatless Mondays, but for at least two other meals a week. I am actually eating one right now; the inspiration for this review obviously. But here's the thing, I have been eating this pita for almost as long as I'd been eating Subway and I've never, not a single time, been bummed about eating it. So packed with flavor compounded by the fact that you literally can't eat a cheaper meal, that each time I go there I almost feel guilty. Everything else there is very good as well, but honestly 9 times out of 10 I'm walking out of there with a $3 falafel pita and a small side of hummus. Suck on that $5 foot long. I never like you anyway. And it WAS YOU, NOT ME!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Short version: Great drinks; good food, great prices. Recommend it Long version: Went here last Friday evening with friends. We were a group of 7, and we made reservations. We ended up being seated in an alcove at the back of the restaurant, which was quite nice because we felt as if we were in our own private room. Service: excellent. Our server was attentive without being obnoxious, answered questions well and made some good recommendations. We weren't rushed and were able to stay 25 minutes after we paid the bill. Food: pretty good. Everyone at the table was happy with what they got (and everyone got different dishes), so that should give you a sense of the quality). Drinks: I had the jalepeno caipirinha which was great. Not overly sweet and had a nice spicy finish from the jalepeno. A friend had the traditional caipirinha which was great also. Full disclosure: Most people had different sandwiches because they were very reasonably priced. I had the baked bacalau (salted codfish) and pao de queijo (cheese bread). So I had the most ""Brazilian"" food. My dishes were very good. Whenever I go to a Brazilian restaurant I always get the cheese bread and these were quite nice. The baked bacalau was a new dish to me, but it was a good dish: not too fishy with a little kick and nice blend b/c it also had baked potatoes in the dish. Came served in a little cast iron skillet which was a cute presentation. Highlight: Jalapeno Caipirinha; baked bacalau.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"THE BEST BRUNCH. I just needed to start off with that because my admiration for Jane (the restaurant) is so strong. While visiting my good friend in NYC, we wanted to scope out a sweet brunch spot in the city. That's where we stumbled across Jane and I can't begin to explain how happy we are that we did. First, they take reservations on Opentable for brunch. Second, we were able to get ourselves in there for a 12pm time slot on a Sunday. Finally, the food/service/ambiance at this Greenwich Village gem was simply second to none! Short Ribs Benedict (Special of the day) - Freakishly good Hollandaise sauce over perfectly poached eggs all paired with golden crispy potatoes that make my mouth water just thinking about it; what's not to like about that?! Complimentary Drink w/entree - Seriously, that's awesome. Your choice of a nice fresh squeezed juice or alcoholic beverage (if you like your brunch a little boozy). Quite the deal!

My boyfriend and I literally live across the street, and we dine out at least 4 times a week so we don't always want to travel far.

(no stars for service) I have been in the food & bev industry for 20 years and have never experienced this kind of service. Our main course came before we were done with our appetizer. The moment I set down my fork my plate disappeared like a magic trick. We ordered a bottle of wine and it was practically poured out immediately (glass was way too full). She pushed us to order dessert immediately after we were done with our meal, even after I said we wanted to wait a min. she hovered and came back three times till I gave in just to get her away. Then dropped the check when we had full glasses of wine and came back at least 5 times while we were trying to enjoy it and flipped through the book looking for our credit card.

Then I had the gnocchi for my entree (I was leaning towards the risotto, but the waiter recommended this instead).  I'm glad he did, it was very unusual and a smaller portion, but it was fantastic!  It came in this yogurt sauce that reminded me of an Armenian dish we have called manti.  So good.  My boyfriend had the duck which was amazing too.   For dessert I was excited to get the candy bar (from all the reviews) but it was just okay...too heavy for my liking (and I like sweets!).  My boyfriend had the ice cream, which wasn't anything special either.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The rice was a fine complement to the lamb without overshadowing the meat, and the white sauce enhanced all the flavors. The pita was wonderful.

"Birthdays come but once a year (still far too frequent in my opinion). As I prepared to enter my quarter life crisis, my partner-in-food did his best to help me forget my woes of growing older with a surprise dinner at Gramercy Tavern. What a dinner it was! We both ordered the Vegetarian Tasting Menu consisting of the following: -Radish & Kohlrabi Salad -Country Egg -Sugar Snap Peas & Cucumber -Barley Risotto -Baby Carrots, Shiitake & Spiced Almonds -Warm Salad of Vegetables & Black Lentils -Spinach Fettuccine -Green Garlic & Mushrooms It took us a while to settle on a wine. The waiter suggested a Riesling Austrian called Stift Göttweig, a compromise to my dry, crisp preference and my partner's sweet tooth. One sip and I could not have been more pleased with the choice. As for the dishes (starting with my least favorite), the amuse bouche served at the start was odd in flavor and unimpressive. Everything else, however, was spectacular. From the initial radish salad to the barley risotto, the food was a feast for my eyes and mouth. The final entree of spinach fettuccine served with whole garlic cloves tasted especially unique yet not overpowering as one might expect with garlic. We also ordered a plate of five cheeses. Despite the fact I no longer recall our various selections months later as I write this, I do recall the taste--perfection. Murray Greenberg, former owner of the infamous Murray's Cheese in West Village, would be hard pressed to find a more delicious serving of coagulated milk (besides his own of course). The plates were perfectly proportioned allowing for fullness without the feeling of being stuffed. The waiter was very accompanying and patient, even as we discussed the pros and cons of the meal using him as a mediator. For dessert, we had the peanut butter-wafer-chocolate-toffee and the rhubarb shortcake. Both were amazing, but not near as good as the main courses. Friends and colleagues have always raved about the upscale eatery located off E 20th between Broadway and Park. Following my quarter life crisis birthday dinner, I understand why. With its innovative menu, impressive interior, superb service, and amazing food, Gramercy Tavern is a place I recommend often. It's perfect for special occasions, get-togethers, Monday nights, Tuesday evenings, Wednesday afternoons--well, you get the idea. I have dined at countless restaurants since Gramercy Tavern. It still ranks as my number 1, personal favorite restaurant in New York City. Danny Meyer, you done good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The grilled calamari was good.  The sauce that accompanied the baby arugula and calamari was delicious. I ordered the house special, spaghetti and (lamb?) meatballs.   Granted I rarely ever order Spaghetti and meatballs because whenever I go to an establishment, I feel weird ordering something I could get in a can, but nothing else on the pasta menu interested me and when the waiter suggested homemade spaghetti and meatballs with lamb ragu, I decided to give it a go. The pasta was cooked al dente, but I felt like I was eating canned Chef Boyardee, but more bland and with less seasoning.  The meatballs were moist, but I feel like they were under seasoned. Once an generous amount of salt was added, it became more flavorful, but nothing that really warranted the four stars. The problem may have been that I failed to order the highly recommended dishes such as the lobster crepe (not a big fan of lobster) or the fillet mingon with truffle sauce (wasn't that hungry).  But as far as the pasta dishes go, it was rather underwhelming.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday tonight, and wow, this place really deserves all the awesome reviews it's getting. We dove right in, ordering a number of appetizers in the $4 - 6 range so we could get the most out of the menu. We had: Sandeko Bandel ($4.99) A dish made from wild boar and served with lemon. It was a little gamey and tough, but I enjoyed it. Lhaphing ($3.99), A spicy mung bean jelly. It's a lot like really hot and savory jello. It looks benign, but it'll really sneak up on you! I can say that this dish was certainly a culinary experience unlike any I had before. Bhatmas ($3.99) These were pretty strange. They were dried soybeans, mixed with an array of vegetables and some chillies. The dish is eaten cold and provides a nice counterpoint to the overwhelming spiciness present in a lot of the dishes (in that it's cold and crunchy). Certainly a pleasant surprise! Chasha Kho-wa ($4.99) This was a soup with chicken and corn in it. It seemed like a good idea to order it because of how cold it was outside. I enjoyed the broth, but the dish sort of fell to the wayside and was overshadowed by the other, better dishes on the table. It was alright. It isn't something I'd turn down, but it's not something I'd be in a hurry to order, either. Yak Momos ($11.49) These were what we came here for. Yes, this area is flooded with great momo places (Bhim's Cafe being one of them), but as far as I know, this is the only one that serves yak. (Please, correct me if I'm wrong.) The dumplings were served with three chutneys: one red (which looked really intimidating, but really wasn't), one green (my personal favorite), and one orange. The dumpling skins were quite chewy and very nicely folded. They don't really skimp on the yak either; these dumplings are packed, and you can literally feel the juices drip out when you bite into them. To those of you who have never had yak, it tastes a lot like beef, but is much more intensely marbled. It basically melts in your mouth. It's not on the main menu; instead, it's on a separate menu that lists yak dishes exclusively. Tibetan tea (two cups were $2.50) This was also a new experience for me. I'd never really had a savory tea before (with the exception of Genmai-cha). This tea is really a love it or hate it kind of deal. It's extremely rich and has a slight saltiness to it--two characteristics that can easily and understandably turn people off. But if you feel adventurous, it's definitely worth a try. You can get a cup for just $1.25, and a pot for a bit over twice that. Overall, we got four (really filling) appetizers, tea, and some awesome momos for just about $35. I'll definitely be returning to Himalayan Yak in the future! Recommended: Yak Momos, Lhaphing, Bhatmas Good, but not essential: Sandeko Bandel, Chasha Kho-wa If you're feeling adventurous: Tibetan butter tea (I also saw a goat offal dish there that sounded really good. I might try that next time I go.)","[0.0, 1.0]"
My first time here the experience was ok I've had better soul food than I had at Amy Ruth's. I believe every soul food you need to stick to the roots. At Amy Ruth's stick to the Chicken and Waffles.

"Love the overall setting and atmosphere of this place! Perfect combination of traditional Japanese cultural setting and contemporary modernistic design~ Moreover, immediately as you enter the main restaurant area to get seated at your table, literally every single worker openly greets you making you feel like an instant celebrity ha! All the workers seem so happy and chill and the manager was honestly one of the coolest persons I've seen! Customer service was fantastic and the foods were beyond scrumptious! Definitely drink all the broth of the ramen! I usually am never able to consume an entire bowl of ramen at a typical ramen restaurant but it was just too damn good to not finish and take in all its great taste! Additionally, the workers are constantly walking around checking up on you and refilling your drinks that you will most likely never run out of water for even the slightest second unless you're absolutely dehydrated or something.

"Their brunch is by far better than their dinner. The dinner menu while it looks great items are just okay. I do recommend the ravioli, Which has a lot of flavor. I do have to say that the ambience is very nice; But my experience recently with the waiter wasn't a good one. I went with a group of six people and the bill was very expensive.  It was upwards of $250 per person so we all put credit cards down on top of the check to be split evenly. The waitress in a rude manner let me know that they can only take three credit cards. I asked her nicely to them please split the bill into two and use three credit cards on each divided bill. She refused! It went as far as me needing to speak to the manager, because who in their right mind brings $300 in cash to dinner? When I told her that we didn't have enough cash on us she told me to go to an ATM. At a restaurant this nice where prices are high I really did expect that they would accept our credit cards. They did end up accepting it after talking to the manager but I left a bad taste in my mouth.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I felt like checking this place out after reading an article on the top 25 burgers in America.  Minetta Tavern is one of 4 or 5 places in NYC that made the list.  Being that it was the closest to my sister's place, I decided to give it a shot.  A heads up, it's a good idea make a reservation or be cool w/ sitting at the bar, which is what we ended up doing.  The place itself is a dimly lit tavern w/ a lot of New Yorkers coming in for an after work bite to eat.  For the food itself, the Minetta burger comes in at a heavy 17 dollars.  For that amount of money, I expect a lot of effort put into that burger or a lot of fries on the side.  I got both.  The two burger patties are very tender and juicy in contrast to the crispy bun that is toasted to near perfection.  Overall, while the 17 dollars is pushing it, it's definitely a burger I would pay over 10 dollars for and it does deserve to be on the top 25 burgers in the US.  Not a place you'd go to regularly if you're stingy, but I know I say this often: try it once.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The bartenders and servers all know their stuff, and they are extremely helpful and attentive. They didn't even try to upsell me, which I always appreciate.

"Brought to you by the good folks of Stone St... Taking over the former Wall Street Burger Shoppe Space, 'Dead Rabbit' changes it up by creating an old school pub on the first floor and a slightly more upscale cocktail lounge upstairs.  Think PDT with a lot  of Irish influence and a touch of Asian antiquities. The Pub on the first floor carries a few of your standard beers and a few more micro brews.   The lounge upstairs has a lengthy list of cocktails and communal punches.  Never had a communal punch before but figured it would be a good night to explore something new.  It was a refreshing departure from my standard Scotch and Beer but the bowl and ladle it came in made it difficult to get the last cup of sweet nectar out, had to take the bowl straight to the face.

Watching (and hearing) the guy make the noodles was fun, but maybe someone could have swept the place up a little?  There was some garbage under a table, but I guess that's a lot like China.

"I love, love LOVE this place! Everything about it is what I'd consider for a perfect bar. The food is phenomenal; I highly recommend the tacos (chicken!!) and enchilada. Not traditional Mexican-style necessarily, but honestly, BETTER. The kale salad (with lemon poppyseed dressing and cashews) is a great switch-up to the usual and the brunch burger (grass-fed burger with fried egg and other fixin's) is a treat on the weekend. As for the booze: they rotate their well-balanced seasonal beer selection often, and bartenders are always happy to give you info on beers you've never had and make helpful suggestions. Great whiskey/bourbon selection, too. ALL of the staff are wonderful--bartenders, servers, owners, chef--and though it definitely has its' busier nights, it doesn't really draw a super rowdy, sloppy crowd (i.e. I never find myself annoyed by other patrons there, which happens often these days). Since I live down the street, I love how close it is. There definitely isn't much going on in the way of bars this side of McGuinness, so not only was it a much-welcome addition to the hood, but it is kind of an oasis in an otherwise mellow, quiet area. Lastly, the backyard is great. Occasionally they'll host BBQs in the back, and the yard offers so much space that I've never been at a loss for a seat no matter what time of the day/night I'm there.

"Unfortunately, Molly's is deliberately trying to go out of business with it's rude, sarcastic, and loudly disingenuous staff, particularly the old WHITE Irish bartender.  I brought my Hispanic friend to the bar for a couple of after work drinks.  The Irish bartender kept a keen eye on him and was waiting for a chance to pick on him.  My friend is a renown vintage jewelry maker and dealer.  We spoke of the items he had just purchased and were examining them closely.   My friend then opened up to the bartender in order to break the ice so to speak and asked the bartender to look at a German piece that was laid among the other pieces my friend had just purchased.  The bartender then says, ""Did you just find that here?  The two customers who were sitting here before YOU came here were German, and it belongs to them.""  My friend showed a receipt for the purchase explaining that it had just been purchased from a local thrift shop.  Stunned, we left and couldn't believe that a place where most of the staff, bartender, and customers alike are a homogenous blend of white-haired, unfriendly, suspecting, judgmental, nudniks that this MAN would attempt his bartender trick of accusing a CUSTOMER of taking something probably only to take home himself, the thief. Racial profiling?  Perhaps not.  Bad service on a paying customer?  Certainly.  The rest of the staff acted the same.  Pretty much questioning where we came from and why we were there.  One waitress screamed at me pointing to the restroom and mumbling a bit about an outhouse then laughing to another customer.  I am white but I think all this was fueled by my Hispanic friend being there with ME. I give this place a thumbs down, much for the service, but more for the weak drinks which are all calculated by this white-haired, aged Jeffrey Dahmer-esque BARTENDER.  He ONLY services his own kind.  Luckily these type of bars are closing down around Murray Hill, Kip's Bay, and the Gramercy Park area.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Worst brunch service in quite a while.  My friend and I both ordered a simple eggs/toast/potatoes dish without meat.  The waiter and waitress (yes-two!) happily suggested to replace the meat with arugula.  YES!!!  Except both dishes arrived with meat somehow woven over the potatoes, through the toast, and under the eggs.  My companion was ok with them just removing the meat, I asked politely for them to make a new dish for me.  I waited FOREVER (longer than the wait for the original dish, and the place was not crowded) for the correct dish to arrive.  Not once did my original waiter duo come over and notice the problem - my friend was finished and I did not have anything to eat.  The corrected dish had fresh eggs, but the potatoes were cold.   While I ate and my friend waited for me to finish, another waiter offered a refill on his decaf coffee.  But then came back to explain that since it's decaf americano, there are no refills.  How about giving him a free refill for screwing up both of our orders? When the bill came, nothing was comped.  My sour face led the original waiter to come over and genuinely ask what was wrong.  I politely explained to him since he didn't have any idea, and I suggested that my $3.75 cappuccino be comped.  He later returned with an amended bill that had a total credit of $2.24 for me and my friend to share.  Slap in the face.  Paid cash and left.   I understand mistakes happen in the kitchen, but this was handled so poorly.  I want to like this place; the decor is lovely, but the attitude says ""go elsewhere.""","[0.0, 1.0]"
"what a GREAT groupon deal! Note this review is for the groupon deal only 2 entrees, 2 drinks, 2 desserts all for 29 dollars Service was good, they explained the menu well, menu wasnt super extensive but everything looked delicious. Ordered a roasted lamb shank, with beans and mashed potatoes. It came with tomato sauce on top. It was delicious. Lamb was fall off the bone. I highly recommend this! Tiramisu was pretty good too. Just the perfect size not too big not too small. My GF ordered the chicken parm and it was... nothing special. just a meh. oh well canoli was good, i liked how it was crispy, reallly crispy but some people might not like that Overall a great groupon deal. Without the groupon though? I dont know, maybe a 3.5 ..., prices were just OK for the food. Its 22 dollars for a lamb shank which was great, though not jaw dropping. Chicken parm was maybe 12 or 14 for what i would say a mediocre dish. Its also far to get too and a really small space. However service was really good and servers really nice. If i was in the area i definitely wouldnt have qualms of coming back, definitely check it out if you're nearby!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Hands down the best Mexican food in the city! I live on this block and eat here pretty frequently and am never disappointed. I had my birthday here last year and take all my out of town guests here for dinner and/or brunch. You definitely can't eat here without having one of their margaritas- the best I have ever had! Their tequila selection is also amazing. As for the menu I pretty much rotate between 3 things: calamari tacos, steak tacos and the enchiladas verdes. They don't take reservations so it's best to either get there early or put your name in and then grab a drink down the street.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A classic NY hole in the wall find. As already stated by many the price and food are fantastic.  The sesame pancake is a thicker version than the usual fare found at most places and is light, not greasy and full of flavor, and its a healthly slze slice, no skimping here.  The dumplings are fresh and flavorful and unlike some of the streetfare versions, the pork and chive filling is full of flavor with no off tasting grisely mix, and again the dumpling is generously filled. Seating is very limited and basically a bench lining the wall with a narrow shelf to eat off of. A better choice is eat outside on  a stoop, find a park or in your car if you drive there. Just dont wait too long as the dumplings will taste best right out of the wok. The store itself is a mini cultural moment with the cook turning out hugh amounts of dumplings, both steamed and fried, from super sized woks.  Next to him is a woman with two cleavers chopping the fillings non stop, think human version of a food processor.  Behind her are a team of three women churning out the actual dumplings at a lightening speed pace. For anyone seeking a real food experience this is the place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After reading about this place and how many reviews it has, I wanted to go see if it is going be good Malaysian food or not. When I walk in the door, it remind me of a mom and pop shop. Everyone there were enjoying their food in silence so that was a good sign. I order 2 items to eat, roti canal and the Singaporean noodle and order 1 more item to go for later on when i get hungry again. Anyway the food that came out were delicious and bold. The soup was sweet but had sooo much flavor. I was impress and enjoy every single bite. The best part was it wasn't even expensive. Everything was under $18 and i had more food to bring home to try.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"According to how many reviews this place has gotten, it is extremely overrated!!  I didn't have to wait long (~10min)  but the food is not that good.  I didn't have bad service or anything, I am rating it low based on their food.  They mass produce everything, exactly like an assembly line.  Hence, the quality can't be that good.  Furthermore, their lamb/beef is grounded.  I am assuming they bought it already grounded, hence the quality of meat is sub-par.  Every bite was like drinking cholesterol, it was that oily.  I even tried half of my plate it with a lot of white sauce as other people have recommended, but even then, doesn't make the food taste that much better.  If you have to try this place once, go ahead and don't expect much  Also, I think there are other halal carts that are better than this one.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend and I came here for a quick pre-theater dinner. And at 6pm, the place was packed. The music together with the quaint old films projecting (Grease!) on the brick wall kept us well entertained during our short evening here. We tried their green pasta with shrimp. This pasta tasted really fresh. Although there were only 4 pieces of shrimp, that too was perfectly cooked and so juicy. Together with the cream sauce, this whole dish was just fantastic. Our only gripe was the service - While waiting for our table to be set up, we were at the bar and had ordered drinks that had not been made. During this time, one of the staff started showing us to our table. I alerted her that our drinks had not arrived. So she offered this peculiar piece of advice: One of us should wait for the drinks at the bar and bring them over ourselves later, while another should follow her to the table. Isn't this strange??? I've been to several restaurants, and they've invariably offered to bring our drinks to the table whenever this happens. Also, throughout our meal, we were offered food that we did not order, THREE times. Perhaps this is some elaborate marketing strategy to get us to order more food. I hope this restaurant straightens out their service issues soon, before I come back again for their green pasta!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I dragged 9 people to Clinton St. Bakery on a Thursday morning at 10 am and the wait was 2 and a half hours. NO WAY I was leaving, even if people stomachs were grumbling and other places were near by. I'm sure after eating everyone at least understood why I was crazy enough to make everyone wait (it turned out to only be 45 minute wait anyway). I have an undying love for brunch and Clinton St. Bakery caters to my every whim: A small wood furnished restaurant equipped with great lighting and pancakes that melt in your mouth, large bowls of steaming hot chocolate and biscuits so perfectly dense and buttery. Dear God! I've had two items on the brunch menu thus far: The banana walnut pancakes (So fluffy! The Best I've ever had!) with MAPLE BUTTER (drool) and the buttermilk biscuits. I wish I could alternate each plate every morning (after I've run for like 10 miles before). Next time I'm going to take Kat H.'s recommendation and come in for the 6-8 pm beer and burger. Maybe even get a malt? I bet its amazing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The food is awesome and one of the top Italian places rated on OpenTable so I'd definitely try it out if you haven't already. It's also a plus that the prices are relatively cheap. The people are also so nice, friendly, and helpful that it makes the place even better. The only downside is that the portions are pretty small. A primi dish of pasta is definitely not enough food for me to be full so I would definitely suggest getting an appetizer with that. I would definitely recommend the salmon tartare, bruschetta, and tagliatelle. I have also tried the ravioli, which is really good, but I personally prefer if ravioli stuffed with cheese instead of spinach.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Overall, this was an enjoyable joint. The menu had an excellent variety. I ordered an old favorite, Sauerbraten, and friends got the Jaegar Schnitzel and Penne with Smoked Trout & Shrimp. Admittedly, I am a bit of a sauerbraten snob, so this dish really had no chance. Contrary to its name, the meat was not sour enough and the meat wasn't lean enough for my liking. The side dishes were not impressive -- red cabbage (definitely from a jar) and roasted potatoes (eh, not exciting). A side of spaetzle would have been a trillion times better. I was actually craving the linzer torte; however, I decided to pass it up and share some dessert with my dinner guests. They chose the strawberries and cantaloupe with mint ice cream. It was actually a refreshing blend of flavors. The beer selection was fitting. I had a Gaffel Kölsch and Gösser Lager -- draft, of course. Both were good choices. I wouldn't mind seeing at least two more beers added to their draft selection. Service was good, nothing exceptional. I really liked the vibe in the place. It was dim, busy and full of people talking loudly -- just like a biergarten or keller! That made me happy.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ippudo was one of my favorite tonkotsu ramen shops in Japan so I was very excited to hear that they would open a shop in NY.  There are however some notable differences between the Ippudo in Japan.  Here is what I noticed: 1. There is much more on the menu in NY.  It is more of a restaurant than a ramen shop.  In addition, there were different kinds of ramen in the NY shop such as miso, shoyu and tsukemen.   2. The only condiments in NY was a black pepper and also a sesame seed grinder.  In Japan, there is ginger, takana and raw garlic. 3. In NY, there was no pitcher of rooibos tea. 4. Cabbage was used in the ramen in the NY shop. 5. It is considerably cheaper in Japan. The taste was the same I remember having in Japan.  If you don't mind spending $15 for a bowl of ramen, you won't get a better bowl anywhere else in NY.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you really want to experience EXCELLENT New York Pizza, make a trek out to the otherside of the Brooklyn Bridge and let your taste buds experience Grimaldi's. I used to absolutely hate pizza with a passion because of the nastiness that is Pizza Hut and other trash chain pizza places. When I visited New York and then moved there, I changed my tune. I discovered pizza can taste good and then went on a mission to find the best New York pizza. I've tried pizza by the slice at numerous places like Patsy's, Famous Rays, Famous Rays II, Famous Rays III, the other Famous Rays and all those other places that claim to be famous. I know I'll probably be chastised for my review on John's on Bleeker, but Grimaldi's to me is much better. The pizza is thin, but not as extreme as John's. The crust is chewy, not crispy like a cracker which is what I experienced at John's. Grimaldi's uses fresh mozzarella and chopped basil on their pies. Those few ingredients are what make this place so great. Another great thing is that they don't pour on marinara sauce as if the dough was on fire and they needed to put it out. A lot of pizza places (not in NY) do that and that's why I used to have a PhD (pizza hating degree). They accept cash only and it's always crowded so go early and prepared with cash.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm thoroughly confused as to how anyone could compare this place to Ippudo.  They don't even have the same types of broths.  It's like comparing apples to oranges.  You can't.  The broth here is ALL chicken based, while (aside from the veg option) Ippudo's all has some pork component. If you want to try different varieties of what their different ramens, then don't do any of the spicy with the paitan.  The paitan is the basic broth, and the spicy is just a spicy oil added to that.   The 30min wait on a Thurs @ 7p was not so long considering the other reviews here.  You sign in on the clipboard hanging from the door.  One of the staff will call you.  Sometimes, he will step outside to look for you, other times, he won't.  So it's best to stand inside the enclosed area if there is room.  Once you are seated, service is prompt.  They forgot our eggs, and offered to give one free to us, but we declined.

"The food there was decent. The decor was ok, a million clay pots on the ceiling made it look interesting but that's about it. The food wasn't spectacular. The lamb shank I had was ok, I wasn't immensely impressed by it. The food overall is good, especially if you're into the whole i wanna hang out with the trendsters crowd. The service was a bit lacking. Apparently if you show up in a large party, the staff has a bit of a freak out. Ok so we were a party of 13. Not a lucky number I suppose. All the soda came in these tiny glass bottles, great for novelty purposes, not so much for drinking as you don't get that much. Oh well no high corn fructose syrup for me then! The waiter wanted us to order everything immediately, geez so much for chatting and enjoying the ambiance of the place. No you just can't order appetizers now. You have to order everything now. And for some reason the waiter thought that being that two of us wanted the same dish, doesn't mean we're sharing! The staff couldn't wait to get rid of us. Considering it took us a while to get our food, and geez we'd like to chat, cause that's what a bunch of girls do, oh we're closing the register can you pay now? Wow...you really want us out don't you? Oh and of course tip is already included. If you're flying solo or just with a friend then great for you! otherwise you might have better luck elsewhere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I thought about four stars but I soon came to the conclusion it was well worth five stars. Although the wait is very long I see it as a once every few months type of place. We arrived at 630 and were out by 830. A guy drove from Detroit to try Doms pizza. My only complaint is the wait, it could be run way more efficiently but the guy helping Dom was like a chicken with his head cut off. It worth the wait just to have Dom personally make the pizza. The pizza itself is absolutely amazing. I love Brooklyn style and this is the perfect Brooklyn pizza. Four cheeses grated while make each pizza, handmade sauce made in small sauce pans in the back, fresh basil grown in the window, and olive oil, lots of olive oil! Make the hour trip from midtown, you won't regret it at all!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you're having a bad day,  go to XIXA. If you are having a good day, go to XIXA. Sigh, I always want to go to Xixa.  It's hard for me not to go to this Traif spin-off. I even hesitate writing this review because I want it to be my secret and I want to sit in the same spot every time I want to eat there. But that's just selfish so... The FOOD is carefully crafted, with quality ingredients and amazing flavor combinations that can only help but bring up anyones mood. Some dishes have a Thai flavor influence other times French, but across the board the flavors are all south of the border. These flavors literally come from dreams I've never dreamed. (Thanks to Chef Jason Marcus)  And the menu is similarly organized to Traif ie. Lighter Small dishes (5-10$) to a richer entree style($12-29).  Now these are ideally meant to share but sometimes, aka when I've had a crap day and already eaten, I'll pop in just for a glass of wine and a small dish.  A therapeutic apertif, if you will, but you could certainly make it a full solo meal if you wanted. I've definitely thought about it. So price wise you could spend a little or you could spend a lot . Now I've had a lot of things but I'm not going to talk about all of them right now, but I am very fond of the Esquites, a mini thai-mexi blend soup, the Pozole Stew-hearty and I could eat this all by myself and die happy and incredibly full (recommended for a solo meat lovers meal), Foie Gras Al Pastor-very rich entree style but I would share.. it's a lot of foie for one person, the Crab Flan Tamale-oh yes!, and the Bunelo Sundae and the Churros I've always had a great time with the SERVICE here. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable and Heather, owner has always been there. I don't know if she's always there but she checks in on everyone when she is and makes sure everything is going great. Another example of great service leads me to their BAR, They do not have a crazy cocktail list. I don't know if this is a soft opening thing or whatever. But its okay, trust these people & try something new because they specialize in Tequila, and Mezcal and have an extensive wine list. They have a tasting of Bacanora that I liked reminded me a bit of grappa. But my eating companion order some tequila and was hoping for something to drink along with it, as straight tequila is not her thing. And Voila! They accommodated her with two little shooters, one of sweetened lime juice and the other of this house made spicy sangralito? oh I don't know I tasted it thou, a sour of sweet sour spicy thing The space is very nice, it sort of blends that south of the border bar where all the locals hang out with nice dining in the back. It's all very nice, lots of reclaimed wood and iron. I never eat in the back, by choice, I eat at a along table near the bar with surprisingly comfy iron stools, so I can look out the window. But the back looks nice with booths and tables. Maybe I'll venture to a booth sometime, the seats are more plush in the back. I also like the lamp choices. To be honest it was what brought me in the first time. When I first came here I had not idea what was going on. I had just been checking out the progress of the place that had amazing lamps Everytime I've been here I've tried to order something else completely new and I haven't been disappointed.The food is always a fun delicious adventure. Since they opened, I have been here three times, with different types of people and we've always had a great time. So GO already! Try it before everyone else know about it. It's quieter than Traif because it's still secret and there's no wait . Just try not to take my spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great atmosphere, great for groups (downstairs) or for a date (upstairs area, overlooking the first floor). I came here with 9 other people and ordered the Whole Shebang - one of everything on the menu excluding the cheese plates and dessert, all for $420. We did the calculation and it turns out to be a $13 savings compares to ordering all the same items a la carte. Not a big savings overall but it took out the complexity of deciding what to order. Overall I really enjoyed the food.  Given the size of some of the plates I didn't get to have a lot of each thing, probably about a bite or two, but they were flavorful bites.  Not everything was great - the octopus ceviches was tough and chewy, the oysters were small and nothing special, as were the shrimp & chorizo skewer and the coca with mushrooms, ricotta and truffles cheese.  Most other things were pretty good but the winners of the night were the smoked mozzarella skewer, crab ravioli, sea urchin risotto, and the braised short rib with beet pasta. Even though I only had a bite of each thing (and not even everything), I was very full by the end of the meal and was glad when we finally got the last plate, as I knew I would be tempted to try anything new they brought out.  We didn't have room for dessert so I can't comment on it but they had some pretty interesting choices. Great place - I will be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This review is based on a recent dinner. We were a group of five people all of whom enjoy both eating, and cooking food. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, with well spaced tables despite its rather small size. We got there early on a Friday night, with a 6:30pm reservation, by 7:30pm the place was packed. The staff was very pleasant and professional in its service although it seemed slightly overwhelmed afterwards. Our bread, salads, and mussels in wine appetizers were wonderful. My friends who did not want to go to a traditional ""red sauce"" place nevertheless ordered the slowly braised meatballs, and later the three meat lasagna; although tasty they were not overly impressed. However being a Yelp reader, we ordered the striped bass on a bed of couscous, loaded with pine nuts, dried fruit, and a mild yogurt dressing, simply divine. We drank with our meals both a red Tuscan, and a white Gavi both of which perfectly complemented our dinners. We finished our meal with coffee, espresso, and both the baby Jesus cake, and a tasty chocolate torte dessert.  Overall a very tasty and satisfying dining experience. We shall return, and you too should also give it a try.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I'm a lifelong Brooklyn resident who loves pizza. And I loved the pizza here.  This place has great brick oven pies. Cheese is real and fresh with just the right amount of saltiness.

"I used to like this place. Maybe diner time is better here, but after experiencing by far THE WORST brunch , I may not go back. I was expecting the same friendly service for brunch . I mean come on, people are usually recovering from a hangover Sunday morning, a little TLC. the mascarpone pancakes were too thick, dry , and the mascarpone looked and tasted like a huge scoop of butter. My wife's eggs were a bit too salty and buttery(she ordered the frittata w/ artichokes and smoked motz). I was rushed through the ordering process with my wife. A larger group sat next to us, and our server forgot all about us. I had to get her attention several times to get a refill on water and coffee. what should only have taken 1 hour took 2 and a half because the servers were too busy taking care of the larger groups.My wife had to get up to give the server our credit card.

"I will never order from Crisp again.  I ordered lunch for several people today (four orders total) and we waited 90 minutes for it to arrive.  I called three times to check on the order.  The first time, I was put on hold and no one ever came back on the line.  The second time, the manager told me he was too busy to talk to me, but the order was on it's way and would be there in less than 10 minutes (it wasn't). He clearly invented the 10 minute estimate, since he didn't ask for my address so he could check on the order.  The third time I called, I was told that the order had already arrived (it hadn't). When the order finally arrived, I paid in cash.  The delivery guy did not have change, so I was forced to give him a very large tip.  Once I got upstairs and checked the order, I realized that one of the four orders was missing completely, and only part of another order had arrived.  I called to ask for my money back since it was already so late and we didn't want to wait for them to bring the rest of the order.  The manager agreed, but then called back a little while later to offer me a store credit instead, since his kitchen guy thought he had sent the full order.  He did not, and I did not appreciate being called a liar.  I explained that a credit wouldn't help since I was never ordering from his restaurant again, and that I wanted back the cash I paid for items that were not received.  He did eventually send back the cash for the missing items, but it took a lot of arguing to get there. I was very surprised at the level of rudeness, incompetence, and general unpleasantness shown by the staff at Crisp.  Though I've enjoyed their food in the past, I will not be frequenting this restaurant anymore.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been coming to Paulie Gee's since they first opened and am a Greenpoint neighbor and local. I, like most, of course love the pizza and am sometimes willing to wait on the ridiculously long line to savor the woodfired goodness that is their craft. One saving grace that has kept me going back and continuously supporting the business has been their option to TAKE OUT pizza as sometimes I just can't do the massive hour long wait for a pie. I was just severely disappointed to learn they are no longer doing take out orders (come on, I am even willing to PICK UP! As no delivery option wasn't enough?) as Paulie just 'doesn't feel like doing it' anymore. Your pizza may be delicious, you may be building a small empire as far as I can tell and I applaud and support this, but must your regulars suffer if they aren't willing or able to wait in line for upwards of 45 minutes on average just to sit down? Have some humility. All it takes is a few cardboard boxes and someone to pick up the phone! The humanity! Please bring take out back. I even made a Yelp account just to post this.

"I went to this place a few times. Yes, sometimes it can be busy and you have to wait. However, if you are waiting and only ordering dumplings than your wait time should be quick, unless they ran out of dumplings. There are sometimes no people there like on a saturday afternoon. There seems to be a lot of tourists coming to this place. There are also local Chinatown people there ordering food. When you order soup, your order will take longer like 10-15 minutes for wonton soup. I order the fried pork and chive dumplings and the fried pork buns. They were warm and delicious. I also tried the sesame rolls which were warm and tasted buttery. I tried the wonton soup and the roast pork with noodle. They put it in a plastic container and it was very hot. You have to wait for awhile for it to cool down before you can eat it. The roast pork was very delicious. The spicy wonton soup was also delicious.

To my surprise the two salads were split and put on separate plates for us. That is the first time I didn't need to make a mess of sharing. Then to top it all off the owner took two little boys who were dining with their families into the kitchen to make their own ice cream sundaes. Where was this place when I was a kid?

Never brought my friend's drink and we had to order it again. The Matador combo could do without the fries and sausages. Way too dry and too many carbs if you order carb appetizers too. The avocados and salad, empanadas, papas rellenos, rice and beans, and the chicken were tasty. What was not great there: maduros, yucca, and fries and sausages. These were dry a flavorless. The empanadas and papas rellenos plates came with 2 each. Everything else was generous. The chicken was flavorful tasted like the usual rotisserie kind. The fruit drink with cinnamon tasted very watered down. Bathrooms only one for women and one for men.

"I eat Halal food, at least, once a day (it is beginning to show in my waistline), and--as such--am a huge snob when it comes to how it is prepared. With that said, The Halal Guys do not make my favourite variation of Halal food by a long shot (the nerve of me, I know), but I am an Honest Abe; I cannot tell a lie! Before the diehard fans write me off as an ignorant noob with an untrained tongue, let me highlight the good things about The Halal Guys and their product, specifically the platter. Pros: Portion: The amount of food that comes with your meal is unmatched; you can trust that you are getting your money's worth, which brings me to the next pro, Price: For $6 a platter, you are given enough food to satisfy two stomachs (but if you are a champ, you chow these suckers down solo) The Sauce: I don't know what is in their white sauce, but it always keeps me coming back for more. The hot sauce--enough to render you blind with tears if you are unprepared--is also a divine treat. The Result: After finishing your meal (if you do, in fact, eat all of it), you are left in a state of euphoria. You have a full stomach, a happy soul, and firmly believe that everyone and everything in the world is lovely. If you are chowing down past 3 a.m on the weekend, you are also probably one step closer to waking up without a massive hangover. Now that we have the good, let's move on to the bad: The Rice: I find that it never tastes as good as it looks. For me, it always seems as if it is never cooked long enough, and ends up being unpleasantly hard; almost crunchy. The Flavours: Dare to eat your platter without any sauce, and you will find that the meat really is nothing to write home about. Many of the Halal carts that I frequent chop their meat up with a delicious concoction of peppers, onions, and other various spices that make the sauces an added bonus, and not a necessity, to your meal; The Halal Guys, sadly, fall short in that regard. The Chicken: I used to order the Chicken and Gyro (Lamb) combo, but after biting down into bone a number of times, I had to ditch the chicken. I understand that it happens, particularly when you are working with such a high volume of customers in such a short time span. All the same, it ruins the experience. Overall, the Halal Guys provide a tremendous service; that much is obvious with their near monopoly over Halal food in the immediate area and the reputation their brand has in NYC and beyond. You will either love The Halal Guys and become a diehard fan, kind of like it and re-visit from time to time, or downright hate it and renounce it altogether. In any case, you are sharing an experience with all who go to these famed carts and enjoying what has become a staple in an otherwise under-appreciated industry (street cart food). Bottom line? You've gotta try it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The bar was pretty empty when I went but, I thought I'd give it a try. The beers were  overpriced relative to other craft beer bars in the neighborhood. I paid $8 for a captain lawrence when they had it at Brick Yard for $5.  Cheapest draft on the menu was $7.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Such a great addition to the neighborhood food culture. Battersby already stands out as a lovely place for great service and a memorable meal.

"Recently discovered PENELOPE and have loved all the dishes I've tried. Partial to the Nutella French Toast.  Ordered food and was surprised when it wasn't up to their usual standard.  Since it was such an anomaly, I figured I'd deal.  Called to give a heads up and they were super friendly and sweet. Rushed out replacement order although I was perfectly OK with them not doing so and didn't ask.  Replacement food was delish. Fantastic attitude and good customer service. May not sound like a 'big deal' but myself and others have ordered from MANY local places to know different.  Will definitely continue to recommend to friends/coworkers!  Deliberately sought out site to review PENELOPE.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Cute little place in Woodside! Now I don't have to take the train to Manhattan to get crepes. I've tried both the sweet and the savory crepes and they're good for their price range (Nutella-Banana crepe: $4, with strawberries: $5). I've tried better in Manhattan though, but since I live a few blocks away, I can't complain! There's one person making the crepes, so when there's a line, it can be quite a wait, but the crepes are made to order. There's not a lot of seating, so my friends and I usually take them out and eat them somewhere else. It's literally across the street from the 61st-Roosevelt 7 stop, Q32, Q53, and Q18.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been here three times with my bro and thought I should finally write a review. This place has some of the best service and food in Williamsburg. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly (which is hard in Williamsburg, I always feel like the pple (who are normally hipsters) who work at these establishments have an air of superiority and no personality, but not here. The food quality is superb. Each time I have went the food has tasted so fresh and cooked to perfection. There was a minor mishap, where they brought out the wrong plates of food, and it was handled very nicely. The menu changes, but whatever they have will not disappoint you. I love this place and hope it continues to deliver the goods!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We had a lunch at Petite Crevette that was superb. we were the only ones in this tiny restaurant and had the full attention of the owner, a gregarious and delightful man, clearly well-schooled and highly talented in seafood preparation. We had fresh mozzarilla and heirloom tomatoes for an appetizer- flavorful and perfectly balanced; fried oysters that were fresh, tasty and crispy, and a simple paillard of salmon, perfectly cooked in a way that let the fresh flavorful taste of the salmon really shine. French fries and salad were great too. If this lunch is any indication, we can't wait to return for dinner. This is simple seafood, shining in its own quality and at its best.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Happened upon this cozy place happily while strolling the East Village in search of a nice brunch spot. Loved the sparkle of the chandeliers, decorative tin ceiling and the warm wood and brick textures. We slipped into a bench booth against the wall overlooking the elegant bar. Sedate, local, but happening. We spied dishes had by other guests...the white bean dip with spiced pita chips looked spectacular. We started with the Shitake mushroom tart with black truffel oil...amazing! Followed by the sauteed shrimp over grits (I love buttery grits!) with a side of chicken fennel sausage, and ""The Francisco"" a combination of scrambled eggs, squash, sundried tomatoes and basil with a side of sausage or bacon. UNBELIEVABLE flavors! Topped with cold refreshing wine goblets of Mimosas. We were so elated by our discovery, we called a couple of friends to join us on the spot.

"So many lemmings in this city ---- stop following the people on line, and  open your eyes.           This is the most filthy, digusting preparation of food I have ever witnessed.

"I am not an expert on Himalayan food, in fact I honestly don't have a clue. So, I cant speak for the authenticity of the dishes but what I can talk about is wow... I ended up here for the lunch time special the other day, and I am assuming for the savings on the electricity bill the lights inside where turned off, maybe it was the environment... who knows for what reason but it was really weird walking into a daytime dark restaurant, it gave this honest feel of some Himalayan roadside diner that you are expecting an Ox to walk in the door... Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It was really homelike... wait.. No not homelike cause an Ox is walking in the door, but it was really comfortable.. to the food.. First thing that I loved was, when the guy dropped the menu off he didn't disappear, and not that I am a service whore, it is just that at lunch time sometimes it has to be quick... But, I ended up getting No. 3. Gyathuk Ngopa sauteed noodles with fresh green veg and veg... So I assumed it was just with veg, not with veg veg, and even though I would have liked tofu, what ever, it wasn't on the menu... When the food came out, it looked like a typical run of the mill plate of noodles, but I thought for less that $6, what was I expecting... Then came the taste, and it is cause of the taste that I will be going back. There was something really honest in the flavor, cant exactly put my finger on it aside to say it wasn't bland. When I finished the plate and really wanted more... not that it wasn't enough food, just I wanted more... Would I go back? yes, without a doubt..","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I ate here last weekend.  The space is small but warm, with the hue of a fireplace, staff all very kind sincere, as if it were one's home. I could tell from the regular's at the bar and the tables that this place has been in business for a long time partly due to the faithful patronage of Soho locals.   The prices are fair, large selections of wine ranging from cheap to not so cheap.  And the menu, huge in selection all under $30. The food... delicious and generously portioned. My friend had the cassoulet which was a hearty mix of white beans lamb and sausage topped with a whole leg of duck confit.  She forced it upon me saying that it reminded her of her mother's cassoulet recipe that she ate growing up in the south of france. Super good for the belly in winter. I had the Steak Frite which honestly was a flavorful sirloin cut with not much fat for being the cheapest steak on the menu. ( I have had worse cuts for more money at some other bistro/brasseries in this city.) The Service was attentive and actually helpful. It just seemed to me that this restaurant served hearty homemade food that was French without any of that NYC pretense.   It's my new place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Welcome to Room Service - where you are greeted by a GIANT chandelier encased in glass in the middle of the restaurant. There are multiple lunch special options that range from $7-9 dollars and include a soup or appetizer and main dish.  I opted for the spring rolls (3) and the vegatarian duck over pad thai. ($8.00)  I would return - I would probably even order the same items. But let me speak for a minute about the chairs... Modern looking, silver chairs, that have the appearance of costing $400 each. I am not sure I would have paid $4 - it had me leaning near horizontal. (not kidding) So much so that the wait staff bumped into me twice walking by.

The tapas here were terrible.  The seafood croquettes were recommended by our waiter came out horrible and mushy and chewy.

"This 2-3 block radius in the EV is quite the destination for tacos these days (Otto's, San Loco, etc.) and Taqueria Diana is definitely one of the better options. I ordered takeout which was ready for pickup almost immediately. I had 2 Carnitas tacos which were very solid - only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the taco was a little bit greasy and some of the meat was a tiny bit dry, but I can look past it the one time. They had really fresh tortilla chips and the portion of guacamole was enough for 2. A very solid dinner for ~$9.

I was by myself and ended up sharing a table with a very nice German family. I got the regular Al Sharpton with a chicken leg and waffle and it was the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The waffle was firm and slightly crispy on the outside and not too sweet. The fried chicken was also nice and crispy on the outside, not too oily, and super moist inside. Drizzle some syrup over top and that salty sweet combo is oh so good. Wow. The German family got the chicken and waffles as well and loved it too. The younger one drizzled hot sauce on top but I didnt mess with perfection. The staff was also very nice and attentive. I have to go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Last night I went to Artichoke with some friends. Now I never really even heard about it, but every time I go down to the east village I always wonder what that long line is for. Given the restaurant name, I always just assumed that it was a vegetarian restaurant.  Of very little interest to me. But...surprise - it's a pizza joint - specializing in artichoke toppings.  I of course went with the artichoke & spinach pizza. Imagine creamy and cheesy artichoke and spinach dip baked on pizza dough.  Essentially it was more like a white pizza, or a dip + bread rolled all in one.  $4 bucks gets you a huge slice - definitely enough to fill you up. The pizza was very very buttery - starting off rich and gooey from the tip, but increasingly a little more dry as you work your way up the crust.  It is a very thick and doughy pizza in order to be able to hold up the heaviness of the artichoke & spinach dip. I'd say while it was certainly worth a try, the buttery and greasiness definitely got to me as I made it towards the finish line and could probably do without the crust. The best part of it was definitely the cheesy and creamy artichoke & spinach topping - so good that as in my friend Yue's words ""I just want to drink it."" But if that's the best part, maybe next time I'll just make some dip at home...and drink it up with a nice baguette.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love this place!  I've lived within a couple blocks of them for about 10 years now and they're great.  They are a go to for take out or delivery for me.  I usually order their lentil soup w/pita bread.  $5 = warm delicious dinner = I'm happy.   There might bebetter places in the area now (again, I've lived here for 10 years and this place is my habit/comfort food), and sometimes the person answering the phone speaks less than perfect English.  Overalll, though, I really like the place and have gone there to dine in with friends and taken out of town guests there and had good experiences.  They have a very lovely, albeit a little quirkly, outdoor space.  I also love their garden salad - fresh ingredients and it's fairly healthy.  They'll vary what goes into the salad depending on the season/what's fresh.  I appreciate that.   Basically, this place is the real deal, quirky, local, good food.  I think they're cash only, and BYOB, but check first.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"3.5/5 stars for me. I came here because quite frankly I saw it had over 4 stars on yelp with almost 500 reviews. That is a pretty good record in my book so I needed to check it out. Had not looked at the menu or anything but it was in the neighborhood so I called over and walked in as a party of 3. A few things. The place is HUGE. There are 2 main inside areas and then there is a garden which is closed in with skylights. It remains closed in during summer as well. We sat out back in the garden. There are fire places inside and downstairs. It is also connected downstairs to a Jazz bar which has a live jazz performing every hour or so (don't quote me on that, check the schedule). I was under the impression it was more of a dinner place but boy was I wrong. The menu is more little bites/pizza/dessert/drinks/coffee/tea, etc. We made it work and ordered a few things. Crostini, Bruschetta, Lasagna, Calzone and Pizza. It seems like a lot but things were small and we shared. We had some left over. We saved room for dessert which was good. The wine menu is massive and the cocktails looked great at other tables. I will say this. Although I had my hopes set on a nice Italian full dinner, we still left satisfied. This is a GREAT place for a date or to sit back with a few little bites and some wine or cocktails. I can totally see where it gets the high rating from. From my understanding they also have private party rooms downstairs with prix fixe menus. Stop in and check this place out. It's in a great area and accessible to many subways and after dinner places. I would suggest a reservation as the bar was very small and tables were packed.  Until next time...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I recently moved to Clinton Street about year ago and was excited to maybe have great breakfast spot down the street from me. Our main goal was to recommend this spot for our guest at the new Hotel on Ludlow. Man was I wrong. So I placed order to go and gentleman on phone sounded delightful and nice. He said the food would be ready in 20 minutes. So i figure to come 30 minutes later. Arrived and my food wasn't ready, not a big deal! I was excited! So right when he said few more minutes, I could see down food line, they had my exact order read but set up for a table. I was like, I must have ordered the right thing! So 10 min pass, 20 min? 35 min. Then guys stops his food service line and says that's actually to go guys! Man was I angry because the meal been sitting there before I got there and 45 minutes already passed! I couldn't blame the service line due to the fact the cannot speak English. So he dumps all this food we order in plastic container, I mean I order 50$ worth of breakfast alone for my self. No syrup, no butter, cold waffles, cold pancakes, eggs and everything was just Nasty and hard. Unfortunately we just threw it away. I was imaging maple syrup? Whip butter? We gotNothing :( but high hopes. we had to crunch on a dry waffle and toss it after 4 minutes.

"Killer spot to meet up with friends or end the night. Old meets hip but on the boarder of gaudy interior. It's high ceilings offer allot of real estate for pictures, statues and mirrors.

"So after months of a friend urging  and raving about the pancakes, we finally grabbed brunch here last Saturday and I must say...those pancakes were everything. I prefer waffles over pancakes because of the difference in texture. Waffles are usually crispy and pancakes are usually undercooked and tastes doughy in the middle. However these pancakes were sent from heaven. Hint of sweetness, crispy on the outside and cooked just right on the inside and the mixed fruit on top (strawberries,bananas, and blueberries) were very fresh. I couldn't finish the two pancakes because they are huge and extremely filling. But had I known you could order just 1 I would have done that. So FYI you can order just one. Didn't try anything else. But I'll be back. Thanking my friend for suggesting.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We visited Eataly right after returning from Italy in June, and it is stunningly like the approach to food shopping there.  No all-purpose grocery, but rather, a set of small stores selling cheese OR meats OR produce.  Of course it is crowded because it's NYC, but the prices are not much different than we saw in Florence and Stresa and Rome.  The food was authentic.  Crowded yes.  Noisy yes.  But the food we ate there was fabulous -- just like we had in Italy two weeks earlier.  The capachinno was authentically slightly bitter, just like we enjoyed in Rome.  I fear that many of the reviews I have read about Eataly say more about the reviewers than about this adventurous place!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Do or Dine Where? 1108 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11216 Foie gras doughnut.  Need I say more?  When you go to this place, you have to try multiple dishes.  They are just so unique.  I'll go into detail below if you are interested but just as a tip, make sure to keep your eye out for this place or you will continue to walk past it over and over.  Their awning is from the previous owner--an Indian Bakery.  The inside is nicely designed, from the beautiful tables and table settings to the bar.  This place is a must when visiting NYC. -Foie Gras Doughnut (doughnut, foie gras mousse and jam): Ok normally I wouldn't eat duck liver (I can't stomach it) but I figured, eh, it's in a doughnut, how bad could it be?  WOW.  You initially taste the fried dough (which is heavenly) but then you get a tart taste that is somehow lemony and salty all at once.  But oh, then comes the sweet jam.  It just melts in your mouth leaving you wanting more and more.   -Lamb Breast (fatty, cumin, lime): When you first take a bite, you think it's over-seasoned because of the thick crust.  But then you get a taste of the meat which is perfectly juicy, tender and rich--and this is coming from someone who doesn't like lamb.  The end taste is smoky which is nice because it offsets the huge amount of fat you intake (which is a bit too much if you ask me). -A Fish and some Chips (fries, yuzu-shallot vinaigrette): Certainly not your traditional fish. You are served a whole flesh-fried fish (so no breading).  Also.  What is yuzu?  It's a citrus fruit originating in East Asia.  It's like a hybrid of sour mandarin and ichang papeda (Chinese lemon) and looks like a grapefruit.  So how did it taste?  The fish didn't have much taste at all actually--but it was still crispy.  The fries were also very crispy and you could taste the freshness of the potatoes which were perfectly smoky and sweet.  But the yuzu-shallot vinaigrette was really what made this dish.  Not knowing what yuzu was, it tasted like a lemon/hibiscus garlic and onion mix which really added a lot of flavor to both the fish and fries.  Unfortunately I still taste it on my breath a day later. -Chicken & Woffals (jerk, pineapple, maple): The chicken is extremely tender and falls off the bone.  The waffle is perfect--not too soggy, not too hard (and I'm not a waffle fan either).  This waffle was topped with a pineapple/maple glaze that must have had cinnamon. Together it is an interesting combination of moist and chewy, but I prefer to eat the chicken before digging into the waffle as the juices from the chicken mix perfectly with the cinnamon to create a sweet/salty taste. FINAL VERDICT:  Every item I ordered on the menu I would never order anywhere else.  They all sound disgusting to me. Gross. But they were delicious and I had an amazing dining experience.  I wouldn't mind going back to try the E666S, Fawn-tons, Bone, Slugs & Hominy, and the Flank...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"$10 brunch for good size portions and excellent food, can't be beat!  It includes coffee, tea or mimosa. The French Toast melts in your mouth. The croque monsieur was also divine. The emmenthaler cheese forms a golden crust on top and they somehow manage to keep the bread from being soggy. We ordered 1 poached egg and they gave us 2 for just $1.  They have a small TV at the bar where you can watch sports. The downside is that the place is a bit cramped in space, it took a little while for the food to come out, and the insufficient A/C. I wouldn't  come on a hot and humid day.  Also, it's pricier for lunch/dinner (entrees are $16 and up), so I would suggest just coming for brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Low fi Red Hook Hipster Haunt Have you ever been to a place were everything seems to happen without a word ever been spoken? When my party and I arrived there was a quiet look from our hairy hipster waiter who in Jesus like fashion held out a hand suggesting our table. My party was in the mood for burgers and beer however the menu was limited.   Not knowing what to order they all settled for some broccoli side dish and King Bee cocktails. I had a simple but delicious fish stew and a hearty oatmeal beer.  Some how all my party's grumblings about filling their stomachs with comfort food disappeared with one sip of their cocktails and one bite of the broccoli. There are some unique choices on the menu and the portions are moderate but everything is surprisingly tasty in this low fi relaxed neighborhood haunt.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"My FAVORITE place to go for breakfast. This is the kind of establishment that reminds me of old New York, where my grandfather might have gone to freshen up with a cup of joe after a successful night of poker with the guys. There's just room enough to shimmy in and find a seat at the counter, with a waitress, a short order cook and a cashier behind the counter, and a larger kitchen in the back where they bake fresh goods and cook homemade Ukranian/American dining essentials (soups, perogies, meatloaf) every day. The services is friendly and quick, and most of the patrons are locals and obviously regulars. And one can't forget to mention how cheap it is: you can easily walk out at the end of a meal, very happily full, w/ change from a $10. Leave Veselka to the hoi polloi of tourists and nouveau transplants. The Stage is for those who appreciate old school charm, only.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friends and I went here on a Sunday afternoon (first time for all of us). There were 5 of us total and we ended up having to wait a bit for a table. I had read the reviews that this place was small but I didn't realize it was THAT small! This is definitely not the place to take a group of more than 6. The server was extremely nice and attentive. He wasn't always pestering us but he always came around the time we were ready to order, have our plates taken away, etc. The owner, on the other hand, is a different story. From the reviews, I expected an old Filipino man. Instead it was an old white guy that looked a little out of place and kept suggesting food I didn't really like. Luckily I was there to let my friends know that his suggestions weren't that great. I was a little bit insulted by that too because I'm Filipino myself and eat a lot of the stuff off the menu on a daily basis, homecooked by my grandma. He was kind of annoying but didn't bother us TOO much. I'm grateful to him though for owning a restaurant serving good, affordable Filipino cuisine. For appetizers, we ordered lumpiang shanghai (fried pork spring rolls with sweet and sour dip) and lumpiang sariwa (vegetable crepe with peanut sauce). For entrees, we got kare kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut soup with shrimp paste on the side), bbq pork skewers, lechon kawali (fried pork belly) and grilled chicken with vinegar dip; all with a side of the delicious garlic rice, cooked just the way my grandma makes it. All of these dishes tasted just like grandma's, which is exactly what I wanted. For dessert, we ordered the special halo halo (ice, evaporated milk with various other toppings with purple yam ice cream on top), mango float (mango on top of frozen cream) and leche flan (a thicker variation of Spanish flan). Appetizers, entrees, drinks and desserts pleased everyone, which comprised of me (lifelong Filipino food fan) and my friends (first timers). Grill 21 is definitely a place I want to keep going to. Though I agree that the places in Flushing are probably better, Grill 21 is a great go to for people such as me and my friends who don't have the time to trek from Brooklyn to Queens. Grandma would approve!","[1.0, 0.0]"
Ambiance and decor great. Food-ok.  Would definitely come back for drinks and sit at the bar but the food is overrated.

"Meh with a tend to the downside. I ordered the pork medallions and spicy peppers. The medallions turned out to be flavorless cutlets about 1/4"" thick and the peppers turned out to be some confusing concoction of what appeared to be shredded cabbage, onions, black & green olives, some kind of fruit and no taste. When I asked where the peppers were the waiter and the manager appeared confused and said that perhaps the kitchen had changed the offering and didn't alert them. WTF? I then was offered the opportunity to get something else and opted for a chicken souvlaki which came with unsalted home made potato chips. The chicken was flavorless. 2 lousy selections. On the positive side the attempt to resolve the problem with the first meal was quick and responsive. My grandkids ordered the braised lamb shank and a lamb burger, both of which tasted pretty good based on my small sample bite. While leaving we noticed the place was packed both upstairs and downstairs with the upstairs (entry level) noise level pretty much off the charts for me. Some people must really like this place, my wife and I just don't happen to be among them.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a Food Network fetishist's wet dream, isn't it? Just opened in August, it's over 50,000 square feet of mangi molto beni Italia courtesy of restaurateurs and TV cooking personalities Mario Batali (Babbo) and Lidia Matticchio Bastianich (Becco, Felidia) and her son Joe, in collaboration with Oscar Farinetti, the original Eataly founder in Turin. Be prepared for a level of sensory overload that you would expect if you mixed Dean & Deluca with Venice's Rialto Market and threw in a steakhouse, a Neapolitan pizzeria, a coffee bar and a rooftop beer garden for good measure. But when is there too much of a good thing? I guess when it becomes a chore to navigate the swarms of crowds who are browsing every nook and cranny of the expansive market hall. I came with friends on a Friday evening, and people were blitzing through the place so quickly that it was hard to focus on anything in particular until you come upon the prices. Not cheap. But then again, you're in the middle of the increasingly fashionable Flatiron district, so what do you expect? It's definitely worth a visit when you're in town, but make sure you allot enough time to browse the entire hall, especially if you have a poster of Giada de Laurentiis hanging above your headboard. And mamma mia, don't eat beforehand!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was recommended this place by a friend who lives around the corner and after reading the yelp reviews I just had to try it. I swung in on my way to meet a friend for a drink a few blocks away (thinking it would be a good meal on the go). And I was right. Since the empanadas are pretty inexpensive (and I was starving), I ordered 3 empanadas: (2) spicy chicken & (1) pernil. The order came out in about 10min and both types were spot on and delicious. I didn't even make it to my second spicy chicken. Since I was on the move I didn't get too much use out of the salsas but the order came with a red and green. Oh and it's open 24hrs! I can't wait to go back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"4.5 stars... Arepas Cafe is definitely worth taking a trip out of the way for. Their arepas are bigger, better, and cheaper than the more well known Caracas Arepa Bar (which is also very good). The restaurant is small but still bigger than Caracas and is very clean with plenty of elbow room. Though they have more than arepas here you'd really be missing out if you didn't try the Venezualan specialty that is only available at a few places in the city. For $6.75 (or a little less if you get one of their lunch specials Monday-Friday 11-4) you get a made to order giant arepa stuffed with plump sweet plantains, phenominal shredded beef, black beans, and aged white cheese (the Pabellon). One may not be big enough if you've got a big appetite but two is way too much, trust me on this one. The lunch specials come with a juice of your choosing. I went with chicha, a traditional thick South American drink made from rice and cinnamon. I found the thick consistency of pureed rice to be a little off putting and the amount of sweetness and cinnamon to be too much. I've never had chicha so don't know how authentic this was but if the arepas are any indication it's as good as it gets. Needless to say next time I'll get the jugo de papelón con limón (brown sugar sweetened lemonade), or just spring for the sangria I've heard so much about.  I've now had the traditional pabellon arepa from three places and this one is definitely my favorite.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Big Wong King is one of the oldest Cantonese staples in Chinatown New York.  Surely, it is Cantonese fast food known for cramped seating, bill is submitted to your table immediately after your orders are served and wait staff anxiously waiting to clear the table for the next party.  N.B.  Do not expect Dim Sum at Big Wong King as they are known for noodle soup and entree dishes.  Hustle and bustle busy and extreme high noise volume reminisce me of small dinning rooms in Hong Kong noodle shops.  It is also known as a tourist trap and a favorite for locals in cheap eats category.

"Stella 34 Trattoria - Early evening, midweek dining, moderately priced for tourists, bill includes suggested 18 or 20 percent gratuity including alcohol. Cocktails: FRAGOLI SMASH chunky fruit, more chew than drink, LIMONCELLO MOJITO missing limoncello, both smart, fresh and tasty if you sip before the glass full of ice begins to melt. Starter: CALAMARI crisp, hot with fried bits of pickled pepper, we like. Pizza: Classic MARGHERITA thin crust, just seconds in the oven, perfect, hard to get wrong, would have benefited from a warmed plate. Special: Rotisserie pork with smokey, crisp skin complemented by sharp broccoli rabe. Sweet Closer: Sheep's milk ricotta cheesecake, very light custard slice, cheesecake not. Lemon Genovese original recipe with a dollop of Vivoli Il Gelato, yum. Menu heavy on the Naples experience and intimidating to a regular person.

We both got the paleo chicken wrap with a side of roasted pineapple and sweet potato hash. The chicken wrap was in a crepe like wrap and was filling but just eh. The sweet potato hash was less sweet potato and more filler and the pineapple was very sweet (but can't fault them for that, roasted fruit usually gets sweeter). Portions were pretty big, but prices were very high. They have a big selection of snacks too, but the kale chips and chocolate I tried were pretty bad and I think if I tried this place again, it would just be for the chicken.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to Taim for the first time last month with a friend who swore that it was one of the best Middle Eastern places he'd found in Manhattan. I was not disappointed. The mixed falafel plate was delicious and a good bargain for the amount of food. The falafel was perfectly cooked: crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. The side salads were all uniquely flavored, and each one added something different to the dish. The smoothies are also a nice touch to offset eating a plate full of fried falafel. My only complaint about this place is the seating (it's tiny inside with room for about 7 customers) but that wouldn't be much of a problem if guests made more of an effort to get up as soon as they finish eating. Still, delicious food and I will definitely go back next time I'm in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Two of us arrived on a Saturday night with no reservations. The hostess politely told us it would be about an hour, took our phone number (for one of those cool text paging systems), and recommended a great craft beer bar down the street when we asked her for suggestions. About 45 minutes later we got the ""your table is almost ready, hurry back"" text. Everything about our meal was outstanding, from our server, to the bread, to the crab cakes, oysters (which our server helped us select), and the mussels. We also had multiple drinks (2 beers and 2 glasses of wine?) and our bill was right at $100 after tip. This was our favorite food stop on our trip to NYC. We love Yelp for helping us discover it! **4 stars instead of 5 because my husband came down with a really bad case of food poisoning a little over 24 hours later (not sure about the statute of limitations on seafood type food poisoning). We had been eating out all week, so its hard to say if it was maybe a bad mussel or something completely unrelated, but we share everything and I did not get sick (where as, you cannot share an oyster or mussel).

"Being from Louisiana, I got so excited when I heard this place had opened. I went in today with my roommate. We ordered the Boudin Balls (delicious!), the Muffaletta sandwich (the olive component made it super tasty), the Red Beans and Rice (my roommate loved them and added the Crystal Louisiana sauce like a good southerner-in-training), the Macaroni and Cheese (yummy yummy breading!),  and the Gumbo (no one's gumbo can be better than my mom and family's, but being a block away from me- a very warm substitution!). We also had two desserts. The Bread and Buttermilk dessert laden in bourbon sauce- sublime! All I was missing was milk and a place to curl up in a fetal position (though the pillows on the back of the booths provided a nice touch). This dessert can be shared. The other dessert was chocolatey goodness with peanut butter crumbles. A good single serving size as I would not have wanted to get into the habit of sharing. We were too stuffed to try any of the cocktails. I look forward to trying the PoBoys and Fried Chicken Entree. The decor, feel, and food is a welcome addition to a community saturated with European venues. It brings something different which is nice. One of the owners spoke with us and expressed his love for Louisiana. Our friendly waitress informed us the chef was from New Orleans. Mardi Gras beads were placed in the bill tray for a nice touch. Today was their second day opening, so with any new restaurants I am sure they have many more details to work out. I look forward to when they offer earlier hours, brunches, and potentially more additions to the menu (Beignets and Shrimp/CrawfishEtouffee, please!!!).

"This place is TOURISTY, and Lombardi really plays up the fact that they were the first pizza joint (or so they claim). But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the pizza here, especially when they offer half off their plain margheritas, something that seems to happen often enough. My mom and I ordered a small margherita (6 pieces), which fed us comfortably, and added mushrooms and meatballs. While certainly not the most delicious pizza I've ever had (that distinction goes to American Flatbread in Vermont), you can't really go wrong. They know how to make a crispy crust and don't overdo it on the tomato sauce or cheese. The homemade meatballs are also delicious. I highly recommend it as a topping. Overall, the pizza is a little bland for my taste, though. I don't think I could eat it without some sort of meat and a lot of chili flakes. Two more good things I have to say about this place: First, I like the simplicity of the menu. It kind of implies that Lombardi's tries to do a few things well versus doing a lot of things mediocrely, and the former is how I prefer to roll. Second, they have a large dining space and a fast turnover rate. I guess it's not really a place where people come to enjoy four hour meals. We came on half off day at 5:30 and were seated 15-20 minutes later, which I would say is impressive. In the end, I think we ended up paying around $14 for the two of us, which was by far the cheapest non-food-cart meal I had this past weekend in New York. Success!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Sauce had great flavor, pasta was cooked nicely and the meats were tender and delicious. I still would never go out to Crown Heights voluntarily, but this place was really good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here for a party of 10. They seated us even though half of our party was missing. The place is very cozy, just what i like.

It was very flavorful with a hint of spice to it and lots of shrimp! The pappadelle with oxtail ragu was good as well. I've tried the steak also, but it was nothing special.

"OH MY GOODNESS!! Am I back in Texas?  I absolutely loved Tres Carnes.  I had a bowl with pork shoulder...amazing!  The pork was so soft and delicious and smoky, the hot sauce was actually Hot!  I always feel like I can't find tasty hot sauce in New York.  I loved that they had roasted squash available as a topping.  The blackeyed black beans, were to die for!  So much better than chipotle or dos toros!!!  2 thumbds up for the guacamole. I can't express how much I love this place, it tastes like home.  Also a plus that it's close to my office! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
I do not recommend this place. Far too many French bistros to settle here. The mussels Parisienne were very dry and the French fries too salty. The duck dry as well although the potatoes and mushrooms had a nice zing with the spices used. Ordered artichoke salad for entree artichokes lovely seasoned although a tad over cooked. Did not pair well with the dressing and arugula. This place was recommended by a friend since. Was in the Murray hill area. Thank you but no thank you. Too pricey for the quality of food.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"This lonesome star is awarded for the wonderful food this establishment is capable of dishing out. The 4 missing stars that would have been rewarded are missing due to the lack of concern the staff have for waiting customers. While it may be thought to be a plus to be able to sit at a table for as many hours as one wishes without ordering food or drink, this practice eventually results in the failure of many establishments. Three tables with yapping girls slowed out evening down with a full hour and a half wait at the door. Normally I would jump ship and head for another spot but it was 11 pm and I had no choice but to appreciate the food at this spot. Bottom line. If you eat here please be courteous and don't take up a table just to chat for hours. If the place fails because of you we all loose. Don't be selfish :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

Nicki's has better and more balanced filling, but holy crap, the rolls they use at Hanco's are the real deal. Seriously, where do they get them?! I once called in an order at 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday and an hour later I still had nothing to show for it. Order after order went in, and next to nothing came out of the kitchen. They even took a summer roll out of my order's almost-finished to-go bag and gave it to an annoyed customer, a minute later explaining that all I was waiting for was a summer roll. Good job.

"The best macarons I have ever had in NYC!  After having macarons here, I never want to go back to my old place.  Even my friend has a negative experience from the macarons she previously had somewhere else, enjoys Laduree's macarons.  Laduree's macarons are fresh and made right; smooth, light, fluffy, slightly sweet, and perfectly chewy on the inside.  They are $2.80 each which is pricey, but given the high quality it's totally worth it.   This beautiful shop has a fancy ambiance with no seating area.  It wasn't busy in noon so I was basically the only person in the store.  However, it was busy in the late afternoon, but the long line moved quickly so I waited 5 minutes to order.   The flavors I tried were Pistachio, Raspberry, Vanilla, Rose Petal, Strawberry candy, Green Apple, Coffee, Blackcurrant Violet.  All were amazingly delicious and melt in my mouth!  Laduree's Pistachio macarons are made from real pistachios, which I can taste in it.  The Raspberry flavor is specially filled with straight-up jam, which makes the shells of the macaron are extra-moist, so you must take extra care of it.  Pistachio, Vanilla, and Rose Petal were my favorite and simply divine. Better get 8 macarons and have them put in the free box rather than getting less with a bag.  Otherwise, the macarons would be easily crushed. The staffs are friendly, helpful, and packaging is beautiful. If you love macarons, this is a not-to-miss stop.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Super dumplings for dirt cheap prices! This is a quintessential hole-in-the-wall, greasy Chinese place. The woman who runs the counter is friendly, but speaks very little English, so stick to the numbering system when ordering. The pork and chive fried dumplings are the best when hot, but their quality drops if they've been sitting out. The fried dumplings are superior when they're fresh, but the steamed dumplings are a little more consistent and a little cheaper. Their stuffed buns are an equally tasty and cheap option, but their Little Juicy Buns (#9) can be a bit tough on the bottom where they are cooked... No innuendo intended in that sentence. Their sesame pancakes are tasty, but greasy and a little dry. Their noodles and fried rice come in large portions for their cheap price. This is my favorite dumpling/Chinese place in Downtown Brooklyn/Polytech area, hands down.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ducked in here for a couple drinks early on a weekday evening.  Pretty relaxed atmosphere, mostly people getting out of work and some student types.  Bar was nice and comfy, not crowded at all at that hour (around 6-7PM).  Didn't go for any fancy cocktails but the vodka tonic I had was nice and strong and not too expensive.  They have some nice ryes available that I'd like to come back and try.  If beer is your thing, this seems to be a good spot.  Service was good, nothing spectacular, but my ice cubes didn't get dry and they were playing good music. Split the poutine with a friend and it was lovely.  The cheese curds seemed to be house-made, the gravy was excellent and the potatoes themselves were perfect.  AND they put a fried egg on top, and when the runny yolk mixes with the gravy, it is a beautiful thing.  Also tried the house-made pickles, which were a little bit of a let-down.  The pickled cucumbers and red peppers were good but the plate was mostly pickled fennel.  A whole lot of pickled fennel.  Don't get me wrong, it was interesting and all, but there's a limit to how much of that I can eat.  Although it did make for a nice bright contrast with the rich fatty poutine.  Apparently the pickles are always changing, so perhaps you won't get so much fennel if you try them. Overall, nice spot, I will definitely return, and I'll be thinking of that runny egg & gravy combo for awhile.   Four Stoli cocktails, order of poutine and order of pickles: $50 before tip.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pros: (Extremely) cheap food that is accessible until 4 a.m. in the middle of Chinatown which pretty much shuts down by 9 p.m. The food here is good and fast, I'm a big fan of their congee, roast meat, and pan-fried noodles. It seems like this places is in favor of non-Chinese folks (Maybe that says how Americanized the restaurant is) so it's a good spot to bring your non-Chinese friends who are not yet used to eating chicken feet and shark's fin. Cons: The place has been shut down by the Department of Health more than couple times. When you enter the place, you might understand why.  It's also quite small considering its popularity, so most of the time you will have to wait for a couple minutes (Not for long though). Overall: A solid Chinese noodle place if you are craving for some hot noodle soup or just good Chinese noodles in general. That is, of course, if you are willing to ignore the fact that the place has violated sanitation standards many times. Sometimes, not knowing everything does make your food taste better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The vodka sauce pizza is genius, and though the flavor itself is probably not that hard to replicate (I mean its basically good mozzarella scattered and embedded in a generous slathering of cream/vodka/tomato), what makes it great is the crispety crust. It's so thin and light, but not dried out the way you'd imagine a cracker. Because its so thin though, the cornmeal normally just used for dusting actually stands out and adds a little texture/crunch, which stands up against richness of the sauce and the somewhat chewy, hardened-in-a-good-way cheese. The arugula salad, while also simple, was made great by the execution. Really thinly grated ricotta salata pretty much cover the arugula that are lightly dressed in a citrusy vinaigrette.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After biking over the manhattan bridge, i found myself in chinatown and was hungry so I stopped by here. I had only $3 in my wallet so it was perfect! $2.75 for 10 dumplings. CASH ONLY. I got 10 pork and chive steamed dumplings which were really good. the dough wrapping was fresh and not too thick. The insides were really delicious. It almost had a soup dumpling feel and taste... just not as ""soupy"".. if you understand? It had a really good flavor. It tasted great even without soy sauce or sriracha, but of course those make it even better. I recommend eating it right away or soon after while it's still hot (don't burn your tongue though... which I did) I was disappointed with the price though... It used to be 10 steamed for $2 but now it's $2.75. Still cheap but a pretty big jump. Also, the sesame pancakes are not 50cents but now $1. Someone should update the prices on yelp. BUT STILL AWESOME! loved their dumplings. I want to try the fried ones... but i think if it's your first time, you should keep it pure and get the steamed ones.

Both were good (we didn't have to ask for less salt this time), but this time, I felt that the noodles were too al dente for my taste rather than fresh-tasting as I had remembered. However, they were still good, and only my appetite for the deliciousness made me eat the rest of the food (even though I was already full). We ordered the first dessert (the cake with the mild cream cheese/mascarpone thing), which turned out to be what we needed. However, we didn't manage to finish it, even though the cream was delicious. We ended up paying $20 each, which was not bad for the amount of food we had. Next time, though, I'd recommend getting less food :x We both left feeling really bloated.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came to Upstate on a Tuesday night for a get together of six people at 8pm. Three of us arrived early, and we were greeted by an attentive staff and the owner himself.  We didn't know which local brew to choose from, so he poured us a flight to try - first time getting a flight of beer! We expected a wait of about 45 mins for a table of six, and the wait was about right. It was worth the wait.   Menu was just the right size, a good variety of oysters, and the softshell crabs were very lightly battered, with little to no oil or grease. And they were sized very very well! Service was excellent, and the owner and staff took their time to explain the menu and interact with us. Upstate is a repeat for sure!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Great brunch and wonderful food and wonderful servers.  The only issue we had was the salad which was over salted.  They made up for it with a free dessert.  Classy.   The steak tartar was exceptional - get it w/o the bulgar if you are gluten free. I am giving them only 4 stars because we are gluten free and did not get the bread.  Instead we asked for lettuce to be used with our tartar.  They happily obliged but charged us extra for them.  If you don't get the bread then the lettuce should be free just like the bread should have been.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was looking forward to finally finding time to try Scarpetta after seeing all the positive reviews by fellow yelpers.   4 Stars for the ambiance & location in meat packing, but if you're actually there for the quality of food, I couldn't find myself giving anything but 3 stars.   First off, our table received the appetizer Soft Shell Crab and I had to ask the wait staff if we were going to get their ""famous bread basket"" that I've seen raved on yelp.  The Soft Shell Crab was by far the biggest let down, over priced even factoring in the ambiance and location, the crab was teeny tiny.  Most venues in the city would offer the same for 2/3 the cost and still be profiting.  Nothing special in flavor only plated beautifully.  I regret not trying their polenta dish. We tried the Foie Gras ravioli & Lobster Farfalle.  The lobster was not fresh.  The Foie Gras ravioli was too salty.  The portions as others mentioned were tiny, but the Foie Gras ravioli due to the heavyness of the dish was more than enough.   After our plates were cleared incredibly fast by the wait staff we waited over 15 min for a dessert menu to be served.  Needless to say I was completely disappointed with Scarpetta.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It's always at least an hour late, and it's a miracle if the pizza is hot when it's delivered. And this is after we order before 10am!!

"I was here last week with my wife. She truly wanted Grimaldis but every time we are in Dumbos the long line never gave me the appetite to wait. So, as a Brooklyn native, I've said why not, let's wait this time to see what the hype is all about. The line went quickly, especially if you are a couple it's a lot easier to get in than with a group. We were seated within 30 mins of waiting outside, not bad. We've ordered a large pie with meatballs topping. It took about 20 minutes to get it but this is expected and not bad of a wait. I've expected something remarkable on my first bite of the pizza, and I was disappointed. I had better pizza in Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Gravesend areas. I guess I've wanted for the dough to be thinner and crunchier, not doughy and burnt. It was a good meal just nothing over the top. I'll leave this spot for the tourists. PS. The prices are decent for a Dumbo location.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came here this week before the Monday night show at Birdland -- the overall layout is very intimate yet not very cramped.  There seemed to be 4 major 'rooms' inside one of which is upstairs and overlooks the street.  We were placed in the back corner somewhere (I made a reservation 2 hours before), but it did not seem 'secluded' and we received prompt attention from the staff. So the wine selection -- they have a *huge* list as one option, but they also have a 30$ or so  (forget exactly how much it is) bottle selection on the dinner menu.  We ordered off that and honestly it was very good, and not just given the price. For food I ordered the 'pounded' and breaded veal and we went with the 3 pastas as an app.  The pastas were very good, as was the caesar salad, and the veal was very well cooked, though the melted cheese on it was a bit overwhelming to the flavor of the meat itself.  After the caesar, pasta, wine, and veal we had no room for desert unfortunately.  Clearly they cater to the theater crowd like everyone else on that street, but honestly Becco seemed to be a bit above the norm for that street.  If you do have a play to go to or are in the area give it a shot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What a delicious idea!  A must try! The secret is to go during off hours.  The wait can be long but if you come after 3pm and before 6pm on Sat or Sunday, there is usually room at the bar or only a quick wait for a table. R and I went to the Meatball Shop on a Sat around 2:45pm and waited only 10 min for a seat at the bar.  Here is what we had: 1) Mint Lemonade - A great refreshing start 2) Classic Meatball Slider with Mushroom Sauce - The Classic was just that, ""classic"" - good but I would skip it and try something else.  We weren't terribly impressed by the mushroom sauce. 3) Vegetarian meatball with Spicy Meat Sauce - Hands down our favorite.  We were shocked to find the vegetarian meatball so tasty and it went very well with the spicy meat sauce 4) Chicken meatball with Pesto - Their pesto is made with basil and spinach.  One of our favorite sauces - HIGHLY recommended! 5) Spicy pork with spicy tomato sauce - The pork was very light.  We really enjoyed these balls! 6) Jambalaya ball with tomato sauce - This was the special ball and R's favorite.  It was delicious!   Save room for dessert!!!! They have the best ice cream sandwiches that we have ever had.  For dessert we had the chocolate ice cream with the peanut butter cookie on one side and brownie on the other.  The peanut butter cookie was AMAZING!

"Alright, so I came here and got the famous Artichoke pizza. On the one hand, it makes sense to order the one item an establishment is most known and renowned for. On the other hand, this always brings me problems when it happens to be an item that my taste buds just can't appreciate for the life of them. I strolled right up and ordered it without even realizing it was thick Sicilian, and that just killed it for me. Nothing could make the thick crust of cardboard meat appetizing for me. Moreover, the pizza was too damn rich, creamy, and artichoky, and I had to toss it to the nearest trash about 1/3rd through the slice. Yeuch. As you'll notice, my opinion is a pretty personal one, and I'm sure for those out there who can appreciate this, it's tops. Just not for me.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is the real deal. After a 20-30 minute wait (Monday afternoon), we were at our little table squished in with a mixture of tourists and regulars. After eyeing the simple pizza next to us, the decision to get a regular plain small pizza for two ($12) was made. The place has a great atmosphere: an entire wall dedicated to Sinatra; jazz hits playing; and the typical red and white checked nylon table cloths. Everyone was very friendly, and because it was tight quarters, we chatted with the people next to us. The pizza was nice and toasty, with crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil. The crust was chewy and floppy, but with a good crunch at the edges; something I've been trying to acheive in my oven at home. Basically, if you're looking for what New York style pizza is supposed to be, this is it, and at a hard-to-beat price.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The fried burger didn't really have much flavor, and so it was really disappointing since we waited so long for it to come out. It was alright, but not for 15$. Probably wouldn't get it again or at least not at Korzo. So the price, quality, and service was a huge no-no.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"very pleasant surprise!  hearth is the kind of restaurant that is reliable on good food that comforts your soul.  the restaurant itself is a touch of class... you will feel as if you're sitting in front of a fire place from back home.  let's face it.. fireplaces in new york city, is not very common.  nothng over the top, and no surprises.  which is OK.  i don't need every other restaurant to be  new modern american cuisine... and they seasonal change their menu.... highlights - grilled quail with quail egg, served over farro and a few other veggies... delish... it was an appetizer portion, but i definitely could eat this as an entree if they just given me another piece of quail.  the farro gives is a nice firmer texture which I appreciated.   spaghetti w/ veal & ricotta meatballs.... pasta was amazing...chewy texture that I love so much (think udon noodles) and anything veal if properly cooked spits out tender bits of meat. moist and flavorful combined with the soft and delicate ricotta cheese.   i would come back for this dish alone.   impressed that such a restaurant exists in east village...but then again ... there are many gems in this neighborhood, even if there are a dime and dozen Japanese restaurants.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A perfect example to ""don't judge a book by its cover."" Don't judge this restaurant by its cover, or in this case by its appearance. We were a bit skeptical when we first entered the place. The seats weren't in the best condition, and the overall looks were not very convenient or pretty. But you know what? The ramen was great and that was the most important thing for me. Ordered a Yasai Ramen (veggie ramen) and it was actually delicious. I went before to Ise Ramen in midtown and Jinya Ramen in the West Village (which sadly closed) and this was the best ramen I had in the city thus far. It also cost $12 which is pretty fair for what you get. In summary: great ramen, bad looks. I liked it, just hope they will change / improve the interior design. Although you enter a restaurant to eat, what you see around you maybe isn't equally important as the food, but it is important nonetheless.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My neighborhood default food spot. I love it here, the hot food plates are the shit and everything is vegan or vegetarian except the cod fish. Yes I accidentally ate a whole fucking plate of it thinking that everything here was veg. my fault. i admit it. let's move on. The hot foods include: curry chicken, sweet and sour ribs, and pepper steak all of which I've tried and all tasty. Everything plate comes with steamed veggies and brown rice with peas. The portions are generous large plates are enough for 2 and only 7 bucks and small plates are 5 bucks and filled to the brim. I always get a small whatever and eat one of their amazing patties. Even my meat eating tour partner Melissa loves them and that's a big deal. They've got soy, chicken, veggie, peas, jerk tofu, and fish. Hang on, not sure if the fish is veg, you should ask. I've had all of them, but the chicken- ridiculously flavorful and the crust flaky and fatty. The soy is good too, and so is the jerk tofu but the veggie is bland and boring. stay away unless you like lame food. They've also got smoothies, wheat grass, and a small grocery section of deli foods, trail mix, nuts, chocolate, and other assorted supplements and healthy looking things. I haven't had much of their baked goods but they have coconut cookies, sweet breads, muffins, cake, and cookies. Some of them vegan like the carrot cake, walnut brownies, and fruit cake. I've tried the fruit cake since it was something I haven't had before. It tastes like a Chinese haw flake dipped in red wine. I imagine it turns some people on, but it wasn't for me. Overall, a great place to meet a friend(just 1 or 2 since it really only has one table for 3/4 and bar stools), or take out, shoot some wheat grass, and eat flavorful, cheap, and healthy vegan Jamaican food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The highlight of my NYC trip. First night in, sat on a plane all day from Seattle. Plunked our bags down, grabbed a cab, and at 1:00am banged down to Employees Only for some beats, bevvies, and late night grub. Dark and on Thursday night, packed shoulder to shoulder with pretty people. Friendly door guy, friendly maitre'd. Sat in the back and ordered exquisite drinks, my favorite Blood and Sand perfectly executed and a fabulous jalapeno-infused mescal martini I forget the name of. To cap it off was the steak tartare. My first steak tartare was at Cafe Claude in San Francisco, then again in Seattle's Walrus and the Carpenter. Employees Only surpassed both. I could have eaten the beast tail to ears if it was prepared this way by them. Dear.Lord.Me.Delish. Our sweet waitress agreed, nodded that it was probably best in the city.

"My partner and I had a 9pm reservation last night, Saturday. Restaurant was almost full but emptied out around 9:45. Agreeed with other reviewers that if your are looking for quiet and intimate location probably best visit earlier in the evening or midweek ... Staff were very attentive and welcoming.  Male waiter knew the menu and offered advice when asked. Actually I would probably rate him one of best waiters in a long time. He visited regularly but didnt do overkill.  The wine we brought was opened immediately after we sat down and our water was refilled as necessary. Food was excellent, a little on the rich side for my palate and I considered the portions to be sufficient ... In fact given the richness of the food the portions were in balance. We shared the goat cheese tartlet and I enjoyed lamb for entree and my partner hungrily ate up his rare steak. The veg were delicious and we loved the presentation. Imy partner cleared the delicious looking plate of profiteroles (i was way too full) and had a lovely expresso. I considered it to be the best French food I have had in the city and will return very soon for a midweek experience. Thanks for making our date a wonderful experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was really excited to try this pizza after hearing all the hype but I must say it was rather disappointing. The artichoke pizza is HUGE, which I guess its a good thing since it's like 4.50 a slice, but other than it's size this pizza is not worth the hype. The crust is surprisingly thick, not new york style at all and bready, both qualities which i'm not fond of in a pizza. It has waaaay too much cheese, but the artichoke flavor was OK. If I was just reviewing the artichoke pizza then the place would have gotten a 2 star or maybe 1, buuuut I also tried the sicilian slice and it was very good. My distaste for bready pizza didn''t prevent me totally liking this pizza! SO GOOD! its really crispy, the slice is not soaked in cheese, and the sauce is OK. I didn't try the Margherita slice, but It looked much better than the artichoke one, since the crust appeared thinner and it was less cheese so maybe I will give that a try.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We decided to check out Batali and Bastianich's new endeavor. Came in on a weekend around 7 or 8PM and the place was PACKED. We walked around to see where to dine at and the needless to say, the place is as confusing as other Yelpers have written about. Other than the small markets to buy fresh food, there are a bunch of eateries to dine at but I felt like I needed an instruction booklet on how to get a table and order. After circling La Piazza di Eataly for atleast 5 minutes (and looking confused), we asked an employee (didn't even know if he was working that area) how to order and all that stuff. A spot finally opened up at one of the tables (we found out it's first come, first serve) and we were given menus. Here's what was ordered: -grande piatto misto salumi e formaggi ($22): an assortment of the best cheeses and meats of Eatly. I didn't know what I was eating, but it sure tasted darn good! -bocconcini ($11): freshly-made mozzarella with 2 slices of meat and beans? -glass of Brandini Nebbiolo '06 ($15): not too strong or heavy and smooth The food was excellent. We also received a plate that had slices of almonds in honey, figs and sweetened slices of orange peel. You receive slices of bread (you can ask for more) and you eat the meat, cheese, and other accompaniments however you please. There was definitely enough food for the two of us and service, although busy, was attentive. I thought the food at this spot was delicious.

"C'est magnifique! I will join my fellow fans of Chef Amir in offering other French phrases to exclaim joy for the existence of this delicious food truck. I always, always get the cous cous.  It is homey and delicious with just the right balance of well seasoned meat and accoutrements (usually butternut squash, zucchini, carrots and chickpeas).  And the Casablanca sauce is a must add. I love the lemon chicken, although the tilapia is a nice light alternative. The chicken cigars are very tasty, but being deep fried, a decadent treat I only will have once in a blue moon. The service is friendly and Chef Amir is always there with a smile.  And they have a frequent flier card where you get a free cous cous or rice plate when you buy 10.  Can't beat that!   Come see them on a corner near you.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came here because my friend Mel was having her bday celebration here. Everyone has been here before but this was my first time. I was super excited because i've only heard good things about this place. We got the chef's platter and GOD Damn i thought Eh.. this isn't going to be enough. WRONG it was ENOUGH. The best thing that came out was the Pork Belly. But everything was amazing. We had Duck, Tongue (which i wasn't a fan of but it's because i don't like gamey tasting foods), Sweetbreads (i was really surprised that i liked.. they tasted very similar to McDonalds chicken nuggets... odd), watermelon gazpacho, berry salad and a ton of desserts. But the best dessert was obviously the bacon donuts. They were amazing. I also tried this unfiltered beer that was ridiculous. Went well with everything we ate. So if you have to pick a spot to eat in Williamsburg this is it!! You don't want to miss any of the food that comes out of that kitchen.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Huge portions, and decently good food. We went for breakfast and I ordered the banana pancakes and tofu scramble. The pancakes were a little too rich for breakfast even though they were very good, and the tofu scramble was too mushy and floppy which is disappointing because it tasted okay. Another lady in my party really enjoyed the granola, and another said the burrito was good but he barely finished it in two sittings because it was so huge and rich (although big portions aren't really a problem!) Our waitress was pretty awful. When we went to pay, she made it very clear that our asking to split the bill was a huge inconvenience for her, and rather than taking the tip from our change like we asked, she told us to ""figure it out"" ourselves, and then proceeded to give back the wrong change. Maybe she was new but she must have been poorly trained and horrible at math to get that frustrated. The music selection was great and I would probably go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My sisters thought the ropa vieja was a little too sweet but pair it with the rice and beans and you're good to go. Each entree came with two sides and the plantains were my favorite, and I don't normally like plantains. The yuca came out too oily and the flavor just didn't make it through to the middle. Otherwise I loved the food. The service was amazing, we couldn't have asked for a better, sweeter waiter.

"This place is so cute and is open air with all their windows open and wrap around out door seating. I was lucky enough to score an outdoor table on a gorgeous night that had a view of the Hudson river (ok maybe a glimpse). I went with a party of 4 and we selected the calamari and crostini, both were good. The calamari was a little chewy. For entrees we had spinach gnocchi (which was the best meal of the table), meatballs, tagliatelle, and tilpia. The tilpia was my least favorite b/c it was dry. I still give this place four stars because service was great, wine selection was nice, and you can't beat an outdoor table on a gorgeous night. I would go back but try pasta instead of  fish.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We stumbled upon Market Table after our original brunch plans were thwarted by large crowds and a lack of tables at our first destination. Overall, the experience was definitely well above average, though not perfect. Market Table was busy for a weekend mid-day, but not too noisy or overwhelming. The ambiance was quaint and rustic, but tables were fairly close together and caused some inconvenience when being seated with large jackets and bags (I guess that's NYC in the winter time, though). I went for the Poached Eggs (buttermilk biscuit, grilled ham, & hollandaise.... errr perhaps they should call it Eggs Benedict?). The dish was, by far, the best eggs Benedict I have had in NYC, or anywhere for that matter! The biscuit rivaled the buttermilk biscuits at Cookshop (though Cookshop still has a better biscuit), the ham was great, the eggs were perfectly done, and the hollandaise was delectable! It came with a side salad, which was also very good. However, I was craving some OJ with my brunch and when it arrived I was surprised to see that it was literally only about the size of a shot. I know it was probably fresh squeezed, but that was a let down. As for the service, our waitress was efficient but not intrusive and we definitely enjoyed our brunch!","[1.0, 0.0]"

We ordered the arroz con pollo, which is made to order and takes about 45 mins to an hour, but was SO DELICIOUS, and even better the next day (even cold). There was enough for about 6 meals in that one order, so it was definitely worth the price. The staff was extremely friendly even if they weren't waiting on our specific table.

"I've never seen anyone famous here and it's still my favorite spot in NYC. I'm a celebrity/pop-culture freak so that says quite a lot. Upon entering, you feel immediately transported to a different place in time. It's almost like you've stepped onto the Titanic or something. I love the hustle and bustle, the crowds around the bar area, and the throngs of people silly enough not to make a reservation waiting outside. I love that you sit damn near shoulder to shoulder with the people next to you. How else would we have known to try the French Onion soup had the lady next to us not easily overheard our question and interjected to explain that it's not to be missed? This friendliness is just part of the vibe. The slow braised pork cheeks with soft polenta and gremolata were rich, tender pieces of meat on top of a giant serving of buttery polenta perfectly cut by the fresh carrots and celery in the gremolata. All three components created THE perfect bite. I dabbled in my friend's mac and cheese that was crusty on top and creamy once you dug in (my favorite way for mac and cheese to be cooked), and the French Onion Soup is just simply something we all should start every meal with. Even though I loved my dish, I spent the entire meal eyeing the steak frites it seemed like 90% of the restaurant was munching on and definitely plan on getting those next time. I was suffering from major order envy. Wine, bubbles, and cocktails are all super affordable. We had a nice bottle of Rosé for $50, and our server was extremely knowledgable in pointing us in the right direction with that choice. Thus leading to my favorite part of Balthazar, we were never rushed. The place was literally packed from the time we got there (circa 1:30) to about 4:30pm and our server only came by to refill our wine glasses, not push us to order dessert or pay the bill and get the eff out. When it comes down to it, my dream day in NYC would have to involve a long drawn-out, booze fueled meal at Balthazar. It's unforgettable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"4.5 stars Chef Michael White made his mark on the NYC dining scene because of his ability to make stupendous pasta. Since I couldn't afford to dine at Marea on this trip, I made sure to visit his more affordable location in Soho. Everybody and their mama was right about recommending Osteria Morini.  By that I mean, Rene C, Amanda B, NYC Mag list, Chowhound and....you get the picture. The roasted porchetta was calling my name, but I wanted the pasta so bad. The Garganelli with its pasta quills is superbly coated with cream and truffle butter. Basically, fat and fat on delicious carbs! Prosciutto, peas and radicchio round out this beautiful concierto in my mouth. My friend's Tagliarini is essentially a saffron scented pasta dish with generous servings of mussels and shrimp in a nice tangy tomato sauce. We also ordered the specials of the night: the ""Mussetto alla Zingara"" which are lamb sweetbreads, calf brains in a lemon butter sauce. SERIOUSLY good!  While their tuna carpaccio with fried capers and creme fraiche is also a hit. I was a bit put off by having to wait an hour for my table even though I made a reservation (which you should make 3 weeks in advance!)  No matter, I was busy with a Violette cocktail in my hand and I don't normally order vodka drinks anymore, but this one had liquer de violette which was a great pairing with the orange juice and lemon lime cordial.  My initial gut reaction was, ""really, $15 for a cocktail?!"" but then not a lot of bars carry REAL liquer de violette, let alone an Italian restaurant. We hesitated on ordering two desserts since they were charging $11 each. But guess what? our server convinced us to order two! (great upsell here!) The torrone semifreddo had white chocolate, apricot, candied fennel, grapefruit segments and served with meyer lemon granita.  A busy list of ingredients but it all worked well: this dish was light as the spring air and of course, the granita was a great palate cleanser. Next up, the heavy hitter: Gianduja budino with its chocolate hazelnut custard, Lambrusco poached pears and stracciatella gelato. Boy, it was spoonful after spoonful of divine chocolate deliciousness. The meat-centric food of Emilia-Romagna is certainly highlighted at Osteria Morini. I'm not sure what constitutes an authentic osteria but this is a casual, lively space, with spellbinding food that's appropriately priced for Soho. There are a multitude of reasons why this is a packed house every night but there is one reason you should go: DAMN GOOD FOOD.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Bonnie's on Saturday night for a good-old burger and fries.   Some parts of the meal were excellent, others were so-so.  My cheeseburger was cooked medium with a nice char outside, but was still somehow dry.  Liberal application of ketchup and chipolte mayo fixed that, though.  The mayo is great, by the way.  Put it on everything! The fries were good.  Nice and crispy, not too salty, and you are served a good sized portion of them. The real standout of my meal was the cup of vegetarian chili that I got with my burger.  I am certainly no vegetarian, but their chili made me not care that there was no meat in it.  It was very, very good.  If I go back to Bonnie's, it would be for their chili. The service was sub-par.  I ordered bacon on my cheeseburger, but that never happened.  I don't know if the waited heard me or not (the place is small and loud on a Saturday night), or if it was just missed by the cook.  It seemed that we were a bother to the waiter upon entering the restaurant, which helped add to the feeling of being rushed. If you go, do NOT sit in the small table near the bar.  Everybody needs to pass by you on the way to either end of the restaurant, and I was bumped into about a half-dozen times while I was there, not to mention bumping into other people while trying to leave. Good: Chipotle mayo & vegetarian chili Bad: Cramped quarters, poor service","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Some friends and I went here for dinner last weekend, and had such a mediocre, overpriced experience I felt I had to write a (rare for me) yelp review.  I'm giving two stars instead of only one just because our cocktails were very good. We went to the pines feeling excited, ready to have a nice dinner, based on what we'd read online about the place. We were sadly disappointed. The charcuterie we ordered came with two tiny pieces of bread, a joke for the four people we had at the table, it would have been enough bread for a fifth of the meat on the plate. The duck leg we ordered was five bites, not even a half of an actual duck leg, just peices strewn around the plate. Very small portions, and even though we expected that, and ordered six plates for the four of us, we were all hungry, and upset about the money and time we invested in the dinner when we left. Nothing we ate was especially good, our dishes varied from 'not bad' to 'actively gross'.  Not recommended at all.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This was our 3rd time at Public in about a year and the place just seems to get better and better.  To start, the space is just about perfect. Especially in winter, the place is amazingly warm and inviting with all the candles and oil lamps setting off the brick and wood. Also, unlike so many places in Manhattan, although space is at a premium you don't feel like you are being shoehorned in here - there is space to get in and out of your table and space on the table to eat without playing musical dishes. Although other reviewers have complained about the service, we have never found it wanting. The staff have invariably been cheerful, informed, and appropriately attentive. Most importantly, the food is different, flavorful, well presented, and good. Among the appetizers the grilled scallops, mushroom ceviche, and grilled Kobe beef tongue are out favorites. Interesting, but a little less our style was the grilled Kobe beef tongue. The mains have yet to disappoint us although we do have some favorites: the roast lamb sirloin, the New Zealand venison loin, beet gnudi, and the pork belly and tenderloin. Then there are the desserts, which just seem to be getting better every time we go - combining strong, interesting flavors with artistic platings. Unfortunately, with fresh figs out of the market, the fig bar that we have so enjoyed if off the menu, but it has been replaced a spiced apple cobbler that is served with caramelized popcorn and the most amazing cranberry-rosemary sorbet. Speaking of the sorbets, although this is maybe not the best time of year their sorbet sampler, everything on it is so good that it is hard to pass up.  Also, having just suffered through some amazingly boring cheese platters, I can hardly recommend the one at Public too strongly. My only complaint from all our visits is that the decaf espresso is weaker than dish water. When I asked our server, I was told that this is a problem that they have with the decaf. With everything else done to such a high standard, this seems like a problem that should be fixed. Public may not be the trendiest or fanciest restaurant in town, but, day in and day out there are few that consistently do better.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Decor is totally cute- half George Washington/old school Americana, and overall typical West Village, quasi hipster-trendy spot.  Service is really prompt, polite and nice (they were great with waters and coffee refills).  The coffee is great and strong (large grounds in there), and it looked like my friend enjoyed her freshly squeezed OJ (large). We ordered the full bread basket to share which was a biscuit (best thing I had), zucchini bread (good but not the best I've had - kind of lacking in flavor?, blueberry muffin sort of thing and semi chocolate chip cookie/scone thing - the last two were the worst).  The basket came with butter (or was it devonshire cream?, butter/honey, and jam. Meh, ok to good). My friend enjoyed the farm egg scramble, which was softly scrambled eggs with goat cheese, mixed green salad, on toast. Came with a nice helping of really good cripsy breakfast potatoes.  I think this was better than my dish- I had the mushroom fritatta with a side salad. The salad was right atop of the fritatta and the vinaigrette made it SO vineggar-y and tart. Not a fan. I enjoyed the ambiance but I don't think I will come back for the food.

"I went to the Hourglass Tavern on April 16 with three friends.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our dinners.  We all went for the prix fix pre-theatre option.  Two of us got the chicken, one the pasta primavera and I got the home made ravioli.  The salad, and especially the dressing, was delicious.  Our waitress was really sweet also.  Would definately go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is horrible!  It doesn't even deserve the one star given for reviewing.  Where do I start...I thought it would be cool to bring my dad here for brunch since it was in the neighborhood.  It just went down hill the moment we set our foot in the door.  First, the service was slow, there was one waiter for the whole place on a Sunday afternoon.  When the food did arrived it was good, unknowingly to find out later after we left we BOTH ended up darting home with food poisoning.  We both ordered two different dishes!!!  Lastly, when the check arrived, we were charged 20% for tax!  I am not sure if this is legal and I questioned it...not only was I given a nasty look for asking, the lady said that is the tax.  I did pay the full total including the questionable 20% tax and still provided a tip because whatever the case the waiter did serve us.  I know definitely that I would not find myself in this place ever again!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"new favorite brunch place in nyc. ann and i went this morning and had a ridiculously delicious beginning to our sunday. i started with a glass of fresh squeezed oj and she had the coffee. the portions here are not that large (but by no means meager), so it was a good thing we ordered 3 entrees between the 2 of us. i had the spicy duck burger with a side of indian smoked bacon while she went with the calamari salad, and we split the blueberry and buckwheat pancakes. the duck burger here is amazing, distinct brunch fare that tastes nothing like the omelettes/benedicts that I have grown weary of eating. it came with the usual burger fixings of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, but also came with two slices of avocado. i added a few slices of the bacon (perfectly crispy and with just the right amount of fat) and the burger was complete. the calamari salad was surprisingly tasty, and the pancakes were just the right texture of pan cooked on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. when we had finished our entrees, we were prepared to head out full and happy, but one look at the dessert menu and we knew that we could not leave without sampling one of the desserts. we went with the waiter's suggestion of the banana hazelnut tart with milk jam and molasses ice cream. amazing. definitely looking forward to coming here for dinner sometime in the (near) future.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food taste like mom's, if she was Cuban and could cook. My first two times here: 1st) I saw the empanadas through the window while I was arguing with my girlfriend on the phone and started drooling. 2nd) When I needed to pee,(this is a common theme) and I thought I could sneak a whiz while it was crazy busy. The smell was too good to not sit and eat. The empandas. My auntie made the BEST empanadas i've EVER eatten. STILL. However, these are pretty damn good. I've had the fish, the chicken and the spinach in ricotta cheese. The last one is bombdotcom. Get the green sauce for the chicken. It's crack. Infact, ask for extra green sauce for home. That shit is good on everything. The salmon. HUGE cut. Is it wild caught ? No. Does every single bite melt in your mouth? Hell to the yeah. They bake it in some kind of orange-y(color) sauce that's crazy flavorful. Ask for an extra scoop of it so you can pour it over your rice and your body, cuz it's THAT good! Trust. The side that I have gotten is the same: yellow rice, black beans, sweet plantains. The amount of rice, beans and plantains is a meal on it's own. If you are hungry and is a fat kid eater, the specials with the rice and two sides is gonna be perfect. If you are a runway model like eater, you will have enough for leftovers later...

"Let me start out by saying this is 5 star food for me. Simply the freshest produce and fish and just amazing classic, clean flavors. I'm addicted to the crudite plate and the peeky toe crab toast, but to speak honestly every dish I've had there has been great to amazing. Only been twice, but was really wowed by the food. Place loses a star for having the cheesiest clientele ever. I know it's not the restaurants fault, but it makes going there pretty annoying. It's filled with a combination of ""skank in the city"" types, and loud financial dudes. The decor seems severely dated and reeks of a late 90s shabby chic mess. If you can somehow see beyond the loud, platic-like blow our haired ladies and the men that love them, you will have a great meal, but because the place is new and popular you'll have to wait with all these annoying people and it can severely detract from the experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Food: Went for brunch. This was my first time at Locanda Verde and the second time for my sister and bro-in-law.  Menu was nice, if pricey, but I wanted conventional breakfast fare.  I asked the waiter  whether he preferred the waffle, the pancakes, or the french toast (all dressed up versions of each).  He cautioned ""not the french toast.""  OK, pancakes it was.  My plate of ricotta pancakes topped with fresh blueberries and lemon curd looked like something from a magazine,  but each pancake was basically a sealed envelope of raw batter.  ""Waiter, they seem a little undercooked""  ""Oh no, they are supposed to be like that, they have ricotta."" (completely indiscernible to the taste).   An hour later, I'm feeling sick to my stomach.  I can only imagine the gooey mess of raw egg that the french toast must be.  My sister's frittata was ""uninspired"" and my and my bro-in-law's uovo modena (poached eggs with hollendaise sauce) and pork hash was tasty but ""nothing special and pretty hard to screw up.""  The tab for the three of us with coffee but no alcohol was $75 before tip.  The fam, who as I mention had eaten there before say two times was enough, this place is not worth returning to, no matter what hype or PR DeNiro has bought for it. Service:  Hostess was a class-A bitch who gave us the once over at 10am and then tried to seat us us next to the silverware station in the back, despite the fact the place was nearly empty (and was still nearly empty when we left an hour later).  (We looked fine, we are all 30somethings in  in finance for chrisakes -- sister lives in Tribeca, I live UWS). Prior to seating us she, in front of us, bawled out the  'assistant hostess' who actually performs the act of seating guests for not following her instructions in seating the prior party (apparently this prior party also balked when they were thrown in the back corner and the assistant hostess seated them elsewhere without first receiving permission from her royal bitchiness.)  Our waiter was nice but I should have known when he steered me away from the french toast that he was in on the hustle and that we would have been better off just about anywhere else.   Conclusion: go elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"At first, I was a little shocked when I saw the yelp rating for this. After coming here for a night out with friends, I had expected the rating to be much higher! On a Saturday night, there was a decent amount of people grabbing drinks with friends, eating some bratwursts, and playing some jenga. Yes, Jenga. This place has a few board games people can play while eating and drinking - one of the best combos ever. The restaurant was dim litted with a rustic feel but had an upbeat vibe from the music heavily blasting in the background. You order at the bar - food & drinks; then you'll pick up your food at the pick up station. The only thing I have to say is that they need to have a better system when it comes to pick up. They should have a number system - when an order is ready yell out ""Order 157"" instead of just laying out the food in trays and having customers confused which order is theirs. The best part is the belgian french fries with the different dipping sauces. lets just say at the end of the night I had 3 orders of french fries and 4 dipping sauces (curry, chipotle, jalapeno, and the house sauce ....favorites in that order!) Definitely try these sauces, they are amazing! There is a wide variety of beers - draft and bottled - for the tastes of men and women! I myself had 4 german beers.

"I was extremely disappointed with Maialino.:(. Sorry to say because I went to dinner very excited to try this well-reviewed restaurant.  The one really good thing was the service, our waiter was an absolute pleasure!!  The bread on the table was fine, nothing special at all.  The prosciutto and melon appetizer was mediocre at best.  The melon I had bought at Whole Foods that afternoon was much more ripe and tasty.  The pasta arrabiata was only okay.  I was so disappointed by this point in the meal.  The pasta was undercooked....I'm 100% Italian, so I know al dente....this was not al dente, it was not cooked!!!  The sauce was average.  The only redeeming thing about the food was the olive oil cake for dessert.  I own my own custom dessert business, so I am typically very critical of dessert and although this wasn't amazing, it was quite delicious and a fairly good size.  All in all, I say if you want to try a Danny Meyer restaurant, head to the Shake Shack.....it beats Maialino any day.  (I'm not being sarcastic)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I feel bad for giving a three because I rarely give 3s. But anywho on to my review. The restaurant: very beautiful space. A bit cramped but beautiful the ambiance and lighting is wonderful. The old school glasses they use for the water so beautiful. The bathroom is beautiful. So the setting gets a 5 for me. The downside: the food. From all the reviews I read, I figure maybe I came here on an off day. I am a lover of mexican food ( no tex-mex yuck lol) So the tacos are decently priced. Average price for tacos anywhere in the city. However, they lacked something : the taste was way off. I compare my mexican food to the mexican food i eat off the mexican carts in the city or at my new fav restaurant in east harlem. These tacos were so bland. The quesadilla - I liked the presentation because it didn't look like the quesadillas that im use to seeing. However, the taste of these quesadillas were good but still lacking something in its savoriness of it in regards to the meat. The drinks: Only had a sangria and it was delicios. I really loved the fact that the sangria was on tap. I thought that was so DOPE! So maybe next time when I come to Chavelas I will have an entree and see if my opinion changes regarding the taste of the food which wasn't up to my standards. I did hear that others who went to chavelas before they moved saying that the food was much better at the old place than the new place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Lovely restaurant!   I came here for an early lunch with my family before seeing a Broadway show and it was absolutely excellent!  First of all, I loved that it is located in what I'm assuming is a former row house.  Made for a nice atmosphere.   We had reservations and were seated right away--which I recommend you make since it filled up mighty quickly!  Our waiter had an Italian accent which was fun and we had no complaints about the service. I had the stuffed peppers and also sampled some of my sister's pasta.  All were excellent and really shows what true Italian food should be--unlike all of the chain restaurants that claim they serve Italian food.  Their pasta lunch special is an amazing deal: you get 3 types of pasta for less than $20 I believe. And even though I was happily full from my entree, I managed to eat my entire piece of chocolate mousse cake.  It was incredibly creamy and not overly sweet.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I runne to death, and death meets me as fast, And all my pleasures are like yesterday. One of the first pleasures that would spring to mind would be this meal. There exists a sort of breathlessness with which seasonality is described in Brooklyn. Trout are labeled as 'freshly killed,' distances of supplying farms are listed in feet from the kitchen, and one imagines that at the current pace, we aren't far from a future in which our produce is embedded with stopwatches, depressed as it is picked and depressed once more when it reaches the pan. Battersby encapsulates all that this affectation strives towards but commoditizes none of it. No bearded salesman flashes a Wall Street grin while ""taking you on a tour"" of the provenance of the heirloom tomatoes comprising the namesake salad. You are told what you are presented with, nothing more. You know all the details as soon as you begin to eat. The burrata quivers under your fork, a basil leaf coasts down the now broken surface, halting only on reaching the pool of olive oil and juice from the tomato. The sourdough croutons remain remarkably rigid, the final element in a perfect composition. One attempted in so many places that you - for the life of you - could never recall while eating the masterstroke in front of you. Battersby is one of a mere handful of restaurants in which I heard none of the trite, grating comparisons of one dish to another that so dominates faux-friendship small talk. While it has become somewhat de rigeur to name drop signature dishes, Battersby forces you to forget what you have eaten, and forces you to contemplate what you are eating. Not out of confusion, though there is an unnerving state of shock afforded by the best plates sent from the kitchen. Shock which stems from the inevitably unanswered wondering as to how such ostensibly simple yet marvelous food has not been replicated elsewhere. The peaks reached are a testament to the ability of the chef and the efficiency of the humblingly tiny kitchen. The offered eggplant and cucumber are two such examples; the former based around a Japanese variety known for the difficulty in emphasizing its natural earthy sweetness achieved only through deceptively exact cooking, the latter a showcase of the range of textural and vinegary nuances of pickling and marinating. Both were stunning. Lu and I came at the end of August, the closet thing to a culinary golden hour. The final summer harvests end in earnest, and the first fall growths are shipped off for a culinary easing of sorts into the relative bounty of autumn. Though the serving of both tomatoes and eggplants to bookend a dish based on preservation (the cucumbers) made this evident, it was most firmly driven home by the dishes involving protein. Having partaken in the 7 course option, I was hoping to be served a pasta course (as it is often served as one of the courses) as I'd heard them to be extraordinarily well done. Upon my first bite of the chanterelle mushrooms flecked with smoked bacon laced under the trembling sheen of a hen egg, I promptly forgot any and all pinings for the duck pappardelle. I did not, however, forget the equally pervasive praise laid upon Battersby's fish dishes. It would be impossible to when brought a pan-fried red snapper, piquantly seasoned and meriting every ounce of its zucchini and bok choy purée, the vibrant, cool, minty and yet slightly bitter substance acting the perfect compliment to the spicy, firm fleshed fish, its skin crackling under cutlery strokes. Our final protein, the lamb, was the only misstep, and it was only perceptible in the face of the previously unbroken rhythm of greatness. The lamb itself was ever so slightly tougher than it should have been, and the accompanying chanterelle mushrooms and eggplant purée felt like toss-ins in light of their earlier excellence as principal players. Dessert at Battersby predictably merits high praise as well. Few places can render a humble rhubarb into something exciting. Fewer still would do so by pairing it with a pastry made from beets. The strawberry mousse is not the anchor holding these unlikely partners in the realm of dessert, but instead is the mast, binding all but useless without its sails. This is all to say little of the service, which is a fair sight better than many restaurants both neighboring and afar. The wait, long though it will be, is unequivocally worth it. If you are impatient, make a reservation for either of the tasting menus (5 or 7 courses) and prepare for glory.

"I saw this place on Martha Stewart this past year and decided to include it on our next visit to NY. It did not disappoint! I had the fried chicken dish which was accompanied not by your usual mashed potatoes and gravy but, rather, a spinach, pear and almond salad which was absolutely delicious. My husband had the burger with cheddar cheese, bacon and waffle chips which he loved as well. We also had the roasted brussels sprouts with bacon but thought these were a little under-cooked.

Ehh... that didn't bother me too much, but just warning some people who are extremely sensitive to waiters who like to rush patrons. (I find it to be a sign of authenticity for Asian food.) Now to the food! - Soup dumplings: This is my first time trying soup dumplings so I honestly have NO frame of reference for these delicious bombs of boiling fire. However, they were amazing. Gotta love the simplicity of soup broth inside a thin, delicate dumpling wrapper. It's like a reverse noodle soup. YUM. Seriously, that's all we ordered and were happy. Be careful when eating these things because they will seriously burn your tongue, lips, throat, etc. if you aren't careful. Then you would be too numb to enjoy it!

"Stupid Hipster Waiter: So would you like to look at the dessert menu? Us: Nah...we'll pass Stupid Hipster Waiter: Yeah, good idea - you guys have had a lot of food. Us: *blank stare* Did he just call us fat? Luckily for that waiter, it was true that we were stuffed stupid. Otherwise, I would have jumped up from the cramped backless picnic bench we shared with two other couples and stabbed the fool in his suspenders-covered heart with my steak knife. Did I also mention that this was Valentine's Day?  Day of love, indeed. We spent the better part of the day roaming around the MOMA's Tim Burton exhibit for hours while tripping on Little Silly Dots ...so, um yes, we were ravenous.  Hence, after a short wait for a table, we dined on: -1  1/2 dozen nicely shucked East and West coast oysters, - The insanely silky chicken liver mousse with garlicky baguette slices - 2 orders of perfectly charred steak with beets and chards on the side; - And several Wizards, as our cocktail of choice. However, knowing that your tips are dependant on the price point of your customers' orders AND your service skills, why would a waiter make a statement that could persuade us to stop ordering and/or offend us?  Though we had no intention of having dessert at M&S due to plans elsewhere in Chinatown, Stupid Hipster Waiter's comment left a bad taste in my mouth that I later had to wash out with more cocktails at Apotheke. M&S's only saving grace involves that chicken liver mousse, those fresh oysters and the huge and slightly toasted muffaleta we split at brunch during a later visit, sans Stupid Hipster Waiter. Not only was the place virtually empty on a non-Hallmark holiday Saturday afternoon, but we snagged one of the coveted semi-private booths with a high back, so we could properly support our gluttonous guts without getting dubbed as greedy AND the server kept her comments to herself; a win-win all around.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"SO RUDE!!! They say people in NYC are rude, but I've never felt that way, until I walked into Café Sabarsky. My friend and I ordered full breakfast, followed by their famous apple strudel. After we finished our food and drinks we kept sitting at the table, talking and catching up. We were served the bill without asking for it, which in itself is a common NYC custom, so I had no problem with it., but the waiter came back 4 times (!!!)  asking if we are ready to pay. We were sitting in the Cafe not more than 25 minutes when the Manager came up and told us that house rules were that you are not allowed to sit more than 20 minutes if you're not ordering more food... It was getting very unpleasant, and our conversation was interrupted too many times, so we payed and left. There was a small line at the door of people waiting for tables, but why kick out paying customers in favor of others? I didn't come for the food (its not that great) - I came to enjoy the atmosphere and have conversation. How rude to kick out paying customers! What comes to mind: Café Sabarsky is inside a German/Austrian museum and the manager's attitude did feel like he was inspired by the Nazi era. We will never set our foot in there again.","[0.0, 1.0]"
This was the best tasting pizza I had while in New York.  It's exactly what I pictured for a New York City Neighborhood Pizza Joint.  It's loved by locals and tourists.  The atmosphere is simple but cozy.  The tables are all crammed inside and the wait is usually long.  You share big tables with strangers but that is part of the appeal.   It's cool to see the Pizza Oven right behind the counter while they make your pie.  They won't let you take a picture of the oven for some reason.    Another fun part was walking the Brooklyn Bridge there and back.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was visiting friends in NYC and from tokyo. The friends just moved into this neighborhood and still exploring the area. Jack & Nellie's is about 5 to 10 min walk from the Forest hills station, 30 min train ride from downtown. Since arriving in NYC, I kept hearing about  'brunch' being the new  trend, that everyone does. So we did brunch. :) I would say Jack & Nellie's has that Sunday morning delight  quality. Lot's of energized buzzing people at its place, probably enjoying the long brunch and luxury of time you don't get to enjoy during weekdays. The menu was pretty homey style 'breakfast' menu, that can be found at any breakfast place. The sausage here was superb, egg perfectly light and soft as I like it. The one thing that made this brunch very special was the live jazz music played by a couple of  high school kids. They were pretty damn talented for sure, and a pleasant surprise to your lazy Sunday morning.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I ended up at The Smith when my original plan for nearby 13th Step was cancelled.  Friends were gathering for dinner and a drink so I joined in.  There is an old school kind of cafeteria or lunchroom vibe to the place and while it seemed spacious the people and tables were clustered together very tightly.  Not a lot of room for comfort.  I didn't like that right off the bat. Food wise I was hankering for a hamburger and they had one to offer.  Yes I said one.  It was there deluxe Smith or something along those lines.  Essentially a burger with cheese, the usual toppings of onion, tomato and lettuce with ""special sauce"" (probably thousand island).  It came with thin french fries and was served on a round, I think sourdough bun.  It was a very pricy $15 for this alone.   While they cooked it to my preference I was not happy with the taste of it.  Something didn't ring correct to my palate and after a few bites I was dissecting it.  One of my dining buddies said the first example of a sub-par burger is when you start taking it apart to eat pieces.  He might have been right.   The patty was not huge and certainly didn't warrant the $15 price tag.  I've had better burgers at both Smiths Bar uptown and Duke's over on 19th.  Add two pints of beer to the mix and I was out a nice chunk of change before tax and tip.   The young lady we dined with had Mac and Cheese and she was not crazy about it nor were the folks who had a pesto ravioli.  The shame of it was how everyone was excited for their dishes and was left for want.  Our server however was a charming young lady who was attentive and friendly.  This is clearly more of a trendy trap and one that will set you back more than you might want to spend for only a few things.  Glad I came to  try it but doubt I will return any time soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yes fellow Yelpers, it has arrived! A choice from Chipotle or Dos Toros. Well hands down Dos Toros is where you want to eat! Call me a Mexicanese because I love my rice and if the rice was made just like or close to moms real Mexican rice, con amor, then you can guarantee the rest of the food is made with the same love, otherwise its just rice with orange food coloring. Now to the tacos, here they do not have those taco bell hard shell basura or ""white boy"" tacos like at Chipotle. You are given a hefty portion of meat, unlike you guessed it, Chipotle which seems to be going through a meat recession since, oh they opened! One or two tacos is filling and they dont lack in flavor. Their guacamole isn't avocado paste, its worthy of being labeled Guacamole. The Pico de Gallo, well its ok but ask for it spicy and you have a winner! So the next time you put your Mexican hat on and want some fast good to eat tacos, skip the usual and go to Dos Toros, their tacos are good and that's No Bull!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I wondered why people would stand in a line for food in 36 degrees temperature.I read a few reviews and decided to join the line myself; buckled down with hands in pockets. While waiting we (the line) was served with fresh falafel as a taste of what is to come.  Having it for the second time ( first time from here) made me a falafel fan!!!  The guy taking the orders was jovial and the cashier made conversing easy. My total experience answered my question. I will stand in this line again even in temps below 36.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm not sure what happened to this place. I've been eating here since they opened, but things seemed to be sliding a bit. I love the apps. The main courses are really generously portioned. But they've cut back on the happy hour and seriously raised the beer prices. Why? But really, this is the reason for the one star review: If I'm going to go to a place that serves an almost $20 hamburger, is it too much to expect clean bathrooms? It's really gross to sit through the rest of dinner with urine on your shoes. They have rugs in the hallway outside the bathrooms--I imagine so you can wipe your feet after using the toilet. Disgusting. And, unfortunately, this has been my experience in my last three visits (I keep going back thinking they might just manage to clean the bathrooms). The last time I was there, the bathroom I used had no soap, which is troubling because I saw a member of the staff leave that bathroom and then serve people food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"YUMMO! Much like many others, I have not been untouched by the NYC Ramen craze. One evening while out in Brooklyn I decided to give Chuko a try. I ordered the wings, the pork buns and the Kimchi Ramen - which came with ground pork but I also added Pork Belly. I have to say I was quite impressed!! The buns were served with bahn-mi style accouterments and had a nice siracha mayo. absolutely delicious! The salt+pepper wings are potato starched before being fried and served only with a wedge of lime. They were plump and juicy and perfectly crispy. I think an order comes with 4 wings which is fine given their size and that by the last wing it was getting a little boring. If dining alone there again I'll probably double down on buns instead. Now the main course, the Kimchi Ramen. Absolutely delicious! The broth was rich yet, delicate. The ground pork flavorful, the fermented kimchi had the right amount of tangy kick. I also had to admire the perfection of the poached egg and the velvety texture it added when I broke it into the soup. The noodles were slightly thick, curly and perfectly al dente with the right amount of chew. Upon talking to the service staff, I confirmed that Chuko, like virtually every other major Ramen place in the city does in fact get their noodles from Sun Noodles. I've seen some comments where people seem to think this is some kind of fraud, but au contraire it is quite the opposite! Yet to try a noodle in the city that can hold a candle to Sun's. As I mentioned previously, I did add the pork belly to the Ramen and was a bit surprised. The Pork Belly in the bun was excellent, while in my Ramen it was a bit dry/overdone. I do believe they torch the Pork Belly that gets added to the Ramen (and I do not think it was torched for the bun) so maybe that explains it? It wasn't bad - it just wasn't as good and I thought that was interesting. All-in-all I could find myself making an excuse or two to head out to Brooklyn and making sure to stop by Chuko when I do. That's saying a lot considering I live on the UWS which is why I decided on a 5 stars vs 4!","[0.0, 1.0]"
Not a fan of lychee so I didn't come here for the martini special but they also had a special on Yuengling beer which I am a fan of so it worked out. The portions of the food are small but it is a tappas place after-all. If you plan on eating it as dinner it's probably best to order 2 things which is exactly what I did. What I ate: I had the chicken satay with rice and teriyaki shrimp skewers. Both were quite delicious. Even though the portions are small the prices are very reasonable. There was supposed to be a live DJ but at some point it looks like he just put a CD on and left. The music was a mash up of several different genres. The decor was quite nice. They definitely need more than one waitress and it would be nice if the hostess seated you rather than just saying you can sit anywhere you like because she wasn't very attentive and it took her a while to realize that you had recently arrived and were waiting for service. Once the place starting filling up she would stop by less and less and we were pounding our drinks down pretty fast so we started ordering two in advanced from that point so she could keep up with us.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was really disappointed to find the food just wasn't any good and that it was incredibly overpriced.  We had a panini and 2 pizzas.  The shrimp and garlic pizza was pretty bad.  It was very wet rendering the crust soggy and falling apart.  The garlic was not mixed into the pizza- basically they too what seemed like old and mushy pureed ( yes I know thats what pureed is) garlic in chunks and just plopped onto the pizza.  Terrible tasting for someone who loves garlic.    The panini was very un-panini like, just basically bread with some proscuitto jammed in there...not the nicely grilled/toasted flatbread you expect from a regular panini. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is the sausage pizza was edible.   Because I'm on a gluten free diet and don't live in NYC anymore, I'm open to going to just about any GF restaurant.  Sadly I was hoping this would be my main dining spot for my frequent biz  trips.  Unfortunately I won't be returning for mushy poor tasting food. For those who desire gluten free pizza- just pick up Glutino pizza crusts in the frozen section and make it yourself.  The trick is to brush olive oil on both sides of the crust and pre-bake if you prefer it crispy.  Then make sure you use mozarella that is not fresh - it will be too moist for the crust.  Go with something you can shred.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Being a fan of Marea since its opening, I was very eager to try the new Michael White's place. I knew that the experience would not be comparable, Osteria Morini being much more casual. I had a lovely evening but not a great one. The place is designed to look like an Italian osteria but it actually looks like an Italian restaurant at Disneyland. Way too artificial... But nobody goes to an Italian restaurant for the decor. Everyone goes there for the food... The food was comforting and delicious. Not very creative or inventive. Simply well executed and the perfect place to enjoy a great plate of pasta with friends. We started with a charcuterie plate, the croquettes and the skewers. Very nicely presented. We ordered every single type of pasta on the menu for our table and were not disapointed. They were all cooked to perfection and absolutely to die for. Nothing will never come close to the octopus and bone marrow fusilli at Marea but these paste were just great... The torta we had for dessert was disapointing. Service was very professional but not very friendly. It did not matter. We had a very nice evening and I will definitely be back. Just because this is one of the best pasta place in the city.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So, I was hearing a lot of buzz about newcomer to Williamsburg, The Gorbals. I also heard it was inside of an Urban Outfitters. My curiosity got the better of me, and I had to check it out for myself. To lessen any confusion on how to get to the restaurant itself, step one, look for Urban Outfitters. Step two, hook a right to the elevator once you enter and hit #3 floor. Alternatively, there are stairs right before the elevator, you can take those too. Hey, you made it! The restaurant is rustic and charming, and...yup, open kitchen. My heart. And, like I said, it's inside a store. Peek through the wall paneling and you can shop with your eyes. The menu encourages you to share dishes, and so, I did. But to start, I ordered The Son of a Gun (mezcal, tequila, pear puree, lime, almond syrup, mole bitters). This was a great drink. As many mezcal cocktails as I've had before, I hadn't had one with pear puree. Why the hell have I not had one before this? It was fantastic. You have a little hint of smokiness from the mezcal, a little citrus from the lime, and then to smooth and sweeten it out, but not too sweet, is the pear and almond syrup. Then, there were four dishes ordered to share. To start, I had the Broccoli (soy, chilies, vinegar). Perfection. The broccoli is charred, giving it a great, light, crispy texture on the florets. At the same time, it also acts as a little sponge, soaking up the soy and vinegar sauce, giving it an incredible flavor. After that, I had Grilled Shishitos (charred eggplant). The peppers were mild, and had a tiny bit of charring on the outside, giving it a nice, smoky flavor. But, the best part of the dish was actually the charred eggplant, which was a pureed sauce underneath the shishitos. It was a little sweet, a little smokey, and also savory. Basically, it was delicious. Next, was the Octopus (za'atar, olives, pine nuts). The octopus is is served as one piece, with a delicious tahini-like sauce on the plate, confected with pine nuts and topped with the fried olives. By the way, olives should always be fried. The octopus itself was amazing, it was plump, tender, and had a wonderful flavor, which was enhanced by the za'atar. Last of the dishes was the Black Bass (radish, watermelon, bonito butter). This dish was a dream. The bass was so light, delicate and flavorful. If this were offered as an entree sized portion, I would order this every time as my main meal. The radish and watermelon salad was a perfect compliment, adding some sweetness and crunch, but also topped with a yogurt dressing, adding an herby and creamy element to the dish. So, that was the last of the savory dishes, but since everything was so incredible, I had to go for one of their desserts. I had Sticky Toffee Pudding (black pepper ice cream, maldon salt). Unreal. This was so good, and perfectly portioned. The cake itself is light, warm, and coated and soaked with a rich, thick, toffee sauce, sprinkled with large granules of the salt, emulating a salted caramel. Topping the dessert is a black pepper ice cream, both sweet and a little spicy at the same time, which, to me, is a wonderful combination. Each component here went together so well, it was the perfect finish to the meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great food great atmosphere, (aside from the obviously drunk half naked hipster).  Thursday night at 9 and there was no wait but by 10 the place was full.  The size and price of their entrees are very reasonable.   The curry puffs were nice mostly beef very little potato filling.  I only wish it had more curry taste.  The accompanying relish looked more like a decoration than something you should be eating.  I would have preferred proper tasting relish rather than plate art.   Duckaholic entree was phenomenal.  Duck was cooked perfectly,  fat rendered, meat tender and bits crispy.  Served in a delicate basil sauce.  Most places will serve indiscernible pieces of meat with an overwhelming sauce, but not here!  The sauce was had depth, and was clearly basil but it worked to accent the duck rather than clobber it.  And for $15 you get almost half a bird, no mystery pieces here!           Massuman curry also showed a delicate hand.  All the flavors seemed to just work together with out being overwhelming.","[1.0, 0.0]"

In fact, my wife requested no chives or onion garnish and there were none when the food came out even though the dish -- shrimp and grits -- did have those garnishes. The back room was okay, but compared to the front it lacks the dark, char-house atmosphere. That's a small complaint, but I'd def. want to sit in the front part next time.

"I went to the Breakroom recently for the first time, and the last time. The place seems interesting at first, and admittedly the food is not bad. First thing my girlfriend and I we're put off by was the repeated use of the word nigger by the overly hip hop Asian staff. Second thing was our waiter forgot to put in our entire order, so it took us 45 minutes to get all our food. Lastly, when the last part of our order did come it was wrong. Our waiter asked us if we wanted that instead of offering to fix it. Three strikes. My advice: tone down the hip hop and work on the customer service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The bf suggested having dinner at Pio Pio after he recalled having a great meal at its UES location a few months ago. Encouraged, we headed down the street to the new restaurant that, though lacking a visible sign, is pretty impressively decorated. The restaurant is beautiful, if a bit dark: stone walls, wood paneling, and a sleek, long bar and a variety of seating (raised tables, booths, banquette) make it a really nice addition to the HK area. And though the decor makes Pio Pio seem perfect for a nice dinner, fancy dinner it is not. Pio Pio is famous for their chicken and I'll be honest when I say I ate most of the food with my hands. We ordered the Matador meal, which came with a whole Pio chicken, fries with chopped up hot dog, tostones, rice, beans, and an avocado salad. While everything was good, I won't say it was spectacular. Perhaps because turnover was so low (at 8pm on a Tuesday, Pio Pio was more or less empty), our chicken did not taste fresh and was more oily than moist. I did not see what separated this Peruvian chicken from your local supermarket rotisserie and might even prefer the latter. Portions are somewhat generous: though the bird is on the smaller scale, with all the sides, we were content with one piece a person (there were 4 quarters) and filled ourselves with all the small plates. The tostones and the avocado salad were yummy, and the rice and beans were flavorful. We ate until we were stuffed and took home leftovers. Portion wise, the price was good. The matador meal ($32) easily feeds 3, and there are two other cheaper combo meals on the menu. Entree prices average at $16, and a half-jarra of sangria cost $14. I glanced at the takeout menu and prices are slightly cheaper to go. There are other options besides the chicken that I did not try, such as cerviche and other seafood and meats. Service was attentive, in the polite/invisible way and I have no complaints. I enjoyed my meal but, for a $50 dinner, I would hesitate on returning. If one is in the mood for Peruvian food in a trendy setting, Pio Pio is a great choice. 3 stars for now, though I'm sure the rating will rise as it works out its opening jinks!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Dinner on Monday, July 25. We were seated immediately, and the ambience is very pleasant. For once you don't have to shout to be heard, the seats are comfortable and the table spacing is generous so that your conversation is not overheard. Service is well-meaning and largely efficient, but water glasses go unfilled, extra bread isn't offered (so we asked) and too many of the menu items require long, involved explanations that can leave you reeling about what you're actually ordering. I ordered a Bombay gimlet to start; this is a simple drink, nothing but Bombay gin and Rose's lime juice. Except here. They serve ""their version,"" which is very little gin and fresh lime juice over-sweetened with simple syrup. I don't mind a restaurant creating new cocktails and being inventive, but when you order a standard (Martini, Manhattan, Gimlet) how about getting the real thing instead of some bartender's creative take on it. And tell the customer what he's getting before putting in the order. $18. A simple salad with vinaigrette dressing runs $15. The ""Uovo"" appetizer is described perfectly by Jonathan H., below. Essentially, it is sweetbreads and lobster (not a lot of each) completely inundated by foam, sort of like fishing around in your kitchen sink after spiking the water with detergent. The tastes are fine, but the tactile sensation leaves something to be desired -- not the umami I think they were after. This app runs $23. Spaghetti with blue crab, lemon, bottarga, chiles: OK, but not memorable. Stay away if you don't like spicy food. Halibut: A small rectangle of fresh fish fillet, almost unseasoned, cooked almost too much so that it bordered on being dry, with a small melange of vegetables on the side as well as an even smaller portion of bland polenta. For $37 the halibut should be ethereal. Clearly, they haven't heard of sous-vide. We skipped desserts and coffee. The tab with tax and tip was just under $200. I can think of ten other restaurants with better food for the money, although not with surroundings this civilized.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm a pretty strict vegetarian (but, do eat dairy products) and therefore, it is baffling that I ever go to these restaurants.  Food was good, but just not worth the extravagant money that I had to throw in.  That's the thing about big groups... the alcohol and meats add up to it. Even though, the chef graciously accommodated my vegetarian needs and tried to send 5 different things... it just didn't cut it.  If I am going to spend 250USD on a night out w/ friends for some food and I thought everything was ""meh"" ...then I'll be very disgruntled... obviously.

"In many ways it pains me to write this review as I have dined at Almond  at least 20 times over the years. Unfortunately the continued deterioration of their food coupled with the absolutely abysmal dining experience last night leaves me no recourse. We arrived and were seated but an adjacent group of 6 were so loud we literally could not hear each other across the table. We asked to be relocated and were only given the option of a table on the other side of this group or outside. The hostess clearly saw our request as a bother; talk about blaming the victim. We relocated outside but I had no desire to sit outside with a jacket in order to eat. We were looking for another restaurant on-line and told the waiter we were leaving. Apparently he was able to find us a table towards the back. We were further annoyed to see several empty tables despite the hostess's contention that none were available. Capping things off was a dinner that was eminently mediocre. I've always loved this place for both the quality of the dining experience and professionalism and friendliness of the staff. Last nice it was closer to a raucous, drunken sorority party than a restaurant. Several other diners mentioned to us how terrible their evening had been due to this group. Management was clearly unable or unwilling to get control of the situation as it grew louder and more obnoxious throughout the evening.

"Oh Balthazar, I still think about your french onion soup.  I don't even remember what else I had but the soup was too good to be true.  It was almost like fondue.  I think I had fish.   We had a great time at Balthazar.  I took one star off because they put right next to waiter station and along a walkway so we were constantly getting bumped and they refused to move us to one of the many empty tables.  Anyway, the food and service definitely made up for it.  The major added bonus was the fact that Chef Eric Ripert was sitting at the table next to us.  We even managed to take a strategically placed picture with him in the background.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Disappointment after disappointment. We were seated very quickly and all seemed to go well and our server seemed nice and competent until we ordered drinks. Two sodas, that's all. She brought one, my other friend waited for a few minutes before I finally decided to flag down the waitress to remind her. We placed our food orders and it took a ridiculously long time to come out. They restaurant was only half full so we expected it to be out a little quicker. When it finally did come out, the flavor of everything was really good. My friends enjoyed the fish special and the mushroom and chicken pot pies a lot, I split the asparagus and gnocchi with my friend and we severely disappointed. The gnocchi were so tough that the delicious flavor didn't matter anymore, we only ate them because we were so hungry after waiting we figured ordering anything else wouldn't be worth it. The asparagus also had good flavor, but the crispy prosciutto seemed like an afterthought, we definitely expected a lot more that two tiny pieces, maybe they should specify on the menu that it's just a garnish and I wouldn't have been let down. We asked for the check and when we wanted to split the bill we were told that she can only split it on two cards, which is a lie and also was not mentioned on the menu or by her earlier. She said she would do us a favor and split it on three cards (which proved she lied about the limit) but two of my friends had to leave the restaurant to find an ATM machine and withdraw cash while accruing a transaction fee. It was an upsetting way to end a meal, she should have made an exception and made us feel special, that might have made up for the gnocchi and prosciutto. And maybe then we would consider returning someday, oh well.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had an appointment up the block and was early, so I stopped in here for a quick lunch.  It was really a pleasant experience! I opted to sit at a high top near the window in the bar area. The bartender was a very pleasant guy, he took my order and recommended a beer. I started with a Brooklyn-brewed beer (their lightest one) which was really good and then I ordered a small plate and salad from their menu. I had the stuffed piquillo peppers which were stuffed with pork and cheese and had a sherry sauce. I then had the arugula salad which was a perfect, light, lemon dressed salad. Great customer service too. I will be back again when in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Set my expectations too high. Words like ""Chopped finalist"" and ""Top Chef"" made me think this was much better than it was.  No discernible host station so I just stood in the doorway until a busboy found the hostess. My waitress seemed new-bad sign. A good restaurant will not hire someone without experience. Got my subpar bread when I was seated-another bad sign. Ordered some wine and an appetizer - stuffed figs. Figs were meh, too many conflicting flavors not complimentary. Ordered the bistro burger,  not my normal MO but words like bacon and house made pickles drew me in. After a bit too long of a wait for a slow Wednesday my burger arrived. Over cooked I ordered med-rare and got more like med-well. Again conflicting not complimentary flavors. Gouda cheese with bread and butter pickles?  Needless to say I left half of it on the plate. Decided to not waste my calories. Oh and The ""truffle fries"" tasted like McD with some oil.  Bummed I wasted a good dining experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

PROS: - You can say you ate at Grimaldi's. - In the summer, there is an ice cream stand close by.

"I ate dinner at the bar and had a fantastic time. Repeat: I ate dinner, at the bar, and had a fantastic time. Becco, unlike the other restaurants on 46th St. has two nondescript doors and no greeter, so I almost passed right by it. Awfully glad I didn't. I was seated at the bar for dinner since I lacked a reservation. The bartender was very attentive and incredibly knowledgeable not only about drinks but also about the dinner specials. I was very appreciative of the fact that she asked if I had a show to catch (I did, and the food came noticeably faster). The food itself was fantastic. I had a Pollo al Limone, which came with a very solid Caesar Salad. The chicken was incredibly tender, and the sauce was just the right amount of flavourful. I topped off my meal with a lemon shaved ice dessert, which was also fantastic. A delicious meal and fantastic service, price be damned. I'm definitely coming back, but next time, I'm going to get me a table.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I decided to try Taim after searching Yelp for a ""good"" falafel spot. Despite the positive reviews - I thought the food was horrible! I got the falafel platter: The Israeli salad and tabbouleh had absolutely NO flavor. The falafel (""Harissa"") was not crispy or crunchy on the outside, but rather was soggy. In addition, the people working the register were rude. I am so disappointed. There's a 100% chance I will not be returning.  If you're interested in this type of cuisine try Omar's (54th & 3rd).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I had to create a YELP account (after living and eating Williamsburg for 5 years) just to love on Beehive Oven in the public sphere.  My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful meal here at Happy Hour today (a Wednesday). We ordered: A. Jezebel Wings with Buttermilk Dressing appetizer They are three very big (jumbo) wings that are fried to perfection and covered with the yummiest sweet and hot Jezebel sauce (almost like a chutney)...unbelievably tasty! B. Fried Green Tomatoes with Remoulade appetizer: I wanted to have these and watermelon lemonade on a porch every afternoon for the rest of my life while watching a little bird come down the walk and writing songs on a banjo. C. 2 Deviled Eggs (appetizer) We said cheers, bumped them together and were off!  Like eating nice chocolates from a box, each a mini celebration. Rich and decadent! We had to ignore the fact that we did little to earn them that morning.. D. An Abita Pecan beer and a Capt. Kolsch beer (they're a Texan run establishment, and they gotchu covered on that Shiner Bock!) E. The Nettie Biscuit for me (Named after the owner's true-Texan grandmother.  She smiles from a farm somewhere in TX surrounded by chickens in black and white photo posted near the kitchen) and the motto is-- ""Nettie would be proud"".  The fried chicken and the biscuit are both heavenly. F. Shrimp and Grits with Fried Okra for him (a generous portion of shrimp and an almost gumbo-like sauce on top of the grits (bell pepper, onion) that was so flavorful and delish. I managed to take a bite before it vanished.. G. YOU MUST ORDER One Slice of Hummingbird Cake (homemade, total food science as far as being perfectly moist/balanced/creamy etc. and such a treat.) H. 2 Coffees :) 1. This cost us 45 dollars. In Williamsburg! 2. We obviously had a trigger-happy moment and ordered everything on the menu, but we ate every single bite of it all, except for a few okra which we took home with us.  It was just so good. The best thing about Beehive Oven though is not the food. It's the owners..if you have a chance to talk to the owners John and Trevva..they are so hospitable and warm you feel like you're in someone's country home.  If at this point you're thinking that I am not accustomed to thinking critically, you read my review correctly.  There was nothing to break down about the experience.  Just a great one! If they ever open up a bed and breakfast I am so there! That said, I promise not to Yelp so basically again unless it's really dire. Best, Noni","[0.0, 1.0]"

The atmosphere is raucous and evocative, and the service is on point. I haven't had much of a chance to explore the menu, but everything I've had in my visits here has been very delicious.

"I cannot believe this place is still getting good reviews.  I love Bar Jamon (how can you F-up wine and cheese) but Casa Mono needs a major overhaul.  It fails in food quality and service, which is flat out unacceptable in NYC, especially at the prices they are charging.   During the past two times I have visited Casa Mono, the food has either come out burnt or incomplete.  For example, when I asked the waiter whether the brussel sprouts should be charred black, he remarked, ""yes, this is the way the chef prefers to serve the dish.""  On what planet is burnt food considered gourmet?  On a second occasion, the gambas were served with 1 medium-sized shrimp and what I believed should have been 1 head-on shrimp, only the dish we were served had the head-on as a decorative piece with no shrimp attached.  Again, when I asked the waiter to confirm that the shrimp did not go missing, I was told that is the way the chef intended to serve the dish - with only 1 medium size shrimp.  I'm sorry, but for $16, you can at least include the entire head-on shrimp rather than just the shell for decoration.   As for the other dishes we tasted, the broth for the mussels was overpowering and the pork croquette was way too oily.  The only good part was of course the wine.  At least there is some quality control over the wine.   Bottom line, I will never return to Casa Mono.  I'm a huge fan of Batali's other restaurants but this one has seriously taken a dive.   Maybe he should stick to Italian.  I hope a real food critic re-reviews this place because maybe it will inspire some much needed improvements.   My advice for anyone reading this review..... visit Bar Jamon but avoid Casa Mono like the plague.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Charming little spot. We called ahead to make a reservation which worked out perfectly. Had the soup of the day which was delicious and had a bold tasting broth with very yummy fresh vegetables. That was perfect! The place was quite warm, though after having warm soup, I think I adjusted just fine. Also tasted both the chicken pot pie and the portabella mushroom pot pie. They were both appropriate size portions and were quite filling. The crusts (one whole wheat, one regular) were both flakey and very nice. The vegetables were fresh, the chicken was a blend of white and dark meat and the consistency was quite good. I enjoyed everything including a nice rich cup of coffee! Would like to go there again and try other options.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Food: 8.5/10 Service: 8/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Ippudo is no doubt one of the best ramen places in the city, but be wary of the inevitable long wait and high prices. If you can, stop by during lunch to put your name down for a same-day dinner reservation to minimize your wait. If you are willing to try your luck, the wait will usually be less than what they tell you, but be prepared to wait at least 30 min for lunch and an hour for dinner. You can also order appetizers at the bar while waiting - get the pork buns (but skip the mayo)!!! The ramen is delicious, but the portions are small for the high price. Desserts are outstanding, PLUS they now serve Lady M crepe cake, which is arguably the best cake in NYC. Try it, your life will be changed. In short, Ippudo isn't the best ramen I've ever had, but I must commend them for excelling in all areas - appetizers, main course, dessert. I would subtract half a star for the long waits and for the atmosphere being a little too hectic and loud.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Was intrigued by the idea of vegetarian sushi and have been meaning to try this place for a long time. Finally decided to get delivery tonight and am quite happy with my experience. I ordered the Verde Salad, black bean sweet potato brownie and carrot side salad (just to meet the $15 delivery minimum - which on seamless is actually $18 total min, kinda steep) I got a call less than 5 minutes later saying the black bean brownies were sold out, so I decided to get black sesame chia pudding instead. Happy with the promptness of the call and the employee on the other line was friendly and helpful. my order arrived within the delivery limit specified (a little over 30 minutes)   The salad and carrot side salad were both much bigger than I expected, so I saved half for another meal. The black sesame chia seed pudding is really tasty. overall, definitely a good option for when you want something fresh and healthy that won't weigh you down (which is necessary when trying to stay awake, studying for finals) I can see myself ordering from here again","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yes, the pizza is really good. I'm not gonna say it is the BEST pizza in Brooklyn, though. It is heavy, a little thicker than I like, very rich, and pretty much everything on the menu is meat and/or carbs. It's a once-in-a-while kind of place for me. There are other just as gourmet pizza places that won't make you gain 20 pounds in one sitting. I like how they have a backyard area with an outdoor bar so you can drink a beer while you wait. A lot of tables in this place are large picnic tables, so it's not unusual for them to seat a party of two together with a part of four at the same table. I generally don't mind this, except when the table wobbles like crazy and you have a bunch of drunk people next to you who don't care that they are giving you motion sickness. I came here for brunch once, and they had an awesome breakfast pizza. I don't remember all of the details, but it had eggs and lots of cheese on it -- perfect for my extremely hungover friend. That's all I can really say about this place. I know it's super popular and always packed, but I think it's ideal for those who love to overeat and still have relatively refined palates.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Cute rustic atmosphere, but kind of cramped and I'm just not a fan of dim lighting..and I've heard this is a new trend, but I just don't see the appeal in seeing inside the kitchen the whole time I'm there...especially when it's right next to my table. I just think it's ugly and should be behind closed doors. Whatever. Anyway, we were visiting with a relative we had not seen in many years, so we were certainly on the loud side this evening. Nothing terrible - your typical noisy socializing and laughter topped off with a bottle (or two) of wine. I think the wait staff hated us a little bit, but they were still very professional and kind. On to the most important part....THE FOOD. The menu wasn't as large as I hoped, but I went with the ricotta gnocchi and hoped for the best. I got the best, indeed. I wanted to eat that dish forever.

Sure pays to be nice and friendly and to smile a lot, because we were treated so well. But to be fair they treat everyone with a lot of hospitality, they will even cut your food for you and help you with your jacket, its so nice, very hospitable touch you dont get in a lot of places that are high end.

"I'm not sure I understand why this place often has a long line outside when there are so many great places in the area.  I've eaten there 3 times. First time was actually ok. They were not too busy and the crepes are nice. Second time I went for coffee. Horrible coffee and even more horrible service. This male server slammed down around 20 packs of sugar in front of me when I asked politely for some more after I had my coffee.  3rd time I went to meet 5 friends there. a couple of us had mussels first to share and then main course. I told the waitress I would like the mussels first and then my risotto dish. EVERYTHING then came out - about 50 minutes later by the way - everything EXCEPT my risotto. So 20 minutes later when we all were done with our food - I was not the only one having more than one thing - I got my risotto, after asking for it 2 times. First time I asked a waitress who pointed to someone else and said 'Talk to her'. Then when I got her attention she simply said 'Well you wanted me to bring it out AFTER the other stuff'', clearly trying to blame whatever went wrong on me. Apparently it was perfectly normal for her, that an entire table had finished their food, starters and mains, before 1 person then gets his. They had clearly forgotten about it and didn't even have the balls to admit that they made a mistake.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Other than that, though, Beyoglu doesn't miss a step.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I've never had a bad experience.  You're best off going with a group and getting a few meze's to share...my favorites are the filo with feta, the cacik, the barbunya and shepherd salad.   I have had dreams about the bread they serve....

"Went on a Friday night and ordered the special. It was special! Like very bad things are special. It was plastic chicken in curry sauce with recently unfrozen vegetables. That was it. That was the ballgame. The atmosphere was nice and the mussels were good, but the quality of this order was so far beneath the purported dignity of the restaurant that it undermined the whole thing. There's no way they could have shoveled that garbage and not known *exactly* what they were doing. I don't care if you suck. I care if you are dishonest about it. That food didn't belong in that restaurant, and the fact that it was attached to a price tag with a ""teen"" slapped on the end of it ought to keep someone up late at night. Don't let it be you! Sleep is important.","[0.0, 1.0]"
The food is really good hear but I enjoy going during the less busy times. It can be loud but the servers always seem to be on their game. I don't mind the more boisterous times but when I usually skulk in I am there for a quick snack at the bar and a well made cocktail. The not so bloody martini is a favorite. The main food draw is their absolutely stellar brussels sprouts. Everyone mentions them for a reason! And the phoenician fries are good too. After going at least once a week for the sprouts I decided I'd just have to learn to make the recipe for myself. If found this link online to the ilili brussels recipe and have made it twice. Works great! neurotickitchen.com/2012… I also enjoy their kebabs for a sit down meal and ordering a mezze sampling with a big group so I get to taste it all.

"After walking by their long lines time after time, I finally decided to see what all the rage is about. After an hour of waiting in the cold, I was finally seated at the bar. Warning: Totto Ramen is very small. I ordered the Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen and added a seasoned hard boiled egg. After ordering, I was in for a treat because I got a front row seat to the ramen-making show. There are 3 ingredients that dictate my rating: the noodles, broth, and char siu (meat). 1. The noodles were perfectly cooked to al dente. 2. The broth is SO delicious - by far my favorite part of the dish. It's savory, almost velvety-smooth, and perfectly seasoned (most tend to experience death by salt). I wish I could have ordered a bowl of broth on its own! 3. The char siu pork seems to be pre-cooked - they were laid out on a wire rack. Right before the meat takes its turn on the assembly line, it's seared with a mini blowtorch. The pork is good though I thought it was a little on the tough side. The seasoned egg lived up to its name - I couldn't pinpoint what the egg is seasoned with but it was darn good. And the runny yolk... you can't go wrong there. The added shredded pork, nori, and other toppings complemented the dish well and heightened the overall flavor. I thought the portion was perfect.

"Noodle Pudding always hits the spot! My favorite things to get:   - Tagliatelle Bolo Gnese: Great classic meat sauce.   - Lasagna Bolognese: Unbelievable flavors.   - Strozza Preti Alla Siciliana eggplant, tomato and ricotta : This type of eggplant flavor is something I have never experienced....DIVINE!   - Cesare Salad: LARGE, definitely can split this with someone if you are not eating it as your meal, BEWARE: Anchovies included (I tell them to keep 'em off my salad) Atmosphere: 5 stars. I couldn't ask for anything more. I see some people have been complaining about the noise, screw em. If you are used to a stuck up place which has thick tension the minute you walk in then this place is not for you. They open up the large windows in the front when it's nice outside and it's lit just perfect. Yes, there is noise, but it's people talking which makes the place more relaxed. This really is a local place, which has a lot of personality. Try it out, you won't be let down.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Cute arepa place. Very low key. The food comes out quickly. We came here on a Saturday eve. The place was full with very few empty tables. There is a nice looking bar and a restaurant with casual seating. The table cloths have vibrant colors with fruit on them. I like them although they make the place look more low key than it could be. We ordered a corn pancake, arepa and some yuca fries. The meal was not big but was filling. Note for the seafood arepa - the seafood is cold. If you like it warm, try another option. The portobello mushroom arepa is pretty good and the corn pancake is nice and sweet. There aren't that many filling gluten free options out there and this is a good one although a bit pricey for what it is... Demographic on a saturday night was couples, families with children and college age groups.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What does Katja mean? Well in my opinion it means DELICIOUS. This place has expanded over the years and now it takes up full 3 store wide with still no place to sit if you get there late.  How do they do it? Just order their sausage sampler and bite into the first big bite of the thick bacon and you will see. And take a sip into your stein size Bavarian beer. I like the wooden tables and brick walls. It's a simple setup with the bar in the middle. We were lucky enough to sit by the window and enjoy a simple guys night out. The seats are tight as that of any small restaurants in NYC but just don't pay attention to your neighbors conversation about being poor and not being able to pay the next month's bills and have to borrow money from his parents. After all, this is Lower East Side. Enjoy your next visit and make sure to talk to the owner about how you have missed this place; he'll make sure that you come back next time.

"Came here for lunch Food overall was pretty good Got the pretzel hot dog sandwich thing, some dumplings and the coffee w/ condensed milk. The best thing was probably the coffee. Cheburashka. Tasty!! It was sweet, with a great coffee aroma. Definitely would of loved just drinking this thing with a croissant or pastry. Sandwich was ok, good russian hot dog ""crunch"", nice condiments, overall very well put together. Nothinspecial though Dumplings.. were a little mediocre and overpriced. Cute presentation but overall the taste was just ""ok"". Im comparing them to asian dumplings because i've never had russian ones before. Overall a good unique place to try if you're in the area. However I felt things were a little bit too overpriced. The hotdog sandwich was 7 dollars for essentially a hot dog with special vegetables on top. THe dumplings were tiny and basicallly a dollar each. THe coffee was 5 bucks which I guess is comparable to starbucks (haha which says nothing) Overall I would return, but probably just for coffee and pastries. I like those overpriced, but sandwiches probably not so much.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Party Bowl: I love how the party bowl sushi pieces were circular as opposed to the usual rectangular shape. The challenge with the circular shape is that the sushi pieces had more rice than fish.

We didn't have to wait for a table, and we were immediately brought coffee and water. We ordered the pancakes (probably the best I've ever had -- I don't know what they put into these but they taste literally like pan CAKES -- served with berries and powdered sugar), the french toast (again, amazing), and the pancake and fried chicken dish -- which is a whopper of a meal - it comes with fried chicken, bacon, and a sunny side up egg, all layered in between the delicious pancakes mentioned above. My boyfriend's sister, who is tiny and usually doesn't finish anything on her plate, devoured the whole thing. The service was excellent, and the price was right!

"3.5 stars I've heard so many good things about ABC Kitchen, and read so often of its amazingness, that when I finally visited it was a bit of a disappointment... I came here with my family this past Christmas Eve. We ordered for 8 so tried most of the items on the menu: - Crab toast: not mind-blowing but quite delicious - Homemade ricotta, cranberry compost and bread: ricotta was good (comparable to Laconda Verde's ricotta app), but small proportion - Kasha and bowtie pasta: veal meatballs were good, recommended - Ricotta raviola: not memorable - Whole wheat pasta with ricotta, prosciutto and dates: meh - Black sea bass: recommended - wood-fired Maine lobster: one lobster cut in half, recommended - Fried organic chicken: recommended (brings to mind fried chicken schnitzel) - Pork confit (seasonal item): very rich - brussel sprouts: meh For desert, the fruit plate was a total letdown (super small) and the assorted doughnuts, which were really good. Overall - decent meal, but no way as good as people say. Most of the dishes weren't super memorable and I much prefer Gramercy Tavern two blocks away.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm not often moved by pizza, but I had to write a review for Saraghina's capicola pizza, a cured ham on mozarella and tomato basil that has come to be my pizza of choice in BK. The flavor of the meat infuses nice with the sauce, like a pick and roll between steve nash and amar'e for one of those dunks that jerk a spectator's limbs in joy (this of course before amar'e went to join the knicks thereby ensuring that their continued losses might be slightly more fun to watch). I had this pizza before Amar'e was making a fuss about a trade so I fear my memory has elevated how good it was beyond what it might currently be; given that, the meaty oily tomato basil bliss fills me with such fervor i'd support in a presidential race!, were it to become sentient and politically-minded. i loved it so much that when i took a good friend here and he reacted with less than militant-extremist level fervor i liked him a little bit less. the space is great, lots of rooms and benches and a beautiful garden. it's out of the way, and they don't let you bring your own liquor anymore, but if you can get there and the weather's nice it's quite lovely.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of my very favorite places in NYC. No, it's no secret, but every time I go it's a blast and the food is excellent. Freshest draft beer in the city--makes the beer vs. sake decision very difficult every time! I prefer to sit at the counter for quicker service and the ability to order a couple dishes at a time. (but hey, after an hour and a half's wait, I'll take a table too!) Daikon salad with dried baby sardines, fried chicken gizzards, pork belly skewers, chicken skin skewers, uni and sashimi specials!, grilled mackerel, ice cream with red bean pancake... dang, I want to go there right now! And it's far cheaper than a trip to Japan. If two of us go all-out and get every damn thing we want and drink to our livers' content, we're still only out around 100 bucks. The only cons I can think of: the wait can be ridiculously long, and they do often run out of menu items, causing me to cry inside.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend and I are on a quest for the best burger. We decided one stop should be the Corner Bistro in the western village. Written up many time as the best burger in NYC. Inside, the place was crowded (on a Wednesday night) but with a friendly environment, with multiple lines leading to the bar, restroom(s), and to be seated. It took roughly 20 minutes to get a table, but the waiter was extremely helpful and kept us updated the entire time. We ordered fires and on first bit we realized we were eating BACON (FRIES)! Yes, bacon. With bacon being a staple on many of their burgers, we can only guess that they add the leftover bacon grease to their fryer turning their standard thin cut frozen fries into something fantastic. A few minutes later, our 'Bistro Burger' finally arrived... a cheeseburger topped with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and (raw) onions. We promptly split it in half, each took a big bite, and practically in unison, each said that it was a good burger. Not amazing, not fantastic, or even great... it was just 'good.' For a place that's had numerous write ups as being the best burger in NYC, we were extremely disappointed. If you're in the area, it might be a fun place to visit (especially with $2.50 draft beer), but don't travel out of your way for their burger.

"Came here after reading a review from a Chinese food magazine and saw a picture of a bowl of sesame seeds.  This reminds me of the tonkatsu (fried breaded pork cutlet) I had in Kyoto/Osaka.  You need to crush the sesame seeds into fine powder in a bowl and mixed with their sauce to eat with your tonkatsu.   3 stars for tonkatsu ($15) as it was very meaty and thick  The taste of the meat and sauce were better in Japan. I also ordered the sashimi appetizer ($14) and it was a mistake.  It had three thin slices of three types of fish (tuna, salmon and a white fish).  The taste was so so - 2 stars               My husband ordered the dinner set ($17) which includes potato salad, cabbage salad with their special salad dressing, a couple of appetizers (fried tofu and preserved cabbage??), miso soup, one piece of shrimp katsu, crabcake katsu and pork katsu and a bowl of rice.  It also comes with a dessert dish with a slice of pumpkin pie and a small scoop of green tea ice cream.  Very good value and taste very good - 4 stars My daughter ordered the kid set ($9) which includes smaller portion of the dinner set (minus miso soup, pork katsu, green tea ice cream).  Also very good value and she loved it. - 4 stars We also ordered the following appetizer/dessert: - wasabi squid tentacles ($4) - very small dish and did not expect it is served raw, definitely will not order this again - fried soba noodle ($2) - hot and crunchy - black sesame pudding ($4) - cold, creamy, tasted good and served in a pretty ceramic pot with cover Bathroom is kept very clean.  All waiters are non-Japanese which did not provide an authentic feel.  The restaurant was pretty full on a rainy Sunday night.  A lot of customers ordered the curry dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This hole-in-the-wall is my favorite place to go to when I can't decide what or where I want to go eat. I have tried many dishes and noodle soups there but my favorites are Ho Hee Mei Mein, Char Kway Teow, Singapore Kari Laksa, and Hokkien Char Mee (KL style). The Hainese chicken is good, but sometimes I feel like they give you more bones than meat. The Roti Canai doesn't have a crispy outer layer so if you're looking for that, get it elsewhere like across broadway at Coco's. Dishes don't take long to come out and you can be in and out within 45mins or less if in a small group. Food is tasty and the prices are cheap... What more can you ask for?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I almost don't want to write this review. Why? Because I love this place so darn much and the thought of not being able to get a seat at the bar or the bartender forgetting my name, makes me shudder. Then again, the thought of it going out of business makes me weep, so here we go... It is the middle of December, the M train isn't running to Ridgewood and mounds of snow are still piled in the streets from the last big nor'easter. And it is my birthday. My 30th birthday to be precise. Despite the overwhelming odds, I held my party at Gottscheer Hall and those who came were rewarded with not only my best birthday ever, but one of the greatest nights out of their lives (I'm assuming). When we arrived, we were told that the chef wanted to go home so instead of leaving us to go hungry, we were given a tray of sausage and peppers and rolls on the house, more than enough for all of us to share. We then spent the night sharing a few dozen pitchers of good German beer, bought for well below Manhattan prices and taking advantage of their free jukebox, which filled the room with classic rock and polka music. Sometime near midnight, a friend sat at the baby grand in the back and an impromptu karaoke session began, creating a scene that would have made Chris Columbus jealous with its cliched cheesyness. I've been back many times since for dinner, which is always wholesome and never disappointing, and cheap weekday drinks. It is my go-to spot and should be yours, just save me a seat at the bar.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"everyone knows there's always going to be a wait for brunch.  we waited almost an hour for a table for 3.  in the midst of that i got in line for the to-go coffee line and that didn't move any faster. no coffee. blah blah time still goes by slowly and my homie checks some eye candy and we talk about motorcycles and last nights drunken episode.  fine. finally sat down and ordered immediately.... blah blah we talk about guns and memphis crime.  fine. how about it took over an hour for 2 orders of effing over-easy eggs, toast, burger, fries to get to our table. how about they don't know how to make over-easy eggs. how about offering your patient customers a round of beers at least. how about the only thing that came hot and yummy were the truffle fries. everything tasted mediocre because it was probably forgotten and overlooked/ overcooked. owner guy with crazy 70s polyester clothes and waiters, you are all nice but need to work harder if you want to charge me that much for brunch prices in brooklyn. oh yea and your bloody mary mix is shot.  tastes like watered down v8.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Read about this place a couple of times and finally made it on Saturday (19th). Called ahead for reservations about 6PM but was told that they didn't have anything until 915, which is always a good sign. Found out because the place is pretty small, but intimate. Was able to reserve two seats at the bar. Well were we in for a treat! Great menu, great variety and decent wine list as well. To preface, I have celiac's, lactose, fructose and sucrose intolerance and they catered to my every need. The place totes itself as certified gluten free and they back it up. Potato vodka option behind the bar, complimentary gluten free bread to dip in olive oil and diced fresh garlic. my girlfriend, who doesn't have any food allergies was given fresh french bread as well. Drinks were quick and delicious. Female bartender was fantastic all night. Before we ordered she asked if we had any allergies. Once i told her she made a note and immediately made the chef aware as we saw him peek out from the small kitchen. I had the gluten free penne with pesto (also dairy-free). My date had fresh ahi tuna with a sliced avocado salad. Both were delicious. For the entree I had the steak with sauteed broccoli rabe and mushrooms. Swapped out the butternut squash (sucrose) for potatoes, when it came out, she realized the potatoes she gave me had butter in them. Quickly, grabbed the dish, brought it in the back and within 3 minutes I had a fresh new plate ( I knew it was freshly made again because I had sliced the steak and the new dish had two new fresh pieces (of good size). My GF had black linguini with fresh shrimp in a tomato based sauced. They were both excellent. For dessert, just had a espresso that hit the spot and wasn't over steamed. Clincher was on the way out where the chef happened to be at the door and and said ""Goodnight Gino, have a good one"". My GF and I were thrown aback, looked at one another and smiled. Great experience. Would def go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Shake Shack is far superior to In n Out, Five Guys, Burger Joint, all of the above!  Had their Shack Burger and fries, and it was perfect.

"Several things here are excellent, a few are atrocious. Lets start off with the positive. First, use your eyes, and don't sit under a speaker. You will find the seating is very comfortable and the music is just right. It is my understanding the bartenders are the DJs and they make a great mix. They have definitely done their homework on Spotify.  The lighting is soothing and the overall color scheme is cozy and warm. The staff is excellent. Cocktail waitresses are attentive and are up for genuine conversation, not just flirtatious banter. The bartenders are professional, experienced, well-versed, and most importantly, fast. Unfortunately, it's rare in Astoria to come across a bartender that knows how to make a drink properly, so I appreciate them when I see one. Now, the negatives mostly stem from the fact that the clientele is a few years younger. I am in my early 30's and understand I just may be too old for Astoria. What I do not understand is the mid-20's Astoria brand of hipster, nor the bro-tank kids. Their conversations always tend to be at a volume that must be overheard by surrounding patrons. I personally find that if I wanted to talk to them, I would pull up a chair. They shouldn't be a part of my tables' conversation from 8 feet away. I think the obnoxious young men are the genesis of the noise issue that was brought up on some other reviews, as opposed to the music. The other negative is there are a lot of dudes. Seriously, bring women if you want to talk to any because they are in short supply. Overall, go for a late nightcap with your friends Mon-Wed and you will have a great time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is one of those places that really needs a pros and cons list because the things that made it so great were not related to the things that made it bad. Pros: - Although a bit garish, the clashing decorations of the lobby and the multi-colored main dining room was interesting and worked well with the festive, sangria-filled atmosphere - Cheese breads: I have no idea what these things are actually called, but they give you an unlimited supply of breads, one of which are the cheese breads that you often find in Brazilian restaurants. I think I ate like 15 of them while I was waiting for my food. The Strawberry butter that it comes with is also delicious - The 8 different types of sangria provide a large variety that you can always come back to and mix-and-match so that you never get tired of their drinks. The two that I tried (one red and one white) were both very delicious - The price (about $23 after tax and tip) is not bad for unlimited drinks and food Cons: - The first glass is this huge monstrosity that takes forever to finish, but the subsequent glasses are all about half that size. It feels like they are ""cheating"" you, know what I mean? - The burger that I ordered with my meal was very dry and tasteless. I think it goes at the top of my list for worst restaurant burger. Will never order it again. DO NOT ORDER. - It's difficult to call over a waiter. It felt like our waiter was avoiding our table. We spent 15 minutes trying to find our waiter to get refills on our sangria. We eventually asked someone else to grab our waiter for us, but either he forgot or ignored us because we flagged our guy down 5 minutes later. Overall it was a so-so experience. For the price, the unlimited sangria portion of the menu makes Calle Ocho still a pretty good brunch spot, even with its flaws. I strongly recommend setting a reservation because the place gets pretty crowded.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I miss this place...  I used to live across the street in Stuytown and being Filipino, it was the closest place I ever came to having home cooked meals like my mom used to make.  While living there, I used to stop by once a month, so I've just about have had everything on the menu and not once have been upset about what I ordered. Add on the fact the staff is very friendly (been quite a few times where the owner and myself would sit talking like we were old friends and even on occasion shared food.)  Out of all the Filipino places I tried in the area, hands down the best.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've lived in Bedstuy four years now and sadly it took me three years to find this hidden beauty. Dave's brisket house is the finest hole in the wall (and I say that with the upmost respect) I have ever stumbled upon. The gentlemen who work there are all top-notch, friendly dudes who try their best to be as accommodating as possible. Sometimes meats will run out (pastrami seems to be the most popular) and customers get rude and nasty. I've never seen the guys behind the counter give any attitude back (which amazes me). Anyway, on to the food - sublime. Medium pastrami on wheat with mayo and mustard is enough to feed my girlfriend and I every visit. Buy a can of Doctor Brown's rootbeer out of the well-stocked cooler, and you can't go wrong. The pastrami is our personal favorite followed by the corned beef. Surprisingly, the brisket is a little bland in comparison to the other selections, although it gets top billing. Anyway, if you're in the neighborhood and want a cheap, tasty meal, stop in at Dave's. On second thought, stay away, I don't want you eating all my pastrami.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Finally found that clean, crisp, fresh Greek restaurant with great polite  service, big portions, welcoming and casual but still fancy enough, atmosphere. They are very busy and always have people waiting for a table. But I think it's worth trying this place out! The Greek salad was just a normal huge Greek salad but i absolutely loved it. Probably because all the abundant ingredients were extremely famous. You know when a dish is made up of only a few things tossed in but every bite is fresh, it can be that great. :) The grilled octopus- definitely salted perfectly, aka lightly, and no painful jaw joints after eating this appetizer because it is so soft. There is absolutely no rubbery texture and it will fill you up. I was actually full after the salad and octopus, and we were not pairing our dinner with wine this night. We shared the special of the day entree, the red snapper. Man it was huge and we forced ourselves to eat all of it. The best part of this snapper was that it wasn't oily! I hate it when we order grilled fish and the fish comes out in its oil broth. You won't get this at Taverna Kyclades. The fish comes out split open in half, so it's easy to eat. You will have a few bones here and there but I got like four. Oh ok us, dessert is complimentary! Some kind if pudding which I'm not a big fan of but is devoured the whole thing. So good! When I'm hungry and need a refreshening crisp dinner, I'm coming here again! Next time I'm pairing it with wine :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A belated birthday dinner for me and a friend who had no understanding of what Japanese Ramen was. I'll sum it up, just as I did for him.   It's all about the pork belly, soup broth, and the delicious fresh al dente ramen noodles. Upon arrival the door was closed at 7 PM and we were told we'd have to wait til 8 PM.  We put our name on the clipboard and when the hostess came out, we asked why 8 PM?  We were told they ran out of their broth.  Boo!  I was about to cry, but alas she said to wait and we'd be served soon.  This wait turned most patrons away, which made our wait even shorter.  We only waited another 15mins and we finally got it.   Along with our order of Ramen, we also tried the Char Siu Mayo Don.  The lovely spread of pork belly on rice impressed my Ramen virgin friend.  It was delicious, albeit I could've used less of the mayo.  The pork was juicy & succulent and perfectly charred. Now to the ramen.  It was perfectly wavy ramen served al dente.  The miso broth is my favorite broth*.  The egg complimented everything and held it all together.  This is probably the first time I didn't question the portion sizing of the pork.  They're very generous with the pork!  My friend was surprisingly pleased with this new discovery.  In the past he'd only had Sapporo (yelp.com/biz/sapporo-new…) near work.  He had a ill-contrived idea in his head that all Ramen tasted like Sapporo. I wish this place was slightly closer to work.  I'd come for lunch at least once a week.  Service was a pleasure and the place is tiny but comfortable.  They even have a place for the winter bags & clothing articles.  There are metal shelves on the walls above the tables to put your stuff! *How come they don't have Miso broth hot pot?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sometimes being too authentic can hurt. Limiting your menu can be good, but when a place limits their menu without providing much variety, I end up deciding from items I merely tolerate vs. something I'm actually excited about. The soba selection made me feel the way I do when I hear a song with too many techno remixes that sound the same. The shumai were nicely done but the wasabi dip was too asian-fusion a la Tao for me. The chawanmushi was blatantly overpriced at $8.50 for a cup of steamed egg custard worth maybe about $0.45...and that's being generous. The fishcake soba had some great flavor to the soup base but otherwise I'm not itching for more.","[0.0, 1.0]"

You really can't go wrong here. Except the wait can be brutal. Side note- they go into a sort of tea time mode in the afternoon from 3-5 with a limited menu. its a great time to go sit with a few friends and have a cappuccino and a cheese board or light salad. all the tables are open, so you have the run of the place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"In a word...terrible. That was my experience here. anyone has eaten a lot of Lebanese/ Middle Eastern food would feel the same way. For whatever reason, Manhattan does not have a lot of option sin this category when it comes to a anything other than small ""stands"" around town where you can can fast food on the run. However, if you want a real sit down meal with ambiance, etc., there are not many options. Maybe that is why NY'ers have given this place such positive reviews. To begin with, the restaurant is incredibly noisy. It is diddicult to have a conversation even accross the table from someone. The lighting is difficult to read the menu by and the wait staff has no real idea what the food is about. One of their ""signature"" dishes was a brussel sprout concoction. It was sweet, the brussel sprouts not cooked well and had some cream sauce on them...not a very good combination. The portions were rediculously small and even though we had a lot of dishes between the four of us that dined there, I left totally unsatisfied. Do yourself a favor, if you want some good Middle Eastern food without the atnosphere, go to Taim Falaffel in the Village. The food is incredible, is of the same genre and you will feel a lot better about the money you have spent.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The burger was greasy and salty--medium rare is NOT the way to go--get it medium to well done (it ain't steak and doesn't hold up uncooked). The bacon was not crispy or consistently cooked within the burger. Worst burger of the month, which is saying a whole lot. Fries were delicious and salad was a salad, another star for some stability.

"I used to go to this place when I was a kid, before they moved. It was located in a tiny hole-in-the-wall near East Broadway under the train tracks, and the sandwiches were only a dollar and change. This was the place to go for Vietnamese sandwiches in Chinatown... and it still is. I remember when they first opened at their new location. It was so popular, it was insane! The sandwiches were huge, fresh, and delicious -- and they were only $2something. This place got so much business that they were often sold out. People would come pre-order sandwiches days in advance. Now, my co-workers and I order quite frequently for delivery to our office. The sandwiches are now $3.75, and have gotten a bit smaller, but are still very cheap considering the prices of the food around here (Noho). We usually get our sandwiches within 30-45 mins., and they are usually still hot. We usually give a nice tip for trudging up here (20-25%), but that still comes out to about $5 a sandwich. There was an instance where we thought they had blacklisted us because they refused to deliver, but it was just because their delivery guy (which may be the owner?) was out. Overall.. delicious sandwiches, cheaper than most, and probably the only place in Chinatown that delivers to Noho.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My husband and I have basically lived within spitting distance of this place for the last 2 years but for whatever reason, have never gone. We finally decided to check it out and were so excited.

My husband and I both ordered a panino & soup combo which was only $11. My husband had the focaccia rosmarino and said it was good. I had the baguette Parma which tasted better after I added balsamic vinagerette. It was a bit bland. My husband & I both had the artichoke & potato soup which was very bland.  The most disappointing point of our meal was when we got kicked out before we were even finished our drinks! I was asking my husband if he wanted some coffee or dessert when the waitress said we had to leave because they needed our table for someone else! The waitress (who was polite and accommodating) brought us a complimentary tiramisu (a dessert neither my husband or I care for) with our check as a peace offering for kicking us out and was very apologetic but the damage had already been done.  I'm sure this restaurant has great potential but our experience made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome :(","[1.0, 0.0]"

A chipped plate, butternut squash puree was thrown on leaving a mess, the vegetables were burnt and the scallops were hidden underneath.  Why were they covered with burnt vegetables?  I moved them aside to reveal the scallops that were seared only on one side and not even done properly.  They were overcooked but under seared.  $30?

We also got the fried chicken with corn and candied yams and they were good too. The candied yams had a strong gingery taste to me so i would avoid that if you dont like ginger.

I was expecting a casual dinner, not a $$$$ dinner.  Mistakes happen, so might as well make the most of it.   I ordered the French onion soup which was very flavorful.  A bit salty, but the broth was rich and full of taste.  The chicken liver and Foie gras pate was okay, a bit too heavy and plain. But now came the steak frites, and wow.... now this is the reason I would still have fond memories of this place even after seeing my credit card bill The steak was simple, charred on the outside, rare on the inside, but incredibly tender and juicy.  It makes me feel like I'm eating on an Anthony Bourdain show, where he proclaims how good the meat is that you only need a little salt and pepper for it.  It's THAT good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Not cheap (at 18 usd plus tax) but totally worth it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Crispy okra! Mark my words and order that with your cocktail. Like little potato chips, salty, mixed with fresh onion and a bit of cilantro, this is an innovation not to be missed. The Drunken Munkey is a one-room bistro with Indian mixology, great curries and more paraphernalia from the Raj than you can shake a cricket bat at, including cricket balls as doorknobs lol. A dozen tables plus another ten bar stools, you might pack 50 people into the Munkey but they better be good friends. Enough description, another fine app: paani puri, little crisp shells that are delightful little delivery devices for a bit of potato and a pool of tamarind sauce. One bite is both crunchy and hugely flavorful, yum. Eat them before they go soft! Yes, cocktails. Anastasia declined to make the complicated Indian drinks so we went with classic gin & tonics instead. Prolly the finest G&T I've ever had, served in a cut-glass tumbler with a lemon twist and a silver spoon-straw cocktail thingy, excellent. But $14. Ouch. Happy hour is buy 2, get 2 free so bring a friend! Entrees are Anglo-Indian curries, choose from lamb fish or chicken. Every plate (as so many have noted) comes with rice, naan, raita and an adorable tiny pitcher of dal on the side. All had a bit of heat but dumbed down, none were even American medium spice. Vegetarian rating: 3 stars, surprisingly few veg options, yet altogether typical for Anglo-Indian fare where meat and vegetables were often mixed together. Nothing on tap. Very easy to run up a big bar tab here. Don't say I didn't warn you! For a sweet ending we sampled the carrot halvah and the rum ball. Both excellent but I give the edge to the carrot concoction, worth the sugar.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Went there on a Saturday evening.  Great food!  The Pad See Ew was really good.  But by far the best thing there was the ribs!  The dipping sauce went really well with the ribs. The ribs were a must have!  The calamari was pretty good too.  The only negatives were that it was pretty loud and we did have to wait about 45 min - 1 hr to be seated.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is great. The Wontons are delicious, the shu mai, the beef stew over noodles (I like Shanghai style noodles) and the clay pot casserole dishes are all really really good. Service is normal for Chinatown and there are some waiters who don't speak English, but they know how to wear a Hawaiian shirt, believe it. But you don't go to Chinese for great service, do you? No you go for the awesome food. And this is the place on Mott street, best as I can tell.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm not even sure where to begin! Co-owner Heather was just the sweetest thing there could be, she helped me with some extra special touches on my boyfriend's birthday dinner and gave us pleasant conversation throughout our meal. We had: The yellowtail with meyer lemon, the strawberry ribs, the lamb meatballs, an amazing pasta dish that I cannot remember the name of, and the Anglianico red wine. If I could eat that yellowtail dish forever until I die I would be happy. Ribs were the bf's favorite dish. The space has a great feel, the people are lovely, and the food is like heaven.

"First off, the quality of the bbq was sublime in that I could taste the smoky flavor all throughout the meats.  While I know organic is supposed to be better for you, it is irrelevant to me. I got the 50/50 sandwich which is 50% pulled pork, and 50% brisket.  It was quite tasty and the bread that it was on was really quite good being heartier than a potato roll, but not quite as chewy as a seseme hoagie.  Really, the bread was very very good. My wife got one of the specials of the day being 'Philly Cheese Brisket'.  Oddly, cheese on brisket... very good. Both came with pickles (oddly sour taste that was unique), a half dollar-sized cornbread which is a one bite treat, and cole slaw.  Now, despite the other reviews here, I liked it.  While it did not have nearly as much mayo as most, it was quite a nice flavor and the cabbage was nice and crunchy. This was not the best bbq I have had, but is much better than the commercial places like Dallas BBQ or Texas Rotisserie. Honestly, I am taking 2 stars away for value and for that reason solely.  Each sandwich was about $11 and the iced teas were about $2.77 each.  For that price, I think going to Dinosaur would be well worth the trip instead. I would come back here, but only if in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I ordered dinner for delivery here tonight and was pleasantly surprised!  I first liked that the menu had a few items that aren't the usual suspects on a menu at a Mexican/Latin restaurant. I ordered the watermelon salad, chicken tacos and brussel sprouts with chorizo.  The watermelon salad was my favorite!  It was so fresh and flavorful. Bit sized chunks of watermelon and cherry tomatoes sprinkled with cojito cheese, cilantro and pepita peppers and citrus.  It came with a dressing, but I didn't even use it.  I would go there just for this.  Excellent! The chicken tacos were pretty good, not excellent, but very healthy which I love.  The order for $8 included 3 chicken tacos - I thought the size was good. There was also a generous amount of chicken on each taco, but the chicken was not very flavorful and slightly dry.  I used a ton of the fresh lime and salsa that they sent with it. The tacos were not at all greasy, which I appreciate, but they need more sabor! I also got the side of brussel sprouts, which was also a good sized serving. They are YUMMY, very good.  I would say these are good to share bc they are fried so not the healthiest option, but good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yum yum yum. Ok so after the fact that one has to wait at least an hour at any day of the week for this restaurant. It is well worth it. Has a great wine and beer selection.  Our party of four ordered a wide range of stuff - myself just the burrata and tomato salad (fresh but a small portion), my husband the giant prawns (OMG these were the biggest prawns ever and so soft and buttery) and our companions a steak and the lamp chop which they raved about. The best side by far was the pan fried mashed potatoes (and no they're not too salty theyre potatoes they should be!) and the spinach was a close second. Honestly not 5 stars just because of the wait - but I'll have to return at some strange hour to get those potatoes!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Super tiny hole in the wall serves the best breakfast I could find in Hell's Kitchen. Nook is super small, loud, and has slow service. Other than that, it's flawless. I went with three friends. Luckily, a table for four cleared up just as we got there, so we didn't have to wait for a table. Service took a while -- there was just one waiter for the whole restaurant -- but once we got our food, it was like magic! I had a benedict, which was delicious. However, the shining star at Nook is the amazing french toast. Two of my companions ordered the french toast and could not keep their mouths shut about how amazingly delicious it was. Moan, groan, sigh...I just about poked them in the eye with a fork to make them share with me.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Excellent. We had the tofu seafood chijae, the seafood pancake and beef stew. The seafood pancake was very authentic with perfect texture. The stew came with some rice cakes and udon noodles in it.

"The pork buns are so soft and deliciously hearty that I'm dreaming about it two weeks later. Most of the other food was also very good, but overpriced for what it was: -The uni appetizer was standard, however, twice the price of what I'm used to in California. -The beef rib buns were too dry :( -The spicy pork sausage/rice cake had great texture. The rice pinkies were sliced and crispy on the outside. I think they were flash fried. This is an improvement to ddukbuki (Korean spicy rice pinkies), with Szechuan style chili flavoring, and kind of like a mapo tofu with sliced rice pinkies instead of tofu. -The oxtail dumplings were very good. Skip this completely: -The pork shoulder entree was tough and tasted unseasoned, and unmarinated. My friends were nice about it and tried to eat at least half of it. This dish dropped my rating from 3.5 stars to the solid 3. A $6 Thai or Vietnamese grilled pork is infinitely better. Execution overall was pretty good, originality and style did not impress. I feel like you can find an equally good ""regular"" restaurant with the same/similar food for 1/3 the price. It's still a definite must-try though, even if just for the pork buns.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My first experiences at Rabbit Hole were the delicious brunches which led me to explore their dinner menu.  I recently indulged in the fish n' chips, a new addition to the menu.  The light and crispy fish blossomed on the plate.  The portion was wonderful and the texture of the fish was excellent.  With a combination of the creamy tartar sauce splashed with malt vinegar on top of a bed of 'chips' the dish was superior to other attempts at fish n' chips I have encountered elsewhere.  Try the dish with a Harpoon IPA.  Prior to the entree, I shared a plate of fried oysters that, once again, were cooked to a wonderful balance of crispiness and tenderness.  An attempt at describing the flavor is a waste of time, so find out for yourself.  Along with the fried oysters, we shared the Rabbit Hole Salad.  Crispy sliced carrots rested on top of cabbage, drizzled with a touch of soy sauce, vinegar and a dab of sesame oil.  This is a mouth-watering dish that is perfect to begin the evening simply in the way it makes your mouth want more.   And I cannot conclude without agreeing with another review of the pastries in general.  They are made in house and are ridiculous.  Try them.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The deviled eggs were amazing (be sure to get these if you like protein and eggs), not for the bacon shy though.  These eggs had bacon, an olive and maybe some olive oil on them. I LOVED them.  I also had the meatball sliders - look out meatball shop - these babies were delicious.  Sweet and spicy all at the same time and on a healthy little bun. I also found the atmosphere low-key, calming and open - all nice things to find in a city full madness. I'd like to find myself here again, trying more food and drink.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Visiting Carroll Gardens in the fall, we noticed that this place had opened since our last visit.  We chatted with a fellow arranging flowers outside, who turned out to be the owner - he invited us in, bought us a couple of glasses of wine, and could not have been more pleasant.  A few days later, half ruined from walking all over the city, we stopped in again, this time with daughter and boyfriend.  The Bloody Maries were fabulous.  Saved my life.  A plate of comped plantains appeared, and we dove into another round.  Can't speak to the food, but as a neighborhood bar with great soccer pix, good music, and terrific hospitality, the place made me happy. I'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I really think this place is better than Ipuddo. The wait can be awhile but it is worth it! Get there during off peak hours if you can. That's what I did. I went there after watching the Book of Mormon. Walked over there and put my name down. Waited about 20 minutes! Swweeeet! Sat in the back and it was super hot. I felt like I was in a sauna. I ordered the spicy ramen and added corn. I love corn. Broth was flavorful and the ramen was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overly spicy which was what I liked. I want to be able to taste everything and not be overpowered by the spice. Bring Cash. This will be my go-to place when I return to NYC.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Popped by with a local beer nerd.  I already had this place marked out due to the top ranking on RB and BA and now with local acclaim.  This was shaping up to be epic. 40 beers on tap and 4 x 4 flights run $10 and the menu includes RateBeer % rating, ABV and state of origin.  Unfortunately (well... not *THAT* unfortunate) -- I came during a week they were heavily featuring Lagunitas in their rotation (brewers were coming in that week for a Q&A session) - which I'm fond of, but also pretty familiar with.  I was hoping to sample more exotic (to me, anyways) brews - but hey, you can't go wrong with a solid brewery like Lagunitas. The beer selection was everything that I expected - but I didn't really like the 'feel' of this place.  Yes, I know you're going for a no-frills bar - but using plankwood over barrels for tables isn't the most comfortable of options.  We were in a sizeable group - so I didn't sit at the bar.  Service was meh. Far more selection that Stag's Head - but far more uncomfortable.  But I guess that's the price you pay for selection you get here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"They get five stars for the brussels sprout. No kidding. They're quite possibly the best vegetable dish I've ever tasted. Just the right salt, crunch, and texture. They're buttery,  cheese-y, probably about 500 calories a bite. Okay, they nominally qualify as a vegetable but they definitely would be on my ""last meal"" menu. The service is polished yet relaxed, ambience cozy, menu varied enough for the vegetarian and carnivores in our group. The porcini lasagna with homemade pasta was great, and the richness was nicely cut by a ricotta that was not overtly sweetened. We've had the meatball sandwich and mac and cheese on prior visits, and both are over-the-top carb fests. It was nice to see how expertly they also do entrees. Adorable waiter and incredibly efficient and unobtrusive busboy (isn't there a less demeaning term for that position? This guy was an adult who really worked hard.)

I understand it gets busy, but invest in a second person to confirm the order and to hand out the food while one person takes the order and payment.

"Adorable gem in West Village, a bit of a hard to find entrance. Iit's on Morton St, second door (i think its green...) from NW corner that leads to an open courtyard garden--which looks perfect for some al fresco dining or drinks.  It's a bit tight inside the resto but manages to stay ""cozy"" rather than claustrophobic. There's counter dining in front of the open kitchen, and on the lower landing another bar which slowly filled up as the night progressed.  I think the resto is much too small to just stand around the bar for a drink as it feels a bit awkward if you are dining at a table down there but people seemed to not mind it.  Very nice ambiance and vibe for a date, but also ideal for small groups. Food is superb, especially every LAMB dish they have.  Salad watercress, basil, candied lemon, roasted beets, croutons, goat cheese was decent but Spring veggie pot pie, Lemon-cured Duck leg, butter clams + gnocchi apps were winners!

"Came here on a Wednesday night for my best friend's birthday. I had a reservation for our group of friends for 8:30pm but ended up having to wait AN HOUR to be seated! One of the hosts came over to apologize profusely and offer us free drinks while we waited which definitely helped but it was still ridiculous to have to wait so long despite having reservations. Luckily, the food was delicious esp. the peekytoe crab toast, side of corn, the pretzel dusted calamari, lobster, crispy chicken, halibut and suckling pig.

"This place is awesome.  If you like a trendy atmosphere with an eclectic balance of American cuisine; go here! They have a huge selection of amazing food.  I love the honey butter and biscuits they start you off with.  The muscles in the white sauce are to die for and I don't even eat seafood!  The short rib tacos are my favorite along with the mac and cheese, although a little on the heavy side.  The chicken and waffles looked really good but I haven't tried them.  The meatballs were good, although mine are better. ;) All Italians say that. LoL. The drinks are good as well, they have various kinds of mojitos and other fun drinks.  The prices are extremely reasonable for New York City and they are open 24 hours.  Almost like a diner, but with upscale food!  You will not regret coming here.  I went on a Thursday evening.  There was a little wait but I ordered a drink at the bar and by the time I drank it, I was seated.  I will be going again soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So I guess this is the Chinese joint that hipsters go to.  No matter, the place was legit. We were visiting NYC and Opti wanted scallion pancake. This place had it on the menu so we went to check it out.  Great scallion pancake and great steam dumplings.  This was a rare treat for me and it took a certain talent to eat them properly but after a few I was like a pig in a trough with these little morsels. I also like that the table were large circular tables where multiple parties were seated at so essentially you'll be rubbing elbows with strangers while scarfing down these dumplings and getting totally messy in the process.  It's all good though because folks go to town on these dumplings and manners are an after thought. Don't worry how you look just go at it.  Good time. Cash only!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cornerstone cafe offers you brooklyn home style food with brooklyn dinner-esk prices located in manhattan. Something very rare for the city. Their breakfast items are the best, especially the baked eggs, eggs benedict and their french toast which is becoming more and more famous. Their dinner menu is also a hit. With their ""grandma"" like italian dishes, makes you wish you were part of the family. Also, in new news. They have just gotten approved for their beer and wine liquor license and are going to start serving in the next fews weeks. They will also be staying open later...

"Called to make a reservation and they never called to confirm the day before or the day of. So when I got there, they said they don't have my name on the list. I was annoyed because I called about 2 weeks before. They told me it's a 20-30 min wait so we decided to stay. After they seated everyone on their list, suddenly my phone rings and the guy is calling me. I guess they missed my name?? Anyways, we got the last table so it was really only 10 minutes. The place gets packed very quickly so reservation is recommended. You have to get the soba omelette!!! It's heavenly :) Potato croquette, sashimi, grilled short ribs, japanese pancake (which is similar to the omelette so don't order it if you are getting the omelette), diced sirloin steak, and also this baked thing with cheese on top (forgot what it's called), which was super filling. Would love to come back with a big group. Very chillax and fun.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This restaurant was so atrocious that I started a yelp account just to comment on how terrible the food at this place was. I ordered the kungpao chicken, the ""bacon"" with vegetables, and of course the coveted xiao long baos. First the xiao long baos were way too greasy and the pork meat was way too tough, evidence that the pork meat was both cooked too long and not fresh. The soup is supposed to be light and refreshing while the meat is supposed to have bounce and be soft when you bite into them. the vegetable with so called ""bacon"" is a traditional shanghainese dish which consists of pork belly and pickled vegetables in a black soy sauce brine. The pork belly and the vegetable were both so soft and so overcooked that it had no texture and were at that point just pork and vegetable MUSH. The only dish that only semi decent was the kung pao chicken, but who comes to a shanghainese restuarant to eat szchuan cuisine. If you want decent authentic food or just food in general DO NOT  COME HERE. As a shanghainese native this food was literal slap in the face","[1.0, 0.0]"

We spent the summer in Brooklyn and after multiple locals told us that we were missing out on the best pizza available we finally made a trip to L&B for dinner one night.  We were not disappointed!  Our only regret was that we didn't go earlier in the summer so that we could have gone more often.  The pizza is the best we have ever had and every time we order pizza now we wish it was from L&B.  Next summer we look forward to trying more of the entrees.   We had the Spumoni for desert and I loved it but my wife didn't care for it.  Can't wait to go back.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

As for chicken dishes, I recommend the Chicken Trefunghi, which has a fantastic flavor and generous portion size! The Spaghetti Carbonara was really  good too, but I kind of wish that they put a little more on your plate. Their desserts are especially tasty; try their Tiramisu or Cannoli! Our waiter tried his best to quickly pace our meal, but at times we had to remind him to check and see if our food was ready. We were kind of cutting it close when it came to making the show on time. The atmosphere feels like authentic Italian, especially when it came to the waiters and their hospitality. As for attire, try to aim for a dressy casual outfit. Overall, a really nice experience.

"Yes, it is expensive- it's called New York. Yes, it is crowded- it is called weekend shopping. But if you can get over these factors, head straight to the mozzarella to watch your personal cheese order be made in front of you.

The mozzarella is also close to the ravioli so I grab some of that too and then head for the checkout.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My daughter and her boyfriend are big fans of Lidia since they have been to her pricey restaurants. Becco has made me a big fan of Lidia and I am going to this restaurant whenever I am in town. The bread, bread sticks, olives, & white bean dip for starters where just to difficult to stay away from. For entree, I had the sliced steak sprinkled with shredded horseradish and served on roasted root vegetables and buckwheat polenta. The chef would not even hear it if your order is other than rare or medium rare.... Chef's right the steak melts in your mouth. That dish would always linger in my buds. Dessert was zabaglione with fresh berries but since I am a big fan of panna cottas, I wished I ordered that instead. I still finished the zabaglione though by myself! Oh... don't forget about the great staff! Only one of few places I've been where the moment you turn your head one of the staff will be there for you. And they are very knowledgeable of what they serve, & warm & friendly! I'm very glad I agreed with my daughter to go for Becco.

"Great food, great beer selections, and great atmosphere.  The only negative thing I will ever say about this place, is the wait you must endure after 7pm!  But it is worth the wait. I have visited this little gem in the West Village a few times.  Once just to have drinks, and another time for dinner.  The food was delicious and did not disappoint, from the appetizers to the desserts. Started off with the chicken liver toast to accompany our drinks, and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a fan of liver, but this dish was tasty.  Next we had the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto and the speck salad with puntarelle & blood Orange.  The sheep's milk ricotta gnudi are little bite-sized pieces of heavenly cheese-gnocchi type of  things.  I would definitely recommend the dish.   Then came the burgers, and the shoestring fries.  Very good all around.  In some odd sense the burger with the Roquefort cheese reminded me of the burger from Father's Office that I desperately miss from LA.   Rounding up the meal, we decided to try the creme caramel and the ginger cake.  I thought the creme caramel was a bit on the too sweet side, but the ginger cake was perfectly balanced with the sweetness and a hint of spice.   Yes the food is a bit on the pricey side, but I think it is definitely worth it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Hostess, ""well, we can only put you at 2 tables.  We don't have a table big enough to fit all of you."" Me ""Ok"" My husband asked what happened... I told him that the hostess can not seat us all together...I had to call them back and my husband was pissed! "" Hello, you just called regarding the reservations of 14?  What do you mean you can seat us all together?  We called a month in advance and made this reservations."" Manager - ""well have you been here before.  we don't have a big enough spot to sit you all together, but we can make it work."" Husband, "" No we have not been there before, but we heard such great things about, we thought we should try it out.  Ok... fine we will see you in 2 hours.""

"I was looking for a restaurant that would be quintessentially New York, though perhaps less pricy and cramped than restaurants I generally deem quintessential, and I actually chose Malatesta based on Yelp reviews. I made a reservation for my party of 7 at 8:30 on a gorgeous Thursday evening.  We launched right into orders of shareable appetizers and loved our bruschetta sampling and grilled calamari.  The squid pieces were enormous, and not even remotely fishy.  For my first course, I ordered a special of balsamic marinated mushrooms with a young white cheese.  It was quite generous and impeccably fresh, as were my fellow diners' Caprese salads and a fresh artichoke salad, dressed with lemon juice and fresh herbs. For my main, I ordered the spinach gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce on the recommendations of my server and fellow Yelpers.  My brother ordered a ravioli special involving artichokes.  We quietly agreed each others' were our favorites.  Others ordered Penne All Arrabbiata, the Polpette (veal meatballs), or repeats of appetizers, and I enjoyed my tastes all around.  Portions were perfect, neither modest nor gluttonous.  With wines by the glass for only $6 and no entree setting us back more than about $14, the value was spectacular. Malatesta is still quintessential in that it is quite loud when it's packing a full house, and maneuvering can be a bit difficult.  But my out-of-town visitors learned a lesson about what real New Yorkers do when they eat: nevermind the garlic breath, just lean in and talk louder!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"An intimate setting for gathering with the chums.  Here I felt a strong sense of solidarity that we are all hearing each other's conversations (relating) and watching each other's expressions (mirroring).   Try starting off with the ""Duck Egg with Tuna Bottarga"".

To die for:  Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter and Sage (It looks like a small dish but after the first gnudi (you get six), you might think twice that it is!) Let's be real here!  In a city that never sleeps, don't expect to NOT have a long wait.  Besides, why not take this opportunity to be creative while waiting (i.e. walk around the block hand-in-hand with your baby or throw your frisbee across the street; or enjoy a Galoise and watch the world go by).  Paul Rudd can pop in looking for someone and you may even get to see his most current do...up close and personal!  You would be surprised at how the time just passes and voila...your table is ready!  It's worth the wait!  ...But you may just get lucky to not have to.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Don't go here if you want a sterile atmosphere.  Do go here if you like it cozy, warm, romantic and artful. Every item on the menu is superb.  As a regular, I'd recommend the fried oyster appetizer, the cioppino (a San Francisco, Italian-American seafood chowder filled with lobster, shrimp, assorted fresh fish chunks in the most succulent sauce), and almost any grilled fish - snapper, bass,  salmon, tuna etc.  Everything is always fresh and perfectly prepared.   But choose anything from the menus, copies of which are on the walls, and you can't go wrong.  There are even some excellent meat items, such as the perfectly-grilled strip steak, should your party include non-seafood pallets. It's BYOB, which is great since you can purchase wines from a neighboring shop across the street and save a bundle of money. While the atmosphere is funky, the service is attentive. And another plus - after dinner you can stop into the wine bar next door, owned by the same management, and choose from a wide assortment of wines and artisanal beers while listening to great music - piano, guitar or cool jazz, depending on which evening you stop in.   Trust me - go here and go often.  I do.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"They say your favorite restaurant is where they know you. We had never been to Seafire Grill previously. We were treated very special by Aron, the GM, and Besfort, our waiter, and his team. Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by Aaron who is full of energy and enthusiasm. He asked us to wait in the bar for 15 minutes and he would get us a fabulous table. In 15 minutes, he arrived to seat us at a fabulous table.  The service team was probably the best and most efficient of any restaurant we dined in NYC. The service was exceptional. I would give the food 4.5 stars. Very good food, although I always complain about NYC portions being too small. The atmosphere was very nice although adding individual lights to each piece of artwork on the wall would make the place more elegant. I had the salmon and my wife had the halibut. Both were excellent. The prawns were excellent as well. I was so impressed by how well we were treated, we will definitely go back to the Seafire Grill.

Sat at the bar and watched as other parties large and small walked in and were seated before us.  Based on the conversations we overheard, not all had reservations either.  The trick seemed to be standing in front of the hostess which appears to be the only way she remembers you asked for a table.  We also checked in with her while we waited and were told it wouldn't be much longer. Finally, one hour and 40 minutes later - after we were the only ones left at the bar -  we were seated with no apology.  Table service was good.  The food was okay, it definitely didn't live up to the raves people gave it here.  There's nothing unique about pasta with shrimp or sauce, fresh mozzarella, flat bread pizza, a 1/2 roasted chicken or fried calamari in the NY City area.

Great thing that the host offered to take all our coats and keep it somewhere. That would have been a disaster lol. We started the meal off with a bottle of Colombard. A toast to a great dinner ahead. I counted a total of 15 plates including 2 amuse bouche, 2 desserts and a plate of small chocolate squares. All that for $40??? Totally worth it!!! As each dish was brought to our table, the men exclaims ""oh, this by far is the best"". Lol. Funny how they kept on saying how Xixa was a great pick that night. Must've been the Colombard talking or the old fashion mezcal they each wefe drinking. Lol Standouts of that night were the goat sliders and the carrots. The sliders hit that ""oh my this is good"" spot right on. And the carrots were unexpected. Sweet and just plain tasty. By plate #10, we were already expecting to get one dessert and be done with it. We were surprised that we actually still had more to come. ""How much is this again?"" Bill came out to $411 for 6 with a bottle of wine and 3 old fashion mezcals. And tax and tip. Not bad.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"MUST HAVE: the ice cream sandwich. They make all of their cookies and ice creams in-house, and let you mix and match however your little tummy desires. Examples: unbaked flat peanut butter cookies with chocolate ice cream, gingersnap with vanilla, brownie cookies (TIP: they are not brownies, but cookies that taste like brownies) paired with fresh mint ice cream (you can see the leafy evidence). MUST HAVE, TOO: Everything But The Kitchen Sink. Notice the capital letters... this is the name of a dish consisting of a bed of fresh market greens and cooked veggies of the day, with your choice of balls and sauce on top. E.Lee's fave ball + sauce combo: beef meatball with spicy tomato sauce H.Ngo's fave ball + sauce combo: cheddar filled steak meatball with spicy tomato sauce   *note: E.Lee never, EVER eats meat balls but she will eat them here since it's pure meat without the chewy mysterious bits. -Butcher and Porkchop (E.Lee + H.Ngo)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I ordered take-out from here and tried the roti and Chow Kueh Teow. The prices are all very reasonable. I loved the roti, the bread was soft yet crispy and the curry sauce it came with had tons of flavor. The noodles were good but nothing out of this world. A decent place to grab some quick Malaysian food. The person who took the order was not the most friendly though.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Good choice for out of towners. We scored a table by walking in on a Sunday summer evening. When I called, they said they were fully booked, but we took a chance. A lot of interesting choices on Bobby Flay's menu. Saw Jeffrey Zakarian walk by with his little kid (Food Network friend of BF). Food was very good, and service was very nice, if not trying to hard to up-sell items.   I noticed the server bought after dinner drinks for many of the tables (we did not stay for dessert). Setting is typical.  Big, corporate, very nicely done. Why wouldn't I go back? Not personal enough for us.  No way to get to know the bartender or manager (we like to frequent restaurants and know the staff), because it was just too big. Too many tourists. Not a neighborhood spot.   No vibe.  No soul.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Asian-style appetizers, coq au vin, nautical accent pieces, butcher-paper tablecloth and crayons - somehow, it all works. The pre-war tavern Ear Inn is one-part TGIFriday's, one part downtown dive, and chill as hell.   The portions are gigantic ($7 scored me probably 30 garlicky mussels), and the food itself is comforting, unextraordinary, and priced to please at $4 - $13. The beer (it's the kind of place where ordering a cocktail would be frowned upon) menu is smart and understated. Best of all, set on a fairly deserted stretch of SoHo, Ear Inn feels like a familiar, private hideout. It's not - the building has been designated a historic landmark, and has a couple hundred years' worth of apocryphal trivia, but on a frigid weekday night, it felt like somebody's waking dream of a faraway, storied home.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My two friends and I went for dinner (around 8pm) at Caracas in Brooklyn on Thursday, March 3rd of last week.  It was absolutely wonderful!  The food and service were both unbelievably fantastic!  We were seated right away.  Our waiter answered all the questions about the menu for us. Everything was delicious!  In addition, the staff seemed very attentive to all the customers' needs.  Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded, it appeared that the manager had a great process of efficiency. We all agreed that due to the food, the ambiance and the management, we will start being regular customers at Caracas!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have put away quite a few sandwiches in my time. I ordered the #1 (house special) with the chili peppers and the #3 (shredded pork) with chili peppers. Honestly, $3.75 is the most I've ever paid for banh mi, but really, that's still a steal. For me, the bread is the absolute foundation and I immediately noted that the baguette was subpar. The quintessential baguette for banh mi needs to be warmly crisped on the outside, have just a touch of butter, and have a spongy softness on the inside. The bread was rather generic, dry, and .... American? The actual sandwich (#1) once I took a bite was better. The vegetables had lost some of their crispness. I did like the fact that the meat and pate were quite good, flavorful, moist with its inherent pork fat, and without overuse of mayonaise. Everything was in correct proportion. The overall portions were generous for banh mi and I killed it without much thought. So overall taste was okay, texture was disappointing.   The shredded pork (#3) was forgettable and the bi didn't taste particularly flavorful like it should. Needs more of a burnt-y, bitter, sesame quality. This sandwich's contents was kinda of an amalgamated flavor clump. Meh. I tossed the second half of this sandwich. I want to give this joint another shot. Perhaps the veggies are fresher in the morning. But I can't really excuse the bread .... eh. I'm not going out of my way for this. No doubt, the search for good banh mi in the city continues.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"In short, the food is good but not spectacular.  We spent $70 on bbq food, which to me is a bit too pricey.  The pork belly and brisket were very tender but unfortunately all the meats had no flavor.   I liked the overall ambiance of the restaurant along with the decor.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Cho Dang Gol serves rustic Korean food, including their specialty--fresh soybean curd made daily at the restaurant. My favorite dish comes with thin slices of simmered pork, tofu as light as a zephyr, and fresh kimchi, spicy enough to tingle your tongue.

Even the little appetizers--a concomitant of all Korean restaurants--are prepared with extreme care.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Cheesecake? Amazing! Service? Pretty Good. Food was very good as we'll. only thing making me not love this place was the long wait since we didn't have a reservation.

"It takes ALOT of perfection to get a full 5 stars whole-heartedly from me. Chef Mark Simmons and the Kiwiana Staff on 5/4/2013 was absolute perfection and for a large party of 12, no less! From making the reservation to the prefixe menu (with enough tastes for ANY and ALL picky eaters) to the evening itself - absolutely the best birthday celebration to history. Table(s) were ready at our arrival, complimentary glass of bubble was enjoyed thoroughly, and hungry stomachs were filled. Between 12 of us - we got to try almost everything on the menu, so here goes: Appetizers: Slow poached baby beets with lavender infused ricotta and almonds -- so fresh and big enough to share Salmon ceviche with wasabi avocado puree  -- very very fresh and great presentation Corn and crab soup with pop corn and avocado -- unbelievable combination of tastes! Green leaf salad with garam spiced cashews, shallots and blueberries -- perfect amount of dressing and very fresh mixed of greens Entrees: Seared N.Z salmon with brussel sprouts, gala apple and lardons -- perfectly glazed and delicious, even for people who werent salmon fans. Cherry- and chili-glazed rack of lamb with flageolet bean cassoulet and spring vegetables -a MUST try, from the crust and well marinated meat to the veggies, so yum. Black angus sirloin with parsnip and horseradish puree, peppered spinach - large portion of well marinated and juicy meat; Horopito and buttermilk fried chicken with kale slaw and truffle honey - from the look to the taste - delicious and juicy Desserts: --all were hits, the lamington was a personal favorite!!

"First, Kimchi Grill has combined two of my favorite things in a most wonderful way--tacos and kimchi--this is simply the best idea ever.  Unfortunately, despite my attempts at self-restraint, they are also located within my delivery area. After a long day of work it is easy to fall into the warmth of my inviting couch with the ease of Seamless Web and a bottle of wine. And because Kimchi Grill is so delectable I regret nothing. I am moving full speed on the path to a happy, pudgy and slightly poor mortality and the Kimichi Fries are most certainly worth it. Furthermore, Kimchi Grill's staff is nothing but delightful and accommodating. They are often busy (so many people fighting to eat yummy kimchi and guacamole filled burritos) but Kimchi Grill's staff works hard to get out delicious, spicy, mouthwateringly good food as quickly as possible. They also offer wonderful service to their clients. Case in point, I (after a long day teaching the youth) came home cranky and hungry. Kimchi Grill worked hard to make me an awesome burrito and have it hand delivered to my lazy bum's front door. It was very good, however, in a moment of understandable kitchen rush there was no guacamole! I felt wronged, but mostly just cranky, and I forced my boyfriend to call. I think more than anything I simply wanted my voice heard, I really didn't need anything in return, yet Kimichi Grill insisted on sending out complimentary drinks, chips and guac. I felt like such a douche--but also so appreciated. Kimchi Grill is amazing for its food and its service and I am ecstatic that they deliver to me.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Pros: * Bohemian's brand thrives on its exclusivity and secrecy. You can only dine here if you're with someone who has eaten at Bohemian before. For how popular it is (and how hard it is to secure a reservation), it's a testament to how powerful word of mouth is. * Unique dining experience- Bohemian's tiny and intimate space is set up like an elegant and cozy living room with modern furniture. * Loved and recommend the Sashimi Platter (huge fresh pieces), Washu-Beef Short Rib Sashimi, Beef Tartar Flatbread (I wish I ordered this filling entree for myself, the tartar was so tasty with the bread and can be shared with 2 people), Mac & Cheese (made with strong stinky cheese, yum!), and Fried Sweet Potatoes (perfectly fried, tasted so much better than the regular fried potatoes). While the Pan-Roasted Branzino was delicious, my friends had a hard time eating it because it was so bony. * Because I came with a group in which we shared appetizers, entrees, dessert and ordered several cocktails...I had expected astronomical prices. However, the price turned out to be only $51 including tax and tip, not bad at all. Cons: * The Sashimi Rice bowl is TINY- its like a slightly larger Japanese teacup filled more with rice than sashimi. * The strange chocolate covered dried noodle that came with the Soba Creme Brûlée was unappetizing and got stuck in our mouths.   * No waiting bar or waiting space- when the new set of customers arrive, they end up awkwardly standing jam packed in the foyer. The entrance is also right next to the bathroom, so people also get confused who is waiting for bathroom or their table * For such a nice and elegant restaurant, the service was surprisingly and painfully slow. Although our waiter was sweet and friendly...he got 2 of my orders wrong and hardly came around to check on us, re-fill our water glasses, or take away finished dishes in a timely manner. I think the service would be much better for smaller tables.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Such a sweet delight inside the Essex Market. Just one bite from these tacos took me back to Texas. And to add, no snooty yankee prices here: around $4-5 for a taco. My usual is the beef brisket taco, served on 2 corn tortillas. Brisket is tender, lean, and moist. The perfect amount of zest from the cream and cheese, to spiciness with a touch of hot sauce, to sweetness with the pineapple salsa. Such a palatable experience that no one could argue with. They also have a reward card that I take advantage of: ""Buy 9 tacos & the 10th is on the house.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food here is actually pretty damn good. I'm usually suspicious of Thai joints that are fancy (holes in the wall FTW!) but this place was really good and reasonably priced to boot. I started with the special appetizer they had listed outside..pumpkin rolls. essentially a spring roll wrapper filled with a spiced pumpkin puree, deep fried and served with, of all things, mustard. who knew mustard and pumpkin went together? I'm still not so sure they do...but it oddly worked. I would have just as soon dumped some cinnamon syrup all over them though and called it a dessert. Moving on, my entree: PCU noodle with chicken. they did NOT skimp on the chicken, which was great, the bok choy was fresh, and the noodles were well seasoned and cooked. satisfying, and a decent deal at $10. Interesting sidenote: order the thai iced tea (pinto iced tea) and it's a DIY thai iced tea. it all comes in a little box, with a little pitcher of tea, a glass full of ice, a small cup of the cream and a small serving of simple syrup. entertaining to say the least. the downside...its too much tea for the glass so you're left trying to guess the right proportion of each element. Which is cool if you wanna control your sugar or caloric intake but at times it can be hard to achieve that perfect balance and I almost wish they would have came over and mixed it for me. Minus one star because the service was so very slow, even when we were the last people left in the restaurant and usually would be getting shuffled out of there. go figure. definitely a solid choice for a meal around the neighborhood though. PS - sit near the window if possible, great people watching to be had. always shenanigans happening on Christopher St.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went to Locanda Verde for brunch two weekends ago. The space was warm, rustic and was beautifully adorned with gingerbread replicas of NY landmarks and winter cheer. The feel here is what makes the architecture and feel of Tribeca special - original brick walls, high ceilings, open layout & lots of natural lighting. If I had a choice to choose seating, the back table by the windows (seats 4-6ppl) is the best in the house, after which I'd say the front of the house nook is pretty sweet as well - it's inset from the door, the bar and space where everyone stands to waiting to get a seat (you also get to see the hustle & bustle of the restaurant). TIP: If you're heading there for brunch (walk-in) try to get there by 11am (before noon) - we were seated in less than 20 mins; make reservations as early as a week ahead they fill up quickly. Between 4 adults we filled up on: 1 appetizer - ricotta crostini (5 stars); 4 entrees - Scampi and Grits (4.0 stars); Soft Scrambled Farm Egg Crostino (4.5 stars); Crispy Polenta Waffle (3.5); Wood-Fired Uova Al Forno (4 stars); 2 sides - double order of Pork Sausage (4 stars); garlic potatoes (5 stars) drink(s) - Tre-Stelle (house made juice; 5 stars) Will definitely come back for the dessert!

"Would love to give it another try, but 3 stars is the best I can muster for now. Although, perhaps if I had ordered something else I would have given it a higher rating. Pros: the atmosphere is great. service is efficient. our waitress was good and friendly. Cons: Food was average to OK. Nothing wow. I got the veal dish. It was dry and bland. The bed of chickpeas under it was like a slightly too salty paste with a little bit of tang. Not impressed at all. The wife got the mussels. They were fine...hard to mess up mussels. But, the fries that came with it may as well have been from Wendy's. Obviously frozen crap. The only really good thing was the wine & the appetizer: Fried ricotta & smoked parm fritters. They were yum. But, we had a great time with friends so that made for a real nice evening.

"the whole night sucked here. first the girl hosting told us it would be five minutes but also wouldn't seat us at two tables that were actually free so they could seat four instead of two... whatever understandable for the mean time then the misinformed other host told us it would be 20 minutes. instead of checking for us with the original host, he pretty much made me go find the other host and ask myself. then food was just okay, I felt like my fish was overpriced for what I got and my boyfriends steak was smaller for 20 dollars then most places in the area. you can go to speedy Romeo down the street and get a huge steak for just one more dollar. then as our food arrived the food server spilled a lot of our wine all over me. none of the other staff noticed because they are all just hanging out with 22's of beer near the front of the kitchen window . they guy didn't even offer any compensation for our wine. it spilled allllll over me. we ended up spending 110 dollars here and still tipped 20 percent. our waitress saved the day with her service being very accommodating and helpful however she brought our check before we even finish our wine. never again. too expensive for what it is and not worth it. its just hip","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It's that fucking good.  Let me begin with that.  What is?  Trattoria L'Incontro is.  I've heard about it for years and it's sat gathering dust on my list of restaurants to visit.  This is mainly because it's in Queens, and I'm a Brooklyn guy.  I have no big impetus to come up here.  However, the other weekend the girl was out of town, and I wanted to go have a great meal somewhere new.  With Rosario's as a good place to pick up a sandwich for work on Monday, La Guli nearby to pick up dessert after, and the subway a block away, L'Incontro came out on top.  The place is a lot larger than I expected.  High ceilings, big open dining area, and a lot of tables.  Regardless, the place was bustling by 6:30.  Some people had special occasions, others didn't, some young, some old; it was a good mix.  I grabbed a table right in front, which was good for people watching.  I didn't realize it at first, but it reminded me of Italy more so than 9/10 other Italian restaurants--especially those that play up kitchy decor.  In the back, the chef, Rocco Sacramone, was not just schmoozing people but making sure that the operation was running well.  My waiter, Carlos, was excellent.  He was friendly, unpatronizing, and even putting the recitation of the 20 item specials menu aside, he was knowledgeable as well.  One of the best waiters I've seen in quite some time, and that's coming from an ex-waiter.  That's a lot of good things to list about a restaurant, and luckily for me, the food was even better.   For a starter I got the wild game meatballs special, which are ostrich and venison in a sauce with mushrooms and truffle oil.  I hadn't had either meat before so it took a little bit to disseminate the different flavors, but I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  The ostrich tastes mostly like beef, with the venison adding a slight gaminess and oily aftertaste.  The mushrooms were delicious, as was the sauce with added a earthiness to complemented the meat well.  I was a bit disappointed that I only got two balls, but from a pacing perspective it worked.  This dish paired well with the Nero D'Avola I got by the glass.  For a pasta, I got the much talked about mezzaluna ravioli, which are stuffed with mascarpone and pesto, and come in a brandy and walnut sauce with shaved asparagus.  This was an excellent dish!  The pasta tasted homemade as it was, and had the perfect amount of bite to it.  The filling was rich, creamy and flavorful, and contrasted well with the nutty flavors of the asparagus and sauce.  Thank you Yelpers for the recommendation here.  For my main, I got a red snapper special which came in a chickpea puree with spinach and chantarelle mushrooms.   The fish was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly.  The sauce was very simple; the chickpea sauce acted as a slightly creamy, salty contrast to the rich flavor of the fish, with the spinach and mushrooms adding in a little variety.  I thought the mushrooms could've stood out more, but it was still an excellent dish.  I was too full for dessert, but got an espresso and sambuca.  It was just like what I'd had in Italy; full of rich flavor.  I did not bother using the sambuca on the coffee, as it wasn't needed. Excellent meal at an excellent restaurant.  I saw one reviewer compare the owner, Rocco Sacramone, to Mario Batali.  I would consider that a downgrade; Batali is happy just to rake in the money, and only once have I been bowled over by a dish at one of his restaurants (Manzo).  Rocco is doing it the right way, as he was omnipresent in the back of the room, making sure that the everything was going perfectly.  More importantly he was succeeding, as there weren't many holes to poke into this dining experience.  Most importantly, all of his dishes were nuanced, wowed in different ways, and were worth the money.  By the way, while the pricing isn't low by any means, it's very fair for what you get.  Going all out, this dinner cost a little under $80 without tip; you could easily do $50-60pp if you're more conservative.  I love old school Italian, but sometimes a change in pace is needed.  L'Incontro earns its reputation as one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I stumbled upon this place after a show in January '13, and fell in love with their empanadas.  Recently, I found myself in the same neighborhood after another show and actively sought out this narrow little hole in the wall.  Now, when my boyfriend and I arrived, the line to get in was out the door - it should be noted that tables are lined up against one side of the restaurant and people have to walk single file up and down the length on the other side of the restaurant....I wasn't exaggerating when I said it was a narrow hole in the wall.  That being said, once we were seated, we ordered a frenzy of delicious food.  Everything we ate was outstanding, but if I could only recommend one thing, it would be the fried yucca with guacamole.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The smells were out of this world walking by so I had to stop in.  I don't consider myself a true foodie, but I love BBQ and I have the cholesterol level to prove it. Most BBQ joints I've been to in NYC stick to a specific style when it comes to pulled pork.  They either go with the Carolina style, which is heavy on the mustard and vinegar, Kansas City style, which is heavy on the bbq sauce, or sort of a Texas style, which is all about the dry rub.  There are obviously different types of meats and different ways to prepare, but that's about the gist of my knowledge.  I don't see what goes in the cooker, I just see and taste what goes into my belly. Anyway, Mighty Quinns seems to combine the best of all worlds.  They definitely have some delicious dry rub action that you immediately smell coming from their giant smoker, but the not too watery, not too saucy sauce has mouth watering hints of both vinegar and mustard.  A lot of times when BBQ places go ""all in"" on a style, the meat flavor gets overpowered by vinegar or sweet & tangy sauce, but Mighty Quinn's has a nice balance.  My only complaint is the meat was a little fatty.  You need some of that fat for flavor, but it felt like I was chewing gum at one point.  They definitely didn't spare any part of the pig. I ended up getting the naked pulled pork b/c I don't like to waste space in my belly on buns.  The pork was really good as I mentioned above, but the highlight of my meal was the burnt ends baked beans.  Good lord.  If you aren't familiar w/ burnt ends, they are the delicious end piece of brisket that crisps to a nice burn when smoking  (hence the extremely creative name).  It's delicious, and when it's slathered in some sweet sauced baked beans it's amazing.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Emporio is perfect.  The decor is rustic and warm and the staff friendly, professional and attentive.  The food is always high quality and completely delicious!!!  The wine list also has a great selection at a range of prices.  The thing I love is you can come here and enjoy lots of little plates to share with friends or have a well-prepared and well-priced meal with appetizers, pasta course and entrees - it just depends on what you are in the mood for.  Did I mention the deserts?!!!!  We had the chocolate ganash and lemon tart (both recommended by our waitress) and thought about going back the next day just to try them again.  All around a great dining experience.  Thanks!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This was one of the best restaurant week deals this year (a couple months back now, but for future reference).  Between two people, the restaurant week deal got us a free wine tasting, four apps, two entrees, and two desserts.  All of the food was quite amazing.  I would particularly recommend the green bean appetizer and the beignets for dessert!  The only complaint - part of the restaurant is not as pretty/good ambiance as the rest, and of course we were there.  Try to ask for a table in the main section!","[1.0, 0.0]"
Went back for dinner last night and had a fabulous meal with some friends.  The food is excellent and the locations remains hip even though it's gained some notoriety.   I did notice that the prices are creeping up - $13 for a cocktail is a bit steep for me.  Still love the place though...,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Another dive, but good burgers.  Not much else to write about this place, except some claim their drinks are reasonable.   Hit and miss, but the burgers usually hit the spot.  Now that the no smoking order has been in effect for quite a while, this place is more tolerable in the late evenings when tons of geezers would hang at the bar and smoke up all of Virginia's tobacco.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have been a fan of the food here for years. it is consistently good.  The service, however, accounts for the two stars. The hostesses are blasé, unwelcoming and seem to not know that they are there to welcome patrons. Waitstaff appears overwhelmed and over worked. only the busboys seem to realize that they are part of a service business. The manager(?) and those  in charge are officious, curt and often rude. If you are there only for the food, you should not be disappointed. If you believe that dining is about ambiance and  service along with thevquality of the food, you might want to pick up your food and eat it around more pleasant people.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Another New York favorite... not this place needs another 5-star rating, but their soup dumplings are amazeballs. This is the place that started my whole obsession with soup dumplings. All you really need to order here is their Juicy Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao - XLB) and scallion pancakes. I've tried their pork and crab juicy soup dumplings and they're ok. Pork is the way to go. Oh, make sure to also dip it in their chili sauce. The restaurant is communal seating which I really don't mind. It's nice to chat up random strangers while everyone is stuffing their faces. Might not be a place for the socially awkz or people who value their personal space too much. But, it's part of the dining experience! Eat that XLB and enjoy it. This place is hard to miss. It's the only place in that alley that has a line forming outside. You'll see people crowding outside the restaurant waiting for their number to be called.","[1.0, 0.0]"
The food is good and a good deal for the price! Favorite things on the menu: the nachos and the steak with rice and beans.

Ok, I admit so far this is the best sandwich I have had in New York since I moved here year ago.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am not really happy with my experience at Trattoria Trecolori and therefore it gets 1 star. What annoys me is that reservations are required for this restaurant. No where on their website does it state that reservations are required. Even Yelp reviews did not state that a reservation was required. I was going to go to Broadway to see a show on a Thursday, and had some extra time for an early dinner. I walked in Trattoria Trecolori and asked for a table for 2. The hostess then made a big deal that we don't have a reservation and came across as rude, rolling his eyes at my partner and I. The funny thing is, the restaurant is practically empty while he was talking to us. He then pointed to the front of the restaurant and said we could sit down on a small round table near the front of the restaurant with barely any room on it for food. There was no olive oil bottle either, just barely a small candle. Reservations weren't required for the tables in the front of the restaurant. If you come here, do not accept these tables as there is really no space to eat your food properly on them. Just walk out and make a reservation if you really want to eat here. The food was ok, just good enough to give this restaurant one star. The waitress was friendly, the exact opposite of the hostess who seated us. In any case, I wouldn't even define this as a fancy upper class restaurant which should require reservations! Everything on the menu is $15-$20, all middle-class prices. People who walk in without reservations are treated like dirt in this place. I urge the owner of this restaurant to state their reservation policy more directly to patrons through their website. The funny thing is, The Olive Garden is just down the street from Trattoria Trecolori, and the lower paid middle-class workers there treat you so much better there. It makes you wonder why even go to a place like Trattoria Trecolori if these people do not appreciate your business, Bad service always takes away from good food in principle.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Friday night we walked in, party of three, and I don't know how the hell it happened, but we got seated right away. I think David Chang is amazing. I don't go to Noodle Bar too often because it takes me like two days to digest the food there, but I do love his food and I was not disappointed at Ssam Bar. It was so damn good. His food is original without sacrificing taste for originality (a fatal mistake in all art); bold and daring. We got the pork buns (because of course), Edward's wigwam ham, apple kimchi, spicy rice cakes, pickled vegetable assortment, Spanish mackerel with citrus and beets. I swear the apple kimchi is genius. You have to get it. Seriously. The Spanish mackerel was also fantastic. The flavors, again, original and delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the ham, so next time I will pick a different kind, or maybe just double up on the apple kimchi. The rice cakes were delicious too, with a heat that doesn't punch you in the face, but definitely builds up. It was nice to eat those with the pickled vegetables because they did a good job of counterbalancing the heat. Of course I would recommend this place. Will be back soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So I finally got to visit the DUMBO location.  I have eaten at Grimaldi's on Franklin Avenue many times, but have always wanted to eat at the Brooklyn location.  Got there about 12:15pm; the line was about 5 people deep.  My boyfriend and I waited about 15 minutes at most.  We were ushered inside and seated at the end of a row of small 2-top tables pushed together.  There's a hustle-bustle atmosphere in this pizzeria.  Lots of tourists and locals grabbing lunch.  It's definitely nice to get pizza here and walk over the Brooklyn Bridge on a nice day (which we did).  Great pizza.  But, if I'm ever craving Grimaldi's I might just continue going to the one in Garden City - there has never been a wait and the pizza is equally as delicious.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is phenomenal! I'm not sure why they are getting such horrible reviews. Yes, it is new and they don't take reservations and they clearly have a few kinks to work out in the seating department. So go there prepared to wait, have some drinks and oysters at the bar. It is absolutely worth it... the food was incredible and the staff was super friendly, the chef even came out to check how everything was after the meal. The seafood was so fresh and delicious, I will no doubt be going back again. The peel and eat shrimp were perfection! We ordered snow crab legs which were great, as were the fried clams, creamed spinach and crab cakes. The blue crabs were pretty good too, but not the best I've eaten. Everything was reasonably priced, and given the outrageous prices for seafood in New York, I'd say this place is great deal.  All in all, I had a great experience. Just go there ready to wait and it'll be all good.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here expecting great things and Chef David Chang doesn't disappoint.  We ordered the pork buns,which were fatty and delicious.  Better than the ones I had at Ippudo. For the entree, my party pre-ordered the bo ssam, which was almost two much for 3 guys/3 gals.  After a few servings, it got a little routine to make my little wraps with lettuce, meat, scallions and rice, but overall a very tasty experience. One curiousity I have is the idea of having the wait staff dressed like 20 year old college students.  No apron, no sign that they work for the restaurant.  It wasn't a big deal and for the most part they were cool and attentive.  Although the little hipster Asian guy with the black rim glassed was pretty rude to me when I walked back in after going out to flag down my Fiance.  Dude, I was already inside sitting with a full table of friends.  A stern ""Hello? Can I help you??"" as if we were somehow trying to sneak in and steal something was not necessary.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Was excited for Sunday brunch given the reputation and reviews. I ordered a special of baked eggs with spicy marinara, artichokes and burrata. Getting a free cocktail with the meal is good, but I felt like the food prices reflect the extra cost of a drink. The meal was good, and service was attentive, but I would have been really disappointed had I not called ahead and instead waited the normal 1.5 hour wait time for walk-ins. I would give Jane 3.5 stars if possible - above average but not amazing, and you can do better for the prices and wait times.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Only if you're crazy and/or have no taste in pizza should you ever go here. The fact that it's a tiny establishment isn't a problem, but there are two things definitely wrong here: 1: They reheat it. It was only 7:15 when I went in for a slice with some friends, and in my book, that's a no-no. 2: It just wasn't good pizza! You couldn't taste any mozzarella on the pie (I ordered just a regular slice, nothing funky like the artichoke pizza I've heard about), it was practically ALL parmesan! The fact that it was reheated only made the crust tough and crunchy, more like a pita chip or a cracker than anything. The basil leaves were really distracting, and the sauce was just... well, it wasn't there. So, if you want good pizza? Find someplace that ISN'T this.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Love this place! If I was looking to move to an apartment  in East Village, I'd compare each potential apt according to how far it is from this place.

I recommend picking a sweet sauce like the Vietnamese pineapple, a mayo-based sauce like the eggplant, and the War sauce. The variety in taste adds so much. Don't be boring.

"sludging through the snowy polar vortex in industrial bushwick, two friends and i found ourselves trembling at the mercy of nature. but the promise of delicious vietnamese food put enough wind in our sails to amble the 20 minute walk from myrtle broadway to 112 harrison place. entering the restaurant, my party was greeted by a full house of chattering, well dressed, incredibly hate-able 20 and 30 somethings. given the inclement weather, this was something one could expect, but it made us weary of what we had fantasized to be our ""little hole in the wall"". the staff was genial and serene as they told us that there would be a 45 minute wait but if we left our number, they would call us when our table was ready. luckily, one of my friends was renting an art studio nearby where we could hang in the mean time, so we accepted the offer. 43 minutes later and the man i can only assume to be the restaurant's owner, henry, called us to let us know our table was ready. when we came back, he ushered us past the other tables to our own spot in a corner next to a window with flowers and an antique mirror. our waitress was friendly, helped us decide upon dishes and encouraged us to get plates to share. dad's rolls, sautéed eggplant, pumpkin curry, crab with noodles, two coffees and a slice of chestnut mille crepe. henry repeatedly brought us more rice telling us not to be shy when it came to portions. the rolls were bigger than an average spring roll, about the size of a small wrap, and the shrimp was fresh, the rolls especially fit amazing with the jalapeños and chili paste they provide. but the highlights for me were the eggplant - soft, grilled to perfection, marinated as if cut steak, and the slice of chestnut mille, 20 stacked powder crepes with butterscotch and brandy. we didn't want the meal to end. but our bellies filled, we paid a reasonable check and parted back into the snow. the staff could not have made us feel more comfortable, and we left with energy to pursue our nights, struggling against the wind on endless vision quests.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The food is delicious but the service is a bit suspect and unpredictable. I live only a block away and have been there several times already for dinner--it is a relaxed, seat yourself kind of spot. I had, up until a few nights ago, had decent service considering it's more a bar than restaurant (self-seating). But there was a stiffy waitress who waited for a while before serving my friend and I--the bartender was the first to approach the table when he saw we hadn't been helped. She was pushy, rude, and masked it with a valley girl smile. Her initial approach was as if she thought my friend and I were pre-gentrified Crown Heights residents, OG locals and we did NOT feel welcomed. At one point after payment (and a great tip despite actions and attitude of this chick, who I can only describe as a too broke for Manhattan but I like pretending this is it, neo Prospect/Crown Heights snob), she asked my friend and I to move because people were waiting to sit. There was no line. There was no wait. There were tables in the back.

I am not one to lie and I'll admit I love this place. Whenever I am in New York I make an effort to stop by. The last time I was there I met up with a college friend and luckily we got the last remaining table near the door (a bit of a draft but bearable since it was sunny out) only to watch a dozen people trail in only half an hour later. The place is understaffed as one waitress was attending to all the tables in the restaurant but the food more than makes up for the lack of service. I ordered the Cuban style roast pork dish and shared the famous corn (both spectacular!). I also ordered the Mexican hot chocolate which was divine and the perfect touch to my meal. The portions are very generous (you will not go home hungry) and the prices are very decent. I have tried various Cuban restaurants (ranging in price range) and this one hits the spot. This is a very popular local hangout and IF you get lucky you may even spot some celebrities dine here including Rachel Bilson!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Coming from one of the pickiest eater on the planet: When I first saw the menu for this place I had a mini-anxiety attack. Nothing looks normal about the ingredients on this menu, and nothing really sounded all THAT appetizing either. But, to my surprise (but not really, because I read yelp reviews) everything we tried was great! Here's what we had: E666s with bacon and culantro - i don't even eat devilied eggs at all and these were really good! Of course everything is better deep fried but there was no rotten egg smell or taste, the filling had a little kick and the outside was nice and crispy fried. Definitely a nice starter. Total of 2 eggs, each split in half. FAWN-TONS - I really wasn't so sure about how I would like venison but these were pretty much perfect. The outside was a crispy wonton and inside had very flavorful, non-gamey, taste with a hint of horseradish on top. Chicken & Woffals - the waitress started to tell us about the dish and mentioned chicken liver and I kindly asked her to stop right there - I don't want to know - just let me taste it. The waffle was awesome, crispy on the outside, very sweet. The chicken was a cornish hen and was broiled I think? Not fried. A little too much bone for me but still great. Flank - Kind of an average steak dish, served sliced and med-rare. SHOTS!! Get the spherical0-back!! A weird gusher-ey like chaser after a shot of their fine tequila. Kind of like an explosion in your mouth. Dessert - not much to choose from but why do you need anything other than an ice cream snickers bar? You don't. Staff - I can't say enough good thinks about Justin and Luke (partners and owners), they treated us like family and have some awesome ideas for the future. Can't wait to see what happens with this place - big things ahead.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been coming to this place for the past few months now and have NEVER had a single bad crumb of thing to eat here, and the people who work here are nothing short of fantastic. I literally just made a yelp account to share my love for Black Tree. Besides the incredible food here, which I could go on and on for days about, I'm posting specifically for a woman named Darra and how she is so important and valuable to the Black Tree establishment. My friends and I just had dinner there no less than an hour ago and we had an AMAZING and WONDERFUL time and it was unarguably because of Darra and her friendliness and efficency. She was the best waitress/hostess/person to spend our dinner with and I could not say nicer words about her. NO we are not staff, NO we are not trust fund babies (I will show you my bank account I swear), NO we are not just friends of the people that work there...we are genuine people who live in this city and love amazing food and amazing people and that is what Black Tree has to offer you. SERIOUSLY this is one of if not my absolute favorite restaurant in this city and I seriously highly encourage anyone who enjoys putting food in their mouth and chewing it and eating it to come to Black Tree as often as they are able to.

Great restaurant.  Very attentive and professional staff.   Always there but never hovering or rushing us.  We had a party of eight and a reservation on a Saturday night for 6 pm.  They immediately asked us if we were going to see a show (which we were) and made sure we were out by 7:40.   Food was excellent and pricing is average for New York.   Atmosphere is nice and noise level was great.  We all sat on a  round table but could easily talk to each other without raised voices.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is not going to be an essay because anything I write won't do the meal justice. You simply have to pray that you can get a reservation so that you can experience the genius of Chef Ramirez. Getting reservations here are very difficult and we were only able to get in by the grace of my friend's AMEX concierge service. The meal was roughly 21 courses and featured an array of exotic fish served sashimi style with garnishing and various sauces. You will definitely eat something new when you visit, because it's unlikely that you've seen these fish on some other menu. We had some red trumpet fish and a deep sea fish to name a couple. What's awesome about this restaurant is that Chef Ramirez still cooks and is there every day. We were told that he wants to be there every day and isn't planning on going anywhere else. In some sense, he's like a modern day Jiro, except his cuisine is quite different. I think Chef's Table is probably one of the best, if not the best tasting menu in NYC at the moment. The service is top notch; Chef Ramirez even buses some dishes when he has some down time. Now where else would you see a 3-michelin star chef busing your dishes? Unheard of. I found it pretty cool because it just shows how down to earth Chef Ramirez is despite his notoriety and success. For an tasting menu unlike any other, visit Chef's Table and prepared to be amazed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I used to love this place madly.  I went there once a week before everyone discovered it.

"This is the real deal. After a night that probably raised our BAC to .29, we knew what we needed....  We had heard about this majestic place ever since we landed in NYC... ""Bro you gotta get the chicken and rice... it will blow your mind..""  It was time.. and yes.... my mind was BLOWN. The Famous Halal Guys are the ones that bring you such deliciousness on 53rd and 6th.  Stay away from the imposters that look just like them aka New York's Best Halal Food.  Both have similar yellow shirts and logos... but you can easily spot the difference.  The Famous Halal Guys have yellow to-go  bags, the imposters have white.  The Famous Halal Guys also brand their shirts with ""We are different"".  We got there around 2:12 a.m. and got in line.  It would be around a 25 minute wait, but we didn't care... One whiff of the aroma coming from the cart and you're sold.  Ordering is easy, you tell them what you want (which would be a combination aka chicken and gyro over rice), give them the cash, and 9 seconds later there's your food.  Located near the side of the cart is the famous white sauce and hot sauce.  Load up on the white sauce.... it's amazing.  Be careful with the hot sauce thought, since it's extremely spicy.  Mix everything up and enjoy.... This will be the best meal of your life.  For 6 dollars and more than a pound of food.... this is one of NYC's biggest steals. I went two straight nights to get their combination.  Only reason it wasn't 3 nights is because my plane left the next day.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The ramen here was delicious.  I was able to try the totto miso ramen (a go-to broth for me) and my friend's totto spicy ramen (chicken broth with spicy sesame oil).  The miso totto ramen included a scoop of ground pork, a few slices of char siu pork, scallions, bean sprouts, and onions.  The ground pork was a little salty for my taste, but the char siu was delicious.  It was very fatty, but the fat made it so tender and rich.  The broth was possibly the best part of my ramen.  It wasn't too salty, and supposedly made sans MSG- a healthy addition to this very unhealthy meal. As for the totto spicy ramen... it was quite delicious, just a bit too spicy for me.  My nose started running a bit, and I stopped being able to taste the broth for anything other than just spice.  It was also plainer than my miso bowl.  There was an omission of the ground pork and the egg, though I would have missed neither. We also tried the char siu onigiri, which was the appetizer special.  Not really worth mentioning.  Maybe the ramen was just too good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They should make me want to salivate my way to Brooklyn just to sample their yumminess... and they don't. The chicken is dry, the sides are not good... like I didn't even finish my mac and cheese, and I LOVE mac and cheese.

"Came in here for brunch this Sunday with my girlfriend. (Just FYI we both work in great restaurants here in NYC). Looks like a nice place, cozy vibe, tasty looking menu. Unfortunately the food was awful. Not just mediocre, but bad. My girlfriend ordered the ""special"" which was an omelette with sweet potatoes. The omelette looked and tasted worse then any McDonald egg would probably taste. The ""salad"" that came as her side was nothing more then lettuce placed on the dish. No dressing, no mixed greens, no vegetables, tomatoes, no nothing. I ordered the Chill-A-Chicken. Better then the omelette but still very boring. Definitely not worth 12 bucks. Maybe 5. I was excited for this place, now I have no interest of ever coming back or recommending it. It's really disappointing when this happens because I hate wasting money and giving bad reviews.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Another place that I find to be over-hyped. I have eaten at numerous Japanese and ramen restaurants and I really do not understand the hype. The ramen are ordinary. The food are nothing special. Its ok and edible, not bad or good. The one of the reasons for the one star is the extremely long wait. I got there at 4:50pm when the store was suppose to open at 5pm and waited until 5:50pm to be seated. Another reason is that this place is not the cleanest and got a ""C"" health rating. But the main reason for the one star is the below par service. Our waited on 2/12/2012 Sunday at 5:50pm was this Asian guy with long bleached and wavy hair who did not attend to our table well so we gave him a $7 tip for a $65 bill. He had the nerve to come back and say ""$7 is not enough, you need to give at least 15%"". First of all tips are called tips because they are based on the service and it is NOT something you have to give. If you feel like tip should be enforced, then just increase the price of your menu and give the waiters an extra pay. *(FYI for everyone, even if a place charges you an automatic 15% or whatever tip, you are NOT required by law to pay for it. It's still optional, hence the word ""tip"")* Second his service was below par. I could honestly care less about paying an extra $5 but it's the principle. I just hate it when places feel that tip is something that they deserve and not something they earned. So if you are a worker there reading this, please let this guy know what he did was not right. And if he wants to earn the ""15%"" then easy, give better service. But to all those that have to go here and wait in line for 1-2 hours, then DO NOT get the pork chunks or Niku ramen, its gross and full of fat. Just get the spicy ramen and the pork don. Go with 1-2 people, you are seated A LOT faster than 3-4 because there are only 2 tables seating 3-4 people. This place is cash only. Overall DO NOT come here and wait in-line for ramen that taste just the same as anywhere else. But if you have to come here, then you will see why I posted this.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There is nothing that will make you ""WOW"" about.  If you want something plain and boring this is a place to go. The service is NOT so great. They seated us and never gave us bread until we requested for it! After we go the bread it was just plain dry bread with nothing to dip. So we had to request again for the dippings. This happened both times I went! The place is tight. You can hear the other tables convo very clearly! The third time I attempt to go I had a drink with me. (I was with a friend who likes some of the dishes they had there. So I was dragged along.) They would not seat me until I dump my drink out! Its not like iam not going to order YOUR food.

"Williamsburger is a pricey burger joint located in a remote part of Queens/Brooklyn 10 minute walk south from the subway stop.  The burgers run from $12 to $15, delicious but rather overpriced for the quaint size and limited fries that are included in the meal (sweet potato fries $1.50 extra).  When I spend $12 on a burger I want it to be larger than my face.   This is not the place to annihilate a burger with bare hands instead to enjoy a fine burger with silverware.  The burger consisted of a toasted bun, mild pink (medium-rare) patty, slice of lettuce, circular purple onions, and dill pickles.  The flavor was quite juicy, however I noticed an unusual amount of oil dripping from the back of the burger that soaked into the bun and made it soggy. The item to rave here about isn't the burger, but it's the milkshake- Salted Caramel Milkshake.  I tried it influenced by the positive tips and found it to be unbelievable, worth ordering in place of the burger. I planned to take a lactose pill to eat only a 1/4 of the shake, but ended up consuming the whole thing and ran home and popped another pill. Salted Caramel Milkshake.  Do it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I couldn't really give it 5 stars for the waits on how crowded it gets in the restaurant, and the food to be honest was only decent I thought but I don't know how they can stay in business with these kind of prices. I suppose that's the magic of Chinatown... Best come with a small group and just get it to go and eat as you walk. I've never seen seats free up inside the establishment.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After having spent 6 weeks in Brooklyn, eating sushi essentially on a nightly basis, I died from mercury poisoning. But before that happened, this restaurant proved to be the best sushi restaurant in Brooklyn. Even something as simple as the miso soup is just better.

"The Halal Guys can be considered part of the NY experience. Long lines at almost all times of the day - but they move through it rather quickly. As someone passing by observed, they're definitely raking it in. The hot sauce is pretty hot, so take it easy on that. The white sauce is pretty good though, so make sure you try some. Chicken was dry and the rice was acceptable. White sauce helps fluff it up but nothing to write home about. Would I go there again? Probably not. For the price ($6), there are definitely better offerings throughout the city. Can't justify paying for some dry slightly stringy chicken and rice - the pita is a solid touch though.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here on a Thursday night around 7:30 and didn't have to wait (2 people), but the place was pretty packed. Service was quick and the waiter was very attentive and friendly. Ordered the small calamari and fried tiger shrimp rolls to start off. The calamari was HUGE in portion size, so I would assume the larger option is meant for a party of 4 or more. For two people, we couldn't finish it, but it was tasty (not over fried where you can't taste/feel the chewiness of the calamari). The fried tiger shrimp rolls came in 6 rolls, pretty good and I loved the dipping sauce it came with (used it for the calamari instead too). For the entree, I had the spicy noodles which wasn't overly spicy, but a tad on the bland side. My friend ordered the pad see yue, which I tried and absolutely LOVED (super flavorful)!! Think for a party of 2, this was too much food cause we couldn't finish our entrees either (haha!). Drink wise, the beers are around $4-5 and wine is around $7-8 or $23/bottle (didn't order a cocktail, but they have a full bar). Pretty cheap and does the job. Song felt like a date night kinda place, dim lighting and great atmosphere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In my humble opinion, this is one of the best Italian restaurants around. If you've got out of town guests, are looking for a great date spot, or looking for a place to hang out with family and friends, you can't go wrong with this place. The lighting and decor is comfortable and attractive. The wine list is extensive and the service is good. The best part of the experience is the quality food and the reasonable prices.  There's the standard Italian selection of meats and cheeses but the standout is the gnocchi di ricotta (and it's a tough sell to get me to order pasta!).The smell is enough to make you hungry. Even more, the flavors of ricotta, black truffle and chive, nice & warm, illustrate the very definition of comfort food. The flavors are delicious! Also amazing are the bigoletti di barbabietole (beet gnocchi), as well as the artichoke panzotti. The desserts are equally delectable, especially the girella al ciocolatto, essentially sponge cake with tons of nutella and a scoop of ice cream. The dish is a worthwhile treat. But,  seriously, it should be hard to screw up a dish made with nutella. As a better test, Uva does a fine job with tiramisu, an Italian classic that's too often screwed up in restaurants. As a tip, it can be hard to get in if you don't time things right. There are no reservations, unless it's a group of something like 4-5 or more, and even then there are only reservations for something like groups of 8 or more after 8PM. Even still, I've never had much of a problem getting in. Even if I did, the wait is surely worth it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long long time. Outstanding service- this restaurant values the fact that you've chosen them in an area with a lot of dining options and they let you know it. I appreciated the sommelier who didn't bat an eye when I said we didn't want to spend a fortune on  wine and pointed us to a lovely 48$ bottle of chardonnay (even though the bulk of the wines were over 60). In fact, all of the staff were really good- very professional, but genuine and friendly. The food was delicious.  I had skate and am still thinking about how well it was cooked (and how do they make roasted cauliflower so delicious?). The restaurant has a wood-burning oven, so we shared a margherita pizza to start. My friends ordered desserts and I tried and enjoyed both. I don't think we sent a crumb of food back to the kitchen in any of our courses. The space is fantastic- soaring ceilings, tarnished woods & brick contrasted with the giant wall of wine separating the Tap room from the main dining room. I will definitely go back again when I'm next in NYC. I'd like to try the tasting menu in the dining room too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Everything and then some. I've been here for dinner twice and brunch once and am glad that I didn't find this place earlier or else I would be 20 pounds heavier! The only draw back is if you are not 100% hungry then you won't be able to fully enjoy yourself! The apps are amazing and could be a meal themselves. So far I;ve had the frid green tomatos with the best sauce ever - lemon pepper ranch!!! Then atomic fireballs of mac n cheese??? disco tots with cheddar and gravy - all amazing! However the best thing I've had the pleasure of eating here is the biscuits and maple sausage cheddar gravy for brunch. I dipped the tots in the left over gravy and at the end of the day there was nothing left on the plate. Also BYOB helps keep the bill down - and they are more than accommodating with extra glasses and cheap but delicious mixers - $7 carafe of OJ. The service is amazing as well - happy people who are in no rush at all. When I say no rush, it is not that they aren't attentive just that it is a laid back place. Even if there is a line out the door they don't shoe you along but rather let you ease into the meal and fully enjoy yourself! Enjoy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"AMAZING !! I went here finally last night for a friend's birthday dinner and wow...The food really IS incredible. I had the ravioli with spinach, ricotta and mascarpone cheese. Perfect! The tomato sauce, although I got it ALL over my vest (don't ask) was amazing. Many Italian places overdue it with the garlic (I hate garlic) and onions but no, this sauce was truly one of the best I have had...ever. Maybe second place to my Grandmother's. I sampled my friend's chicken marasala (yum), another's mezza luna dish (Ravioli stuffed with mascarpone & pesto in a sauce made of asparagus, brandy and walnuts) and...I don't even LIKE pesto and I thought this was delicious as well. The service was exceptional. Very friendly and attentive wait staff. Your glasses are constantly refilled and replaced (we ordered bottles of wine), etc. Since it was my friend's birthday they gave us a free bottle of wine and free champagne at the end of the dinner. Now Dessert--I am a Tiramisu freak and very picky about it--and their's was very good. They also have a wine bar which is very nice (I actually like the ambiance/lighting better in there) which offers drinks, and some appetizers. I expected the bill to be much more than it was. We got wine, apps, desserts, etc and it came to around $45 a person. Not bad at all. So, yes, for sure I will be back as this is one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. EDIT: Forgot to mention...even the flatbreads with the sun-dried tomato paste they serve to you were tasty!... As you can see...I am obsessed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is great! When I walked in I was greeted by the super friendly and sweet hostess. I love when the hostess of a restaurant is nice because it makes me feel welcomed. She was a doll and she took my walk-in reservation and said that they will do the best to accommodate us as the restaurant is packed. As soon as my entire party of 5 arrived we were seated within 5 minutes. The general ambiance of the place itself will bring me back here. It reminded me of an old french wine bar meets rustic cabin. The walls were made of brick and they had delicate chandlers hanging from the ceiling which created for a very welcoming vibe. Now, on to the food --- UNBELIEVABLE! We ordered the sheep's ricotta cheese and black truffle honey bruschette which was amazing. It was a bit small, but the taste of the dish was yummmm. Their cured meat platter was very good too, so I recommend that. My friends tried their polenta dish and they enjoyed that also. For mains, two of us ordered the gnocchi di ricotta which was by far one of the best pasta dishes ive ever had. The gnocchi wasnt very heavy which i loved. It came in this divine black truffle sauce which i couldnt get enough off. Ahh just thinking about it makes me want it right now! Previous reviewers all raved about this dish, so we had to try it. We weren't sorry at all! I never finish an entire pasta dish but i managed to house the entire thing (and the serving size was quite big too). My friends ordered the penne gratinate (a baked pasta dish with red sauce. So good and very fresh tasting), melanzane alla parmigiana (essentially an eggplant parm. I didnt try this but he loved it), and petto d'anatra (their duck dish which was awesome). Their wine menu was extensive and diverse which we loved. I want to go back to try other wines that they have. All in all, this restaurant is very highly recommended. We mainly saw groups of friends there, so its a great social spot. But, i would come back with my husband for a great, fun meal too!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Hubby and I went here for our anniversary dinner. Wish we had gone somewhere else. The place is very modern looking, service was OK, butt he food was such a disappointment. I had the prix fix. The cesar salad was OK. Nothing to write home about. For starters, hubby had the wings, which were the best part of the meal. For dinner, I had the skirt steak. It was tough and lacked flavor. It was also a bit too cooked for my taste ( I ordered med-rare).  The collard greens which accompanied the steak were inedible and the roasted potatoes were not cooked enough. Hubby ordered the Red Velvet waffle and chicken.  He had been DREAMING about it for days! He was let down. The two little pieces of chicken had a soggy coating and barely any meat. The waffle was also soggy.   Dessert was a let-down. They were out of the peach cobbler we were dying to try, so we had the bread pudding that came with my prix-fix. It was meh.

"well. i don't know what else to say so i'll say it again. well. there have been over a hundred reviews by people extremely excited about this cart. to me it sounds more like a cult than an eating experience. on second thought, it sounds EXACTLY like a cult, in that the story is not the cart, it's the belief in the cart. and so the tale begins... i went there the other night for the first time. i've been eating cart food, ""street chicken,"" for more than 10 years. occasionally i've hit a bad spot with greasy runnyfat chicken, wilted lettuce, tomatoes less than red and so on. but for the most part, no matter the neighborhood, it's always been easy to find really good carts. except around wall st, apparently, it's not that hard. there was one on 5th avenue and 20th street, one at park avenue and 53rd street, one on 55th street at 6th avenue where i ate for years and loved it. etc. etc. when i joined yelp i started reading about the ""famous"" cart at 53rd and 6th, only at night, lines as long as the great wazoo, drunk parties and food orgasms at 3am, i figured, ok, next time i'm in midtown in the middle of the night (why, i asked myself, would i ever be in midtown at that hour?), i'll check it out. might even make a special occasion out of it -- once it warms up, of course. i mean, who in their right mind would ever stand on line in the freezing cold at 3am for cart food? not a new yorker, that's for sure. ok, it finally happened two days ago. first, there are actually TWO carts there on 53rd street, one on either side of 6th avenue. i must have walked back and forth across the avenue three times checking out the grills and the sauces, sizing up the guys, trying to determine which was the ""famous"" one and which was the pretender, because i really didn't want to blow it. but i couldn't figure it out -- they looked about the same. i chose the one on the east side, guessing the one nearer to moma was ""the one,"" and asked the guy, ""are you those famous guys?"" and he said ""yes."" so i said, ""what about that one over there?"" and he said, ""the same, the same, same thing."" so it looks like because of the yelp thing, we have a little franchise going. i got chicken on pita, white sauce, red sauce, paid the $4 and ran it home. set it up on the table with the requisite thousand napkins because i don't know how anybody else does it, but with me it drips all over your hands and down your sleeve so i'm eating and wiping and eating and wiping, trying not to spill it on my clothes or the floor. anyhow, i devoured it because it was good. in fact, it tasted just like.....cart food. honestly, by the time i was done, which took about two minutes, i had completely forgotten that it came from the ""famous"" 53rd street halal cart. it was just cart food, it was good, i ate it, and it wasn't until an hour later that i suddenly remembered, hey, that was from the famous 53rd street cart. i wondered how that very important fact could have slipped my mind, and realized it was because it tasted pretty much like every other good cart food i've ever had, which is not a bad thing. in fact, it's a good thing. it's just not an unbelievably great thing. thus the cult concept. it's a scene, a thing to get excited about. we need things to get excited about. just like we need a constant cultural scapegoat and a constant celebrity crash and burn and a constant war. the faces change but the words never change. halal 53 is cart food for people who don't eat cart food, cart food for people who are maybe afraid of cart food, afraid of rats, poison, rancidity, hepatitis, gangrene, rot, who knows. i don't, i'm just speculating...and rambling... right. this is one helluva long review for a two minute meal forgotten as soon as it's over. but before i go, i should mention that there is a fair amount of cayenne in the red sauce so it can be pretty hot by new york standards. then again, the same can be said of every other cart food i've ever had. regardless, californians, koreans and hunan lovers should have no problem. so if it's 3am and freezing and you're drunk and starving and in midtown and the line is all the way up to the sky, take my advice and find another cart. pretty much any one will do.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am not surprised that I loved this restaurant. The hundreds of reviews and several walk-bys forced me to finally try Extra Virgin for dinner. There are several seats available on the front porch. The restaurant is pretty open, which is key for a nice evening.  Tightly packed west village atmosphere. Tips: Go there early, they only take reservations for 6 or more. We showed up at 6:30 and were seated right away (4 of us). What we ate -Entrees: Lemon Crusted Chilean Seabass fennel potato puree, crispy artichokes, salsa verde, avocado puree  - - loads of flavor and probably the best seabass I have ever experienced! On the smaller side... Prosciutto Wrapped Roasted Loin Of Pork crispy parmesan potato croquette, broccolini, roasted garlic - - extremely flavorful and amazing! Rigatoni Bolognese classic meat sauce, fresh ricotta, shaved parmesan - - average, nothing special. Aged New York Strip roasted rosemary fingerlings, lemon grilled asparagus - - your typical strip steak. The rosemary fingerlings made it even more delicious! What we ate - Apps: Truffle Mac And Cheese Tart  & Sauteed Spinach With Garlic - - if you are a truffle fan, you will know that anything with truffle oil is to die for. This mac is key and you must get it if you dine here!! Several menu items are made with truffle oil. Drinks: The cocktails were great. The extra virgin and the watermelon martini definitely contained the most alcohol of the drinks we drank. Bottom-line: I will be back. I can't wait to come experience brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They don't take reservations but the wait wasn't too long on a weekday (I came at about 1:15pm and was seated by 1:30).  I had the Souper Sandwich so I selected the meatball sandwich and the chicken noodle soup.  Comfort food for a chilly day.  Unlike other meatball sandwiches which oozes of sauce and gets all messy, this was a bit on the drier end.  Still good but I wish there was a tad more pesto mayo for some added flavour.  It was tasty though.  The meatballs were moist.  The soup was nothing spectacular - what you'd expect from a chicken noodle soup.

"Don't tell your mother, but this stuffed cabbage is better than hers. I regret I passed by this establishment on previous Greenpoint food forays. The interior is cozy and welcoming, the prices low (cash only) and the food defines savory. You start with a complimentary plate of salads: cole slaw, red cabbage, sweet carrot salad, a bit of lettuce with salad cream. It's not listed that way on the menu, but you can get a plate of mixed pierogi, potato/cheese,. sauerkraut mushroom, and meat. They are perfectly fried and the onions are sweet. The stuffed cabbage has a bit more flavor going on than most, and is meltingly delicious. A schnitzel is crisp and tender, topped with an egg, accompanied by perfectly cooked potatoes. Fresh dill. No room for dessert, not a chance. About the only criticism is that the pierogi arrived as a side dish, not an appetizer, but than may be because the salads arrive first.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They ran out of boxes, it was only 1:00pm ! I purchased about 1 lb and had the chocolates placed in 2 bags. Thankfully it wasn't too hot outside and I didn't have to worry about melting sweets. Little did I know, there was NO WAY my purchase would have melted !  Why??? Because they were STALE and DRY ! These chocolates make GODIVA boxed chocolates seem FRESH ! And we all know GODIVA is overly processed and has a long shelf life, unless you buy them from Europe - GODIVA from Europe is heavenly ! Eataly will have to make MANY changes to this counter's product, packaging and presentations. I rank this 0 stars but the system forces me to give at least 1 star.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Am obsessed with this place and always slip it in as a suggestion for dinner even though there are a gazillion other dining options in NYC. It's nearly impossible to get reservations less than a week out as they only take 6p reservations and the rest are walk-in (1 hr+ wait) so I've only been 3 times but if it were easier to get in I'd go once a week. Ambience and service is impeccable and every dish looks like a work of art. My problem is that I can't seem to order anything other than the Kasaan Ni even though I'd like to try other dishes b/c it's so dang good and I don't want to have order remorse. I've tried some bites of their other dishes that friends ordered and everything tastes so good. But nothing beats the Kasaan Ni with its gorgeous presentation of side dishes and super tender, flavorful chicken. The dish is huge so it's probably best to share b/t 2 people (or even 3) but I usually order my own :). Some day I'll go back and try something else on the menu (maybe).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"IF YOU'RE NOT ASIAN, DO NOT EAT HERE! DON'T LIKE ANYONE OF DARK DESCENT! While visiting NYC, My mother and I went there to eat because we liked the menu and plus the rating was an A... WORST MISTAKE EVER!!! We entered, the waiter walked us over to these great seats and we placed our order... Well, I was warned about the NYC Asian community being very biased towards other minorities, but I didn't believe it because I love the Asian culture and being from Canada, our Asian communities are AMAZING! I was wrong. We placed our order,  and was given no cutlery, or plates. I had to ask the four different waiters five times before we received anything.  All the waiters spoke English perfectly, I just know that my mother and I were not welcomed. We had ordered, was the vegetable dumplings and the Seafood delight (was told it feeds 2 people), ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!  No flavour and tasted very stale. The seafood tasted bad. The portion was so small, because it was served in a serviette plate. I had to ask two more waiters for a small bowl of rice... As my mother and I sat waiting for food, what was upsetting was to watching customers walk in and being served before us....Also, what was the end straw was to seat a woman sitting a table beside ours. Her and her date ordered the same thing and was served properly... The woman was not Asian, but Caucasian with her Caucasian boyfriend. Our snack and it was a snack came up to 28.75 with taxes. Our portions was so small that the woman sitting beside us comment to her boyfriend, she saw what we were served and was shocked. My mother and I should had walked out... At the end, I had asked 4 waiters to get the check. I didn't wanted to tip our waiter, but I did because I'm Canadian, it's in my nature to still be kind to ignorant people. Will I ever eat here again, HELL NO! Because we were still hungry, we went to the Chinese Bakery (on the same street) called Fae... We should had went there for dinner.

"The only reason this place is not getting 5 stars from me is the horrendous noise level in the dining room and bar area.  So far I have been able to sit at an outdoor table (the street is fairly quiet) to avoid the noise.  My dining partners and I agreed it would be a great warm weather place to dine--but not winter, when we would be forced indoors. Now--on to the FOOD.  Complex, creative, consistent.  Example: Perfectly seared scallops, served on a bed of corn risotto, flavored with chorizo, chipotle flakes and sorrel.  A combination I would have never imagined, yet delicious.  A flavor I will crave at odd moments, I'm sure. I was also fortunate enough to try the carrot/ginger/lime soup--jazzed up with a little kick of heat (could it be wasabi?)  Fantastic.  I'm not usually a sweet soup fan. At my first visit, the server recommended a Spanish red ($16 for the glass, and I'm hunting for a place to purchase it by bottle now...it's my new favorite.) Meals are accompanied by a crazy delicious bread--a fresh-from-the oven brioche-y roll, topped with a crunch of sea salt, and served with carmelized onion whipped butter.  Melts in your mouth. I'm looking forward to trying more from the seemingly modest, but endlessly impressive menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I stopped in with a friend for the oyster happy hour, then the rain started, so we decided to stay for dinner. I'm very glad we did. We sat at the bar and began with the octopus appetizer, very tender and an unusual preparation with chickpeas, nuts and basil, definitely a must. Pate with pickled radishes were also a nice surprise, I think it was the bread that did it. It had that slightly sweet and nuttiness that complimented it so well. My friend then had the Thai mussels, generous portion, dipping the bread in the broth was addictive, he couldn't stop. I had the market fish with greens in a bacon broth, it disappeared in front of me. Could be because I'm a little bit of a bacon addict. I also tried the bacon infused bourbon cocktail, I will stop by for more of those in the next few days. I sincerely recommend this place to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a great meal without breaking the bank. It was very reasonable. Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. It was a terrific evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Best pizza in New York.  Great ambiance and super friendly staff.  Paulie likes to walk around and see how everyone is doing, which is great. [EDIT] OK, been back here like 5 times since my last review and all I can say is that this place continues to rock.  If I lived next to there I'd probably hit it every day.  But now that winter is company I'm probably not getting on the G Train as much so my beautiful Paulie Gee's will have to wait until Spring.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Love the ambiance Hillstone creates, it's not too stuffy nor too casual. The live Jazz band, by the bar, adds a great touch to the overall dining experience. They don't offer complimentary bread but their Foccacia priced at $2 is a worthy appetizer. I had the Osaka style tuna roll; it was beautifully presented and equally tasty. However, it's hardly satisfying as there were only 5 pieces on my plate. I had to eat some of my bf's entree (ribs) to get full. Speaking of which, his ribs were very tender and the shoestring fries did not make the meal seem too heavy and dense. We will definitely frequent this place more often especially since it's located conveniently near my bf's apartment.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We'd called ahead to ask them to hold the table but they gave it away and didn't really care (""well, you could go to Ella down the street""...).  More galling was that another group also arrived late and they got given their table, despite not calling ahead.

"Yes, it's a novel experience and it will feel like a lot of fun. While it's definitely worth a visit, I personally wouldn't eat/shop here frequently. For one thing, I noticed that a lot of the items here can be found at the local supermarkets for half the price. I think it's the draw of the ""Italian"" packaging that gets most people. The layout of the place is chaotic, but it's definitely fun to walk around and see everything. I wouldn't mind getting some wine + cheese here occasionally, or stopping by for a gelato. It's a fun experience nonetheless, but in terms of value I would say the bulk of what your paying is for the place and not for the food.

"Positives: Fantastic pizza made in a true wood burning stove, fresh ingredients, super-delicious and salt-balanced cheese, laid-back vibe, great music, communal tables, old-school pizza place that reminds me of New Park in Howard Beach and others out on the island. Negative: Spaced out waitress with way-too-blonde-hair and thick rimmed black glasses practically ignored us, didn't tell us about the specials, nor did she ask us if we wanted to hear them, and then proceeded to give the specials to the couple next to us. Aside from this, she took about 15 minutes to bring me a bottled soda because she was too busy flirting with the two dudes at the end of the bar. Another waitress noticed that we were being ignored and asked us if we needed anything, cleared our dishes, and brought us our check without us having to ask (she also noticed that we sat for about 15 minutes and tried to get blondie's attention.) Overall, the pizza was good. Our service was the worst--even in all of Wburg and Bushwick where it matters if you're a regular...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Update 12/3/2014: The general manager got in touch with me after his holiday and settled the dispute in a professional and courteous manner. Turns out the issue was due to a change of waiters during the night. So other than the service on the night, everything else was pretty good. Hopefully our next visit turns out better. 11/29/2014: THE WAITER THREW AWAY MY FOOD. Let me start with saying that the food here is incredible.  Possibly one of the most perfectly seasoned Cote de Boeuf's I had. The wine list left a good impression even though we didn't find the bottle we were looking for, in general the drinks were pretty good. The interior is old school New York at its best but to some people it may seem dated. The service is horrible. There is no other way of putting it. Some of the waitresses seemed nice, but we received horrible lazy amateur service undeserving of such an establishment. They were unprofessional and incredibly disrespectful, one of the waitresses was incredibly rude to one of my friends the entire night, knocking her bag on purpose and snatching her menu out of her hand. It took us at least 30 minutes to get our order down and our service was slap dash at best,  At first I didn't care about it at all, service usually doesn't matter to me as much as the food. But later in the night, I asked the waiter to wrap up our Cote de Boeuf's, as we had only eaten about 20 percent of it and wanted it later. He took the plate but never gave me the box. I had to ask for it on our way out, so he gave it to me. By the time I got home, I discovered that he, for whatever ludicrous reason, had only packed the side of potatoes from my friends Fillet Mignon, leaving my 80% of Cote De Boeuf in a Minetta Lane dumpster somewhere. Only go to this restaurant if you don't mind being served by amateur ex-Chipotle employees in lieu of waiters. The service and atmosphere at the original Wolfgang's is infinitely better, go there if you don't want to be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is fantastic - small, legitimate gem - it is absolute top quality food, simple Italian ingredients all mixed just the right way.  It is still undiscovered, but I won't be surprised if there are soon lines out the door for these paninis.  They are truly that good.... easily could become another Torrisi, etc.  I can't believe how good the food is and can't wait to go back!  (One panini is easily 2 meals - saved half for dinner every time).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been looking forward to trying the Spotted Pig for years. Alas! I got to try your raved about menu and location, April Bloomfield! I am a very patient woman. Sadly, no celebrity spotting at this evening but their delicious apps and entrees made up for any sorrow for not seeing Beyonce and Jay-Z. The ambience was fun and kitschy: pigs lining the top windows, pigs hanging from the ceilings, pig made out of twine outside the restaurant. Our friend loved the pig theme. For starters, we ordered the deviled egg (flavorful, fresh, serves 2), devils on horseback (dates, bacon and hint of spiciness), and chicken liver toast (amazingly moist due to liver mixed with olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt: delicious but not very photogenic). For entrees: sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto (the buttery basil pesto was amazing!), their famous burger with Roquefort Cheese and shoestring fries. I must stop and say the burger is perfect if you split it with 3 other people. Its a great taste with the strong pungent cheese, medium rare juicy beef, very nice. If I were to eat the whole burger, I would not have the same review. And those fries! We could not get enough of them! They had slivers of garlic crisps and rosemary mixed with the fries. My new favorite fries! So aromatic! We just smelled fried rosemary and rosemary all night long. Loved it! (Also we were seated next to a rosemary plant). Last entree: Pig cheek sausage with fried pig ears. Loved the crispy salty fatty cartilage of the pig ears. The pigs cheek was perfectly done, falling apart into the rich savory salty sauce. Then, us pigs, ordered the rhubarb pie and lemon lime pie tarts. Loved the lemon lime tart, sweet and sour it was a perfect ending to a rich meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

A recent vegetarian wager left me forlorn thinking I wouldn't have them again, but then I discovered their steamed vegetarian dumplings.  They don't have the same fried sensation of a coronary, but they are just as tasty.

Although in mentioning this to my worthless geeky date about me needing to be in protective gear and a bubble would be perfect fit, he immediately shot down my idea and mentioned how ridiculous the idea was. True it is a silly idea, however not as silly as his. With a true serious face turned on he presents a magnetic forcefield. Ummmm yah ... I don't think that will work so well. While seafood does have some mercury I don't think it's enough to repel seafood juice, and shells. I am virtually embarrass to be with him on a date. Not to mention I am about 2inches taller than this guy in my flats. Never again will I be set up on a blind date. Beer and seafood prepared in the best ways. Raw, steamed, or broiled.

Good planning - we got a table right away. However, what was that when a friend wanted to join us about 20 minutes later, they said the kitchen was closing. Why? There were not enough people there! We were definitely not the only ones! I understand that they are used to a certain volume of customers, but that doesn't mean they should shit on everyone just because the night was not their most successful ever. They ruined what could have been a really nice dinner without like 12 people bumping your elbows. Other than that, the brussel sprouts were savory and delicious, as was the ramen. I had the veggie option. Mmmm salt!

"Came here on a friend's recommendation and have to say it was a pleasant experience. It was fairly empty on a Friday night (although it did fill up a bit more as the evening went on). We sat in the small patio area outside and enjoyed some mussels and Belgian fries. This in itself was more than enough food for 2, espcially with the bread to dip. I tend to like quieter and not-packed places these days so this was perfect. If you're the type to peak into a restaurant and get turned off by a place only half full, then come back during brunch hours. I dont think it gets as full in the evenings.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've visited New York City many times and have never bought food from a cart. After hearing how amazing the chicken and rice was from my cousin, we stopped here as part of our food trip. The chicken and rice with the white sauce was so delicious! The portions are huge for $6, and we split the platter among 4 of us. The Halal guys are super nice and we waited in line for only about 10 minutes (granted, it was a Tuesday night at about 10pm). There are about 4 carts that say they are the 'original' Halal guys on the same block, so I'm not sure which one is the real one, but I was quite satisfied!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had very high hopes for this place when it first opened: The pot stickers and soup dumplings were delicious, and other food tasted authentic, was interesting, and had the wok hay you look for. I thought I would be having many happy meals there. But lately the food has been inconsistent. The Ma Po Tofu is different every time we order it. Today it was especially garlicky. The chili chicken which was mouth watering the first couple of times I had it was too greasy today. A noodle soup my wife had enjoyed before left her cold. We're probably not going to be going back much.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tucked on a quiet block in the East Village sits a tiny cash-only ramen shrine. That about sums up most of the reviews of Minca. You're there for ramen. And a beer. I really liked the spicy miso ramen with thick noodles. Mushrooms, corn kernels, seaweed, onions swim with those springy noodles in a thick broth that, in the end, doesn't have much heat. What did it for me was the pork slices. If all pork tasted like that, with that meltaway texture, I'd eat it much more often. This pork didn't let me down. Prices are on the higher side ($13 for the  spicy miso at time of review) for what really boils down to a large, but good, bowl of soup. 3 stars for that, but I'm giving the pork a star of its own. Bless that single waitress's heart, running around this packed place taking orders, bussing the tables, and keeping a smile on her face.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've never thought of tail as a prime cut of meat until I got the ox tail at The Islands. It's extremely tender with a rich, briny sauce that left me wanting to gnaw on the tail bone of every cross-sectional piece. The curried goat was similarly delicious, and the jerk chicken was spicy and moist. Everything came with rice and beans and steamed vegetables, which was a nice way to soak up all the extra sauce. For its spot and layout, The Islands is a bit pricey--we paid $12 for a large chicken, $13 for goat, and $15 for oxtail. But they do mean large--we split those three dishes between five people, which made it more economical. The only other problem is the haywire takeout line. I think there were only two or three orders in front of us, but we waited for a good 15 minutes before even crossing the threshold into the restaurant. But once we got to eat the food, I'd say it was worth the wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cute, trendy, delicious; what's not to like? I've tried their dip sobas and cold sobas, both of which are perfect for a hot summer day. There's not many restaurants that offer light, refreshing food that is also filling. Their soba noodles are cooked at just the right consistency, and the toppings are fresh and simple. But the best part is their soup base. The staff brings to your table a kettle of hot water as you almost finish your soba, and after you add that to your bowl of ingredients what's left becomes an amazing soup for you to drink. If you're not sure about how it works, or just want to learn more about soba, don't worry. They have cute explanatory cartoon cards to guide you along the way!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"omg. When I first went in, I thought I had the wrong place. It's a tiny deli that looks pretty grungy and has a million things on the menu. I also thought a deli named David's known for its pastrami and brisket had to be run by Jewish guys but wrong again. I've dreamt of David's ever since the first time I went over the summer. The salty, sweet and slightly fatty pastrami melts in your mouth and goes perfectly with the tangy mustard. I went with the small and for anyone who eats normal portion sizes, this is enough.

"Previously, I gave Mama Gyro a 5 star rating for excellent quality food, fast/friendly service and reasonable prices. Unfortunately, that was about 2 years ago. Now, Mama Gyro regularly takes over an hour to deliver food, the prices have risen about 33%, and they often make mistakes in the order. On top of all of that, when they make mistakes, they refuse to rectify the situation and give an attitude. For example, today, I ordered about $30 in dips and spreads. I paid for 3 extra pita breads. When the delivery arrived, no additional pita bread was included. When grubhub asked for a refund, Mama Gyro refused. Naturally, it was not as enjoyable to eat dips and spreads without pita bread... but they did not care or offer to try to accommodate me. Another example: Last week I ordered a $6 piece of feta cheese. I gave my credit card info and the order was placed on the telephone. Ten minutes later, a lady from Mama Gyro called me and told me that it was not in stock. So, instead of offering a refund, she insisted on me ordering a similar priced item. When I refused, she got mad and said fine, but it will take 3 business days. I am done with Mama Gryo.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Excellent pizza! Would've given this place five stars if we didn't have to wait an hour & ten minutes just to order! Then again, I think our wait would've been shorter if it wasn't for that damn party of 17 in front of us. YES, SEVENTEEN! WTF. We took our pizza to-go and ate at the park down the street. It only took them about 15 minutes for them to make our pizza.. fresh out of the oven! We got the large regular pizza (regular = mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and basil) and it was delicious!

"This place is definitely worth a detour if you're in the neighborhood. The kitchen is in plain view right behind the counter, and the guys running the place have a great Brooklyn attitude to their customers. I got the medium pastrami sandwich on rye for lunch on a weekday, and I (foolishly) ordered some fries to go along with it... that sandwich was ridiculous! I couldn't finish the fries, that meat was something else. I can't speak to other delis, but this place is a gem. Definitely check it out. There are a few tables to sit down and eat at, and I had a table to myself around 1 on a Thursday. The place does get a little busy during the noon rush, but the guys are quick and you'll spend 10-15 minutes waiting to order at worst. Docked a star for decor, but a) it's Bed-Stuy and b) the sandwiches are still some next-level s**t.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I almost want to keep this place a secret because it has that quaint undiscovered feel and I've never had to wait for a table. I came here for dessert and coffee once on a winter afternoon and LOVED it. The garden is covered and heated, the espresso drinks and dessert were excellent (try the bread pudding) and the atmosphere was the best of all. I've been back for dinner a few times, and the atmosphere is definitely what brings me back. It is superb for a romantic dinner date. Service has always been attentive as well. However, I find the food to be good, but nothing to write home about. I've had the lasagna and pizza and they were both delicious, but if La Lanterna didn't have the romantic garden, I probably wouldn't come for the food. The menu seems authentic, but I wish they had pastas. My recommendation would be to come here for coffee, drinks, or dessert, as the atmosphere is unparalleled but the food is just ok.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"You usually don't ever hear a woman say she loves small things. But I love me some small plates and small bar where everyone is on top of one another diggin into some mouth watering food.

If you want to eat at this place and grab a spot by the window, don't show up at 6:30, show up at 6 like your date told to you. I blew that one. All I'm gonna say is, at least we got a table.

"So this place is growing on me.  I swore I wrote a review on this place a year ago and gave it a 3 star.  Either I deleted it on accident, or I'm bat shit crazy. I'm very into instant gratification and not much into long waits, even if the food is mind blowing.  I've been to Ippudo a total of 6 times now, and this place keeps getting better in my eyes.  A big part is probably because my wait times have significantly gotten better. I had a wait time of 15 minutes at 6pm for a table of 5 two weeks ago, and this past week I had a wait time of 40 minutes for a table of 12 (2 tables of 6, they can only seat a maximum of 10). Lately i've been going with the Spicy Miso Ramen.  I like the spicier kick that makes me sweat balls.   Noodles:  Al dente and perfectly chewy.  Option of extra noodles by yelling out ""kae-dama"" when you still have broth left.  I finally yelled it out, instead of just asking the waiter.  Much more fun yelling out you want some extra noodles than asking politely. Broth:  Perfect spiciness.  Not so spicy where you are pining for water and filling your stomach up, and thus having no more room for extra noodles. Ingredients in broth:  Maybe possibly too gingery for my tastes, but still pretty good. Finally, the pork buns.  I'm starting to think they are better than Momofuku's.  More tender and better tasting. Ippudo has moved up to my 2nd favorite place for ramen right behind Ramen Dojo in the Bay Area (yelp.com/biz/ramen-dojo-…) I'll be back, since it's right around the corner from my house :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came back here for dinner- my friend and I ordered the pork chop and the quail from the entrees menu. The pork plate was huge but the quail looked tremendously tiny. They gave us what looked like two anorexic wings on a rectangular plate w/ a tiny round piece of spoon bread and a heaping pile of collard greens in a souffle bowl. I was not happy with that dish- $22 for a miniscule portion? No. Thankfully the pork chop platter was really good and filling. If you want value for your buck I do not recommend the Quail nor the Corn Custard entree- I kept looking over the next table where someone ordered it and the expression on the girl's face was pure WTF; her friend had to share her own burger with her so she won't be hungry. Big portions: burgers, pork chop, trout, fish and chips. All the others will not satiate your hunger. Brunch/Lunch is a better option.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I knew we were in the right place when I saw that the tables were set with a spoon and fork. Let me explain. Being familiar with Filipino food is akin to belonging to an exclusive club. To gain entrance to this club, you have to either be Filipino, or be very close to someone who is. Because the best Filipino food is cooked at home. Filipino food is unique in that you will never, ever, EVER find a dish that tastes better than home-cooked. Like, just give up. It's not gonna happen. Let go & let God. Just accept it so we can move on. It's just a fact that whenever you eat FIlipino food outside of the home, it will be, at the most, second-best. Maharlika is exactly that: the Second Best. The Filipino dining experience is more visceral than anything -- take in the smells & sounds of the kitchen, the table settings, the enveloping feeling of comfort & warmth. Maybe that's why Filipino food isn't as mainstream as other Asian cuisines --- it's not as simple as following a recipe. There are certain details that are essential to the experience -- including setting the table with a spoon & fork, instead of a fork & knife. The spoon is just as essential to Filipino food as chopsticks are to Chinese food. And this is why Maharlika is succeeding -- they are not simply recreating Filipino recipes. They use the same ingredients, & the same foundations, but the dishes are upgraded in a way that you *can't* get at home. Their dishes are both authentic & reimagined. My boyfriend said it best: ""It's like home cooking, but if your mom graduated from a top culinary school."" ******************* We started off our meal with Spam Fries & Lumpiang Barquillos. The Spam Fries are just ... bless whoever came up with this. Blessings & good tidings upon you, kind stranger. For all of the healthy, fresh food that Filipinos eat, sometimes you just need to order some delicious deep-fried meat-in-a-can. I didn't know what to expect with Lumpiang Barquillos -- I'm only familiar with Lumpiang Shanghai, & Fresh Lumpia. But both are delicious, so I figured it was a safe bet. Lumpiang Barquillos is closer to Shanghai, but much longer & thinner. More delicate too. They tasted like a lighter version of Shanghai. We cut each of them in half to share easily. They were very good, & the sweet dipping sauce was nice ... but ultimately nothing could keep me from those Spam Fries. Especially when you dip the fries into the Banana sauce .... mmmmasarap! (We were also given a small plate of Chicharron. It's not really my thing, but my boyfriend enjoyed the crispy, crunchy bits of chicken skin. And my boyfriend had a glass of Tang. TANG!) For dinner, we ordered Bistec (with Garlic Rice) & Kare Kare. Our waitress asked if we wanted extra plates so we could eat family-style -- which is another seemingly innocent question that really speaks to that comfortable home-cooked feeling. But, we were both greedy, so no extra plates for us! My Bistec was outstanding, & the garlic rice was second only to the rice cooked in the Philippines. The marinated steak was impossibly tender & easily cut with my ""Filipino knife"" (read: spoon). There was a slight sweetness to the sauce that seemed to enhance every other flavor, making it better than any bistec I've had before. The Kare Kare was incredible: the sauce was incredibly flavorful and not too thick, & the oxtail practically fell off of the bone. It came with a small dish of Bagoong on the side, which made my boyfriend very happy. Both dishes were just fantastic. ******************* Maharlika is definitely setting the standard for bringing Filipino restaurants into the mainstream. Well done, & maraming salamat po! I will hopefully be back soon to try the tocino, which appears to have wonderful reviews too. PS: Bonus points to whoever chose the 80s/90s station for background music. Because I'll be darned if Filipinos don't enjoy a good sing-along with their meal! PPS: Call ahead for reservations! Highly recommended, especially if you're in a larger group.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is OUTRAGEOUS and after eating here it's clear why it was ranked among the top NYC restaurants for so many years in a row. The menu rotates with the seasons and offerings are based on what's fresh at the Union Square Market. Prices are steep (more than $100 for the pri fix menu) but the food is incredible and the hospitality is unmatched. This is a place that focuses on the details--the service is seamless, tiny amuse buche are delivered between courses, and individually wrapped coffee cakes for breakfast are delivered with the bill. For less expensive (but equally delicious) fare, opt for the front bar section. The menu is limited, but many of the famous dishes are offered at lower costs. And remember to order the Gramercy Cocktail. It is without a doubt the best drink in this city.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!!!! Got takeout of fried chicken, sprouting garden salad and devil eggs to go. Chicken, lightly breaded, spicy and delicious. The sprouting garden salad is beautifully presented and refreshing. And they even carefully packed the devils eggs so we can appreciated how gorgeous those little devils are!! Can't wait to go back and have a sit down meal","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Samurai Ribs is the best!  The meat is so tender and it melt in your mouth good. Tried Totto in Hell's Kitchen, they are not the same if you want to compare these two.  Totto is more of Chicken stock soup base ramen joint.  If i want to have a bowl of Spicy ramen I will probably choose Totto's because their spicy paste is better. Ippudo still tops them in portion size and presentation.  The downside is their soup base gotten a little on the salty side.  The ramen is still one of the best I had because their ramen is authentic unlike other restaurants' (i think most other uses store brought Nisim brand instant noodle).  Soup is rich, appetizers are great.  The worst part of Ippudo is the wait time.  Either you should go there super early or near closing time to avoid long wait otherwise expect to spend 1-2hr of time to kill.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came with my boyfriend tonight to enjoy a little Colombian food this side of Bogota. We had heard great things about the place and were eager to try it out. With all the great reviews we were sure this was going to be a wonderful meal. Tonight we finally got the chance since work was slow for both of us. It being a Wednesday summer night and all we figured we would just do the walk-in thing. When we got there, there was no one at the stand (which was odd), but we just chilled out and waited. It seemed like a nice enough place and all. Think Lower Eastside sheek paired with tacky TGIF. It seemed a little forced & a little dusty, but no big deal we weren't here to stair at the walls. We wanted some great chicharron, aji, and empanadas. Decor shmacor. Never the less the host soon arrived. He was pleasant enough and told us it would be about 15 minutes for a table. I asked if they had a garden and he said there was a patio and he would do his best to get us out there. So we sat in there weird cocktail area to wait. I say weird because it was like right there but there wasn't a server or waitress or anything to help us out. The host gave us a drink menu to look through and me and the hubby picked out a mojito for me and a frozen margarita for him. Simple straight to the point drinks where could we go wrong. I WILL TELL YOU WHERE. Who in this day and age serves the crappiest alcohol gussied up with some fresh limes and mint. Do you think people can't taste garbage liquor? While I can. It wouldn't be a big deal if the drinks were cheaper, but really $19 plus tax and tip! My man said his was fine on the liquor side, but said it tasted waaaaay too much like the crappy sour mix you find at the local beer slinging joints. Any way we moved past this. We wanted some food and luckily a table on the ""patio"" had opened up.  We were lead ""outside"" to the ""patio"". Oh I see you noticed all the quotation marks. So OUTSIDE is really just another room inside and PATIO means warm concrete box with disgusting gunky roof sitting on dollar folding chairs and in front of flimsy folding tables. We (and everyone around us) were by no means outside. We were just seated at crappy patio furniture INSIDE. I don't understand why you would say their was an outdoor seating area if in fact there wasn't? Whats wrong with saying we will take you to our backroom. Whatever!?!?! So there we are and we can't even hear ourselves think let alone talk to each other. There was a big table and OOOHHHHH could these ladies yammer. They were beyond loud. You would think they had never dined out beyond a high school cafeteria. And the way they spoke to the staff was embarrassing. They treated their waiter like he was a child. He just smiled and nodded. You could see he was agitated, but he kept his mouth shut and just kept on trying to be hospitable. While we were sitting there pondering what kind of weird latin world we had stumbled into our waitress came. She was also getting berated by the table, but seemed to brush it off. She gave us some water, plantain chips, and showed us their Aji sauce for the chips. She then pointed out some items on the menu that were popular. Honestly, I could barely hear her. While she was going through her schtick, a table that had been seated after us flagged down the waiter, the poor guy taking care of the loud mouths, and obviously asked to move ""inside"". So here we were. What on earth had happened? Me and the man just wanted a nice night out. Instead we were seated inside on crappy patio furniture, drinking garbage liquor, at PS XXX listening to the gossip of who knows what. Gosh darnit we were going to enjoy this rare night out together!!!!! (WOO SAAA). And the woo saa paid off There was a lull. The ladies quieted for a moment and for nearly the 1st time that night I felt like I was out and just enjoying myself and some time with my man. A large bald guy in a jacket, I'm guessing the manager, was out standing in front of the table. Guess why he was there????? He asked the women to tone it down. He seemed to be soft spoken but firm. This did not sit well with them. One lady demanded that he point out who was complaining (I WAS, I wasn't, but I WAS, in fact everyone ""out"" there was). He just seemed to repeat a plea for them to quiet down. One woman snapped back 'eff that we are just enjoying ourselves'. Again the manager insisted they quiet down. The group was not happy and muttered off while he backed off and said they were leaving. THANK GOD!! The manager left and so did the group from hell. I feel soory for him and his staff if this is what they have to deal with, but it was finally like a night out Our waitress (who I think was hiding from the drama) came back a few minutes later to get our order. The hubby had the Bandeja Peasa and I the Arroz con Pollo. The rest of the meal was fine, but nothing special. Guess what, we will be skipping Bogota forever after this foray.....","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Elegant, chic and attentive. No wonder they have 2 michelin stars. Arrived early and waited at the 5 seat bar. Note to future patrons, when you walk in, you'll see the glass in front, the entrance door is on your LEFT. The dining area is dimly lit with candles on every table. Definitely has the romantic ambiance and vibe. If you want to impress a girl, bring her to Jungsik. We opted to do the 10 course tasting menu for $155 pp. Honestly, it was a lot more than 10 dishes (chef's complimentary appetizers and desserts), it felt like a never ending supply of goodness each round. Our reservation was @ 8pm and we didn't leave until 11:30pm. Be prepared for the long hall. The dishes were so thought out and presentation was top notch. Each plate was different, decorative and the plate itself had a certain temperature to it to bring out the best taste of the food. *Cue drumroll* Time for the food breakdown: 1)  Cobia Tartar - white fish tartar - so cold and fresh. The greens and tiny flowers (yes!! flowers!!!) on top brought a nice balance of texture and taste. This was one of the best dishes from our meal. A must get! Who know we can eat flowers? 2) Fried Oysters - 3 to 4 tiny fried oysters encrusted with squid ink crumbs paired with pickled veggies. You start to see the different elements of Korean influence. Overall, good. 3) Octopus with ssamjang aioli - super tender paired with fermented soy bean paste! I don't know what they did to the Octopus, but Chef... keep it up and I'll have to keep coming back for this! If you see the picture, you'll know what I mean. 4) Crispy Red Snapper - Wow. I knew fish can taste this good. From what our waiter told us, the chef boiled the fish to soften the SCALES then fries it to perfection. The kimchi and pickled veggies paired so well with the fish. It had the right amount of spice and one of my favorites. 5) Mushrooms - mixture of hen of the woods and shiitake with truffle sauce. This was by far my least favorite dish. The mushrooms were immersed with so much richness, I felt like I was eating a stick of butter and salt. PASS!! 6) Hae Jang - Pork belly with spicy broth - I appreciated what the chef was trying to do with this dish. Loved the pork belly, good amount of fat and meat. Kimchi broth with some rice underneath. On a cold night, the soup definitely warmed the body and makes you feel cozy and homey. 7) Poached egg in broth with mushroom shavings - when i first got this dish, the waiter informed me that it is going to be very rich. As soon as he said that, I thought of the mushroom entree and grew very weary. Luckily, it wasn't that kind of rich, it's yolky but not omg-eating-stick-of-butter rich. After blending everything together, it was another comfort food. 8) Jungsik Steak - grilled waygu with kimchi sesame. Let's just say that I took two bites and could not finish it. The amount of fat on there really was a turn off and the taste was a bit gamey to me. The last savory dish and I was highly disappointed how it ended like that. But at least we can go onto the dessert!! The desserts were amazing. Each one was better than the next. Chef started us out with a cleanser to clean the palate.  A japanese like cup with a white ball of flavored shaved ice and white foam with a straw chocolate on top. Cold and refreshing. The taste reminded me of those white spongy cakes that you buy when visiting your ancestors at the cemetery. Next up, Jang Dok. WOW WOW and WOW. Never knew chocolate can taste THAT good. Chocolate mousse with a chocolate crumble. I can eat about 3 of these alone. The crumble is what really make this dessert so scrumptious. God, I'm drooling already. There are a few more desserts that came our way, mostly all complimentary. Just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, the waiter brought out a corn creme brulee. Now, anyone who knows me, knows that I love creme brulee. But when I heard corn.... I was kinda hesitant. One bite though, it had it at 'corn'. This was one of the BEST creme brulee I EVER had. It's topped with these little seeds from Latin America that tastes like popcorn. Just enough sweetness to marry everything together. As our night ended, we were stuffed to the brim and felt the food coma kicking in. Service was top notch. Silverware changed at every course. Hospitable. Loved every moment of it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We came to Yuca Bar with a huge group at around 1 am on a Friday night for some dancing. We had tons of fun! There was enough space for our group of 15 to dance comfortably and mingle. DJ was playing lots of popping tunes that was great for dancing! Some of us were hungry for some late night munchies and ordered food. Service was a bit rude but I guess it was late and it was loud so the waitress was grumpy. The serving size was big for tapas. The food was okay...nothing memorable.

"It is okay. New good, not awful. Cannot explain all the gushing reviews. We only had cafe au lait and desert crepes. Maybe their regular menu is better than their sweet crepes. Coffee was beyond horrible, which is inexcusable, given that the owner/chef is actually french. Whatever they serve is NOT french coffee, not even a mediocre American coffee. It is one of those sour drip dish-water tasting coffee which can only be found in hospital cafeterias and a few dirty spoon diners. The only good thing was that they steamed milk. Big plus. But then it was served oddly separate from coffee. Another huge disappointment was a nutela/banana crepe with whipped cream. They don't even bother whipping cream. It comes from those supermarket aluminum containers and tastes like chemical concoction, which is exactly what it is. We lived in France for years and never saw desert crepes made of such odd flour. We use organic flour at home and it is never this dark and odd tasting.Savory crepes are traditionally made with buckwheat flour, but these crepes didn't taste like buckwheat either. Not bad, just odd. The place itself is tiny, only 8 small tables and a few bar chairs, but very charming. The waitress was nice and the owner kept checking the room from his kitchen, though didn't talk to anyone. Nice paintings on walls, giving you a feel of a Soho gallery (before Soho became the shopping mall of America). If you happen to be nearby and feel like something different, maybe french atmosphere, you might want check this place out. Just don't count of their crepes to be anywhere close to what you get in France.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We heard great things about this place, and since we were in town (NYC) we decided to check it out.  We discovered that it was located in the village, so we jumped in a cab and headed down from times square on a Saturday night.  We arrived around 7pm, and there was a 2.5 hour wait.  Our first reaction was to leave, but then we decided to stick it out and drink at the bar in hopes that the food was worth a 2.5hr wait.   The bartender was really busy, but when he got to us he made some great recommendations from their beer list.  They definitely have some unique beers, many of which I tried and liked.   About 2 hours in we were sat and ordered the sea bass special and the burger / fries.  The food was great across the board.  The atmosphere in the place is also great, although very loud and bustling.   It's definitely a fun place for a casual dinner.  A tad pricey though.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A real gem of this town, something truly new york.  With the crazy schedules of everyone here, of course we need a high end restaurant open late at night.  You can come here when you're up at 3 AM and want a real meal.  The food is delicious, the service is attentive. A lot of the clientele is from the service industry, mainly chefs from other good restaurants who get off work late and obviously don't want to cook for themselves but want a wonderful meal.  It lets them participate in the industry they work for from the customer's standpoint.  And you know the food will be good when you see some top chefs dining here. This isn't another veselka where you see a bunch of drunks wandering in late at night for food.  It's real fine dining for those who are up late. I've never been during the day but I'd imagine it's just as good.  This place always comes to mind when I happen to be having an oddly scheduled day and want to eat well.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came to this restaurant after finding a good review online. The staff there were a bit on the rough side, lack of customer service was definitely present but if you are looking for something really quick, cheap and extremely delicious, this is the place. We ordered four large items and paid $9. We could not finish our entire meal and the dumplings were some of the best we ever has. Check out if you are on the Lower East Side. I've had a lot of dumplings from a number of dumpling shops throughout NYC and other areas Prosperity Dumplings gives you a lot of food for your buck. I bought a bunch of dumplings cooked in a variety of ways, plus two large soups for just over $10.00. It is your normal Chinatown take out shop. What this shop lacks in size, you get in quantity. The food has a fast turn around. The food has to be good, when the shop is always packed with locals as well as visitors. You can always tell a good place to eat, when you see the locals packing the place We go here everytime we visit New York. The place is super small. There are 4 bar stools with small counters in case you are lucky enough to grab one. We got 20 Dim Sum (1 order of vegetable and 1 order of lamb) and the total was $7.20. They steam them, don't boil or bake. It started to pour so i wads lucky and got two of the bar stools and chowed down. Dang it was good. i ate the rest in the hotel room that night. You aren't here for the ambiance, you are here for the food. There is a line out the door and folks stand outside eating their dumplings and chatting. Don't miss Prosperity Dumpli.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went to Perilla last night with two friends for my birthday. I was definitely happy about the food and everything else about the restaurant. The wait-staff was very friendly and the ambiance was elegant with a homey feel. The lighting was perfect and the noise level wasn't too high. The ceiling fans and a not-too-ostentatious chandelier made me feel like I was having dinner in someone's beautiful dining room. We started the meal each with a glass of wine--the whites were served very chilled which is one of those details you just have to appreciate. For appetizers, we had the crispy Berkshire pork belly. The top layer was very crispy--almost crunchy. I'd have to say the meaty layer was tough however, but nothing the sauce couldn't really mask. It's a good portion, on the larger side for an appetizer especially when considering how dense the meat was. We also shared a king oyster mushroom carpaccio appetizer that was very unique and delicious. It came with a thick and creamy white sauce (emulsion) and avacado puree drizzled on one side of it. The carpaccio is long and shaped like a soft taco (cylindrical) filled with more mushrooms and other ingredients inside. It came on a bed of crunchy frisee. The more detailed ingredients used in this creative dish were particularly noteworthy both visually and in taste. The tiny toasted rice pearls were a great contrast to the thin and slippery slivers of mushroom. All the flavors came together very well. For my entree, I ordered the pan roasted red snapper with baby bok choy, cashew nuts, squash, and crones in a green curry sauce. It was DELICIOUS. I was a bit hesitant to order a fish entree, but it was perfection. The green curry sauce isn't heavy or overwhelming in taste at all. I love the combination of cashew nuts and curry. Paired with the fish and the other vegetables in the dish, it was beyond words. And the portion was large, simply put. Perilla does not skimp on portions in general, and definitely not with their fish dishes (there was a healthy handful of nuts in the dish as well). I think the entree was finished with a sprinkle of paprika... the plating and colors were beautiful. I highly recommend this dish for fish/seafood lovers. The snapper was soft and delicate, but still very meaty. It was fresh with absolutely no unpleasant odor. My boyfriend ordered the pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin. The meat comes out sliced and so the tenderloin consists of small round circular pieces. It was a bit odd looking, but the plating was still gorgeous. And the tenderloin was SO incredibly tender and delicious. The meat was soft like butter and just melted in my mouth. It was plentiful juicy. The dish came with a hedgehog custard which puzzled us all. My boyfriend thought it tasted like ""hotdog"" or ground sausage but I didn't think so. It didn't have much of a taste at all, definitely not salty like hotdog. I'd say the texture was a cross between a creamy custard and an overly steamed squash. The color was similar to yellow squash as well.  I would say this dish's portion is medium and just right--not large or small. Overall, this tenderloin dish is superb (so tender!) and I would recommend it. My friend had the roasted duckling with mustard greens, white grits and pomegranate in a slightly tangy, dark brown sauce. She ordered the duck well-done. We thought the meat was definitely on the tough side, but that's the risk you take when ordering duck (and then subsequently ordering it well-done out of uneasiness of eating it not fully cooked). This dish was also a healthy to big portion. A good amount of duck. I thought the mustard greens were a little overcooked and thus a bit runny, but the pomegranate balanced out the dish well with its tangy bursts of flavor. The grits are served on one side of the plate and unlike the traditional southern grits, it was a grit-cake--square in shape and densely packed together. I thought the grits were flavored deliciously. The duck, although overcooked and dry in my opinion, was very tasty with the sauce, greens, pomegranate and grits. I would also recommend this dish, just don't order it well. Also had the side of faro risotto which is superb. There's plenty of cheese in the dish that pairs well with the dense bite of the faro. Definitely get it. Also get the doughnut dessert--it's the only one I saw being served that night, evidence of it's popularity. I'd provide more details on both, but no space. Chef Harold's creativity and mastery of flavors and ingredients is very apparent in his work. The food delivers high on the flavor scale while looking superb visually. The meals are hearty yet delicate and beautiful. It's high quality cuisine that isn't disappointing once it hits your taste buds. I highly recommend this restaurant--everything from the wait staff to the ambiance, quality of food and drinks makes Perilla an excellent dining experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Definitely not the worst Italian food I've ever had but certainly nothing to rave about.  The space was cramped and crowded.  But the wait staff was attentive.   I had a pasta w/ sausage and truffle oil, and I had to wonder why they used the truffle oil.  Pasta and Sausage in a nice red sauce doesn't need a fancy condiment to spice it up, but again, it wasn't  bad.  Finally, we had a chocolate cake and mousse desert.  The chocolate cake had an identical texture and taste to a diner brownie.  Which is more than fine in my book, but, not what I was expecting from a restaurant like this. SO,  In conclusion, not bad, but considering the wealth and breadth of choices in the surrounding area, I doubt that I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This was a perfect meal on a cold winter's night.  It's a wonderful place to go with friends and family.  However, like other people have said, there can be a long wait, so plan ahead and make reservations to shorten your wait time.   Check out their website: they've got a visual menu to help you if you don't know what a certain dish means... Ask for the side dishes (banchan) if they don't bring it to you!  At the beginning of the meal, they give you bit of steamed egg, and at the end of the meal, they give you a bit of this cold cinnamon drink.  There are six different types of banchan, including kimchi, turnips, and this fried eggplant and yam soaked in a lemony soy sauce that was delicious!!   We got the japchae (19.95) and the kimchi biji (12.95), which I both loved! It is a little on the expensive side for K-town.  But, we had a good experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I kept hearing a lot about how good this restaurant was so maybe my expectations were too high. I thought the food was decent, but nothing amazing. First, I ordered a drink called The Wizard - I will admit that the silly name had something to do with my choice (and the figs), but when the waiter confirmed it was good, I was sold. I tried to drink it, but all I kept thinking was that it tasted like mouthwash. It was terrible. The pate was creamy, the toasts crispy and who doesn't like a gherkin? I ordered the brick chicken with honey-glazed turnips. The chicken was juicy, but a bit salty. I kept thinking the turnips were under-cooked potatoes and had to remind myself they were in fact turnips. The one bite of my friend's short ribs and grits had good flavor, but also seemed very salty. The decor is dark and cozy. I lucked out with a bench seat, but my dining companion didn't find her stool very comfortable. Overall, I thought this place was a bit underwhelming considering all the great things I had heard.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place was just alright for me.  The first time I tried coming here, I didn't end up going as the wait was 40+ minutes & the waiting area was packed.  It was as if we were waiting to go into a fancy club or something.  My friend & I ended up going to Menkui Tei a few blocks over. So I finally got to go here for lunch.  My friend suggested we leave our offices at 11:40am to beat the lunch crowd.  We only had to wait 5 minutes!  By the time we got there, some patrons were already done eating...haha.  The restaurant is actually bigger than I thought as there is a whole other area once you turn the corner down the restaurant. We got the Hirata Buns in Pork as an app.  These were pretty good as the pork was really tasty & comes in a man-tao bun with lettuce.  For an entree, I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic w/a boiled egg as my friend's friend told me this was the popular ramen here but my friend's order of Akamaru Modern looked more appetizing to me.  The ramen was hearty & great for a winter's day but nothing spectacular to me.  I feel like you can go to plenty other places (without a wait) to satisfy your ramen craving. For dessert we got the Lady M Mille Crepe Cake, again...great but nothing spectacular.  Not sure if a slice of cake is worth $10 either. I definitely wouldn't wait a long time to eat here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So, the bartender was really nice. Beers were fairly priced, my honey comb negroni was awesome, the cupcakes were clutch, but my friend's Pimm's cup just wasn't good. At all.

"Something about Calle Ocho just seems...scandalous.  Might be my new favorite place. The lights are just dim enough, the service so calculated and impeccable, and the food so masterfully conveyed from start to finish that I could have been on the set of ""Pretty Woman"" and wouldn't know the difference. (or maybe I've just always wanted to play a Latin Julia Roberts).  The hum of conversation is just loud enough that you never forget you're in the company of other people, but soft enough that you and your date are center stage, and can plan the feisty evening that will probably commence once you and your date get back upstairs (the restaurant is situated inside the Excelsior hotel, which is $219 on a Friday night - not that I asked or anything).   We got the ""Arepa"" appetizer to start, which was a sweet corn cake topped with ropa vieja, and drizzled with a cream sauce.  Delicious.  For dinner I ordered the pork porterhouse, which was absolutely huge and topped with just-salty enough sauteed collard greens.  My date got the Vaca Frita al Caballo, which was a skirt steak topped with pork rice, a fried egg and an avocado salad.  We were beyond satisfied with our meals, (our forks went back and forth into each other's plates for most of the night) but went for the Banana Tres Leches cake for dessert, which was sweet and flavorful.  Talk about a metaphor... I must also warn you, the signage of the restrooms is a bit perplexing.  There is a photo of Lucille Ball, (or was it Marilyn Monroe? sangria makes facial recognition challenging) on BOTH of the restroom doors.  In a bit of a drunken haze, I chose the more feminine looking Lucy, rationalizing that of course that had to be the women's bathroom, when upon leaving the area, was told by the maitre'd that the bathrooms are unisex.  Duh.  Told you this place was scandalous. ;)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Service, seating and comfort is very nice and the meal was creatively prepared.  Location is at 37th Street and Fifth and almost difficult for my guests to find without noticing the banners outside of the Hotel Setai.  Upscale, understated,  Beautiful room.  This is a hotel restaurant but it is definitely upscale in cuisine and very comfortable.  The skate fish and pasta were excellent and prepared with style and wonderful flavors.  The pate was the best appetizer and the salad nice but not unusual. The dessert chocolate cake with gold leaf was so generously portioned that even I who love dessert could not finish. Did not get any amuse and the bread was a disappointment - cold sandwich sliced bread instead of the wonderful warm rolls and foccacia offered by the upscale Danny Meyers, Boulud and Colecchio restaurants.  The wine list offering included a restaurant week special of $9/glass or $30/bottle (a much better offer than the other upscale restaurants except for the Danny Meyers group). They didn't even return to offer more bread - without our asking and that is perplexing.  Missed the mark on the bread and some of the service. No thank you for coming on departure as I have had before at same and other restaurants even though the hostess desk had more than multiple persons at exit. I was here before and the Service was more attentive when with my husband than when I was with a group of well dressed professional women so I think they either have new staff or are focused on business clients. I love the restaurant and the food and loved chef White's Alto and this place is great but Michelin star upscale restaurants should serve warm baked on premises bread.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Admittedly I didn't know what to expect here. I'm not American, so 'soul food' is a bit new to me. Apparently this place is a bit of an institution, but a local had assured me there's far better places. Well, a group of us went in, and they quickly opened up another area so they could seat us. The waiter was quite friendly and happy to explain what everything was on the menu (like cheesy grits!) to a bunch of clueless foreigners. Some people quite enjoyed their meals, but me personally, I was glad I'd had a late lunch elsewhere. The chicken was nice enough, but nothing extraordinary. As one girl put it, it was like going to KFC. Unfortunately my chicken wasn't quite that nice. And the fries, probably some of the worst I've had. Don't get the fries. I also went the cheesy grits. Maybe it's an acquired taste? Over all, the service was fine, I even didn't mind the ambience, and there's some great murals on the wall, but the food really dragged it down for me.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Checked out this spot on a Sunday night around 7pm with a few friends.....decor was simple but nice, real comfortable, great aura, people are cool, classic hits on the jukebox, like the cure, billy idol, michael jackson etc......and the pricing is not bad.....we had about 9 miller high lifes, a burger and fries, came out to about 60 dollars.....food was tasty, only thing that sucked was that the burger was listed at 9 dollars which comes with no fries just the burger alone, fries will cost another 4, so a burger deluxe there is about 13 dollars which is not cheap....but overall i had a good time, most likely would head back there and just stay away from the food menu.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Sandwiched between Sapparo and another Japanese restaurant,  this place is hard to notice at first glance.  Go downstairs and you will soon realize that it's a happening place. Claustrophobic?  Might want to go outside and wait around because you will be squished like a sardine waiting in line for your name to be called. Braved through the long wait? Good.  This place is a comfy Japanese restaurant that specializes in small appetizer dishes to share amongst your party. Think Tapas, Japanese style.   You will not find rolls of sushi here. Gasps, yes, not all Japanese are sushi restaurants.  The tapas are traditional Japanese fare and the portions are totally share-able. It's pretty cheap too, especially when shared amongst your party! Selections that stood out?  Teriyaki squid (oh so tender and tasty!) ) and one of my favorite was this cold dish of s chopped up octopus with wasabi seasoning.  Chilled yet packs a wasabi-induced spice? I'm game.   The yakitoris (skewers) were flavored well.  The pan fried octopus balls were amazingly good; soft, juicy and flavorful; for a second, it takes me back to eating at some night market in Japan. Lively ambiance, great food to share with great friends,  and sake/beer.? Did I mention this place is pretty inexpensive, so order away.  Life is good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A friend told me of this place and it took me forever to find.  I was born and raised in BK but have left many years ago. Whenever I am visiting (which is several times a year) I like to come here for a brunch. It is on a kind of out of the way street with only a few stores that one would go to in the area but so worth it. I really like coming here in the warmer months so I can sit outside. The outdoor area feels like a million miles away from brooklyn. The vibe is pretty mellow. The menu does not have many choices but that is not needed because the variety is so good. One of my absolute favorites is the grits with eggs. I love the entire dish. A great side is the chocolate bread. There is really nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with. The grilled cheese is great, the eggs and on and on. I have only been here for brunch so I cant comment on the rest of the menu but I am sure it is as good and fresh. They dont rush you either so if you want to come linger and enjoy the atmosphere, this is a great place. Can't wait till my next visit back east to enjoy a brunch again!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I ate here with my daughter...I lived in Belgium for more than 7 years, and my daughter was born there, and we've been back, etc.  This is a very Anglicized version of a Belgian restaurant.  The beer and the frites were very good.  The moules were good, as was the steak, but no sauce on either dish wowed me.  The waffles were disappointing...there was no genuine made-on-the-premises Belgian waffle maker, just a standard US waffle that claims to be Belgian, and then also a packaged Belgian waffle that I could get at Whole Foods (which is still a good waffle).  No one does Waffles like the Belgians in Belgium...the Liege style hot off the device...heavenly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I will miss stumbling out of my office after a 12 hour day and sitting down here and getting a fried chicken cutlet or some squid and rice and dousing it in their awesome homemade hot sauce. I will miss walking in and having them immediately know what I want because I am in there so damn much. I'll be back though.

The plantains were good; I especially liked the butter/lemon sauce it came with. The salchipaps were mediocre. The fries were soggy and I wish they crisped the sausages.

"Had dinner here tonight for the 1st time and it was Fantastic!!! After reading several of the reviews and long-wait horror stories, we showed-up around 6:30pm and waited for 1/2 a minute! No joke! We walked in, asked for a table and they said, ""It'll only be 1/2 a minute while we set-up your table."" With smiles on our faces from the great news, we turned around, ordered a drink at the bar, and was literally motioned to our table a few seconds later. It really was ONLY 1/2 a minute, if that! Our waitress was a delight and recommended a few of the popular dishes there. We had the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage, Greek Salad, and Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings. My taste buds were in heaven!!! The Greek Salad was 'oh so fresh!' Perfect for a warm summer evening! The Gnudi was divine and melts in your mouth! My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. Mmmmm.... And then came the Burger and shoestrings! That burger will never be forgotten and I will sing its praises all the way back to San Francisco! Although The Spotted Pig is a small establishment, it is Perfect just the way it is! Even as we left, I asked for a nearby fro-yo location and they were as nice as could be. They didn't know where Pinkberry was but they tried to help me find one nonetheless!

"It was a long day and night for me as this was the spot chosen for dinner. Taxi ride from Queens we came, and this location being downstairs was mmm. I like it. Walking in here, I thought wow; I like them Sake bar! It was a cool joint for hang out and it was not overly loud and would be a good place to have a conversation.  Being that I already had dinner at a previous restaurant, I didn't care to order much. So the others order with what they know I would enjoy, UNI something. Here what we ordered. ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup  $9. It was delicate. With maybe 2 pcs of uni, I was searching for more. The roe to me overpower the flavor of this dish. HIYAYAKKO :  Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes  $5.00 I have to say this was the 2nd best dish, and tasted a complete dish. All the component work together, as I love bonito flakes. MENTAIKO :  Spicy Cod Fish Roe Imported from Japan  $7.00 SALTY! That's really all I taste. Salt, salt, and more salt.. UZAKU :  Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed  $8.5 Why do they put cucumber slices for? This takes away the flavor of the eel and bland the plate up.. I think this plate was totally wrongly done. Design and sign, I would like the grilled eel to shine, my expectation. HIRAME PONZU :  Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette   $9.00 This is not so fresh fluke here, and the grated dikon radish tasted fresher here. I am disappointed with the sashimi plate. Don't order this! Food tasted below average for me, but I have to say their dessert was something to talk here. The flavor was good and being that I love black sesame, the dessert works for me. So maybe this is just a hangout for sake and dessert? BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream                                        $9.00 2 bottle of sake and Sapporo was added to our ordered.  All and all, I would come here to hang out for sake and dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I knew that my new friend, Kiku, and I were going to get along just fine when she told me she wanted to order a salad for brunch, and by ""salad"", she meant a Bloody Mary.   I really wanted to fall in love with Bubby but the pancakes let me down.   At first they looked like every pancake lover's dream come true: fluffy with just enough color.  But after a couple of bites, I noticed that my pancake was salty.  So strange, right?  I mentioned this to our waitress and she didn't even send over a dessert or offer something.   The best part of my meal was the piping hot biscuit.  The worst  part was having to pay over $40 for salty pancakes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My husband I stopped by this restaurant after spending a day at the spa.  What a perfect end to what started out as a great day together.   There was no shortage on anything at this restaurant.   Our server, Tabs, recommended a cocktail for my husband and he loved it. Our appetizer, Asian Wings, were perfect. Our entree's were absolutely out of this world.  My husband order the Red Velvet Waffles and Fried Chicken.  All he could say was ""WOW, WOW"".  Of course, I had to taste a forkful and I was speechless. I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp with Grits.  Oh my goodness!!!!!  These were two (2) of the best meals I have had outside of my house in a LONG time. We had to meet the chef and shake the hand that prepared such a delicious meal. My husband ordered the Peach Cobbler and Tabs was able to find Peaches and Creme Ice Cream, to make it all complete.

Very convenient to Hilton Garden Inn and Hampton Inn on W 35th. Much better food and prices than Brendan's, which is across the street. The food was delicious, especially the Bulgogy!

We were even able to pick our seat. The menu at this time. Has a nice variety of appetizers, small serving and entree dishes. The dessert menu allows you to choose a full serving  order or a dessert plate with 3 dessert items  (smaller portion of course). The food was fresh and tasted delicious. However, in my opinion no extra salt or pepper was needed. The food was very well seasoned. If you you are sensitive to salt you may want to give the server a heads up to see if they can hold the salt. Quick note, since they just opened recently they do not currently accept credit cards and they do not serve alcohol. Of course, this is something that we were told should be available changing soon.

"YUM! A clean, sparsely filled room of light wood paneling.  Quiet.  Not many tables, lots of blank space for servers to swiftly move back and forth between the sushi bar and hungry patrons. We had an 8:00 reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival.  Warm towels, a carafe of warm sake and we were settled into our comfortable booth. The chef's complimentary appetizer was seaweed and radish.  Don't knock it till you try it; what I would have expected to be flavorless crunch was actually quite good and quite surprising.  A great start to the meal. Miso soup was good, if typical.  We had two hot apps--fried eel skin and egg custard.  The eel was cut into long skinny strips, and both looked and tasted like eel french fries.  I like eel, but this was just bleh.  I would have preferred more of the seaweed and radish.   I had done my yelp homework and knew we were going with the omakase (chef's selections of sashimi).  Our waitress expertly informed us that they recommended 10 pieces per person.  Fine, easy enough. The fish was all of exceptional quality and very flavorful.  I liked that each piece had a tiny dab of wasabi on it.  Unfortunately my dining partner isn't quite as much a fan of spicy mustard as I and didn't appreciate it.  However, when we tasted he toro, our complaints evaporated.  This was hands-down the best fatty tuna I've ever tasted.  Eye-popping good.  Delicious.  Superb.  Need more synonyms?  You get the point. Then, the egg custard came 20 minutes later after our sashimi was already half eaten.  A oversight that shouldn't have happened in a restaurant of this quality.  I had forgotten about that appetizer, still mesmerized by the toro.  I like custard but coming off the toro, it was disappointing (although anything at that point probably would have been).  Perhaps if we'd gotten the custard first, the momentum would have successfully continued to build.  As it was, it kind of fell flat. All totaled our bill came to around $80 per person.  Not exactly eating on the cheap but I had expected more after what I'd read.  Maybe because we decided to forgo dessert?  Anyway that was a pleasant surprise. Now, let me be clear:  this is not the place for you if you spell crab with a ""k"" and prefer your sushi deep fried with cream cheese or spicy sauce.  At Yasuda, the fish speaks for itself and is served unadulterated by fillers and fat which create false flavors and mask inferior fish.  Not at Yasuda; this is a sushi restaurant for purists.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Celebrated my fiance's 31st here.  Knowing they didn't take reservizzies, we stopped in earlier than we wanted to eat dinner to put our name in.  We were told 30-45 min, and I gave the host my digits.  He knew my area code to be from upstate NY, and turns out we are from the same town! we wandered to the Bourgeois Pig for a cocktail.  No sooner did we order our drinks than we get a text to say our table would be ready shortly, and to come back for our seats.  I texted back saying we just ordered, can we have 30 min?  He said no problemo, he'll text again.   Well, he didn't text us back, so we just wandered back to the restaurant anyway.  There was a table available, and we were seated immediately. We ordered a lot of food, because it all looked so great.  Crab cakes were legit -- full of fresh lumpy crab.  The kale/octopus salad was amazing; octopus cooked perfectly and the kale dressed with a perfect vinagrette.   We tried some oysters, too, and I couldn't tell you which ones.  I'm not a huge oyster person, but the west coast (read: less salty) were pretty good.   The scallops were done perfectly, too: nice and sweet.  The mussels were also quite nice, and we kept getting bread for dipping in the beer-broth.   At the end of the meal, the owner bought us a round of drinks after bonding over our being from the same hometown.  It looks like many people were regulars, or that he befriended a lot of his customers.  That's how you do business.  I love upstate!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"wow. are these reviews for real? this place was just down right NASTY I love noodles. My Grandma is the queen of noodles and dumplings. I was lucky enough to grow up with ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, yet HEALTHY Chinese food. Lan Zhou is everything BUT those things, plus it was uber dirty. I got really excited when i read the reviews, so i decided to give this place a shot. Of course, I didn't go in there with the ridiculous hope of it being remotely similar to my grandma's home-cooked deliciousness.. but this was just gross let's start with the dumplings. WTF? seriously. what IS that taste? My friend and i spent a good minute or two trying to figure out that WEIRD TASTE in the greasy filling.  We concluded that the meat they used for the filling was not fresh, and therefore they had marinated it before hand.  Plus, they probably had it frozen for convenience, but it tasted like it was frozen for a VERY long time, thus the eerie sweet and processed taste now the noodles. the girl recommended the house special. I suspected she would, only because it was the most expensive thing on the menu. Whatever, i went with it. BIG MISTAKE.. First of all, they used a stainless steel mixing bowl.  Okay, i understand you're not big on presentation, but a scratched up MIXING BOWL? That's just outta the line! Anyways, I sucked it up, and gave the broth a try. *sigh*.. another big mistake. I just sipped on a lukewarm mixture of GREASE and soy sauce, plus maybe a little bit of tomatoes cooked in it. The noodles weren't even good! It was all overcooked and bland. anyways. i think you all get my drift by now. there's not need to carry on with the negativity. this place is a HUGE nono in my books. restaurants like this really shouldn't exist. please, for the sake of your tummy.. nono","[1.0, 0.0]"
Buttermilk Channel made my Bday suck a little.  Cute place but my oh my what a let down.  I had the special Monday 3 course special.  Soup.  Gross.  Poor waiter realized I didn't like it..sub'd it out with their watermelon salad.  Hmm..didn't touch it either.  But I didn't let that get me down.  Chicken and Waffles were up next.  How can you mess that up?  Ugh.  They did.  Although the chicken had a nice crust.  It wasn't seasoned.    The waffles were as good as the ones you find at the frozen aisle of your supermarket.  The coleslaw leaked onto your waffle.  Gross.  The coleslaw had raw red onions in it..so imagine the surprise when you take a bite out of your waffle with syrup..not noticing there are bits of onions clinging to the underside of your waffle.  yuck.  The only saving grace was the dessert.  Well happy bday to me : (,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"WOW! Decor is amazing. Service is quick, staff is accommodating and pleasant. Presentation is wonderful. Taste is so flavorful and unique! I brought my brother here for his birthday and we were debating between this place or a nearby steakhouse...very happy with our choice. Pricing may seem expensive but won't once you receive your food. Calamari is crispy but not overcooked and is delicious with their housemade habanero hot sauce. I had the black sea bass...the broth was so good I was considering drinking it! The fish itself was soft and flavorful, but the akin had a little crunch to it. The spinach and small potatoes were sitting in the broth and really soaked up the taste. My brother had the cheeseburger and was equally impressed (I thought the Patty part was much thicker than I usually see). I stole a few of his fries and could instantly taste the truffle oil and the rosemary. We both left feeling full but not stuffed. Great portion sizes. I usually worry that really expensive places with unique items will have small portions. This place had enough for you to clean your plate and not feel guilty or cheated. We didn't get to taste these items but saw them on others plates and thought they looked fantastic: fried chicken, seasonal donuts, lobster, raw scallop appetizer, cooked scallop entree.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My coworker took me here for lunch today to try and get me out of my norm. I have to say that was a fantastic decision and this place is totally worth a try. As per everyone's review, I too didn't think highly of a Ramen restaurant and could only think about the Ramen's of college life. However, now that I have tried this place, I am ready to try this place, and other Ramen places! Here is my review of the place and what I ate for my meal: Pork Buns (5 out of 5): I have never had such an interesting food to start a meal. This is totally a worth a try and love the flavor that comes with it. The bun is soft and delicious and the pork mixture was amazing! I don't like too much heat and thought this had a nice kick after each bite. Karaka Men (4 out of 5): When we sat down, we asked the guy next to us what he had order. He had a different Ramen, but his partner had order the Karaka Men and said it was much more flavorful. If I see him again, I would love to thank him! It was a great choice and definitely had a lot of flavor that worked well. It had a bit more kick than the Pork Buns, but still tolerable to me, who again does not enjoy too much heat with meals. Venue (4 out of 5): I really enjoyed the atmosphere and thought it was very active and fun place. The decor was neat and pleasant to be around. The only issue I would say is that this place is very popular and I am thankful that we go in before the lunch time rush hit (around 11:15). It got packed very quickly and as we left had a nice line already formed (and that was before noon!). On a final note, it is a bit pricey for the Ramen. My coworker and I got the pork bun and split the Ramen and thought that was the perfect amount for lunch and kept it reasonably priced.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Since the new theme of the summer, and more broadly speaking, the new theme of my life, is ""Bringing the Happy back to Happy Hour"", Verlaine represents all that I'm looking for. The space has a cool atmosphere.  I'd describe it as low-key but definitely not low-energy.  You feel comfortable here - the lack of pretentiousness here is evident. The happy hour until 10 PM = $4 drinks that actually taste good.  The white and red sangrias go down easy, which makes me thankful for those economy prices.  The lychee martinis are naturally stronger, so luckily you can vary your drink choices as the night progresses and the need arises.  Post 10 PM, the drink prices jump to normal levels, but the expanded drink menu has so many good choices, you don't feel too jaded about happy hour being over.  The passion fruit margarita packed a punch and definitely came with a healthy dose of tequila. The most pleasantly surprising part of this place is the service - both times I've been here, the servers have gone out of their way to try to find seating for the groups I was with (not an easy task since the place isn't that big and has always been crowded).  They bring your drinks quickly even when it's approaching 10 and you're putting in the last-minute orders.

More fresh florals and candles than you can ever imagine and fireplace lounge in the back in amazing. Our server was incredibly kind, respectful and eager to help.  Unfortunately, it was a bit hard to find at times and when we requested his colleagues find him for us, that took a long time as well. Hard to be upset at this though... the server are so respectful. The food, unfortunately, needs to be stepped up.  Its was either bland or over cooked.  The combinations within the taps are very inventive but a bit more care could be taken in defining some clear tastes in the dishes.  The Spanish bread pudding was dry and flavourless. But in the end, the ambivalence softened my criticisms.  Its worth visiting here again, but perhaps only for wine.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was quite the ramen virgin, but this was a must-try on our last trip to NYC.  I figured that, being an outpost of a Japanese chain, Ippudo would at least be authentic. The twenty minute wait, mid-afternoon, was a bit of a surprise.  But at least we didn't try to get a table during the peak hours! I sampled the classic shiromaru with extra noodles ($15).  The tonkotsu broth was rich and deep with flavor - as slurplicious as they say it is.  The slices of pork served on top of the noodles were moist and tasty.   Since DC has exactly zero (0) ramen shops, I've only been able to compare Ippudo to Menchanko-Tei and Motomachi Shokudo (in Vancouver).  I think Ippudo is still tops, in my experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The wait wasn't too bad for us because we were a party of two and they let us sit at the bar which didn't have too much room to move but it had to do.  We got the vegetable dumplings which I absolutely love dumplings and these have to be one of my favorites.  It's rare for me to find vegetable dumplings so that got me excited.   I ordered chicken basil for my entree and my friend got the duck soup. Both were very flavorful and the service was also great.  I guess my rating is just due to not having a lot of choices on the menu... My friend loves Tom yum soup and at a Thai restaurant they didn't have this which is why he opted for the duck soup.  Overall everything is very tasty but definitely look at the menu first to see if they have something that will fit your taste palate.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went to dinner with my family here and what a delight!  I know the Smith from when I lived on 3rd Avenue and that food is pretty much always consistent.  When I heard about older sister Jane, I was intrigued.  So I nailed down a Saturday night reservation to see what it was all about.   Everything was tasty and the service was great.  It was the perfect atmosphere too - hip and modern but really comfortable.  The staff was very accommodating and gave great recommendations.  We had a delicious salad and the black ink pasta to start.  And everyone had something different for dinner -  steak frites, pork chop, the fish special and mussels.  I would definitely go back to try brunch!","[1.0, 0.0]"

They also have a new sandwich each week, they seem to be pretty tasty. I've only had one of them so far, pastrami, which was mind blowing. The service is really nice too.

Went here with a couple of people at brunch. The decor was nice and cute and it was a cool location. The food was alright. The chicken sandwich wasn't amazing and the omlettes looked okay too.

If you get one of the breakfast sandwiches the portion is pretty big. it gets pretty crowded actually so making a reservation wouldn't be a bad idea.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
I'm not going to fall out of line with the overall average rating for this place!  I love their coffee and unfortunately tried the iced latte (vs. the iced coffee) and I can't go back!  It is super strong and wakes me up in the morning.   I have had their sandwiches and don't understand why people say this place is expensive!  It is super cheap and huge portions.   I would have given 5 stars but they aren't open on Sundays (when i want 30 iced lattes) and cash only.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wanted to come here for my birthday dinner, but ended up getting to Bar Six first.  But after pouring over the reviews (hello Jess C!), I still had to check it out. Plus, when I was deciding on a place for dinner, my friend declared, ""I want meat.""  That made the decision for us! Walked in with a friend to a very busy place with a small live music trio in the corner.  By some black magic we were able to be seated right away.  (I think it was because there were lots of parties of 4 and 5).   The tables are a super tight squeeze, so make sure you get yourself settled before you wiggle into your place.  That means take off your coat (a hostess will take it downstairs to coat check for you), your purse, get out your phone, go to the bathroom, etc) before you sit.  There is literally no room to move once you're in your chair.   (Which I should add, is not a terrible thing -- Cuba is a lively, electric, friendly place.  But if you're like me and have to squirm around and go into your stuff every five seconds, you're going to have a hard time.) For dinner, I had the Churrasco and swapped out the fries for maduros (sweet plantains).  I love churrasco and this was no disappointment, though I found the maduros a little on the dry side.   My friend Stephanie G. ordered the Pork Chop, and it came with two chops!  She was so giddy.  Everything was flavorful, and you get so much meat/food -- this is a great place to come when you're hungry! To drink, we had the Ginger Capirinha (very gingery), the En Su Punto, the winter pisco sour from the specials menu, and the Peruvian Dream.  All were boozy and all were greatly enjoyed. TL;DR: Come when you're hungry and want meat, boozy cocktails, and a flavorful slap in the mouth to the sounds of a live Habanera trio band.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'll keep going back until the day I leave NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have been to Alta several times, and finally feel compelled to write a review now that I've been and ordered ""The Whole Shebang"", which is one of everything they have on the menu (excluding cheeses)-- about 45 plates. I went with a group of nine people for a friend's birthday. Within 5 minutes after we ordered, the food started coming. And coming. And coming. It was being delivered so fast, it was overwhelming. And of course, we were all trying to get a little bit of everything, which is hard because tapas plates are generally pretty small. It was a lot of taking a half of a half of a scallop or a corner of a ravioli. So in that respect, it was a little difficult to share, because no one wanted to miss out on the good stuff. And also, a lot of the time you have no idea what you're eating. And I'm pretty sure I either didn't get some of the plates to try or they forgot to bring them to us... hard to tell. But fun too! In terms of the food... what I learned was that the things I had ordered when I had been to Alta previously were actually the best things on the menu. A lot of the other stuff was just ok. It would have been nice to probably have 3 plates each of about a 1/3 of the menu so that everyone could have more of the really good stuff. So I think that would be my recommendation... the 'Whole Shebang' is a neat idea and fun to try, but  if I did it again with 9 people, it might be best to just identify the things that everyone seems to want and get multiples of those. Here is a summary: The menu highlights (things I will order again)-- bacon wrapped dates and olives, whipped deviled egg, fried goat cheese with lavender honey, lamb meatballs, ""blt"", mozzarella skewers, ""pizza"", rosemary lamb, spinach / marscapone bruscetta, tuna tartar, scallops, brussle sprouts, shrimp/ chorizo skewers, fois gras, smoked duck breast, and braised short rib, and SANGRIA (they really have spectacular sangria!) things I wish i remembered/ knew what they were/ got to eat them (because they sound good) - will probably try next time: philidelphia truffle surprise, serrano ham wrapped okra, avocado relleno, summer corn risotto, grilled cobia Ambiance is great... it's big, two stories, and has an feel like feel sort of like a rustic old spain feel (not that i've been, but it seems like an appropriate feel for tapas). I haven't ever gotten spectacular service, but never had problems either. It's usually fast, quick, to the point. You get the feeling that they're trying to turn tables over quickly, which I guess makes sense as there's always people waiting. Overall, Alta is a new york institution for tapas... you really can't go wrong if you trust your instincts on the dishes, and the reviews seem to be fairly consistent in terms of what menu items are the best.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm rating this based on what it is, a food stand to go to after a heavy night of drinking.  Obviously I'm not rating this the same way I would at a sit in restaurant (although I've heard they recently opened one up somewhere downtown). I used to come here after every drinking session regardless of where I was.  If we were in Jersey we would have the soberest person go to the city and bring back 10 combo platters for the rest of the group who were too drunk (or lazy) to make it there.   I usually get the combo plater with 3 white and 2 hot sauces.  I'm usually the only one in the group that can finish the platter in one sitting.  The rest save it for a delicious hangover breakfast. Again this is an awesome place to eat after drinking and probably a decent place for a sober lunch (just doesn't taste as good).","[1.0, 0.0]"
Great pizza. Horrible service. They just take the orders out whenever so someone who sits down WAY after you could end up getting their pizza before you.

"I've had two mediocre meals here. for serious why is EVERYONE  so into this place?  I think it may be there is nothing like it in the neighborhood, We came for a Thursday night dinner and had the salad with chicken meatballs and the spinach pie. Both seemed (and I'm 99% sure were) microwaved as the textures were completely off.  We shared a piece of ginger cake with cream cheese icing that was pretty yummy and pretty heavy, but in a cream cheese, butter, lots of ginger way... I couldn't eat the whole thing, which really is saying something. I came for lunch and had a decent burger  with excellent fries, and shared a cupcake, the cupcake was tough and the frosting leaden, but I'm not a picky about leaden frosting (just leaden cake) if it tastes good, and it did. I came for brunch years ago and I liked it, but I never found it to be the life changing experience that everyone else does.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Sanford's is a nicely finished restaurant with an upscale vibe and a menu that reflects the upscale palate. When you walk in you will likely smell richness in the air, truffle oil and the delightful aroma of braised proteins permeate the restaurant. If you like more refined tastes, like lobster raviolis, truffle, scallops, mushrooms, and an array of sublime sauces, you will probably like this place. I had the Fried Calamari and the Diver Scallops. The calamari was excellent. They managed to learn how to fry it so the breading does not flake off. It is also not spongy. Imagine being able to bite apiece of calamari in half without having to gnaw away at it with your teeth. It was just right.  And the diver scallops with linguine was very tasty. The dish is served with four large diver scallops on a bed of linguine with mushrooms. I definitely recommend this place, and I will most certainly be returning.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The trick to these sandwiches is how they are made the originial individuals who still works their needs to make the sandwiches again. he is getting very cheap on the meat for the shwarama doesnt add enough sauce and is adding way to much red cabbage and lettuce to the sandwich. And what he is really lacking is the twist when the other servers would stick the tongs into the sandwich and give everything a twist so you not just biting into lettuce or cabbage.

Once seated, in the back room, service was quick! We had drinks after a minute or two, and ordered our food within five minutes. And the food arrived after about ten minutes! And was absolutely delicious. I had a chicken box, with fries (you get to choose which side you want). One of the very best fried chicken pieces I have ever had!

"A summer squall, an hour wait, self-service water and underwhelming Key Lime Tart did nothing to spoil a delicious evening on the deck at Brooklyn Crab. We four cosmopolitan diners of variegated age enjoyed a first course of crisp iceberg wedge salad with blue cheese dressing, comfortingly creamy clam chowder and ample shrimp cocktail. We took the plunge and did the Crab Royale experience - lobster, snow and king crab legs, Jonah and blue crabs, all dissected at our leisure. We recommend adding side orders of red potatoes with lemon parsley butter in which to dip all your sweet crab meat. Even the corn was sweet! But truly, as fine as the food offerings were the deep pleasure of Brooklyn Crab for us was the elemental atmosphere - sun, wind, clouds, blue sky, rainbows, sunset and the feeling that we were on holiday, yet so close to big bad Gotham. Our server, Kevin, (jersey number 33 1/3) however, was amazing. He was attentive, engaging, polite, knowledgeable, gracious and full of energy and fun. If you go, be sure to ask for him. We certainly will. If they only offered coffee we would give them a fifth star.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I tried the BBQ shrimp with fried grits - delish!  Not enough to share so get more than one because everyone will want some.  The chicken was crispy and hot - could have used a little salt or seasoning but it was good.  The macaroni and cheese NEEDS CHEESE!  I must teach restaurants how to make this southern style; they never get it right.  They do not have a large selection of desserts here, which was disappointing - with a name that include hothouse, bring it on please.

"I can understand being disappointed if you were to trek all the way out here for a sandwich, because it's always hard for something to live up to your expectations after a long ride. But if you happen to be in the area, then really this cannot be beat. It's cheap, and it's incredibly delicious. I'm all about the #1, my boyfriend loves the #3, and frankly you could polish off one of each before stopping to take a breath. Serious flavor explosion on a bun. That sounds like a retarded commercial, but I say it completely without irony. They make one of my absolutely favorite sandwiches ever.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Having been to the downtown Ippudo, I knew to expect a long wait so we went as early as we could. Dinner service starts at 5pm and we got there around 5:30 and were seated within 15 minutes. The bar/counter area was already full and the seated table area was nearly full as well. Despite the busy atmosphere, every server greeted us as we walked past and we received impeccable service. Our waiter was great, he was able to explain everything we asked about on the menu and kept a perfect balance between leaving us alone to our dinner and making sure we had everything we needed. Additionally, I was blown away by the fact that they switched our plates between each appetizer and took the time to explain each dish as they brought them to the table. It's this kind of attention to detail that sets Ippudo Westside apart from the rest. The food was extraordinary. I actually found myself enjoying the unique appetizers more than the ramen which was more or less the same you can find downtown. TAKO WASABI - raw baby octopus in a wasabi sauce. It reminded me of a japanese-style ceviche. In any case, it was very fresh and not as fishy as I expected. 5/5 PORK HIRATA BUNS - classic pork buns, nothing super special. I thought there was a little bit too much bun for the amount of pork but the sauce kept it from being too dry. 3.5/5 SUZUKI HAKUSAI- Seabass steamed in nappa cabbage and wrapped in yuba tofu skin. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. It took an unusually long time to arrive so we were left waiting for about 25 minutes but we were in such a good mood from everything that had arrived before that it didn't affect much. The sea bass is delicately wrapped in a cabbage and steamed so everything is incredibly tender and soft. I was scared that cutting through it would cause everything to fall apart but it was far from it. The sauce was light and seasoned just well enough to complement the seabass. 5/5 EBI AND KANI CROQUETTES - typical fried shrimp and crab appetizer. It was too creamy for my taste and you could hardly taste shrimp or crab, only cheese. 2/5 AKAMARU MODERN RAMEN - I have nothing but good to say about the ramen. Not too salty (my biggest qualm with most ramens) and definitely big enough to share if you plan on ordering a few appetizers before. 5/5 TL;DR Food is great, service is friendly yet professional. Come early if impatient.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went alone on a Sunday night around 6:30pm and waited about 40 minutes for a seat at the bar. I don't consider that a terribly long wait especially if the food is good. And indeed it was. Hirata Pork Buns - Good. Simply dressed with iceberg lettuce and mayo, the pork belly was glazed with their ""special"" sauce. They were as good as any I've had, but nothing terribly unique or exciting. Akamaru Modern Ramen - Amazing. Slightly chewy noodles in an ""intense"" pork and miso broth with half a soft boiled egg and piece of Berkshire pork. This is probably the most ""flavorful"" Japanese dish I've ever had. I don't think the price is too steep considering I'm likely to pay the same or more for a plate of pasta, which probably takes less work to make, at any decent Italian restaurant. The wait is the biggest downside. The staff can be quite loud as well. Friendly, but loud.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Been to many tea houses and this one is by far one of the worst in terms of the tea and the food they serve here. Firstly, this place is hard to find and you walk upstairs you would find a very Zen like place. It is beautifully decorated, hard wood floors and tables and has serene music playing in the background. There is also a water fall decoration on the side. The ambiance is definitely nice and relaxing. Staff here barely speaks English but they are very kind and helpful. It also gets crowded here. I been here about 3 times now because of the hype here. But would not be coming back because it is over priced and not worth it. I ordered the tea here and it is nothing out of the ordinary. I also had the green tea matcha topped with azuki. This drink is in a small thin glass with lots of ice. It cost $7!!! I literally took two sipps and it was gone. It taste good but matcha green tea does not cost that much. Let me calculate the cost to make this, I can get matcha powder for 40 grams at $5, $1- 2 azuki beans that is already made, milk, and sugar. I rather make it myself and I have and it taste just like this. Another time I had the dessert sampler and it came with tea and 6 tiny pieces of desserts. They were all very unmemorable- there was a biscuit with chocolate, a crispy roll with confection sugar on it, a bite of pie with raspberry and apply, a bite of a baked moon cake with red bean paste in it. This is sooo cheap and the taste lack sophistication. This cost $26. VERY UNSATISFYING! I also had the Mochi- black sesame, green tea, and chocolate- Nothing special here. I would not recommend this place for japanese desserts. I much prefer Panya which is on the same block as Cha-An because the desserts there taste so much better although this place a bakery and is not beautifully decorated like Cha-An.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had this place in my bookmarks...finally made it there last night.  They actually messed up our reservation, but sat us anyway, which was warranted since the place was not full when we got there.   We shared all our plates, which was just enough for 3 females.  The calamari was awesome!  Def suggest this as your appetizer.  We had the lamb chops and a special tortellini w/prosciutto in a white cream sauce.  The lamb was inconsistent as we each had one pc and each had a different take...one was dry one was good with lots of fat, and one was just ok.  The tortellini was pretty good, but did not knock my socks off.  If I was in the neighborhood, I would try it again, but there's a lot of other places on my list I'd go to first.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here with a client and had no clue that Hillstone was a new name for Houstons (which I was familiar with from other locations).   Took a seat in the bar area and ordered a few glasses of wine and spinach dip.  Prices are steep but when it's a business expense, much less painful.  The wine by the glass selection was decent but pricey.  The spinach dip was very good.   Service was definitely lacking.  It took almost 20 minutes to get someone's attention to get us a drink but after that it was decent.  They did remove my glass of wine before I was finished with it which was annoying. Four so-so glasses of wine and a spinach dip was over $80 with tip.  Come to think of it, business expense or not, that's ridiculous.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Only in NY  can one go to a sitdown restaurant and have amazing food at 1am....fried chicken at 1am......YES.   You're in NYC.....  Why not?  Outside of Asia, I am most impressed with NYC's late night dining options.   Blue Ribbon is easily one of my favorite restaurants in this great great city.   This  place is loud and bold like NYC yet delicious like....... NYC.    I experienced bone marrow for the first time at BR a few years ago.   Loved it then, love it now.  And loved it a month ago when I was in town.   The most delicious bone marrow dish to me , after trying bone marrow dishes in over 25 restaurants cross-country is at the Blue Ribbon.   BR's version is simple, luscious buttery marrow served in-bone with crumby rock salt .....oxtail marmalade....simple....... doesnt need anything else but a genius piece of toast and a wine that sends your boat asail.   You come to BR craving comfort food, maybe light fare, late at night when you don't want a half a cow between rye.  Is it appetizers,  a glass of wine with oysters, a pint, a grilled fish, a steak frites or something substantial that only a NYC hunger pang craves, driving you to visit?  Of course.     I've come here for an amazing oyster platter and a salad, a pasta, a dessert, an after dinner drink before bed @ 2am.   Once there, I can't not help but join the party of hungry loud patrons sharing my vision for late night ecstasy before going home. My favorite meal here?  Fried chicken and mash at 1am....... after the cold seafood platter to share.    I make no excuses for my insanity.   And Blue Ribbon does serve up an amazing fried chicken to seal your happiness for the evening:  perfectly crunchy garlicky teasingly spicy chicken, biscuit n honey, collards,  mash or French Fries and guaranteed, even my friends from the South will give this meal a thumbs up.    BR serves up a superbly delectable cold seafood platter that tempers a frigid NY heart....for a minute.  What's in it?  The freshest to the tooth Maine lobster, perfectly chilled prawns, a mosaic of clams, oysters, kelp peeking out of ice and a genius mignonette & lemon slices lodged in convenient places.   Add a Kir Royale and I go to heaven and back.   It's a NYC brasserie.  The food here is bolder, more daring, more inventive, more soulful and defines a different dimension to food than its Parisian counterparts.  Service here is brisk, interactive,  determined and focused.   Blue Ribbon symbolizes eating in NYC to me....... in caps.  Everreeyything is bawdy deeeeelisshus! Genius tip:  Come here late, after midnight if you can.   If you think you are the only hungry one, BR is also a late nite spot for NY chefs to share food and scandalous  moments in the kitchen (or elsewhere, LOL) with .......whomever.   Visits:  15+","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here with a friend and the quality of the food was embarrassingly poor. We waited a long time for it, only to have our appetizers arrive cold and my friend's pasta plate was clearly rushed - sloppy, badly oversalted, and very bland. She barely touched it. My pizza was overcooked and the quality of the ingredients was low. Come on guys, there are a million places in New York to get mediocre pizza, at least make an effort. On the positive side, the atmosphere was nice, our waiter did his best, and the dessert was good. But overall, this was a very poor experience and I won't be back. Also, $20 corking fee? Really? As another reviewer noted, it's not our fault you guys messed up on your wine license. Shamelessly gouging your customers to make up for your own mistakes is no way to make friends, Emporio!

"Very disorganized. I am extremely disappointed by the staff as well. Maybe they're not being paid enough, maybe they're not being appreciated by their management. Whatever it is - but customer service is terrible. The pastry lady was grumpy. The guy at the coffee station at the very entrance was plain obnoxious and self-involved. The ladies at the restaurant wait list don't seem to care you're there. The take-out pasta and pizza are overpriced and not good at all, especially for the price they're asking. Yes, Lavazza coffee is wonderful and the gelato is perfect, but the lack of organization and the lack of customer care are a deal breaker.

"I really want to give this pub a 4.5 out  of 5.  We waited an hour for brunch which seems pretty standard for this restaurant.  We started with the deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, and marinated olives (because at Casa Mono, the olives are juicy and meaty).  We loved all of the apps. The deviled eggs are fabulous but the chicken liver toast is outstanding. So smooth and so tasty. The seasoning is perfect.  For entree, we ordered the 'cubano' with gruyere, and the chargrilled burger with roquefort. The cubano, although tasty, was not oustanding. It lacked something - je ne sais quoi. It was very one-dimensional. The burger however was outstanding, cooked to perefection, juicy, and very very decadent with the roquefort.

I had to endure an entire conversation from the free-spirited hipster next to me about how she hated it when guys wanted to stay over, how being a doctor meant selling your soul and ""working to live but not living for your work"", and how she wanted to sell her eggs for money so she can travel and was highly surprised when they rejected her eggs because she had some disease that she ""purposely"" hid from them.

Yakitori was at worst mediocre, and at best really great. the chicken meatballs, the chicken heart, the shishamo, the chicken negima with green onion and the eringi mushroom were all outstanding. the rest was ""meh..."" the homemade tofu cooked in a hotpot was really great. oh yeah the quail egg for dipping was awesome.

It's not that the waitress was rude, she was just wasn't very attentive, rarely checking in on us. And for such a large automatic gratuity (for just a table of six), I expected at least attentive service. The other thing that killed the experience were the mosquitoes. Our table was mercilessly attacked from the main course to the time we left.

"Hello #44 Ramen Review! Yes, I love ramen enough to have tried 44 different ramen spots.  And yup, it is my favorite food!  And here is my take on it: THOUGHT: Good, but not worth the wait.  It had chicken broth, which made it very unique and different.  I'm used to pork base, and think I'll stick to it.  We waited 1.5 hours even when it was so hot and humid outside -__- MY ORDER: I ordered miso, and taste alone, it was 3 stars, OK.  Adding spicy sesame oil which was about $1-2 extra gave it a good and totally different taste!  I would recommend eating half of your miso bowl and then adding the sesame oil after, as if you had 2 different types of ramen bowls.   COMPARED TO IPPUDO:  If I had to pick one, I'd go to Ippudo.  Santouka is still my #1 though.  Totto noodles are better than Ippudo, but Ippudo broth is better and pork buns put Totto's to shame.   TIPS: Do NOT come with more than a party of 2.  I repeat, DO NOT COME WITH MORE THAN A PARTY OF 2 or you will be waiting for DAYSS. If you do, SPLIT UP.  Not worth waiting for 1.5 hours for, and you'll be much happier and less cranky when you finally get your ramen bowl.   SERVICE: sucked.  1/5 stars. We waited for 1.5 hours with 3 people and they almost split us up. I was about to throw a fit!! Seriously?! We waited 90 freakin minutes and you're going to split us up?!  After we ordered, some people left and I just grabbed those seats.  They were yelling at us to wait to see if it was okay and I was so pissed and didn't move.  So they let us.  Yea, THAT'S RIGHT.  Biatches. OVERALL: Wait and service was horrible, ramen was good but not great.  I came here once but I wouldn't waste my time going again unless there was no wait.  Not worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here with two others for a pre-theater dinner on Friday night. We were promptly seated upon our arrival for our 6:00 reservation. The atmosphere is nice. The food was good, the service was good. In a word, this place is... (you guessed it) good! I define ""good"" as better than OK, but not quite awesome or excellent. I would recommend this place for dinner in the Theater District, but I wouldn't classify it as a must try. That's the jist of the review. If you care about details, read on! The atmosphere, as I said, is nice. It's cozy without being small. Nothing in the decor really stands out in my memory, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The service was good. Our waiter was affable and efficient, and the support staff kept our waters filled, plates cleared, etc. Food came out pretty quickly, as one might expect from a place in the Theater District. The salads and entrees were tasty, but nothing exceptional. I enjoyed the two pasta dishes I tried, and I'm told the veal (which I don't eat) was quite good. Portions were just right: sufficient without being gluttonous. On to dessert. They wheel around a dessert cart to show you what your options are. There is a good selection, including house-made ricotta cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake, tiramisu, cannolis, creme caramel and poached pears. We tried the cheesecake and the creme caramel. Both were definitely above average. The cheesecake was in fact excellent. However, be warned that it's an Italian-style cheesecake made with ricotta cheese and is neither as sweet nor as dense as most people are probably used to. Finally, price. Considering the location, the prices are about what I'd expect them to be. You'll neither feel like you're getting a great deal nor being ripped off.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Usually when I am going to Japanese restaurant I mainly care about the food. However, this time I was so intrigued about the space ( they have booth for 10 people that contains glass table with white ropes underneath it) that I felt for a second  that  I was not  in New York ( Not sure which vibe I got but  it's defiantly felt like I was part of an Asian movie) The food and the flavors are more close to fusion but the chef 's food and the noodles are defined as pieces of originality( the place is known for making their own noodles) I would suggest to bring a date or a group of close friends that feels comfortable to sit in a place that reminds a flea market and sacred temple at once.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Time for the cranky old bartender to hang up his bottle opener. Sorry I offended you by asking for a drink as you gazed off into space. Reality check, buddy, customers ask for drinks.

"we have been eating here from the first day this restaurant has opened and have been regulars here ever since. at first it was great. they had wonderful food and great beer on tap and this was all true for the first few months. i really went there because they had hoegaarden on tap which was my favorite beer. first they changed the hoegaarden to bud light wheat. why you need three taps for bud products and take out a fine import in the process is beyond me. then i stopped going for awhile after this happened until i found they got southampton double white on tap. this was now my new favorite beer since i found it where they brew it at public house in southampton and when i knew riverwalk had it we began to go regularly once again. all of a sudden a few weeks ago they replaced this beer on me again and i was very upset but still ate that night and have not returned since. we do however still order take out from time to time. now every time we go to make an order, something we come to like is not available or as we are told by whoever answers the phone to take the order in there tries to change the menu. this has happened now at least a half dozen times. this last time was tonight where they told us they no longer had a simple turkey club sandwich. we refused to place the order and are getting chinese instead. i am greatly unhappy that this constantly happens. this is why you have a specials menu. you keep the regular menu mostly the same and try specials to see if they do well and get feedback from them, not constantly change the regular menu. how are you supposed to get used to anything if you keep changing it. you also do not constantly change your regular menu because most regulars come to like certain things and that is why they keep coming back. and telling the owner does absolutely nothing seeing as there is a new brother running it almost every time we go there. i am not spending any more money at a place that i am constantly unsatisfied and have to change my original order to something less appealing because of the regular changes that occur every single week there. and lastly we used to tell anyone we knew in the area to try it out because of how great it was and now unfortunately we have to direct people elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Crepes in New York are usually cheap replicas of what a crepe is meant to be. Typically you get an ultra thin pancake topped with the merest layer of nutella and underripe strawberries, folded into quarters. And then they shake the powdered sugar thing and say ""voila - dat'll be $6.00"" Check that preconceived notion at the door sil vou plait. A friend and I were hunting for dessert. Financier was closed so we wandered. And like any good New Yorker, we found another alternative. And struck GOLD. The menu was posted outside, the place was cute (maybe a smidge pretentious) and we wanted sugar. We were seated promptly at one of their maybe six tables and had a more than lovely waitress. He had a nutella crepe with bananas, and I thwarted the bikini gods and got my own crepe - raspberries and nutella. Both come with ice cream btw. The ambiance is perfect for a low key but elegant date (think tall dark and handsome with a side of espresso). And the crepes (savory and sweet) are as elegant and well thought out as the mood lighting. The crepes were to die for. Slightly crispy at the edges, paper thin. Filled with ripe fruit, covered with just enough, but not swimming, in our favorite chocolate hazelnut spread. Topped with a perfect globe of vanilla ice cream. And for $9, its cheaper than Chikalicious, you get a seat where they don't hassle you out the door, and you get a large portion. One side note - Management? Please get your own business cards.

"My first experience was with their chicken&lamb with rice last Friday when it was pouring. I worked late (Yea, sucks especially on a Friday). I had the cravings for a solid dinner. I read from Midtown Lunch that rain is usually the best time to go to The Stand. There was still a short line of people waiting, I bought it, walked through Times Sq. in the rain (without an umbrella like the silly monkey I always am), and took the train home. Even after it got cold, I enjoyed the meal very much. I like how I was in charge of the sauces myself and the container is aluminum (not unhealthier and cheap styrofoam like most places). I've tried a couple of other places around my office but they are not nearly as good as this cart. The one on 48th and 3rd is decent though in the flavor dept. but they're lacking in size...which will lead me into the discussion of the day. 53RD AND 6TH VS. SAMMY'S I have summer fridays now so I can bounce earlier but late enough to miss the full-on lunch hour rush. I decided to hit up the not-so-famous 53rd and 6th lunchtime cart. They are just as good in foodwise. You don't get your own sauces, portion seems a bit smaller but it is only $5, not $6 during evenings, and still aluminum container. I grabbed a seat somewhere close and devoured my chicken&lamb with rice. It was good street meats. I'm usually a chicken&rice kinda guy but I like to compare the flavors in the combo so getting The Mix has been more and more my usual now. I went back to my area to chill and relax a bit with buds. Afterwards, on my way home, I decided to visit Sammy's, the Chicken&Rice king in Jackson Heights, Queens. There was no long line but certainly a bunch of people wanting to order. I decided to get my current usual, walked about 10 mins. back home, and tried my best to enjoy dinner. The food was alright. Something was missing though and the guy probably thought I wouldn't notice. How about equal part Chicken? How do you mess up Chicken&Lamb with rice? Well, by giving me 90% lamb and barely any chicken. WAY TO GO! I don't know if this is because I'm not a usual customer but come on now! He heard me say Chicken AND Lamb. The guy, not Sammy, but his assistant, even told me to take a can of soda with me. I knew it was kinda suspicious but hey, free soda! I grabbed my ginger ale and walked home of course! Maybe he thought I wouldn't complain since I got a free soda but he could've told me to wait for the chicken. I'm patient enough to wait with the crowd. Maybe he just wanted me off on my way and sent me packing with carbonated delight. I'm not fond of their styrofoam but they will not get any stars taken away for it. Let's do a final breakdown: SAMMY'S Food is good, Sauces are ok, no presence on hot sauce, my combo priced at $6 but I didn't even get enough chicken and adding soda to the unhealthy mix is an unequal treat to me enjoying chicken.  I will give them props for their lamb, chopped into little chunks, and tasty. Portion is not hefty to justify $6 in Queens. Regular Basmati Rice is ok.   53rd and 6th (Day) Food is good, Sauces are ok, a better hot sauce, my combo is only $5 and this is in the City, not Queens, the slices of pita are a welcomed side, chicken is solid but lamb is average, not chunks, but slithers. Portion is decent for $5 in the City. Orange Basmati Rice is decent.   53rd and 6th (Evening) Same as day, except combo is $6 dinnertime price, you get your own sauces and still decent portion. Yes, much better than PUNY sammy's and their stingy $6 platter in Queens. The Winner: 53RD AND 6TH during Lunch. Somebody take away the Vendy that was ever awarded to Sammy's and make sure these guys get one! LOL.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Menu was very similar to their old one with some favorite dishes available (red sonja, carrot dip, veggie wrap, etc) but I was actually hoping for a food more options. The other reason for only 4 stars is the portion sizes vary between tapas style & entrée and it's not very clear on the menu.  I loved everything we ordered but we needed to order side dishes to supplement.   Decor, Location,  Service...5 STARS!

"Came here a few weeks ago to have dinner and drinks with my boyfriend and his friends. They have quite an extensive list of beers as well as various other spirits. They also have a pretty sizable food menu. I got a large order of their halusky dish, sans bacon, which can be described as being a coarser spatzle. It was really hearty and yummy, I guess you can it was typical of Eastern European cuisine. They also had this spicy chunky sauce, that went really well with my dish. The service was amazing. As we had a fairly large party and we ordered a sizable amount, the kitchen threw in one of their special appetizer (a salmon dish) and desserts (egg curd strudel) on the house. Amazing! Their drinks were good, the food was tasty, and the free items definitely helped seal the deal. I would love to come back here, though it's not exactly close to me. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is cash only.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Mediocre--lots of hype. I read quite a few reviews and decided to try Roberta's. I ordered the ""Famous Original"".  First, the ingriedients are NOT certified organic, and not certain. Secondly, the pizza is like papa john style (small triangles) and not NY style pizza. Mine was priced at $13 (which is outrageous if you consider what you're getting and what you're paying for), and each additional topping ranged from $1-$4, which is incredible.  The taste was OK.  I will not be going back. There are far too many pizza options to settle for this over priced hype. I am happy to pay the extra cost for organic ingredients and to support local venues, this one can do  A LOT better.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The menu is cleverly put together and I love how they experiment with the dishes (my British husband went for a scotch egg starter and a kebab for mains - the dishes were definitely not what you'd expect in the UK which isn't a bad thing!). The brunch menu is extensive and everything we ordered was fantastic. Whether it's eggs, granola or the fruit platter, everything came out freshly prepared with virtually no wait at all. The service is fantastic - the waiters are totally attentive and I really love the interior. Lots of reclamation wood, antique furniture and reminiscent of a speakeasy-style tavern from yesteryear.

"Wow, Saraghina.  We live in the neighborhood, and we probably get Seraghina take out twice a month.  The pizza is outstanding: Grimaldi's style but smokier.  Really, this is better then Grimaldi's pizza.  I always get the Bufala margherita pizza, which is incredible.  The pasta specials (which change daily) are outstanding.  In particular I've enjoyed an amazing spaghetti with clam sauce, and a kind of thick pasta with beef ragu. In warmer weather, we'll sometimes eat there (instead of take out), because the space is so incredibly charming/ romantic.  But we have kids, so we don't want to ruin the charm/ romance for everyone else...  (Note to parents: go between 5 and 6pm and the place is full of other families.  Go after 7 and you will seriously annoy the other [child-free] patrons.)  In all seriousness, the decor is stunning: has a sort of rustic Italian barn feeling.  During the summer, the garden is so gorgeous, it feels like you're transported to another world. Here are the only cons (which in my mind don't detract from my five star rating because the food is so outstanding): 1. They don't take orders over the phone.  I mean, I understand that they don't deliver, but it would be SO much easier if we could order before we come to pick up instead of ordering there and then waiting for the food.  This is a pizza place, after all... 2.  It's expensive, especially for Bed Stuy.  Spending $17 on a personal pizza is a little ridiculous.  But there are so few other options nearby, that we do it.  Like I said above, the food is worth it, but if it were a little cheaper we'd be able to eat there more often. 3.  It's doesn't cater to (or attract?) locals.  Sometimes we go there and feel like we're the only people who actually live in Bed Stuy.  I mean, of course I LOVE that people come to the neighborhood to eat, because it's great for the local economy.  But it would be nice to see more locals frequenting the establishment, a la Peaches down the street.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Three friends and I just returned from a miserable ""brunch"" at Morgans. The first sign of trouble came as we sat down and were told that only two of about eight brunch items were available. As they are still in their ""soft opening"" phase, we found this disappointing, but acceptable. When we tried to order coffee, we were told they don't serve it, as ""Texas barbecue doesn't do coffee."" This took a moment to process. Coffee is not available with brunch? The news alone was bad enough, but the attitude it was served with nearly had us walking out the door (spoiler alert: that would've been the better move). We placed our orders from our limited options, and then two of us set off to retrieve coffees down the block at Hungry Ghost. At least Morgans did not begrudge us the outside drinks. We received our food, (a bland breakfast burrito, a tasty but slider-sized pulled pork sandwich, an El Paso omelette, and smoked pork tacos). The taco order was missing its side of frijoles, so we asked the server for them. He dismissed the request, saying that they didn't come with the order. We were skeptical, but we finished eating without complaint. While waiting for the check, we took another look at the menu and saw that the beans, as we had already pointed out, did in fact come with the tacos. We again mentioned it to the server at the end of the meal, and he said that while he believed us, he would double check the menu. Once he returned, he acknowledged the beans did indeed come with the tacos. Server: ""The beans are coming out now."" Me: ""It's okay, we're done with our meal, we don't want them now."" Server: ""We can pack them up to go."" By that point, we had already finished up our meal, so it was too little, too late. Me: ""No thanks, maybe you can just take something off the price of the dish."" Server: ""I'll see."" Several minutes pass and the server said he wasn't going to take anything off the price. To review: no coffee, limited menu, small portions, big mistake to come here.  I created this Yelp account to warn fellow brunch and coffee lovers: don't eat here - the service is awful, and if you ask for what you ordered, you'll get served a whole lot of attitude instead.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Cons: - Small space - 1 bathroom (just sayin...) - Because the menu features whatever's available + in season, we couldn't try a dish or two my friend had really really enjoyed before on a prior visit - My particular risotto dish was a smidge tooooo rich for my taste (and there's nothing I love more than comfort food... not to say I didn't finish it :P) Mmmm I suppose that's it.

The salmon fetuccini was the low-light of the meal, it being gloppy, flavorless, and clearly not made with fresh salmon... the salmon was bone-dry and tasted metallic, like it was poured straight out of the can.

"Yup, one more 5-star review for Flat Top, which has quickly shown itself to the new jewel of the neighborhood. I really couldn't have been more pleased with my experience there this past Sunday. My wife and I were celebrating our first anniversary that night. We'd been out to Gramercy Tavern the night before for our ""big, fancy, celebratory meal"" and walked away delighted. So it was with that in the rear-view mirror that we decided to head out to this news spot a few blocks from our home the next night for dinner. While I'm not going to say that Flat Top surpassed the 6-course taster I had the night before, I will certainly say that it did not embarrass itself. I started with the mushroom risotto, while my wife had a basic salad. She was delighted by the inclusion of delicious mandarin orange slices. But we were both blown away by the rich, flavorful risotto. The portion size was appropriate, but had they served me 5 orders, I'd have been five times as happy. For entrees, my wife had the Mentaiko & Shiso Udon Pasta, which was truly unique. She described it as being almost an Asian mac and cheese, the warm gooeyness balanced by the cold cod roe. It's totally unusual, but it works really well. I had the Creekston Skirt Steak a la Flat Top which was served with chimichurri sauce on top. I was between that and the burger, but our waiter said the chimichurri sauce couldn't be beat. Honestly, the sauce wasn't so amazing, but it was fine and I did enjoy the steak. It comes on a sizzling skillet, so be prepared for it to stay hot and keep cooking a bit. Overall, I really enjoyed Flat Top. Further, I can't wait to go back, as there were several items on the menu that I still want to try. Oh, and I should point out that the wine and beer lists are both quite strong. Plenty I'd like to try there, too! There are now 5 superlative restaurants between Columbia and 125th St and several more that more than hold their own. It's a fine time for uptown dining.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The lighting was perfect as well. On top of the awesome decor and ambiance, the food was my favorite part. Everything my friends and I ordered (Basil fried rice, beef, calamari, tom yum, thai chicken wings, fried tofu, pad thai) tasted amazing.

"This little restaurant is truly a Hole in the Wall. The interior is small and might not look that pleasing, the kitchen is open and whenever someone enters the restaurant the cold wind blows in.... but wait until you have their food! I had a beef noodle soup with a couple of baos. The soup was perfect for this cold weather. The noodles were soft, the meat tender, and the broth was excellent.  When a soup is good we Asians like to express in this way: refreshing. The baos were delicious as well. When u r in Chinatown (Manhattan) definitely check it out!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Worst service ever. It turns out that if you aren't draped in furs and have an attitude to boot you won't get your water glasses refilled, you certainly won't get bread, and forget about bread. Our server hardly spent a moment to go over other items on the menu, and would walk away for extremely long periods of time without checking in on us. I unfortunately can't give less than one star, but if I could I would. Also it's a kick in the mouth considering it wasn't that full, and he easily could have handled the three tables. So if you want half assed service and terrible wait staff then please do come.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went there last Saturday without a reservation, and we got seated right away!!  Considering how everyone's been telling me that I should expect at least 1 hr's wait, I was quite happy. The Tavern was relatively low-key with a friendly and laid back atmosphere.  The decoration was understated, but chic. I went for the Grilled Octpus for appetizer, and Duck Confit for main course.  Can I just say the Duck Confit was DELICIOUS!!!  The duck was extremely tender, in richly flavored soup, while the skin was absolutely crispy!! Overall, it was a very good experience at a modest price!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"this place was about an hour wait for two people on a saturday (around 1pm). we finally got seated around 2. the place is kind of snug as we had to sit at a 6 person table with 2 other people sitting at the other end of the table. conversations didn't overlap but it was inconvenient getting in and out of the table because i had to bother the people sitting next to me. we ordered the duck confit and the steak and eggs. i also go the apple cider (virgin). the waiter kindly came back to tell us that the kitchen was backed up and that the food would be a few more minutes. my bf liked that the waiter was kind enough to tell us that instead of making us wait (which most places do). however, i already waited an hour and was waiting an extra 20-30 minutes to eat--at least hook up with some free bread to nibble on. the portions were on the smaller end and i was initially worried that my bf and i would get hungry. the duck was pretty dry. my hangar steak was tiny but cooked well and flavorful (maybe a tad bit salty). overall the food was more of a 3.5 stars for me. the apple cider was good (they had a real cinnamon stick in there). since there is no such thing as .5 stars, i will round up and give 4 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had brunch today with my parents and my wife. The wait was fairly long, both to be seated and to be served, but the food was patently delicious. Similar to Queens Comfort in some ways (small space, communal tables, unusual artwork, odd drinking glasses, decadent food, rather loud). The artwork on the walls is very unusual, but it is not overdone. I got a Fingerling Potatoes Poutine with gravy, gruyere, potatoes, and hardboiled egg, maybe shallots or onions (?). I believe it was a new addition to the brunch menu as it is not listed on the website. Really delicious and really, really filling. Made me very thirsty (probably very salty I guess?). My wife got the grilled cheese (cheddar and mozzarella) with the tomato soup and thought it was great, though the bread-to-cheese ratio was high (then again, the bread is a brioche). The restaurant is difficult to locate on the street because they have no awning; I'm tempted to not describe where it is to prevent it from being even more crowded next time we go! But no, it's a narrow black storefront across from the library, between a Subway and the umpteenth Pollos A La Brasa Mario.

The place was packed I have to say, so we continue sipping our sangria's and waiting. The hostess looked kind of confused but was really nice, she call the manager for a more accurate time and 40 min later we got seated, Was past 8 so the half price tapas was over but we were able to grab some tapas at this price.

"BBQ you can smell from the BQE The brisket is more tender than a teddy pendergrass ballad, wings hotter than a night with Kate Upton, and cole slaw cooler than that time you saw yourself on google maps street view. Megan and Rebecca kept the drinks and good vibes flowing all night. The bearded pit master dude was the main hoss, and all the other staff seemed like friendly, trained professionals. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, which is good if you're the type of person who often sends food back to be remade and fears that an annoyed cook might leave you a little present. All in all, a 5 star experience. This place is as real as it gets.

"We had a great dinner, booked through Open Table.  Our server, Ashley, was friendly, helpful, and fast.  We had the selection of spreads-- yogurt, chickpea, eggplant, and tzatziki-- with warm pita and the meatballs to start, and both were amazing.  The dips were just the right texture and flavor combos, the eggplant especially light and vegetal, instead of glutinous as eggplant puree can be.   The sheeps' milk ricotta dumplings with spicy lamb sausage was amazing-- the dumplings were so soft and light.  One of the group had the lamb chop special with a rice & spinach side-- perfectly cooked chops w/ the right amount of lemon juice & olive oil.  The last member of the group had the lamb shank with orzo, and it was cooked perfectly as well-- flavorful, not greasy, incredibly tender. We split the greek yogurt with honey, slivered almonds and quince for dessert.  Rich and perfect.  The french press coffee was a nice touch.  The red wines we ordered were unfamiliar but delicious. No problems with the reservation, the seating, or our noted need to get out in time to get to the opera.  We would definitely return.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The shrimp on the cold platter had too much old bay. I am a fan of old bay, but this was excessive. It looked as it the shrimp had not been de-veined because of all the old bay. The raw oysters were the only good items on the platter. I also ordered snow crab legs. These were overcooked.

"The House of David is in the hands of Sultan and Waleed, and the pastrami is delicious. The sign out front says $5 pastramis.  The sign hanging inside says $8 pastramis.  The piece of paper on the counter offers pastrami: $5 for small, $8 for medium and $11 for large. A small pastrami on rye with mustard is perfect for lunch.  The venue is a tiny two-table dive on Nostrand, and I think the reviews here are overblown. The girlfriend noted the bathroom was very clean, which is always a good sign.  A fellow diner explained she thinks they changed ownership and moved from their previous location across the street about six months back. Versus Katz's Deli?  David's is less of a schlep from Brooklyn, less pretentious and a better price.  That said you can hit Katz's 24 hours, and the place will feel alive and inviting, and afterwards you're on the Lower East Side.  Bedford is not without certain charm, but I'd say David's for the quick, inexpensive lunch and Katz's for the touristy deli-night-out.

"I decided to go here one afternoon because i always wanted to try Juliana's. The long lines usually deter me. This one particular afternoon a friend and I basically had the restaurant to ourselves.Service was prompt the staff was pretty ok. The first plus for me was them having  Angry Orchard on tap. I ordered the Margherita it was tasty and the ingredients were FRESH!! Service was quick no real complaints there.  I also appreciated that the restaurant gives you  the option of using either cash or credit. The other pizza joints in the area are cash only. For me I will say this pizza is MUCH better than Grimaldi's. I returned for a second visit one chilly evening. I was lucky enough to be graced by Patsy himself. He was very friendly and it was a pleasure to see the pizza legend himself.This chilly evening I opted for a bowl of pasta pasilli. It was a tasty soup that definitely took the chill off. Once again I had the Margherita and it was actually better on my first visit, but it wasn't bad.I don't know something just seemed a little different. All in all if you are looking for a light pizza with a thin crust this is your spot! All of the flavors compliment each other rather than one overpowering the other. This pizza leaves you feeling satisfied not heavy and bloated.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place definitely is a MUST GO when in the Northside.  Couldn't decide what to have for dinner one night as I walked around a bit I ended up in front of Oasis.  Not having had a falafel in a long time and after remembering reading the great reviews here I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  Like everyone else mentions for the price -- $3.00 for falafel sandwich and .50 extra for hummus, which I gladly added, it was worth every dime and then some.  At first I thought that perhaps I would have liked a few more toppings but after I ate my sandwich I quickly changed my mind and thought it was perfect just as it was.  A Snapple on the side completed my meal for a total of $5 CAN'T BEAT THAT WITH A BAT :)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"blargh. after a harrowing drive to the southside in a borrowed car i was famished and really, really psyched to finally try moto. i loved the space, the odd shape of joint and the whole tim-burton-does-retro-paris decor. our server was a lovely gent and i settled in prepared for mindblowing goodness. i was really disappointed, actually. our wines were great; a really tasty cote du rhone and super sparkling rose. our entrees, however, left much to be desired. i got the panini with pear, honey and brie and was startled at how  something made with such inherently amazing ingredients could be just downright icky. the bread was kinda hard, the pears were pure mush, there was certainly a dearth of brie involved and the greens were slimy and looked like they had just come from the bottom of the salad bag. my side of greens looked pretty much the same; sludgy and black and plain inedible. friend #1 got the mac and cheese which again, should be simple to make incredible. but it was super watery and the flavor wasn't that great either. friend #2 got the special which was essentially chicken parm with a side of mashed potatoes. the potatoes were great, but the chicken tasted like freezer and/or something i could have made and screwed up myself at home. we skipped dessert and instead dashed across the street to the ice cream truck that was pulling up. and we were still starving an hour later. maybe i went on an off night (a REALLY off night) but i dunno. i don't think i'll be back to give them the opportunity for redemption. boo, moto.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"the food here is fantastic, but check out the glass heated display cases PAST the $7.99 buffet for the real deal, hot, delicious authentic Korean food on the cheap. I got Beef Bulgogi with a kimchi pancake with choice of soup, salad or kimchi for the really low price of $6.50, and not some small portion either, it was chock full of beef, onions, and a really great multigrain purple rice, enough to take half home, and I am no lightweight. The buffet is a good price for quality Korean food, but the varieties of cheap excellent food in the cases directly past on the right side as you enter is a way better deal. I gave 4 stars only because I didn't see my favorite dishes in the buffet, it seems to cater to a more Americanized palette for the hot food, but at 1pm, it may have been a fluke. I started to fill my dish at the buffet, but soon realized, I didn't want anything there. (Sorry to abandon the togo tray guys, but at $7.99/lb, I didn't want general tso style chicken).

"Cool, cozy Mexican place with really good food that tastes as Mexican 'should' - but not spectacular or anything surprising.  Meaning, their tacos (for example) you pick from pork, chicken, steak, shrimp, fish, or veggie.  All toppings are traditional as well. They're all very good. Just not necessarily memorable. The place itself is pretty small and I prefer to sit at the bar (like I do at most places). It's well decorated and has a cool vibe, especially at night (though it's nearly constantly packed thurs-sat).   Drinks here are actually really good & strong. And $9 for a base margarita up to $11 I think is actually really well priced, especially for this area in LES. I think their spicy or grapefruit margaritas are particularly raved about here. Ate a torta for brunch one day and it was actually really good - bread was crispy, ingredients fresh+juicy, and everything was cooked well together.  Guacamole here tastes like general Guacamole but the chips are usually warm & fresh which is a big ++plus.  Steak plates looked good as well. Definitely a fan of the restaurant and am thoroughly happy whenever I come here, though I tend not to pick it often since it doesn't stand out to me in an area so dense with places that do.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm usually there on Friday or Saturday night, and even though there is a long line it always goes very fast. I'm on keto (low carbs), So I'm usually getting the chicken (extra meat) on salad (no rice, no pita). The food is really very good, specially after a few drinks. It's also cheap and very filling. The lamb is very good as well, however most of the lambs used in gyro in NY have carbs ""fillers"" added to hold the meat together...no way to know in this case...I still have it time to time :) (Fellow ketoers, the white sauce should be a no-no though). Also, I would say that the guys working there are always very friendly and nice...which was kind of unexpected the first time I went there since the line is always very long and they have to work fast. The exact same food is also on 52nd and 6th and 53rd and 7th where you can have your food even faster.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This restaurant is brilliant from its cozy decor and simple but thoughtful wine list, to the amazing execution of everything that I've tried to date.

"For the price, and because I always went for pick-up, I loved this place.  The amount of food you get for the price is almost unbeatable for the quality.  My mom is Malaysian, so I know what good Malaysian food is supposed to taste like.  While I still haven't found anything close to authentic, this is one of the better impersonations.  But if you can't book yourself a flight to Malaysia anytime soon, this will definitely more than do.  The Roti Canai is always devoured instantly. And then the Nasi Lemak.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Our evening began with cocktails at the bar. I had the Rickshaw and the Slow Storm - they were crisp and refreshing. Especially the Rickshaw, which I highly recommend. For appetizers, we had the Red Ruby Shrimp. It literally felt as if I died and went to heaven! Next we had a palate cleanser which consisted of goat cheese stuffed into a puff pastry. It was very delicious and left me wanting for more. For the main course, I had the sea bass with a yogurt based sauce. Light and refreshing - it was simply amazing. This was followed by another palate cleaner - a cream tart with blueberries and raspberries. The atmosphere was great! I highly recommend this place if you're in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Luckily their grilled cheese is good.  I'll give them that. Their atmosphere during the day is entirely different than the energetic bar scene in the evening.  I had a hankering for a grilled cheese so decided to make the trek to the other side of Astoria.  I walked in and asked if there was room for 1 and was told that there was at the communal table.  What I realized was that the tables for FOUR were allowed to be occupied by ONE person and their supplies for the day despite the fact that none of them were eating.  All that they had was a coffee.  Here I was trying to have a full meal and was told to squeeze in between a couple of other patrons and their laptops.  For what was supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable lunch, I was a little annoyed.  I sat there for a good 10 minutes before anyone came by and then I was handed a menu and told that they would get me some water.  More time passed and a different waiter finally asked if I was ready to order.  I told him that I was and that I was also waiting for the water I was promised a while ago.  He got me water and then came back and took my order.  I got the mozzarella & cheddar grilled cheese with tomato soup.  I then asked if I could have a side of the Kitchen Sink Salad because from having ordered it before, I knew it was very large.  I was told that wasn't a problem.  Food and a latte came and I noticed that the salad wasn't the Kitchen Sink salad but just greens.  I asked why that was and was told that they don't do sides of the Kitchen Sink salad.  This was the same waiter as the one who took my order.  I thought maybe there had been some confusion when I placed the order so I didn't push it.  Then I realized that it was just somebody being lazy, a jerk, or both.  The party that sat down after me got their sides of Kitchen Sink salad. I was annoyed by the atmosphere of the place and the lackadaisical service that I just got up and left.  Maybe your patrons that just linger and borderline loiter and use your free WiFi all day are who you are used to serving but there are some people, like me, that would like to pay for a decent lunch and get out in a timely manner.  I won't be heading back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I could drink straight up outta the bottle! the service was simply fantastic! they really cater to your needs and care abt each person to enjoy their meal. and icing on the cake is that its all so affordable! definite a must try! it's great for groups, great for a date spot, literally for any occasion.

"Ahhhhh...nom nom nom. I've had several meals here in the span of a few months and I really think I can say, this is one of my fave restaurants. Tapas style is really the way to go, giving you the opportunity to try as much of their varied menu as possible. They change the menu seasonally, so I do try to come whenever I can. The staff here is approachable (not snooty at all). And if you have 3+ people, definitely go the way of the chef's tasting menu. It's by far the only way you can try a wide range of dishes and get the most bang for your buck.

"I am a restaurant enthusiast and I happen to own 5. I also won Iron Chef. What I do know if while the food was good and the service was immaculate the way whoever owns this restaurant allows the managers to run it is despicable. I had a problem with my order, rack of lamb to be cooked medium and it came out rare. No big deal someone just didn't feel the meet properly or maybe a slow burner or a cold oven. Either way quick fix, however my waiter informed a manager and he continued to sit at the table with his friends drinking in the open on the floor. Now me personally yes socializing is a part of the job however 20 minutes later and I was watching and counting and 3 drinks the manager proceeded to get up and walk downstairs not to be seen again for another hour. I understand there is a lounge downstairs but when I went down to take a peak at the rest of the decor he was again no where to be seen. I am astonished that the owners of such a well spoken of restaurant would allow this sort of non professional behavior to be conducted in their restaurant.  Lo an behold the manager re appeared and continued to sit with his friends until me and my associates left. To our great disappointment Cafeteria was not all that we had hoped it would be. I will not be recommending the restaurant nor will my associates  because you have to wonder if the managers on duty can be getting drunk and not care about the other tables in the restaurant what kind of a example are they setting for the rest of the working environment, and how much detail actually goes into what they do. Management aside thank you to our server for attending to our ever need and being so tentative.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Possibly The Most Annoying Meal I Have Ever Been Ripped Off For.... Just returned from dinner at Minetta Tavern and I turhtfully don't understantd the allure... ""Okay"" food in a totally overcrowded,, uncomfortable dining room.....At very expensive pricing given the atmosphere, comfort level and overall atmosphere. My party of five were seated at a table intended for possible three.. located in the path of waitstaff and maitre'd's constantly bunking into you.. My view was of the bread station and a pole to my left..... Our waiter was extremely pleasant, but he could not make up for the complete discomfort I was subjected to.  Every time a wiater or bus person walked by, my left shoulder and arm was hit, pushed, bunked into... we kept trying to move the table a bit to avoid this.. but to no avail.. the space is too small and there are far too many table ""shoved in"" to make this a pleasant dining experience. The food was ""good"" .. not great as some tout.. and the prices are not in line with the type of seating one has to endure... this is NOT fine dining.!! I wonder how the fire department is paid off to allow such a crowded space... All in all, although it is one of ""the"" places to be seen.. I would certainly rather be sitting in a space where I could enjoy my meal. Minetta Tavern just isn't it ........","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was visiting New York and staying over for the first time in my adult life.  I was 36 hours into recovering from redeye and 36 hours into shell shock of everyday Manhattan.  Wow, it is different.  I took a taxi to where I thought my buddy's studio would be, using my faulty memory to recall the address, and ended up having wasted a precious day and precious taxi money running around Roosevelt Island miles from his place.  Anyway I was told Riverwalk near the Metro might have wifi and it was not a Starbuck's so I dropped in and had a beer while trying to figure out my next move. The bartenders-- all of them-- were unfailingly helpful and friendly.  I took the bartenders' suggestions for an afternoon snack and wine and it was all good and not expensive. (Hi riverwalk grill guys from California... you all rock) Not only that but even the customers seemed nice and upbeat.  Not like Friends or Cheers, just mellow and laid back.  I had a chat with a lady at the bar who for some reason I assumed was down and out but it turned out she was a successful trader just cooling off for the evening (and friendly, even to me). I stopped by for what I thought would be a few minutes to rest and spent a few hours enjoying myself.  It was the turning point in my sojourn to NYC.  That's the kind of place this bar is.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'll make this review short and sweet.  The pizza is fresh, delicious and made with care.  The worn down/age of the restaurant gives it character and creates a certain ambiance Unfortunately, the price is ridiculous.  The slices are small.  Yes they are delicious, but they are tiny and a cheese slice is $5.  I am an average sized man and would probably need to eat 4 to be satisfied.  So I'm sorry, but purely based on quantity, Di Fara is not worth it. The wait, even for a slice is also quite long.  This isn't a big deal as you pretty much know this going in, it shouldn't be a surprise that a slice with sausage takes about 20 mins. to prepare.  So be warned, this will not be a quick meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

i have never written any review for any establishments but i felt compelled to write a review for this one. i have eaten at numerous restaurants from high end to low end but i have never felt the need to write even when the food were bad because the service were at least decent. filipino people are known for their hospitality but somehow jeepney's staff failed basic hospitality 101 miserably. i love filipino dish and someone tried to impress me by taking me to manhattan to eat at jeepneys but this place was a big disappointment and not even a contender. the place wouldn't let us in when we arrived at 4:53pm saying they didn't open until 5:00pm despite of the rain and my cousin asking if we could just stand in the corner to wait the male host didn't want to seat us for our 5:00pm reservation because one person in our party was missing but on her way to the restaurant. he stated that we will be seated once the entire party was present? once seated the waitress spilled the water on the table to which she wiped and my cousin asked for a mop because the water dripped between the tables and wetting our pants and shoes to which she said someone will mop it but we never saw casper arrived with his mop. i guess the waitress assumed that since we were already wet from standing in the rain waiting for them to let us in at 5:00pm that the water dripping under the tables and onto our clothes shouldn't have bothered us. the food was pricey and the taste was lacking. i have been to several fine dining establishments and if this place is comparing themselves to a fine dining it should at the very least improve their standard of operation to start with and gradually move towards improving the taste for the price they charge. i enjoyed manhattan but jeepney's isn't one of them. i would suggest going to jersey city instead if someone really wants to taste some good filipino dish.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"i finally got to the Brooklyn Beet Company. It is a super cute, farm to table, kind of place. I have only heard good things. Today I ordered up my favorite drink, the Bloody Mary. I saw it was premade. No big deal-it saves time, i get it. I took the first sip-terrible. It was more like a horseradish drink. Huge chunks of horse radish took over my mouth. Im not sure if they understand that lots of horseradish does not a bloody mary make. No olives. No olive juice (that i could taste). No hot sauce. No black pepper. It was nothing but horseradish, ice and tomato juice. gross. BUT THEN...YALL...BUT THEN! THE FOOD CAME OUT! i ordered the korzo burger with a side of greens and cole slaw. it was amazing. the burger was perfection with applewood bacon and some kind of sauce. what was it? i dont care because it was amazing. the greens consisted off beet leaves (surprise surpise) and tomatoes and an amazing rosemary-lemon vinaigrette.

The rest of the pizzas blended together...sausage, arugula, mushrooms, prosciutto. It's difficult to really go wrong if you order a pie. The real surprise was that they also managed to conjure up a fierce calamari fritti and carbonara. The service is quick and constantly making sure wine glasses are filled and food is on the table.

"As a chef who specialized in Italian cuisine since the beginning, I can honestly say that eating here and tasting authentic Sicilian cuisine was a learning experience as well as one of my most memorable meals at a Restaurant in New York. We rarely see true regional dishes on a menu. Sadly, Americanized dishes like Chicken Parmigiana (which does not exist in Italy) have become standard on menus not to mention overly filling. True Italian cuisine is light, consisting of ingredients a person would grow in a garden or catch fishing. More importantly, real Italian fare is more than just food... its a memory. When I sat down to eat, I felt like I was at Sunday dinner with family and friends that I've known my whole life. The staff was polite, fast and incredibly hospitable. I had the wood fired artichoke and arugula salad as an appetizer. Never have I tasted a more perfectly cooked artichoke in my life. I can say the same for the whole market fish of the day which was a red snapper. I asked the waiter if I could speak to the chef, to find out his secret... To my delight, the owner Nick Accardi came over and gave me peak at their hand crafted brick oven, which was imported from Italy and made with clay from Mount Vesuvius. After dinner He invited me to come back to make pizza and to show me how fish cooks perfectly in the wood burning brick oven... which I eagerly accepted and came back the next day. I felt like a kid in a toy store getting to play with a new bike. I left Tavola Incredibly inspired, wanting to go back to my kitchen and cook up as many memorable experiences as possible.

"Horrible experience. Went in and asked how long for a table for 2. The host, a guy with glasses, a beanie, and a tattoo on his arm, said has a table for us right away; just give him one second. He did not take down our name even though he has a clipboard, which is understandable since he said he will be seating us shortly. That second turned into 30 minutes. He seated everyone behind us, including other parties the same size as us. When confronted why another party of the same size that came after us was seated before us, he said he was under the impression that they came first. The girl clearly came in behind us. She had asked the same question: how long for a table for 2. He said the same thing, he might have a table for them; just give him one second. The guy was unethical, unprofessional, and rude. He promised to make it up by giving us the next table, but ignored us and seated everyone behind us till there was no one left standing until us. We decided it was just not worth it and left.   There are plenty of delicious brunch places around the area. Chances are I won't be coming back again. Bad service is enough to ruin any meal.

"I came here on a Friday night for a first date and it was fantastic. May have helped that my date looked amazing. They have some really great selection of beer on tap and bottled, but their wine list wasn't huge. It was interesting though, I noticed one that was featured which was boxed wine (brings me back to the Franzia chugging college days where I'd just pull the bag o' wine out of the box and squeeze it down my gullet) but the sommelier explained that just because it comes in a box doesn't make it shitty wine. I agreed but stuck to wine from a bottle. Call me old school. Oh and the name of the bottle alluded to the Dick in a Box Justin Timberlake SNL skit song which we found pretty entertaining. The food was very well done, presentation and taste were on point. I really like the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It had red walls and was quite lively but not too loud to where we could hear the next table (or worse, they could hear us) but still loud enough to have the night amount of energy.

"How fun are soup dumplings?  Pretty freakin' fun!  I ordered out from here today and I really didn't know what to expect.  I thought the dumplings came in soup...but they are FILLED with soup... soo cool.   We had to wait ten minutes for our pork/crab meat filled buns, so while we waited, we read the Time Out, City Search, etc articles in the restaurant window.  I loved the cartoon that explained HOW to eat a soup dumpling.  THANK GOD.  If I hadn't read that, my mouth would be scorched and I would be soo out of Yelp commission for like a week, at LEAST!  I had my spoon and chopstick, took a little nibble, sucked out the soup (garlicky and oddly thick!) and casually ate the rest of the dumpling.  I was happy that I got take out because I feel the walk back to work sort of cooled the dumplings down. Overall, if you're looking for dumplings, enjoy the experience, don't expect some magical spell to be cast on your tastebuds.  They were good but not like amazing...just more fun.   I have no other soup dumplings to compare them with but judging from the crowd and line, I can at least attest to the fact that they are fresh!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Cheese Grill (which is the new official name) is the perfect addition to the Lower East Side neighbourhood. Between the delicious food, great selection of local beers and wines, excellent prices, and (the best) staff, this new establishment deserves far more than 5 stars. I highly recommend the Crispy Goat sandwich. If you have a sweet tooth, the brioche with banana and mascarpone cheese is simply heavenly. You couldn't ask for a more attentive and friendly staff (shout out to Mike!), who are also very knowledgeable about wines. They truly make you feel very welcome and the ambiance has that community/homey feel. It also has a chill vibe (almost reminds me of some cool places in Santa Monica, CA), and on top of it they have a great music playlist! I live in the LES area and I know Cheese Grill is going to be my new watering hole. I'm craving the Crispy Goat right about now!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Ive been here multiple times and every time I come I wonder why I came again. The wine is the  only saving grace of this place ~ the food is ok at best and grossly under delivering for what you would expect but the worst part is the service. Every waiter and bartender is too cool for school and cant be bothered with any opinions other than their own. I thought a place that was driven by a love for food and wine would be open to a dialougue that allows place for hearing what their customers prefer. Apparently here its eithere their way or the high way. This wil definitely be my last time at any terroir locaction.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went into this place during lunch and all tables were taken. Had the chicken shawarma with rice & it was good. I've had better...but it wasn't great! It's a little place with a small menu, but they get the ""mediterranean"" part right. Worth a visit!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I stopped here on my way home from buying my awesome new running shoes and since I left a review for them, I had to stop by and write up a quick one for this fabulous place! Love pretty much everything here. You really can't go wrong. The hardest part is figuring out what to get. I usually get a panini but also indulged with a cheese plate this time as well. Oh and get dessert! I usually don't go for the Crumbs cupcakes since they are outrageously large and would rather fill up on crostini, antipasti etc!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Waited for more than 15 minutes on a Friday night despite having a reservation. The maître d' explained that people were not showing up on time for their reservation and caused the shortage of table. After being led to our table, I noticed there were at least 2 other tables that were available, is it shortage or operational issue? As expected, the suckling pig was sold out, since 8:30 according to our server. She then recommended the Malfatti al Maialino, which is a hand torn pasta dish with suckling pig ragu and topped with argula. We ended up getting the Speck and Crostone di Fegato to start and Pollo alla Diavola and Malfatti al Maialino for entrees. The speck and chicken liver crostini took a while to come, but we were busy enjoying our Barbera a'Alba and the bread basket. The bread sticks were my favorite. The speck was delicious but I'm still very much partial to the Spanish Iberico ham from Despana. The crostini was very rich and the balsamic vinegar really made the dish. We waited a while more for the main course but when I took the first bite of the grilled chicken, I had to admit that the wait was worth it. The chicken was moist, well seasoned and the pickled chili added such intense flavor to the dish. I took a few bites of the suckling pig pasta and it was fantastic. As usual, we inhaled the food and did not save room for dessert. We walked by the bread/dessert station on the way out and saw that they were turning out some really delicious-looking treats. Next time, we'll call ahead for the suckling pig and explore their dessert menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Abandon all diets, ye who enter here. Stick your elbows out and ready your hands to hang on to a delicious arepa. No, I doubt that they are good for you in terms of calories, but they are total satisfying comfort food and therefore you owe it to yourself to indulge at least semi-regularly. As a veggie, I can highly recommend both the Domino (white cheese with sweet & savory black beans) and the Guyanese Tropical (yummy salty cheese with sweet plantains and creamy avocado). I'm not a big eater but I can still down both of these in one sitting on a good day, especially if I order a tangy Brown Sugar Lemonade to wash it down. I have no complaints about these well-portioned, tasty arepas, except for the fact that the arepa itself does occasionally get a little soggy or slippery - though it's usually not a problem. The restaurant itself is small but well managed, everyone I've dealt with so far has been friendly and attentive. If you're in need of some good, solid food, get yourself a few arepas.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In its way as startling as El Bulli. Clearly grounded in a country's cuisine traditions but elevating them to very great heights of flavour, subtlety and intensity.

"This was our first order, so my opinion might be biased. We ordered for delivery. We live pretty close by and it took 35-40 min. On their website it doesnt specify what method should be used for delivery, just says we accept cash or cards with a min. of 10dlls. When the delivery guy came he told us just cash. The prices are quite affordable considering the portions. I had tuk tuk tofu and it was a little bit bland.. fortunately I had sriracha sauce in the fridge. I think more than not being spicy, it lacked some flavor.. the tofu should be marinated maybe a bitore. However my husbands dish- pork ribs were delicious and the veggies really tasty! Our dishes came with white jasmine rice.. big portions. I will maybe taste other dishes in the future and update my review.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Man, is their food good. Boy do they suck at actually getting it to you. Habana Outpost is, in some ways, a victim of their own success. Their beer is cheap. The space they occupy is awesome. Their food is quite good and well-made. And as a consequence, they are SRO at any time you go there. You have to fight for a seat. You have to wait 20 minutes in line just to put in your food order. Then you have to wait for 20 minutes outside the truck where they cook all the food, waiting for them to misinterpret your name to actually pick up your food, by which time you've definitely lost your seat. It can be fun with groups, but any group large enough is going to have a helluva time finding a place where they can all sit. There is a separate line, however, if all you want is more beer. Still, on the right night, with the right type of luck, Habana Outpost is exactly the type of place you want in your neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It's long overdue. To summarize - the worst service I have ever experienced, the host is this crazy woman with ego issues, but food is good. I came to Beyoglu with my wife and a friend. It was my friend's birthday and we had heard good things about the food here, so we decided to bring him here for lunch.  In retrospect, we should've read the reviews and known about the service here. We waited for 10-15 minutes (this much wait is common and was expected) before we were told by a waitress that she will get our table ready in a couple of minutes. When she did not come back in next few minutes, we decided to inquire about it with the hostess (who is this tall weird woman who does not know a thing about hospitality). She told us that the table we were supposed to get was actually reserved for another party and, therefore, we will have to wait more - no apologies, she just blurted it out and went away. We were obviously pissed with this kind of mismanagement and were debating to leave the place. But, within minutes, the hostess came back (seemed visibly irritated) and said she will give us the same table. I, personally, didn't like the way she talked, but to make sure my friend had a great time I decided to give it a try. The frustration, however, was still quite visible on my face. Amazingly, she somehow sniffed that frustration and asked me ""are you giving me the look ?"" as we approached to our table. While we all were taken aback by her completely unprofessional remark, instead of telling her how arrogant and lunatic she sounds, I decided to explain her that my frustration was due to the gross mismanagement there. She didn't bother to apologize or say a word at all. She left with the same irritated look. Once she was gone, we decided to move on as there was no point spoiling our mood over one person. But, it was not over for her. She actually went as far as telling her waiters to delay service to us. It took about 45 mins (maybe more, I am serious) before anyone came to us to ask for the water. The only good thing was that our feeling of pure disgust for the people working at this place was somewhat offset by the good food here. Conclusion: If it does not matter to you that there is a good chance you may have to face a condescending person before you enjoy your meal, you can try this place for some good Mediterranean food. For me it is not the risk worth taking.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love Chavellas. I loved it when it was tinier, and I love it now that it's just tiny. I adore that I can now with my amazing food, have a margarita (so good) and I appreciate that they accept cards in the new spot. It's a great neighborhood restaurant, and the quality is fantastic. Unique food creations and always ask for the specials. I also really love that it still feels small, despite them tripling the space. The tables are still close together, (although not uncomfortably anymore) and it still feels comfy. Here is why the new place got four stars for me and not 5: If they change these two things, throw it up to growing pains, I'll gladly give a five because I love this place so much. 1) music is too loud. On a Sunday Morning why are horns blasting in my ears to the point that I want to leave? It's not a Saturday night out. I honestly had to stop eating until one song stopped. Background music please- this is not a club.  While the music selection is fine- great even, it's just obnoxiously loud. Been to the new location 3x and all three times it was intolerable. 2) New staff isn't as personable as the old faces I got to know. However, I'm sure they will get a hang of it. One hostess really seemed to have an attitude problem- as though this was such an elite place now- I can be rude and snide. That's not the feel Chavellas should, or I believe wants to have. That being said:  This place still has a small feel, with big results.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love the Boil! Delicious food, friendly service and a chill crowd. Very West Coasty and a must for people who love their shellfish as much as I do. Be prepared to get your hands dirty though and don't make any plans for after since you will be sure to want to waddle home and wash all the fish off. We had the soft shell crab to start which was just okay, then we shared bags of the Lobster, Shrimp, Crawfish and Dungeness Crab. The shrimp was my absolute favorite (suck the head!) but everything was delicious in that buttery garlicky old bay sauce. The corn and potatoes were also super flavourful in that sauce and the only thing I wished was that there was more of it. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get and I will definitely be back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

And there was no wait at 1pm on a Sunday!  Definitely going to come back here to try dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I would give this place 3.5 stars if that were an option. It was neither a 4 star nor a true 3 star experience but I've rounded down (either because it was a smidge closer to 3 or because I'm a jerk.) I went with a group of friends and ordered The Whole Shebang. And also the whole dessert menu. And several flights of dessert ports. Pros: -Fried goat cheese (I'm a sucker for lavender honey) -Lamb meatballs (very flavorful and well textured) -Scallops (the mango pairing is surprising but so good) -Squid ink paella (THIS. THIS IS GREAT AND YOU SHOULD PUT IT IN YOUR FACE.) -Dessert highlights: ricotta churros, panna cotta (we got three extra orders of both because we loved them so much). I see the panna cotta isn't on the menu right now but it was easily my favorite. -Port flights were very nicely paired with the desserts Cons: -With all the things we ordered, we dropped a cool $1000 at this place. And it was kind of unpleasant to have to scurry out and find an ATM at the end of the meal since they are cash only (Amex excluded). -1star -Service: the staff probably could have been nicer (both hostess and waitstaff).

"My lady and I stopped in for drinks at the bar on a Friday evening after being curious about the place for a while. Was turned off immediately by the really saccharine live music duo playing coldplay and U2 cover songs sort of plopped down in the middle of the room, but they weren't so loud we couldn't talk so we figured we could deal. I ordered a gin and tonic and it tasted notably weak. I watched the bartender pour the second one and I figured out why, she barely splashed the tonic with gin. The pour count was maybe 0.5 seconds? It was a thimble of gin for a $6 cocktail (rail). That was it. We were done after seeing that. Won't be back ever.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Callehh Callehh Ocho! (Couldnt resist) Bought a $25 gift card to this restaurant for $2! The only condition was to spend at least $50 which wasn't difficult at all. For $110 (including tax and tip) we ordered 2 sangrias, calamari, the salmon, the tilapia, sorbet and domino cake. (wow that's a hearty meal). They even brought us bread with some sort of dip- I want to say there were beans but I had no idea. The bread was scrumptious and we finished all six of them in five minutes. The sangris were great. They came in wine glasses with a ton if ice which kept them nice and cold throughout our meal. The portions of food was great also. We were so full after eating two thirds of the calamari. I find I'm extremely picky when it comes to salmon- just because I think I've tried it just about anyway you can cook it. It was slightly overcooked, and very salty. The tilapia however was yummy. The sorbets came with coconut ginger, guava, and passion fruit. My boyfriend wouldn't stop raving about them. My domino cake was super cute and came with an amazing ice cream. Service was attentive and nice. Our mains took a while though. Other than that, great environment and awesome music!","[1.0, 0.0]"
Stopped in here on July 4th. I am not a gourmet type of person. This was a gourmet place. I had some nice rolls and butter and when I asked for ice water unlike all other places instead of just a glass I got a whole pitcher of ice water. Hence the FIVE STARS!!!! It was true what others had said in reviews here. I had fun waching the tourist from NJ and I am one too LOL!! I tried the Poached Chilean Sea  Bass with vegetables and potatoes. It was a small portion....very small and the chef brought it out. This is always a sign to me you are at a gourmet place and will not be full when you leave. I think that is the idea about gourment. It is so good it leaves you wanting more!!  I enjoyed this place but I like a bit more food !! Reminded me of Bocca..both nice places.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"After reading so many negative reviews, i had my radar up but my good friend made reservations for my birthday and since it was for a Monday evening i figured, whats the worst that could happen. Service: pretty friendly and relaxed. We were late for our reservation but they did not give us any problem. Our biggest issue was it appeared as though they were VERY understaffed. Our waiter was very nice but did not check on us and i had to look for him. Food:  good tasting. Nothing extraordinary but definitely not bland. The appetizers were amazing. I tried the skirt steak medium well with cilantro mash. steak was great. mash was okay. It was happy hour all night btw and you'd think they would be watered down but they had some delicious and strong drinks for the specials.

"friend: ""What should we eat for dinner?"".... me: uh I don't know... something that is good and not a huge line... friend: How about Asian Fusion ? me: thinking inside God damn it its going to be expensive and not good... but thinking.... fine. friend: Momofuku Ssam. Its Japanese Korean FUSION. me: momofuck you? what? friend: No you idiot. meet me there at 9:30. Reluctantly wanting to come here, I gave in and said yes.  I have had bad experiences with fusion restaurants because I refuse to pay premium prices for food that is 1/2 the price in LA... but I gave in.  Apparently Momofuku (which will be the name of my 1st born) means sweet peach. Ironically, this sweet peach of a place is honestly sweet. The decor is decked out in dark wood with a random 1980s poster of John Macenroe.  The place? filled with yuppies and trendy people. Damn, Momofuku is so trendy there is no name on the front! Just a peach! Anyway, the servers are all trendy... ironic that not one Asian worked here when it's a fusion place. The wait was bearable... 30 minutes... after we were called, they directed us to the back to have drinks. I tried the sparkling sake unfiltered for $9 a flute. Tastes like Japanese Ramune/Calpis drinks spiked. Pretty refreshing. On to the food.... again... Im a bitch when it comes to food and it takes a lot for me to enjoy it.... we ordered: Momofuku Saam... aka THE KOREAN FUSION CHIPOLTE BURRITO!!!! There was edamame, kimchi puree, onions, mushrooms, berkshire pork and rice wapped in a ""flour pancake"" where in LA we call it tortilla. Soundede weird, but good lord it was heaven. I haven't ever thought about putting those flavors together but it was just oh so delicious!!! $10 The Steamed Buns- a chinese creation play of Peking Duck wraps, with cucumbers, berkshire ass meat and hoisin sauce. Delicious and fluffy. Great starter, even if it does cost $9. The Mariniated Skirt Steak- served with bib lettuce, kimchi puree and a ginger sauce, it was so delicious. The skirt steak was perpared perfectly, medium rare and so tender marinated in Korean spices. It was seriously the best wrap I have had in a while. $20. Pan Fried Skate with Garlic Aioli and fingerling potatoes- beautiful presentation and a large portion of fish, but it's basically glorifed fried fish with a twist. Still nevertheless good.  $20. So yea, for 3, the bill came out to be $45 per person but it was honestly such a shock for me that it would be good. Kudos for the idea and to the famous chef of David Chang that opened this place. I can't wait to see this come to LA because we all know that LA loves fusion trends. MUST COME EAT HERE! KOREAN CHIPOLTE BURRITO FOR $10!","[1.0, 0.0]"

For dessert the banana cream pie and the black and white cheesecake both hit the spot.

"Across the street from Madison Square Park and Shake Shack, Eataly is an Italian foodie's wet dream come true. When first attending Baruch a few years ago, I'd always heard a random comment or two about the place, but never gave it much thought until a friend shamed me into going with her. It was raining, I was cranky, and I was wondering why the hell I let the bitch drag me over there. Then I walked inside. HOW did I miss this little slice of heaven? How?! I was ready to kiss my friend; she wasn't a bitch, she was a freaking genius. We bought some gelato (the taste... as good as the gelato from Tarry Market, though it's not a surprise since Mario Batali opened that up in the town near me), wandered the overcrowded areas, ogled the delicious looking cheeses, and ventured into the pasta section. I was wrong; the pasta section was true heaven. A restaurant further back is nestled behind row upon row of imported pasta. There was one brand, a whole wheat brand, that eased me into my whole grain pasta journey. It was nutty and did not taste like cardboard. I used the three bags of pasta I bought that week and then used that as an excuse to go back the following week, where I experienced their cannolis and panna cotta. Oh. my. freaking. goodness. They were both amazing. They were both tiny, and overpriced, but damn, they were good. Those two experiences opened the door to a love affair with Eataly. On a day where I needed a pick-me-up--particularly after receiving a terrible grade, for instance--I'd venture over and buy myself a panna cotta, which I would eat in the shade at Madison Square Park. The combo ensured my mood picked up again after thirty minutes. When I had extra money to splurge, I'd drag my friends to one of the random restaurants inside. And when I was hungering for some super fresh cheese, I'd buy their fresh ricotta. Though the inside of this market is windy and can be confusing for a first timer, it's worth your time. Come here, visit, buy food. BUY THE BREAD! Then you'll be in heaven, too.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have been here a few times with my wife and have had delightful meals each time. But, more recently, we went to dinner with two other couples on a busy Saturday night and a major problem with this place became apparent - there is only one bathroom in the whole restaurant and its used by both patrons and employees.   Between the six of us, over a dinner of 2.5 hours, I would say there were only about 30 minutes where all six of us were at the table.  For the rest of the time, at least one of us was waiting in the bathroom line. Any individual wait to use the facilities could take up to 15 minutes. I know this may be an odd complaint, but it really affected the overall enjoyment of this dinner with friends.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There were only 3 types of oysters available (of 15 varieties!!), the foie gras was a tiny tiny piece of pate, and there was barely any lobster in the lobster dish - an overwhelming amount of cilantro though.

"My first 5 star review, and it's well-deserved. Pizza has always been good, sure. But Artichoke just changes the game. The Crab, Margherita, and the Artichoke are amazing. Sicilian? Not sure about, those three have always done it for me. Sure, they're heavy slices with a bunch of creamy sauce on them (as if that's a bad thing), but the price reflects that. Honestly, if I could eat one food and not have to worry about gaining weight, I would eat Artichoke all day. At this point of human development, I'm gonna limit it to about once every three months. And the beers come in Super Big Gulp sizes (Jersey anyone?). What more can you ask for? Only, only gripe ever: the last time I went, I ordered the crab slice. When it came, it was barely lukewarm. Not a huge deal, but certainly noteworthy.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's good.  Note - BYOB and Cash Only so stop at the bottle shop and ATM before you arrive... Adorable atmosphere and when the weather is nice, sit outside - the tables are bit close, so it's probably good for smaller groups (2-4) but larger ones will likely have to split.  Haven't done brunch here, but did post-movie date night dinner here - perfect spot to have a lively conversation over a good meal, and your own fave bottle of vino.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Pretty disappointed. Food was not spectacular (and I love fusion food). Place was too tiny even for an LES establishment. The saving grace was the ube waffle. .

"There are so many things in the world that are a necessity, one of which is Di Fara Pizza.

When u walk in to Di Fara it's an experience in itself, you must order a pie when u get there because slices are a rare thing, when u order a pie just watch how careful Dom is with your pie all the ingredients are either home grown or imported from his home country of Italy, after the wait of 20 minutes or so you watch the best part when Dom takes the pie out of the oven with his own bare hands and sprinkles fresh parmigiana cheese and then to top it all off he takes fresh basil in which he grows on the window of his small shop.

"Best time to go is at lunch by yourself. Used to stop by after class for a nice filling meal. In the great Momofuku Noodle vs Ippudo debate I have to side with Ippudo. The broth is richer and the noodles are very close. Momofuku does have better pork buns though. The ones here are still worth getting, but not the best in the neighborhood. The lunch set is sure to fill you up if the noodles don't, and if you're feeling extra gluttonous you can always order an extra serving of noodles. The karaka-men has become my go to and is the standard by which I judge all other ramen. Before they raised their prices this would be a five star review. While I'll still gladly pay now, it's just a little less satisfying than it used to be.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The Jeffrey is a brand-new beer bar and gastropub in Midtown East, on a block in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. It's owned and managed by the same people who are behind Alewife in Long Island City, and I can vouch for the fact that they know their beers! The food menu is short but solid, with some interesting appetizers and a few excellent sandwich choices. But the beer list is the real star here. On draft, there's a wide variety of (mostly American) craft breweries, covering just about every imaginable style. You can fill up a growler with many of the draft beers to take home. If imports are more your thing, there's also a broad bottle selection, which leans toward Belgian specialties like saisons, lambics and trappist ales. Being imports, most of them aren't cheap, but there are some superb choices here, and connoisseurs will surely appreciate seeing breweries that are very difficult to find in the U.S. On our first visit, I had the Moonraker strong dark ale on cask, which was outstanding. The bar is larger than it looks from the street, with a spacious back room and an open-air patio beyond that. That's fortunate, because we went there just a few days after the official opening and it was already packed! One note of caution and a tip: The entrance hallway runs past the bar and is fairly narrow. If the place is crowded and people are standing all around the bar, you may have a hard time squeezing past. The coffee shop/cafe entrance and the bar entrance are separate doors, but both connect to the same space, so you can use either one to get to the back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Last night was our friend's birthday and we were very excited to celebrate with some noodles because noodles are usually delicious. We decided to try Samurai Mama because the online menu looked promising. Because she is responsible and possesses the quality of foresight, my friend called the night before to inquire about making a reservation. She was informed the restaurant does not take reservations, which is fine. My friend told the hostess we would be a party of 10 and was reassured that there probably would not be much of a wait on a Tuesday night. So, we decided to give it a go. Noodles are worth the risk, right? I arrived at the restaurant first--about 40 minutes before my friends--and decided to check out the scene inside. It was empty, which was great because this meant we would most likely get a table. The host told me to come back when my party arrived and said it was not necessary to leave my name or phone number. ""Just come back,"" he said, ""we will seat your group when everyone is here."" Half of our group arrived at 6:30pm. We poked our heads into the restaurant again and guess what? Still empty! We asked the host (not the same one that was there 40 minutes before) if we could order some drinks and appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party. After a series of mumbles, he proceeded to usher us into a prison-like room, his impractical-looking black shawl floating behind him like a kite in the summer breeze. After we were all seated in this jail cell of a ""waiting room,"" shawl man disappeared. Then, BAM, he reappeared and told us a new rule which he had apparently invented in the 2 minutes he was gone. Because of the size of our group, we were required to spend a minimum of $30 apiece. Now, I love noodles as much as the next girl, but unless there are gold flakes floating in the broth I'd prefer to save my money for other things. Also, wouldn't a normal establishment WANT a party of 10 to spend money and celebrate there? Even if we spent a measly $25 apiece? Especially since there were 3 other patrons in the restaurant. 3. And I may have even seen a tumbleweed. Don't go here. The place seems mismanaged and the staff is pretentious and rude. But do contact the host if you would like to borrow his cape for Halloween this month.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The menu is small, they have a section for small plates and larger plates. The small plates were $15 each, and the larger ones were around $20 something. I ordered 3 small plates, thinking it would be able to fill 2 people up, but boy was I wrong when the servers brought it to my table. The food was literally the size of my palm. Such small portions. Who are they trying to feed, dawrfs? They should replace the word ""small"" with bite size. The food tasted good, but I feel like for what I'm paying it could've been better. I also had to get up to walk over to the front to flag my waitress down a couple of times since they sat us all the way in the back in their outside back area. I'm just saying if you're super hungry, and want attentive workers, don't come here. It's a waste of your time and money.

"If you're looking for a bar with good food in the LES, then you should definitely check out Boulton & Watt. It's right on the corner of Ave A & Houston, and it's pretty dark inside, but they also have outdoor seating.  There were a mix of people there, but mainly young people.  We got a table relatively quick, and it's more group seating style at their high tops. They have a decent amount of beers on tap, and nothing out of the ordinary, which I was expecting, being they're considered a gastropub.  Nonetheless, they had some good seasonal beers.  Their menu is what attracted me to the place because I feel like gastropubs typically have a smorgasbord of things on their menu, and this place is included in that.  They have a few interesting vegetarian options like spaghetti & eggplant meatballs, asparagus ravioli, and their veggie burger. I definitely checked Yelp before ordering and people were raving about the veggie burger so I decided to get it to see what the hype was all about.  It was fantastic!  I've had many veggie burgers throughout the city, including the homemade burgers, and most of them are dry, taste too much like quinoa or whatever their main base is, or need a lot of condiments to make them taste decent.  Their homemade veggie burger didn't really fall apart on me, which is a huge plus, and it tasted very good.  The tzatziki sauce and alfalfa sprouts on top was a nice addition to the burger.  The bun is a bit heavy, which is probably the only knock.  The fries were pretty good too - small and crispy - but the burger was so much food that I barely ate any of them. I'll have to come back and try the spaghetti and eggplant meatballs.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am giving this restaurant 2 stars because their host are terrible. Came here yesterday for my friend's birthday lunch get together and we had to wait almost 2 hours before sitting down. Her boyfriend had came early to the restaurant so he can get a table for 12 since they do not take reservations. We would assume after 45 mins or so, the host would have somewhat arrange a section for us to sit down or let us know how much longer. After 1 hour of waiting we asked if our table was ready.. they still didn't know. We continue to wait patiently since we had a large group. The host didnt seem to care very much about us which made the experience very frustrating. Our first experience here was not very pleasant. After almost 2 hours of waiting, we were seated.

"1. REAL TALK If you don't mind having your conversation casually overheard by the people sitting next to you, then proceed to sit at small cute rectangle table. 2. CORNY You get to select from Oven-baked Wheat, Fried Wheat, or Fried Corn Flour-based Empananas. I prefer the Corn flour empanadas because they have a slightly thicker crunch on the outside. 3. HOT POCKETS I tried to avoid any flavor that sounded like it would taste like a hot pocket. That meant no pizza, americano, ham & cheese, or broccoli & cheese for me. 4. TIPSY The medium-pitcher sangria will probably get two people tipsy for $24. We got 8 or 9 glasses from it. We chose the red wine sangria because we thought it'd go along with the mainly savory empanadas. 5.

I didn't even have a chance to look at the menu and the waitress freakn rushed me to order. It wasn't even 1/2 full in the restaurant and I know she noticed me drop off my stuff at our table and walked out for a bit.

"There are days when all you need is some hot soup dumpling juice dribbling down your chin and making a mess on your plate. Today as my girlfriend felt a cold coming around was one of those days. Forget chicken soup! Nothing makes you feel better than piping hot soup dumplings with some scallion pancakes on the side! There's a skill to eating these little soupy delights and a few variations of techniques. The key is not to make a mess on your plate and savor all the soup. I like to bite a small hole on the top, add some of the tangy sauce, drain the soup onto the spoon and drink. Then I add some spicy chili sauce and some more of that special tangy sauce into the drained dumping and eat. When downtown I head over to Pell St, when in Queens I head over to Flushing.

"Rucola is perfect as a neighborhood restaurant, but not destination-worthy as of yet.  Solid drink menu with inventive and low-sugar cocktails, pleasant service, a cute if somewhat jammed space, and friendly staff.  The food just didn't blow any of my party of 4 away; I would not point to anything being particularly bad, but nothing was particularly great either.  The soft shell crab dish seemed oversalted and overbreaded; the chicken was oversalted, and my fish dish was somewhat bland.  Again, perfectly great spot if you're already in the neighborhood, but if you don't live around there, there are probably equally good places to go.   Nothing on the menu particularly wowed me to begin with, either... again, not bad in any particular way, just not particularly Italian, and not many things that grabbed me. At any rate, I'm pulling for them, as the people running the place seem very cool and friendly.  Considering it was packed when we ate there at 8 on a Wednesday, it looks like I don't have to pull for them too hard...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Short review: The pizza took forever to come and when it did, it was burnt on top and soggy on the bottom. Don't waste your time. Long review: My mother and I ate here on a Saturday around noon. The restaurant is easy to miss on the street because it is at basement level and the sign uses dark colors. The interior was beautiful, but the tables are way too close together. The pizzas are all sold as 11-inch round pies, which seems like a lot for one person, but is just the right amount due to a super-thin crust. The beverage menu only offered beer and wine, so we had to ask if they had anything non-alcoholic. The waiter only suggested a few sodas, even after my mother asked for something non-carbonated, so we were annoyed to see him bring a cup of coffee to another diner only moments later. I ordered foccacia as an appetizer but what I got was burnt, wafer-thin bread with a little rosemary sprinkled on it. It tasted as bad as it looked, so we didn't eat more than two bites. A set of diners seated after us got their pizzas first. My pizza, the Reginella (cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil), arrived next with a few burnt pieces of basil, which I picked off. The pizza tasted good, but thin crust + cherry tomatoes = soggy middle. Another set of diners seated after us got their order, before my mother's Popeye (mozzarella, ricotta, and baby spinach) finally arrived. The spinach was burnt worse than my basil, and the chef put on way too much ricotta making this pizza soggy as well. She didn't like hers at all. There is one unisex bathroom, kept neat and clean, and it is as beautiful as the rest of the restaurant. The check comes held in a giant wooden clothespin, which I thought was a cute touch. Overall, I feel this place has potential if they could get just their act together in the kitchen. But right now it's all flash and no substance.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The reviews steered me in the right direction. Piccolo is great for the solo visitor--I sat at the window to watch pedestrians walk by. There were a number of couples on dates, too. It has a nice, casual ambiance. The prices were very reasonable, especially for Manhattan. The server was helpful and the food prompt. I have a gluten allergy, so I ate the gnocchi. It was tasty and hit the spot. It is classic, old-school Italian in the best of way. I will return when I am back in town!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Impressive and very Japanese. While noodles aren't ever a drawing point for me, these are flavorful noodles done with fine point of detail and flavor. The pork buns are the best I've ever eaten and a I had vegan and gluten free noodle option, which had google berries and an earthy mushroom taste. I also had their shochu with fresh grapefruit which is a fresh and clean cocktail that does not interfere with the tastes of the food, so I highly recommend it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm typically not too impressed with anything fusion, and this place is basically on the border between marginal and just good enough to come back again.   We started off with the truffled mac and cheese and it was a solid dish, though I'm not sure if it's worth the $10 price tag.  For a main dish I got the mussels and french fries, the broth that the mussels were in were really good, but the fries weren't great, soggy and not well seasoned.  Looking back on it now, it was actually a weird pairing that I'm not a big fan of.  I also got to try the lamb shank, and it was good for the first few bites, but as you dig further into the dish you just get tired of the flavor.   The restaurant itself had a nice cozy feel and the service was very friendly.  But unfortunately our waiter had a very strong French accent, so as he read the numerous specials, you couldn't help but stop paying attention because you had no idea what he was saying.  Again, they do have a lot of interesting dishes with pretty big portions for about $20 - $25 an entree, so it's worth trying once if you're in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"bleh i wanna throw up.  imagine if that was the extent of my review?  ok i guess i'll go into details.  see what had happened was i drank too much last night and feeling queasy right now.  plus i saw your mom necked. oh sorry, on to the review.  so i've been meaning to go to momfuku for a while now.  there are 2 motherfuckers....errr momfukus about a block apart.  the other, momofuku noodle bar is about an avenue away.  we went here cause i read somewhere that their pork buns are better than ippudo.  preposterous.  when i take a bite into those meaty buns, pause, a light shines on me and tebow comes down from the sky to bless me.  thats how f'in good they are.  momofuku's pork buns?  not so much.  its not bad per se, it just doesn't compare to ippudo.  not even close.  so the buns is probably a 3 1/2 star.  the dish i orders, some rice cake with spicy sausage is garbage.  i like my sausage long and meaty....pause again.  but they cut these all up into little pieces, almost grounded.  the worst part of this dish is the rice cake.  they were hard and taste like crap.  too bad the sausage wasn't hard.....wait what? and the prices, damn its kinda pricey and the portions were small.  my friend got some sort of steak dish and it was all cut up and small, the plates were decorated nicely which means they cheaped out on the food.  they also stuck us with another group, all crowded up on a strangers lap.  luckily for me, she was some butchy looking lady.  yup, lucky indeed. i should give it one star but hey, jeremy lin and the knicks just won 6 straight.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I come from the Middle East. I've been trying out falafel since I am 5 years old. It is part of my identity, my cloture, my memories. It is what I fantasize of when I'm locked in my office and too busy to grab lunch. I will never be able to lie to myself when it comes to falafel. And with no doubts, I found the best place in Manhattan in that great place called Nish Noosh. They were smart enough to bring the authentic taste and texture of these tender chickpea balls, and skipped no ingredients that are kept in my collective DNA, those unique ones that I seek so much after when I choose my food. And when the service is so fast and professional, the tahini sauce so fresh and lemoni, and the taste so familiar and addictive, you can never go wrong. You are now part of my DNA too, Nish Noosh. What an honor for us both.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The two of us only left 1 slice left (sigh) and finished a drink each even though we ""weren't really that hungry."" We got the ""old fashion"" with mushrooms and pepperoni. Crust was nice and crispy. Pizza was flavorful and we just couldn't stop eating it. We decided to wrap up the last slice so we wouldn't feel like beasts..or maybe I wouldn't feel like one since I ate a whole half a tray on my own.. Would definitely come back here!

"My favorite restaurant in the city.  Unfortunately not affordable enough for me to be a frequent patron - but every time there is a special occasion... I'm there. Imho - it's only worth it to go if you can sit at the counter.  Likewise, try and get the corner spot closest to the entrance (that's where the head sushi chef sits - who is by far the most knowledgeable and friendly).

We ordered multiple pitchers of Sangria (red, champagne, and blueberry champagne) and each was more tastey than the other. Some of the best Sangria we've had.

"This place is way overhyped. Based on some of the reviews you'd think this place serves the best meal of your life, or even the best mexican corn you'd ever tasted, but it actually doesn't.  It's a decent meal, i just couldn't imagine waiting over half an hour for this.  We came here on good friday hoping that there wouldn't be a wait, and there wasn't, so we crammed into our tiny space.  The seating situation here is crazy small, almost makes it not worth it unless you can get a booth for 4.  The menu is very random, there's no order to where the food is listed.  They also don't have a lot of choices, and definitely don't have traditional food.  We started with the tostones and corn.  The corn was very good and i can see why people love it, but personally, i think dos caminos makes it way better.  The tostones was definitely the best part of the meal, specifically the garlic sauce it comes with.  Although i probably smelt like garlic all day, it was well worth it.  I'd put that sauce on everything if i could.  For entrees I had the roast pork with rice and beans and my girlfriend had the cuban sandwich.  I was disappointed when i saw the yellow rice with my beans. Based on the name i thought this was more of a cuban restaurant, but it's clearly more mexican, no cuban restaurant would serve yellow rice with beans.  The roast pork was ok, but didn't have much flavor, it's like they just roasted the pork without anything else on it.  My girlfriends cuban was very good and she really enjoyed it.  She thought the bread they use is the most authentic she's seen in the city.  Overall, not a bad meal, but nothing about it really stood out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My boyfriend and I went here last night for our anniversary dinner.  First impression, it's on a great quiet block, a little off crowded 6th ave and I would have walked right by the place if my boyfriend wasn't with me.  I love ""hidden places"".  It's actually quite big when you get inside and I love the old rustic feel of the place.   We started off with sangria - yum.  I don't know WHY I ordered another glass eventually, because I was tossed after the first glass...needless to say they don't skimp on the alcohol in those.   For food, we took other yelpers' advice, forgot about saving calories, and ordered: -Fried Goat Cheese with Lavender infused honey - was definitely feeling the creamy contrast with the sweetness of the honey.  It was rich and tasted great. -Pulled Pork Empanadas with mint chutney - I could seriously eat this all day long for the rest of my life and die happy.  The chutney was spicy and delicious. -Lamb Meatballs - yummy, it wasn't something I couldn't find elsewhere but great nonetheless. -Bacon wrapped dates and olives - I love bacon wrapped dates, so you can't go wrong with that.  The bacon / olives combo I have never had before and wasn't in love with the salty / salty combo, but I mean, you could put bacon on anything and I'd love it. -Crispy Brussel Sprouts with Apples and Creme Fraiche - AWESOME. My boyfriend hatesss Brussel Sprouts, but actually ate more of this than I did. LOVED it!! For dessert we had chocolate cake, I don't remember the name, but it was your standard delicious cake :).

"My wife and I ate at Ofrenda's last evening after meeting Luis, the chef, when we walked by earlier in the day as he was fixing up the Dia de los Muertos display.  Luis is very friendly so we decided to give Ofrenda a try. Drinks are cheap at Happy Hour and Bryan is an excellent bartender. I make pretty damn good margaritas myself but Bryan's are even better. And the food!  Amazing food for such a small unassuming place.  Scallops are the best I've ever had.  Service was as good as the food. We live in California and eat lots of good Mexican food....but not this good!  This is more like Mexican/French fusion or something of the sort.

We said, ""That's fine, can we have the check."" He then came back numerous times because he didn't think we were paying fast enough! Then as we were leaving he pulled me and a friend aside and demanded to know what I had said to my waitress! He said, ""If you have something to say, say it to me, I'm the manager!"" I answered him, ""I told her the tip was strictly for her, because you were rude"" He then proceeds to scream at me in front of all his other customers, calling ME rude and finally culminates in him yelling, ""Good riddance!!!"" at me as I am trying to get the door open and get away from this giant buffoon. Needless to say, horrible experience and I would never recommend it. The pity too is that I was with a MoMA curator and we had been thinking about planning an after party at this restaurant.

"Ok, so my girlfriend and I decided to try this place after watching the dumpling throwdown on the Food Network. We ordered a prix fixe dinner special for $40, which included a flight of beer, and an appetizer and entree. So, since we saw the throwdown, we had to try the dumpling appetizer. They turned out to be a big disappointment. They were burnt and rather bland on their own. The sauce was some sort of reduction that I didn't think added anything positive in terms of flavor to the experience. As part of the prix fixe, we also got to try a fried fish appetizer which was plain as plain could be. We had to ask for some lemon to give the fish some bite. Otherwise, it would have come from a fish and chip stand and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. For entrees, we had the seared duck breast and bacon wrapped tenderloin. Now, this is what we came to experience. I'm not usually a fan of pork entrees but the tenderloin was amazingly moist. The bacon added just the right amount of crunch and saltiness. The duck breast was also very good. For dessert, we shared some kind of ice cream sandwich (vanilla sandwiched between two vanilla or ginger flavored cookies). The cookies were rock hard, ok but unspectacular. We really wanted to like this place but we came away with mixed feelings. The entrees were excellent but were sandwiched between extraordinarily unexceptional appetizers and dessert. If either was a little better, I might stretch and give it four stars but since only the entrees were memorable, I have to stick with three stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

When we finally got in, sat down, we were ordering drinks and our waiter informed us that their alcohol license expired and they got a new one, but something happened to it and we can't order beer or wine. Fine, we ordered water and apple juice, got our drinks and were ready to order pizzas. Our waiter again started explaining how the oven is not hot enough and we would have to wait about a half an hour to get our pizzas. After pressing him for a couple minutes he admitted that the half an hour would be more like 45 minutes and then we would have to wait for all the other people to get their pizzas (at this point he pointed at the yellow slips in the kitchen, there were about 20 of them), we also noticed how one of the guys in the kitchen was just shoveling coal into the oven. Needless to say, we left.

Song is a little hard to find if you have never been there because there is no real invasive sign out front, but when you do find it, it's worth every little penny.  The food is super inexpensive and you get a ton for the price.  Quick table service, but it's cash only, so be prepared.   I recommend getting it for delivery if you are within the area.  You get so much food.  For $20 you can get 2 huge curry dishes, rice, and 2 spring rolls.  It ended up being 5 full meals! Try the Kang Pak for a spicy vegetable dish.  The eggplant is killer!  and I always get the Tofu Masaman because their peanut sauce is just perfection.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Service: We were seated at least 30 minutes after the estimated time. Even when they said our table was ready we waited 20 more minutes. Having had to wait so long I got thirsty and got a bubble tea. Instead of a welcome, the server instantly gave me attitude about having an outside drink and said they would charge me, then offered to keep it in their fridge. We then proceeded to watch the couple across from us and next to us get their food before us even though they ordered well after we did. We asked about the long delay and the server made up some BS excuse about the ramen cooking, even though everyone ordered ramen. Food: Once the food finally came it did not live up to the hype. The pork buns were smothered in mayonnaise, but would have been good otherwise. The ramen was very good, but did not have much pork in it. This was a complete disappointment - Xian Famous foods on Saint Mark's is a good alternative, cheaper, better and friendly service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wer mal kein klassisches Sushi sucht ist hier richtig. Japanisches Essen in diversen Varianten (Prinzip spanische Tapas) mit großer Karte und japanischen Getränken in ebenfalls umfangreicher Auswahl. Der Zugang ist nicht ganz einfach zu finden und wir wären fast vorbei gelaufen. Man muss durch die Lobby eines Hauses am Doormen vorbei ein Treppe ins Untergeschoss. Im Eingangsbereich steht nur ein kleines Schild, welches auf das Restaurant hinweist. Wegen der Lage im Untergeschoss und dem etwas ungewöhnlichen Zugang waren wir erst etwas skeptisch. Diese Skepsis wurde aber sofort durch die freundliche Bedienung, die schöne, japanisch anmutende Gestaltung der Räume, die interessant klingende Karte und das schlussendlich sehr gute Essen beseitigt. Lasst euch beraten, die Bedienung ist sowohl bei der Speisen- und Getränkeauswahl sehr behilflich und erklärt gut, da man einige Sachen bestimmt noch nicht gehört, geschweige denn gegessen hat.

Lovely service, took all the suggestions from the waiter, fish cooked to per-fec-tion. Even uncharacteristically opted for dessert - and please DO NOT MISS the bourbon truffles. Worth every bite.

"Considering the reasonable prices, Galli has amazing food. Regardless of the price, actually, it's a great dinner spot. I went with a group of 9 people, split several appetizers, a few bottles of wine, and everyone had an entree. We shared a dessert. Everything I tasted was really delicious, and it was a great value. We shared the cheese disks, mushrooms, and eggplant starts--all really tasty and generous (not huge) portions. I had the chicken marsala for my entree and loved it: the sauce was rich, the mushrooms and chicken were cooked really nicely, and the little roasted potatoes were a solid complement to the rest of the plate. We split the brownie and ice cream amongst the table and it was excellent. Brownies and ice cream seem like a no-brainer, but that's not always the case (sadly). The server was very friendly and helpful, and our wine was great. Definitely going back and recommending it to anyone who enjoys Italian food.

"We wanted to have a good time but instead we were forced to leave Being really homesick I had to try the Serbian restaurant in NY ... I could not resist. Did you know that at this place you can not sit more then two hours at the table? I wish this wasn't true but I'm going to tell you what happened to me that night. Our good friends came from Florida so we decided to make reservation for four people. Young man who picked up the phone was very polite, however he never mentioned to me that all reservations have time limit. He wrote my name down and said YOU GOT IT. The night started well, we ordered an appetizer, main dish and enjoyed it a little, wonderful atmosphere. After we finished the food we wanted to mark the night with the house specialty - roast pork. This is where the fun started! The cheerful waitress came to us and politely said that we have another half hour left because the new guests are coming to take over our table. We tried to be rational and told her that we will certainly leave the table but when we finish with our pork that we ordered. She didn't say anything, she left. Two minutes later a man with a huge pimple on his cheek approached our table. His appearance was disturbing. He started telling us, ""You can get the pork, but I need the table in 25 minutes!"" We answered him the same as we answered to the waitress how we would leave after we finish our pork, he replied, NO YOU WON'T!!!!! Of course, that was the owner of the restaurant. Disappointed with his reaction, we asked for the check, paid and left the restaurant. After that happened, we went to a restaurant across the street called Arcane, where the people were incredibly friendly and polite. The service was amazing and we really had a great time. Don't get me wrong, the food at Kafana was delicious. What shocked me was the way we were treated by the owner of this restaurant. As he said ""NO YOU WONT"" have fun at Kafana! I'm not even homesick anymore ...","[0.0, 1.0]"

I spent 4 days walking the city, enjoying time in museums and visiting with friends, and every single morning I had the same breakfast. PROS: - One of the best breakfasts I have ever eaten, hands down. I had the poached egg on pumpernickel with lox wrapped around it. On the side they served me a simple salad with dried cranberries and a vinaigrette dressing. This was so good, I ate it 4 days in a row. - Incredibly friendly staffers, even when the restaurant was in full swing and everyone was in the weeds, they smiled and seemed to truly give a damn CONS: - There isn't one in New Orleans. I am actually thinking of planning a trip back to New York just to have an excuse to eat there again. Really blown away.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This was disappointing. The food is average -- not too bad -- so the food could earn three stars on its own. However, the service is well below par, even for a place where you more or less pick your own seats and bus your own table from time to time. This was the second time this has happened to me here, where my food (a very simple lamb gyro plate) took nearly a half hour to come. About a half dozen orders that came after me were fulfilled, and when I confronted the staff it seems my order was completely forgotten. I waited a little longer for my order, and they messed up one of the parts I had originally asked for. After switching it out, I was going to head out with my food when I noticed they forgot to give me the bread that comes standard with these orders. It was very disappointing, and the cashier at the front seems fairly new such that she had no idea how to deal with this. How about a complimentary beverage or dessert for me having waited nearly 30 minutes for what's essentially fast food? I'm really not happy about this place, and after a few tries and encountering a few disappointing experiences, I've decided to not dine here again. It's cheap, but honestly I don't think it's cheap enough for a joint that doesn't really much service to begin with. Again, the food alone does garner about three stars so it might be worth a try for people looking for a neighborhood quickie.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Now explain to me this white sauce thing. Reading the reviews, it seems that it should be a garlic based sauce. I have to say it tasted very mayonnaise-y and very much like a bad ranch dressing. I was not a fan at all, but poured some over to give my crappy falafel some much needed moisture. :( I wanted to like it so much.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been venturing out to Crown Heights rather frequently, with the hope that my friend would take me to The Islands to partake of the jerk chicken about which she has waxed poetic for ages. That said, she had never tried the jerk chicken until our recent joint endeavor. Thus, as THE dish of this destination, we decided to concentrate our efforts on this brand of Caribbean fare; consequently, upon receiving the call in which I was told that jerk chicken was awaiting my arrival, to say that I enthusiastically skipped over to that neck of the woods would be an understatement. The Islands is a hole-in-the-wall that lives up to this illustrious label - the food is delicious. Opting to take our items to go, we dabbled in the oxtail and jerk chicken (both of which are served with rice) and - for two people - there was far too much food, by a significant margin. In any event, after a long day, we were willing to take our time and dabble in this, that and the other in our food-related endeavors. With moans of pleasure emanating from the apartment - yes, the chicken is as tender as people suggest - we made our way through as much of the meal as we could before raising our napkins in surrender and retiring to the couch for a post-meal karaoke duet to ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart,"" as we are wont to do. It should be noted that the chicken is coated in a thick layer of spices, which produces a slow-burning kick that may frighten away those with a limited tolerance for spicy food. That said, I can never find spicy-enough food and so I welcomed the delight into my person in earnest. While the oxtail was tender and tasty, I don't think that it was as delicious as the jerk chicken and I would probably focus my attention on the latter treat in future, though there are many more items on the menu with which we will need to experiment. Conclusion: There are some occasions on which you seek excellent cuisine from a no-frills Brooklyn institution. A low-key evening in, with great company and delicious Caribbean cuisine? Yes, please and thank you. There is a reason that, after 250 reviews, the feedback tends towards perfection. Whilst this is not a restaurant to which you and your most well-coiffed hipster friends may trek to partake of oysters and absinthe, this is the place where people who know what's what with regards to food will grab a bite to consume in the comfort of their homes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I decided to write a review after going here last week because for some reason I never had before. I've been going here for almost 3 years since I first discovered it. Probably celebrated every major event here: birthdays, anniversaries, other special occasions, gone here before concerts, etc. and it has never once disappointed me. The food is unmatched if you love South American food. The drinks are incredible, happy hour is always a joy. The sauce they make for the plantain chips that you can buy by the bottle are divine. The service is always impeccable, they clearly only hire the friendliest wait-staff and even the bussers frequently introduce themselves by name and offer to help if you need anything. Every experience here is a memorable, I've been probably 20 times in the past few years for brunch, lunch, drinks, and dinner, and I'll keep coming here for as long as it lasts.

"I want to say first of all, this is not about the food--the pizza is EXCELLENT. This is about their SH*TTY HOSTESS/service. My bf and I went to PG's more than a yr ago, and had a GREAT time, Paulie came to our table, chatted us up... AWESOME customer service. He went again, recently with a coworker, and said Paulie came up to them again, great food, etc., and I thought we should go again; he reminded me how good it was. So we went. My bf and I enter PG's and I was excited and all smiles. No wait or line, not busy at all. We are standing there at the hostess stand, when another couple enters behind us. Some minutes later, the older Asian woman (hostess?) comes up to the hostess stand, where my bf and I are standing DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER FACE. And while we're standing there, SHE IGNORES US COMPLETELY, and asks the couple BEHIND US their name for the list. (Esscuse me? Hi? Do you not see us standing right in front of your face?) So I say, ""Hi. We've been standing here, were here first actually."" And she says ""I'm getting their name for the list"", and I reply, ""Our names aren't on the list yet, we were here first (again)"", and she's like ""What's the name? (attitude prob)"" and I tell her my bf's name. She scribbles it down. She doesn't apologize for being COMPLETELY RUDE for NO REASON-or anything, except mumbles, ""Oh I thought your name was on the list already"" (liar, you saw us come in), then IGNORES US AGAIN, and asks the couple behind us how many in their party. They say 2. I interrupt and say ""UM. 2 IN OUR PARTY ALSO. THANKS."" Do her and I know each other from a past life? Because I have never seen or spoken a word to this woman before this. There is no reason for her extremely rude and inexcusable behavior/effing b*tchiness. The rest of our service was fine, save for the fact that the couple who was standing behind us were seated right next to us at a communal table. Just a little awkward. Go to Roberta's, where even though it's super busy, they know how to handle people with GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, and more variety on their menu. If you don't want to leave Greenpoint, go to Adelina's. It's a small wine bar with food. Order the pizza with an egg on top. (such a shame, PG's pizza is so good, too.)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Simply put, the BEST pizza in the world! Better than any pizza I've had even in Rome, Sienna, Florence, and Pisa. Long lines, inconsistent hours, decor that leaves alot to be desired, and the EXPENSIVE cost...ALL true...but the pizza, EVERY LAST MORSEL, it simply heaven! The cost prohibits from going there regularly but it's a wonderful, monthly treat. While you're waiting on line (I've waited two hours, in the rain, just for a pie and it was worth it all), read every plaque on the wall and then eat the pizza for yourself... Enough said!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If only they sold the creme brulee French toast as a dessert. I have a love-hate relationship with French toast and pancakes(especially the ones from Griddle Cafe in LA). Sometimes they are too heavy and sweet. Other times they are light and flavorful. All the time, they are crazy carb and fat overload :( Rarely, can I say they are calorie-worthy. The French toast was dense and crisp on top with a beautiful crust on the side. It was good, but not great. My salad was nicely chopped up and super hardy. Overall, the place was cute and the food was good. Is the French toast worth a try? Sure, share it with some friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This, to be honest, is a review of the establishment in general and the service staff, not the food. We walked to the bar, a couple got up, so we grabbed their seats as they left. Then the bartender tells us that we can't do that, because there is a ""waiting list"" for the bar....what kind of nonsense is that? So we order a couple of drinks and move aside. Thats when I noticed the ambience - the place itself is pretty decent looking, but it's not happening - at all. It's a more mature crowd, mid 40s to 60s, so if you fall below that age range, not sure if u'll enjoy the bar scene too much. I'll try to separately review the food if I get a chance.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After looking at the info I'm about to be the 500th review of this place! So let's start with the obvious..my blackness clearly makes me an expert on all things fried chicken? (it really doesn't) I ordered the Al Sharpton (chicken and waffle) and I had the dark meat version (leg/thigh). I got it to go and the place was pretty crowded at 4 in the afternoon which is not normal by dine-in standards. The wait wasn't too bad and the cashier let us have corn bread (which doesn't normally come with chicken and waffles). I also ordered their chocolate cake because I heard a friend was upset the last time she went because there was no more left. (apparently there is also a kool-aid of the day but....I just couldn't bring myself to get it) Someone asked me when I posted that I was here about to have my first chicken and waffle experience why I didn't sit there and eat and honestly....some things are best enjoyed in the privacy of your own home. I mean, if I really fall in love with my food....I don't want to feel embarrassed about sucking the marrow out of the bone or in crunching on all the parts others would leave behind. (I have been known to eat others left over attached meat in the past but I digress) By the time we got home (Harlem to Elmhurst), the waffles were a little soggy and everything had to go in the oven for a moment. Once I sat down with it I drizzled some syrup on top and dug in. After poisoning my palette with popeyes for the last couple of years,. it had been a long time since I've had some non fast-foody chicken and it was heavenly. The combination of chicken with waffle (My first time ever!) was fantastic and the chicken was tasty, not overly salty, and the ratio of breading to meat was just right. The chocolate cake was moist and didn't taste ""fake"" if you get what I mean. It was worth it. My only qualm was that I didn't order TWO orders of the chicken and waffles because even though I wasn't hungry I just immediately missed eating it after I was done. This is fried chicken done right....now somebody stamp my black card","[1.0, 0.0]"

I enjoyed the Wagyu beef burger and handcut fries, which were superb.  The burger was a real medium-rare, just as I had ordered it, and the fries were perfectly cooked: crisp and golden on the outside and soft and hot on the inside (sounds like food porn, so please forgive).  And I washed it down with two of the most delicious Bloody Marys that I had ever had.  The bacon really adds to the flavor.  Yum.  I'll be back...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Great Biscuits! Oh my! Every family has a unique dynamic where individuals take on specific roles.   These habitual behaviors generally take the element of surprise out of family rituals.   In my family, I am the living GPS and Zagat guide.  When our family dines out for a celebration, I usually have major input, if not the only,  in selecting the restaurant and getting everyone there.  This year, in honor of my birthday, my sisters decided to shake things up a bit. Using their knowledge of the vagaries of my palate, pet peeves and other idiosyncrasies, my siblings decided to surprise me with the restaurant selection for my birthday dinner.   After much secret deliberation (apparently an Excel spreadsheet was used), my two siblings narrowed the many choices down to two.  I was allowed the final pick based upon geography, and did not know the name of the restaurant until we parked in front the Clinton Street Baking Company & Restaurant. The Clinton St. Baking Co & Restaurant is a former wholesale bakeshop & coffee counter turned full service restaurant.    The exterior is unassuming and would not be particularly notable, if not for the many people  waiting outside for a table.  The seating  area is  not particularly large, and retains a coffee counter feel. My sisters were particularly attracted to this restaurant because breakfast/brunch food is available all day.  We are definitely a breakfast loving group.  For us, it is a 24/7 type of meal.  Besides, with a web address like great biscuits dot com who could resist. The Clinton's web address is no idle boast.  Before our own biscuits were brought to the table, all eyes were drawn to the biscuits sitting on another table.  The dainty buttermilk biscuits were crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside.  Quite frankly, a basket of the biscuits, with raspberry jam, alone would be a great meal.  But we did save room for a lot more. The roasted chicken breast in a tequila reduction with smoked corn pudding and corn off the cob   which I picked off the menu, sounded simple, but was delectably complex.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and a wonderful foil for the real star of the dish  - the corn.  The combined sweet and smoky flavors of the smooth pudding texture, sprinkled with fresh kernels, was delightful. (Since having this dish, I have spent more than a few futile hours burning corn in an attempt to replicate the flavor.) My younger sister's eyes were immediately drawn to the pancakes on the menu.  The wild Maine blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter were listed as a house classic, and definitely deserve to be.  Pancakes were the only food that my younger sister ever requested from age five to fifteen.  She is definitely a pancake connoisseur.  Her final judgment was that the pancakes were the perfect texture, the blueberries wonderfully fresh and the maple butter luscious.  I had to agree based upon the little that she let me steal from her plate. My youngest sister took us into completely different territory, by ordering seafood.  The steamed PEI mussels were adequate, but were a definite reminder that shellfish is best prepared in kitchens  which handle a lot of them .  Biscuit specialists do not fit into that category. The discovery of great biscuits was a tasty consequence of switching up  usual family roles, so I look forward to doing it again.  (This is a thinly veiled hint to my siblings.)  Give it a try with your own family.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"YUMMMMMMY.  I think about Ippudo when I am not there.  It makes me really really happy.  A large bowl of the Akamaru Modern, with a poached egg added.  Those tender slices of pork, and the firm, yet giving noodles.  The savory, creamy broth with just enough kick to make it so incredibly addictive.  The pork buns, which have all the flavor components of some sandwich from McDonalds that I just can't pinpoint, but are at least five million times better.  The wait makes me bonkers, but I have settled on two very satisfactory alternates to waiting in their cramped waiting area.  1. Going to Yoga to the People for a class, and rewarding myself with a ramen upon return.  2. Going to Angel's Share for a very lovely cocktail in a very cool spot.  (And it also goes with the Japanese theme, if you're into themes.) Oh no, I just got myself craving Ippudo again...must...go..for...dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is the smallest restaurant I've ever entered.  It reminded me of one of those beer stalls on Bourbob St. that look like they've been wedged between 2 buildings.   When you enter, o rlook through the window, you'll notice a menu with about 30 choices.  Stick with the #4.  Those are the pan fried dumplings that everyone goes for.  It's 5 for a dollar and most people seem to order at least 2 orders.  The skin on the dumplings is pretty thick, so just be ware if you're on some sort of low carb diet. I also tried the beef noodle soup, but wasn't that impressed.  I watched several people order different variations of soup and it is all the same broth.  Once an order is placed, so noodles are dropped in and som eprecooked meat that is stored in a nearby refrigerator.  Not much too it overall. Its a little off the beaten path though, so be prepared for a little walk though if you're coming from Canal St.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We drive by here all the time and always see a long line. Today I finally got a chance to see what the fuss is about! We just ate brunch so I only ordered 2 chicken and 2 beef kabob, 4 kabobs costed $13 total.  Took it home and I was pleasantly impressed by the flavor, the flavor is really in the meat, not just on the surface like many other places. Also even though it's grilled and dry on the outside, the meat is still very tender inside. I will definitely come back and try the rice platter next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"As a Japanese living in Manhattan, this restaurant serves the best quality Japanese dish that I have ever tasted here with reasonable pricing. I don't understand what those who said it's insanely expensive expect from this restaurant, and I would say they picked the wrong restaurant if they are so used to eating $5 Chinese takeaway. Quiality food comes with a bit of price tag. If you don't want to spend $20 for excellent lunch menu, go to Genki Sushi, instead. Yes, I agree that the service needs to be refined, and the waiters should be trained up, but give them sometime to pick up the speed to meet your expectation in services. They just opened a week ago. Also, the restaurant manager needs to understand and work harder to satisfy the expectation from non-Japanese clienteles if they want to broaden customer base. (who knows maybe they can make enough money off from Japanese living in Manhattan and Japanese tourists). Definitely I will go back for more and try everything on the menu. One drawback right now (as of April 6, 2012) was they don't have liquor license, but I am sure they are working on it, and once they get it, this place should become a very popular place to wind down over excellent grilled fish with Japanese sake or plum wine after a long day at work.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Rolled in here with a friend around 11pm on a Friday night. It wasn't terribly busy. Great low key, modern euro vibe. Bartender was pretty chill. I came in search of a large, german beer and pretzels. I was not disappointed. Prices are $6-8 for a .5 Liter (17 ounces) of quality German beer. I inquired about a dark beer on the menu and the bartender happily gave me a sample. Cool! It was awesome so I got a .5 liter of it and a pretzel. It came in it's own glass, a nice touch which is all too rare here in the states. The pretzel was awesome and they had a nice selection of mustard to dip it in. The full menu looked great but wasn't that hungry. I will for sure explore the menu when I come back, but the other reviews indicate that the quality is stellar. Overall I really enjoyed my visit to Der Kommissar. It's a unique establishment and, upon first visit, seems to have a great vibe and service. Check it out if you're in the area.

"Here's a little back story: my favorite Thai place in New York used to at Topaz. They have the best pad thai. the best. and then I met Room Service. Their version of pad thai is different from the usual ones I eat, it is a lot lighter, but still full of flavors. The mango slices on top and the sun dried shrimps are definitely nice touches. There is an egg white omelet covering the pad thai, with various seafood, and, the sauce...oh, the sauce. Everything marinates perfectly on the plate, even the crowded atmosphere (yep, you can eavesdrop about two different conversations, on each side) seemed welcoming. Friends had the green curry and the spicy thai basil. They both finished it, and said that they were quite good. I knocked off one star because of the appetizer. The assorted golden fritters were AWFUL. The dumplings were oily and dry, the blanketed shrimp were just okay, the spring rolls were a drag, and the tofu with crushed peanut sweet chili dipping sauce was downright disgusting... DEFINITELY get the modern pad thai when you are there. It is your specialty after all.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Who woulda known there'd be a hipster ramen spot in the heart of NYC? Just kidding.. although it is pretty hip for what it is.  Nice, dark interior... the servers are also easy on the eyes.  Good thing we came here on an off day.. even on Weds night we had about a 30 minute wait for 3.  The place can be a bit pricey, but let me remind you that you are paying for the ambiance and overall experience I guess.  A bowl of ramen here will run you $15 which I guess is pretty normal since a regular bowl in the bay area will cost you about $9-10 or so.   We had the Akamaru Modern and the Karaka Miso Ramen, which was was the spicy ramen and definitely my favorite!  Extra egg will cost you $2 and bamboo shoots $3.. but its soooo worth it!  And of course we had to get an order of the steamed pork buns.... OMG SO GOOD! I almost wanted an order to go to bring back home.. but I probably would've eaten it all to myself.  We also had an order of the duck over eggplant which I thought was really good as well.

We liked the mini paella with squid and rice, the egg-chorizo mix in eggshell, scallop, and the grilled octopus (which we ordered extra). You can also order small plates from the menu - - the 10-course menu is whatever the chef decides. Among the desserts, the caramelized torija was very tasty (it's like a piece of bread pudding).

"Definitely get the knife peeled noodle. Had the beef knife peeled soup noodle. It was ok, not mind blowing. The texture of the noodle was good but some were too soggy, losing texture. I prefer the noodle texture at X'ian Famous Foods. Beef slices were very tasty. The broth was a-ok...a little on the watery side--i prefer a soup base with little more intensity. Also had the pan fried regular hand pulled noodle. It was more chewy than your usual noodle but other than that, it's not much to write home about. So I would definitely get the knife peeled noodle.

The drink menu seems really great; however, my dining partner and myself were drawn there for the Jambalaya night special ($22 for jambalaya + 1 Abita + 1 oz pour of bourbon) sooo we just had the beer and bourbon, which honestly, was just perfect! So as I said, we came for Jambalaya night and got one of those and split a few of the other all stars on the menu... Lamb Pastrami and the Swiss Chard side. Whomever came up with lamb pastrami may very well be my idol! I am actually not a huge pastrami fan normally, but this was so full of flavor and well complimented by the red onion, coriander spread, and rye bread. Additionally, the swiss chard was a really nice veggie side. And the jambalaya. Well it was very good. To be fair, my friend and I had just gotten back from a fantastic foodie tour of New Orleans...home of jambalaya and our real verdict: the New Yorkers take on jambalaya. Very flavorful, nice heat, tender chicken, andouille, and shrimp... But let's be real, if it's not made in a cast iron skillet passed on for generations, piled HIGH with andouille and chicken, and consumed in the beautiful city of New Orleans, it's just not the same. However, it was very good and I would definitely have it again if it as on the menu. And lastly, and probably one the best things I have consumed in a very very long time (seriously get this next time you come here)... the homemade butter pecan ice cream drizzled in bourbon. I literally could've eaten this all night. It was one of the most fabulous ice creams I have ever had and will surely be back just for this dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In the trendy East Village area where restaurants line the streets, this is a can't miss!  Coming from South Florida where Latin influence is greater than any other, I was super impressed with the authenticity of flavors. Tuna Ceviche served very fresh and in a coconut with lemongrass infusion.  Also they have 4 other kinds to offer.  For the real ceviche lover they have a sampler of any 3 of the 5 they offer.  For my entree I had the churasco which was succulent and prepared perfectly with a mushroom chimichurri that was out of this world.  No need to reach for the salt or pepper, everything is seasoned to perfection.  Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the seating outside was a bit cramped ( I know I know its NYC) but I didn't need to know that the chick on next table over (6-8 inches) away had cramps!  Go on a Tuesday and they offer half priced Tapas!","[1.0, 0.0]"
Northern Spy Food Co has become my favorite restaurant in the east village. Came here a couple of times with the girlfriend once for brunch and twice for dinner. I highly recommend this place for both. I recommend trying one of the specials...both times I've been for dinner all the options sounded good. Had the special whitefish with butternut squash and veggies for dinner. I gambled on this - I normally do not eat fish but I figured I'd give it a shot at this place. My gamble played off and it was amazing! The blueberry crumble that was a perfect end to the meal if it's on the desserts I that night.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Good place!  I was there on a Saturday afternoon with my mom and her friend...wasn't expecting brunch menu only but the food was really tasty and great beer selection!  Also, not too crowded, I'd even consider coming back by myself to have lunch and a beer at the bar.  The decor is nice, kind of a retro-industrial feel with modern finishes.   We finished our lunch at about 3pm and were planning on leaving when the server asked if we would like to reserve the table for 4:30 and go step out and come back.  I thought that was a nice gesture since a NFL playoff game would be starting at 4:30.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place gets PACKED! This is my 2nd visit. First visit, we had to wait for about 40 minutes to be seated at this BIG table shared with a few other parties. I have to say, it was brutal to see other people at your table with their food while you wait for yours. My 2nd time there, no wait (lucky us!!). It was on a Tuesday night, but the place was still filled! The workers know people go there for the dumplings, so before we even sat our butts down, the waiter already asked how many orders of dumplings. Personally I thought it was kinda rude but if I guess I wouldn't mind if I was SUPER hungry and ready to chow! The two of us got an order of the dumplings, Shanghai noodle and a shrimp noodle soup. Everything was delicious. The trick to eat the dumpling is to eat the top first, suck the juice inside, then eat the whole thing. Both times, I had very good experience with the service and the food. I'd go there again :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The perfect little restaurant you go to and always leave satisfied. My boyfriend and I repeatedly come back as if it's the only Italian restaurant in the city. He LOVES the gnocchi and veal meatballs here it's the only thing he orders. I push him to order other yummy dishes Supper offers but nope he doesn't budge - gnocchi with meatballs it is. Who cares because I order everything else on the menu. The menu: They have daily risottos, I like tues (parm, lemon, parsley), wed (parm & mushrooms), and fri (seafood); daily entrees, I like wed (bolognese), thurs (chicken cutlet), fri (sole oreganata); sides, I like the mushroom trifolati; and for pasta, I like them all, especially the spaghetti al limone and ragu bolognese. I hardly drink wine (here I drink Aranciata) but if I happen to want a glass or two they have such an extensive wine list to choose from. The restaurant is always filled but never a wait. The waiters are very pleasant. My bf would steal one of the cooks if he had a restaurant - that's how impressive the cooks are (there's an open kitchen in the center). I really love this place; it's dim, cozy, service is great & personable, and portions are perfect. We have no problems about the cash only policy - I'd want my biz to be cash only too = P Huge FAN of Frank Prisinzano's establishments. ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------ Hands down their gnocchi is truly the best I've ever tasted.

"this place is cheap, for 6 dollars you can really fill up, my friend and i split a combo rice plate (chicken and lamb, with pita, veggy, and rice) first off, im a health nut, i felt really guilty after i ate it and read online somewhere that one plate consisted of about 2045 calories, hard to believe? no, its believable, its quite obvious a lot of oil was used in the cooking, and not to mention the white sauce..isnt exactly fat free or low cal delicious? yes, but i think that i've had better..though i dont know where..this place just didnt stand out for me. i've had enough halal food to know when something really hits the spot, this place came close but no cigar not to mention these guys are mean and rude, i know they're food cart vendors and its amount turning over customers and being quick quick quick, but a wadded up ball of $1s for change and the ""pay me and get out of my face"" attitude does not make for good customer service","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pates et Traditions was an amazing little gem found in Williamsburg. I had a late lunch here with a close friend of mine after a day of thrift shopping and it was a cozy little break from the madness of shopping.   We went around 3pm, a rather odd time for a meal I'll admit, but we had no problem finding a seat.  Although the weather outside was perfect, and others were enjoying the outside seating, we opted for a table indoors.  The decor was very cute and adorable.  It reminded me of a beach side cottage with its pastel colors and various postcards and snapshots all over the walls.  My only critique would be the seating.  My friend sat on one of the benches on the wall while I sat in a cushioned chair.  Maybe it was just my seat but the cushion kept on sliding leading to some slight discomfort and awkwardness. Onto the service, which was very good.  Our server/waitress was a beautiful woman with a thick French accent who I am pretty certain was the owner.  She was a delight though her accent made it somewhat difficult to understand but hey, it makes me wish I had taken French instead of Spanish in high school.  She was patient when my friend and I could not decide on which crepe to order. My friend wound up ordering a savory crepe, I forget its name but it had eggplant and tomato while I had a sweet crepe which had Cinnamon apples and vanilla ice cream.  The presentation was very cute and they both tasted wonderful.  We could not help but sampling each others crepe and vowing to come back and order both a savory and sweet crepe each.  Our bill only ended up being 20$  which I think is very good considering we got 2 crepes, salad, coffee, and juice. Overall Pates et Traditions is a beautiful little place with a friendly atmosphere, and delicious food.  It is somewhere I would definitely return to for a great brunch.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Not your typical Lombardi's or Grimaldi's pizza, but still amazing on its own. The crust is thicker and chewy, and only comes in three toppings, Sicilian, Artichoke, Crab, and two sizes, smaller rectangular one, or huuuge triangular one. I've yet to try the Artichoke, but I presume it's just as amazing. My boyfriend especially loves the Crab, although I have to admit I still prefer the thin crust New York style pizza from Lombardi's and Grimaldi's more. These just remind me too much of your average Dominoes or Pizza Hut, just 100x better, of course.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came in here early on a friday night. Walked right in and took a seat near the back. I was looking to have some nice drinks and some good food. Not a full huge meal but something to soak up the liquor. As we sat near the back of the front section in the dimly lit bar our waitress came over with drink menus and introduced her self. She was nice and made suggestions. One thing I will say is the selection of cocktails they have here is lack luster to say the least. I didn't love either of the two drinks I had and nothing else on the menu sounded even remotely appetizing. I was looking for something sweet so I started with the Skinny Sorbet spritzer in the Mango flavor. It was like fancy seltzer water. Super light, barely any alcohol and I chugged it down. The second drink I ordered was the Creamsicle. I'm not crazy about orange and cream but compared to cucumber and jalapeño drinks I felt this was the best option for me. The creamsicle wasn't too bad. Pretty sweet but not the sweet I was looking for. It needed a kick. It was a light sweet flavor that virtually amounts to no taste. They have a lime on the side of the glass. I squeezed that into my drink and let it sit in there. As my creamsicle began to absorb the flavors of the lime it began to taste a little better. I wouldn't run back here for either of these two drinks but the creamsicle was definitely the better of the two. For eats I ordered the Fish tacos. I glimpsed the yelp reviews and heard they were pretty good. I recently was in San Diego were I had some of the best fish tacos on the planet so I should have decided against it...but I couldn't resist. The fish tacos here were decent. Way more delicious than the two drinks I ordered but I love fish and I love tacos and I asked for wings sauce and that makes everything better. The fish tacos comes with 4 mini taco with a little chunk of fish in each little tortilla. Some type of salad/slaw on top. Once covered in the wing sauce I was licking my fingers. They were good but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was decent. A chill vibe. I was able to talk to my friend the whole night with no loud music or loud people hanging around. The show music videos on the big screen television so we were able to see a whole bunch of videos we had never seen before. Our waitress was pretty nice and we only couldn't get her attention at the end of the night while she played around with one of her co-workers and we waited to get her to bring the bill. It was early so music and all that I can't really speak on. Maybe the vibe is different as the night progresses. Overall it's a decent spot. I probably won't return because the drinks weren't all that impressive.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let me preface my review by saying if this place were in Texas it wouldn't last a week. I would give maybe three stars. Now that thats out there, Fette Sau is fun, relaxing and delicious. I went on a Thursday night around 9 and it was packed. Not to worry, it took only a few minutes to grab a seat at the bar and begin sampling their handful of really well picked delicious beers on draft. They have a great whiskey collection too... we tried a Hudson that was stellar-- and apparently from New York's first distillery since prohibition. So, informative bartenders give this place an extra half star. We looked over the menu, which was limited as BBQ places usually are, and ordered brisket, pork shoulder, and ribs. The ribs were outstanding. The brisket was a bit dry. The thing that stuck out to me most about this place (as compared to the Texas joints) are their weird BBQ sauces. Let me tell you, a good BBQ sauce can make you forget that your brisket is dry. My dining amigo loved one (but he was from Seattle... what does he know?) but I found it WAY to vinegary. When mixed with the thicker, spicier one it was closer to the real thang, but still not enough to make me forgive and forget. Its always crowded, so don't go if you're looking for an intimate place to have a quiet conversation. You are probably going to have to share a giant picnic table with 15+ people. But hey, thats fun. I will go back to Fette Sau for two reasons. The previously mentioned bar and the delicious broccoli. Thats right, the broccoli. I've never had broccoli melt in my mouth like this. I've also never had broccoli at a BBQ place but thats neither here nor there. It was really garlic-y and had some sort of chili flakes going on. Its THE must-order item.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The sandwiches are made to order & I can definitely taste the freshness. The bread is perfectly grilled & the best part about it is the buttery crunch & flavor in each bite. You can also order tasty fries, tater tots, or onion rings on the side to have with your sammie. They offer wine & beer which pairs well with their food menu.

Like Otto, Eataly is one of those places that you need to go to on weekdays or nights. I went in on a Tuesday evening and was immediately impressed. Highlights: - Stracciatella gelato - delicious sweet milk flavor with flecks of light chocolate chips. - The fresh pasta counter. The guy behind the counter told me exactly how to cook one of the pastas I was getting. For a cooking ignoramus like me, that was immensely helpful. - The butternut squash and almond cookie filled handmade ravioli!! I love italian almond cookies so this was beyond impressive to me. - The casualness and openness of the cafe, also loved the really high ceilings - the fresh herbs, including the fresh mint that I bought I need to go back and try the espresso and eat at the cafe.

"This place is so empty but it's just because people haven't figured out what it is yet. Admittedly, the restaurant has some identity issues: there is no particular culture being represented in the limited menu, the decor, and even the name and logo, which to me appear Mayan, don't imply anything about the kitchen. Ultimately, it's American (French) fare, but done very well considering most of the choices in the neighborhood. Probably the most well rounded meal I've had in the area. We had a whole roasted fish and chicken. In retrospect, two main courses was too much food and the price a little steep (the decor hurts the prices: I would pay the same for the same food at chic places like Northeast Kingdom). So next time we may order an appetizer and a main dish instead. The chicken was perfectly cooked and served with tasty pillowy gnocchi that were just a tad too greasy, but the flavors were right on: lots of herbs, properly seasoned. The fish was also quite good, although the green beans were a little too snappy and could have used an extra minute in the boil. Service was fine. I will return.","[1.0, 0.0]"

For me, it's in the neighborhood, so there's an added benefit, but after my third visit this year, I feel compelled to officially review the place and tell you how lovely it is. From the way you feel when you first walk in to this cozy spot and are warmly greeted by staff to how happy your taste buds are when you take your first bite into the house selection of bread and house spreads, Applewood is the real deal. I highly recommend anything with pork on the menu - they house cure it and it is phenomenal. Seriously. Even if you're vegetarian, this is the place to cheat. Desserts are wonderful and so is their wine selection. Tonight, I had the 1/2 bottle of Mt. Harlan Viognier and it rocked my world.

"3.75 stars. Yet another burger place I've been dying to try for the longest time. Ordered the ""Bistro burger"" which is basically a regular cheeseburger with bacon added.  The meat patty is fried (at least, that's what my friend said), thick, and had the crispy bacon with fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion.  There was no sauce.   I was able to appreciate the natural flavor of the beef, and also the fact that it wasn't very oily (I ordered mine medium well) despite it being fried.  The fresh veggies added to the overall ""clean"" flavor.  And while I was able to appreciate it, I still felt the burger was a little dry (maybe I should've just ordered it medium?) and could've used some sort of sauce or maybe more seasoning.  The bacon was good and crispy (often times I find bacon in burgers to be limp and soggy). It's a thick patty (like Shake Shack) and about the same size too.  However, definitely not as oily/greasy as Shake Shack's.  But not as tasty either =( Overall, pretty good.  I'd definitely come again. The fries were stale, tasteless, no salt, nothing great.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bogota is a moderately priced (not cheap) neighborhood that specializes in Colombian food and drink. The restaurant has a festive atmosphere and serves up some terrific food. My wife likes their chicken quesadillas to the point of ordering them almost every time we go. I like the chicken chicharron, the tortilla soup, Daisy's Eggs, the signature arroz con pollo, the empanadas, the pernil. I'm determined to get through their menu, but it's a real challenge. When I try something new, I fall in love with it and then order it over and over again. They have a nice selection of beers and they make all the great hispanic drinks: margaritas, mojitos and caipirinhas, all of which can be ordered with any of the eight tropical fruits they have. Prices are reasonable, especially during their happy hours, which run all day from lunch until dinner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Was walking to Clinton Bakery from 6th Street when we happened to come on this place...so glad we did!!!! The food was great.  We were visiting from California for the week and so wished we had found it earlier in the week.  The service was a little slow but I can handle that when my bill was under $20 for almost the exact same thing I had ordered the day before at Clinton Bakery and spent $37.  Don't get me wrong the blueberry pancakes at Clinton are out of this world but Cornerstone is pretty darn good.  Next time I am in town we will be hitting Cornerstone for certain!  Great coffee too!!!!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cute breakfast stop down under (59th st). Saturday is a busy day for Little Collins, as most the tables were occupied even around 2PM. Placing an order was also a bit awkward because we had picked out a table beforehand, and we waited on line apparently against traffic; the barista took the order of two parties before us, even though we had arrived at the counter first. My Pick Me Up breakfast sandwich was very tasty for the price. My omelette was had the perfect moist-spongy ratio, and I thought all the ingredients served their purpose in completing the sandwich. The tomato kept slipping out as it was so thickly sliced, but it's nothing a tight grip can't handle. It was nice that they called my order by my name, even though I had never given it (yay for credit cards). I would definitely come back for other sandwiches, as their mash looked amazing. I'd be a little hesitant to order brunch as their prices were $10-15, which was hard to believe given the size of the kitchen.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Impossibly small.  Both space and portion-wise.  I'm not quite sure how they do it though, as Graffiti does try to maximize the most out of so little. Space:  There's Manhattan-small then there's Graffiti small.  I can't imagine anyone larger than 100 lbs. able to sit comfortably at one of these tables.  After excusing myself to use the restroom at one point, I found myself shimmying through the kitchen, quite possibly butt-bumping one or two chefs along the way.  They might have enjoyed it.  Bottom line-- get ready to get cozy and intimate with everyone in the restaurant, real fast. Food: Model-size portions.  Unless you're willing to order one of everything off the menu (which can rack up your bill very quickly) be prepared to scarf a second dinner after a meal here.  Highlights, however, included the pickled ginger scallops (with a pleasing crunch offered by the dehydrated mung beans spooned on top), flavorful pork buns with a delicious apricot chutney (although at 3 for $15 I think many would rather skip down the street to momofuku for a bao fix), and the chili shrimp with daikon salsa which perfectly balanced that sweet and sour tang I love so much. Other dishes weren't as memorable.  Interesting to look at but nothing more, the pork dumplings were unappealingly mushy and definitely not better than those I could easily find in Chinatown.  Eggplant buns-- completely unidentifiable as eggplant.  A dark smudge enveloped in a mantou bun.  Had to remind myself what I was biting into at one point. I will, however, compliment Chef Mehta for his desserts.  The hazelnut chocolate ""caviar"" cupcake was an absolute delight and a must-order for any chocolate lover.  And the warm truffle almond strawberries made me re-think the idea that warm fruit could be delicious.  I'd happily eat a bowl of this every night. Last but certainly not least, this review would not be complete without a shout out to the $25 wine list.  Every bottle of wine for a mere $25.  Many, many bottles of Malbec were downed at my dinner.  And with a price point this low, many many more were ordered in succession. There's something to be said about a restaurant that can do this much with so little.  In the case of Graffiti, I applaud them for their resourcefulness, inventive approach to Indian/Asian fusion, and wonderful desserts.  For everything else-- a polite clap.  And maybe a butt-bump.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"so happy that Anella opened in GP. Finally a great neighborhood place that isn't overrun with Williamsburg refugees.   The food is executed amazingly well and is very flavorful. The meatballs are so light and tasty and served with home made spaghetti and a red sauce that has just the perfect balance of sweet and acid.  The hand tossed pizzas are original and quite yummy.  My favorite from their fall menu is the double cut pork chop stuffed with apple and ciabatta (sp) stuffing, a must have for the meat lover.  The hubbie and I were very fortunate and got to taste the newest addition to the desert menu before it was added and it was stunning!.  I'm not a big big cheese cake person, suffice it to say that I hate cheese cake, but the goat cheese cheese cake is something that I could eat every day! The service is unsurpassed for a restaurant that is so new and is better than a lot of white table cloth places that I've been to.  Andrew the manager greets you warmly and is very personable.  The staff makes you feel at home and is very friendly.   The atmosphere is very homey and comfortable and the back patio is a must during the warm weather months.  The only thing I don't like about the decor is the recent addition of the pieces of Michelangelo's David face that is lining the wall of the main dining room, they're just so out of place. Other than that very minor hiccup, Anella is a must for great casual evening out.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Don't try to eat in and DEFINITELY do not order over Seamless unless you want to be tired and hangry.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Sunday brunch was good here but on the scale of French-brunchy-places this was more in the mediocre range for me.  The place itself is cutsey with pictures of the Tin Tin cartoon on the wall and available seating in an enclosed outdoor terrace.   Food: I got the omelet with spinach, mushrooms, onions.  Omelet came out a little overcooked.   Friend got the croque madame.  Big portion and lots of gruyere..mmm Shared the waffle with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  This HIT the SPOT.  Best part of brunch for sure and much more of a dessert than an entree. Service was very efficient, attentive but not overly so and we were seated almost right away for 2pm on a sunday.   Most interesting part of the meal was when the fire dept came through to attend to someone in the enclosed terrace who, according to the watier, apparently wasn't feeling very well because they have a brain tumor.  hmmm...its one of those moments when you know you shouldn't stare when they are brought through the restuarant but you can't help but stare.  Hope the guy survives.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Interesting. Given the commentary received on my Sripraphai thread, I was ready for a struggle.  But dinner was pretty great, and the service was quick, quick!  We made sure to order the soft-shell crab, as recommended.  We also had fish curry with coconut milk wrapped in a banana leaf (see the picture Julie will post if she hasn't already), and since I could not hold myself back, pad thai.  The crab was excellent, but the fried aspect was not agreeing with my taste buds after a couple pieces.  Should have been a lighter batter or something.  The sauce was great, and whatever was in it really complemented the crab.  The fish curry was art, yet I again could not hold myself back and took a bite before a picture could be taken.  It was really spicy, and you could not taste even a subtle note of fish, which is the way I would have liked it.  It's heat made me reflect on those clever Thai folk who put milk and rice in almost everything so as to counteract the spice of the food.  Nice.  The pad thai which we were told not to get but I had to have, interestingly, was not that good.  I've tasted better pad thai at every other Thai restaurant I have been to, even those of the greasier variety.  But for me, pad thai is simply something that begs to be eaten.  For dessert, we split the coconut ice cream with peanuts and palm seeds.  It was served in a coconut half-shell with one of those tiki brollies stuck in the ice cream.  it looked like a Mai Tai!  It was pretty good, but I especially loved the palm seeds. The place is very nice.  I can't wait until the weather gets warmer so we can sit on the patio.  They also do takeout and have some Thai treats for sale.

"Used to be one of my favorite restaurants that I would return to year after year for big occasions, but I went there for a birthday dinner recently and discovered that it must be under new management or something to explain a step decline in food and service. We were seated in a back room (the main reason one goes to Alta is to enjoy the open central room, which has charm) that required literally squeezing behind kitchen staff working at a counter along a wall and into a mundane room facing streetlamps with no window treatment to stop the glare. For the last 35 minutes of our meal, an annoying gentlemen hovered around us constantly checking to see if we were done yet; we felt on the clock, and sure enough, after ordering many courses and spending an exorbitant amount of money, he utlimately approached us and ""offered"" us drinks at the bar so he could have the table. Apparently spending a lot and eating a lot wasn't good enough to allow us to enjoy our meal at a normal pace. This is the rudest thing a restaurant can do to its customers, and I thought Alta as better than than-but alas, it  has become just another lousy business that pushes people out of their seats in order to fill them asap. Ironically, we had just asked for the check when he approached us, and there was an empty table next to us-so the urgency was hard to understand. We ate quickly, and there was little time spent just talking and enjoying each others company, in other words, it was not as if we had finished our meal and were sitting around sipping wine for an hour. Needless to say, he sullied what should have been a relaxing birthday dinner. I definitely do not recommend this place any more. It has clearly changed, and for the worse.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ippudo Ramen tastes just like the ramen I got in Japan. You can watch someone making fresh noodles in the basement, so you know you're not eating something prepackaged.

The wait was extremely long, even on a Tuesday at 1:00 pm. We had about an hour wait for two people. Just know this before you go and make plans to wait somewhere else, because there isn't much room in their waiting area. We went to Think Coffee down the street, which was good too.

It was INCREDIBLE. That corn was INCREDIBLE!   We also split the avocado fries which were tasty. For dinner we had the enchiladas and the stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes. Both were delicious! The enchiladas had a great taste to them.   We didn't get dessert, but I had a cup of coffee and it was just as good. The atmosphere is very cute and perfect for a date, or even a smallish gathering with a friend.   My friend and I sat next to a film crew from Argentina that asked us to taste some of the food they were sampling and tell them what we thought.

"I heart Frank Liotti (the bartender). Not only is he charismatic, funny man - his Manhattan rocked my world. I have not tried their food, so this 5-star rating is really for the talents of their bartender (75% of my score) and the surreal setting (25% of my score), which management pulls of quite well. I swung through here with a few friends on a Friday night a short while back and had drinks at the bar for one or two hours. Such a picturesque setting - nestled into the end of an alley, Freemans feels like you are stepping on to a movie set. And what a scene - in typical New York fashion, at the end of this alley way, you step into what seems like a completely random place, only to find that it is bursting with put together people lapping up their dinner and laughing across their tables. The icing on the cake, though, was the bartender's skills and demeanor. He even gave us a little tutorial in Manhattan's. I was not surprised to find out toward the end that Frank also has a career as a standup comic - because he kept us laughing too (but not in a constant, conversation interrupting way - very appropriate, well-timed interludes or punctuations throughout our time at the bar).","[0.0, 1.0]"

The servers were OK except for this one guy who needed some help with volume control, and I also didn't like how they kept upselling us at every turn.  They definitely took advantage of the fact that we were a large group and brought out things we didn't ask for.

As for the rotisserie duck over rice, if you go to their website you'll see a little '*' next to this on the menu which means 'this dish contains pork'. What this means in real life is that there is a very thick layer of pork sausage stuffed under the skin, which resulted in all my slices of 'duck' being 80% pork sausage and 20% duck. Ok it was nice - but again but no more so that having duck pancakes in any other chinese place. The only saving grace was that I got a free dessert for my duck over rice being tardy to come out....but it wasn't enough to save the meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"oh-la-la. What a dainty crepe restaurant in Brooklyn. The staff was nice, the service was great, the place was super cute. I've been having a huge crepe craving forever, and this place hit the spot. Each savory crepe is served with a side salad (prices range from $9-$12). And the sweet crepes are $9-10. I ordered the chicken & mushroom, followed by the ice cream crepe. Their ""homemade"" chocolate syrup tasted like Hershey's syrup to me. Next time, I think I'll stick to the original Nutella. They had this interesting cocktail that mixed wine & cola & orange slices special. Never had that before, and it paired nicely with a savory crepe. Check out the various posting on wall for other menu specials. They seemed to have utilized every single piece of wall space except the ceiling.

"So I typically check out a bar or two thats not too far from this place and, needless to say, if it's a sunday night, if I'm there, I'm usually 10 sheets to the wind! The bartender there, the medium height Asian guy, makes a killer french martini...ok yeah you can laugh, big brown man with a purple drink...whatever kiss my a@@ it's f'n good and goes really well with any type of Thai food...especially the eggroll skin wrapped deep fried shrimp things....RIIDIC!!  I typically have a couple of these while watching people line up against the brick wall and wait to be seated.   I've never been completely dissatisfied with the food I've had here, except that sometimes, the beef dishes can be a little salty. The pad thai is pretty good here, nice and saucy! The curries are above par but nothing to go crazy about. In terms of decor, I like to sit outside or in one of the middle tables, as it gets really busy and those spaces afford a little bit more space. There is usually a DJ that spins house funk or some a little hip hop but I've never been completely unhappy with the music. Going back to the drinks...I also like the Thai Ice Tea with some Stoli Vanilla Vodka....there is a slight aftertaste but a couple of those makes your dining experience much better!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"How can anyone give this place anything more than one star, its not a real Pio Pio, its a ripoff!! Pio Pio Riko, is NOTHING like the original!!! The food is tasteless, theres no flavor in the chicken, beef, beans, the only saving grace was their green sauce which was served at the beginning with some corn nuts (how were we supposed to eat this was anyones guess, as no plates were provided).   The staff has a thin veneer of friendliness, and lacks any sort of waiting experience or manners for that matter. They seem to be young and dumb, only hired for their looks; the dirty blond hostess actually walked away from us in mid order for whatever reason, with no apology or customary mannerisms one would expect from a restaurant. Im not asking for nor expecting this to be a five star establishment, but i can get this level of service from any fast food place. Seeing this, another waitress came to take our order, she lacked experience but was much more friendly. Our food arrived quickly, which is to be expected from the uncomplicated menu. The presentation was ok, except for the salchi pappa (a hot dog) which looks like one of those trick cigars exploded from either end. My girlfriend had the chicken, which had none of the familiar flavor of a real Pio Pio chicken. The maduros weren't sweet at all, the beans were bland, all in all we were highly disappointed.   The bottom line is; anyone who thinks this food is good, has not experienced the real thing, save your money and time and go to the real Pio Pio on 34th st.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had the couscous with Merguez sausages (O: 3 stars, P: 4 stars, T: 2.5 stars) which was so disappointing. The couscous itself was so bland! Moroccan food is not supposed to lack in flavor! My friend's Hachi Parmentier (O: 3.5 stars, P: 3 stars, T: 3 stars) was slightly better but not by much. The dessert was more satisfying, thankfully. We had the bread pudding (O: 3.5 stars, P: 3 stars, T: 4.5 stars) which was very light and delicious. Over all I'd say come here for a glass of wine and some beautiful people watching.

The spicy sauce they have on the side has some pork bits in it (not vegetarian) and has the spicy chili oil. It's not super spicy, so you can use a lot of it, but the flavor is amazing! My friend just scooped a whole spoonful to drop in his noodle soup because it tasted so good. Note: CASH ONLY.

"I was taking a trip to the McCarren Park for my soccer game with a couple of friends, when I saw this restaurant nearby- (between Lorimer St & Nassau Ave) called Five Leaves. When I walked by, a scent of ricotta pancakes was in the air, compiled with banana, and a pile of berries. It looks as good as it sounds. I would say the coffee part is a little overpriced but the breakfast is a must. So I decided to try these ricotta pancakes. They came with a mound of honeycomb butter, toppled with berries, and a whole banana. These amazing pancakes filled me up quickly, and the texture was fluffy and soft. I highly recommend this place, just come before noon and you won't have to wait like a half-an hour for a table. I would also have to say that the exterior view is amazing. Also if you get the chance, definitely try the truffle fries. They are crispy and brown on the outside with softness bundled on the inside.

"I went here with a friend for lunch once. Before I spoke to anyone, I noticed that I really liked the ""uniforms"" or outfits the waitresses were wearing. Unfortunately, once I started talking to the hostess, I wasn't excited anymore. I must admit my friend and I were being a bit indecisive about where we wanted to eat (inside or outside) and I wasn't hungry at that moment but I told her that I would sit with her while she ate. The hostess told us that we couldn't sit down unless both of us were eating, which I thought was a little odd. We decided to leave (mostly because of the hostess' attitude) so we went outside and then we decided to stay after all (I told you we were being indecisive). She reminded us with her rude tone that we couldn't sit down if we weren't both eating and we told her we would both get a little something. She took us to our table and literally threw our menus at us. As someone who used to live in LA (for 5 hellish years), I know pretense when I see it and this place just gives off that vibe. Like, ""Are you good enough to eat here?"" I don't eat at places because everyone else does--I eat at them because they're good and I enjoy myself.

"Call me this review Confessions of a Cookshop-aholic...well it sounded better in my head than reading it...and I refuse to touch that ""delete"" key. Not sure why I haven't written about this fine establishment before... On to the restaurant, I have dined at Cookshop 4 different times. 2 business lunches post Javits Center convention mania and twice for socializing and dinner. What I'll say this restaurant decor and ambience is as versatile as its staff and menu. Very clean and simple decorative values help focus you on the food. There are plenty of bathrooms there...I think like 4 or so...which means there's never lines etc. or crowding if you decide to break ""the seal."" heh The cocktail list is an inventive one--nothing ridiculous...I do like the bourbon lemonade which is excellent and has some bite to it. Favorites on the dinner menu include: the scallops, the lamb... The bar food is tempting like the deviled eggs amongst other small treats. Favorites on the lunch menu is really anything on the sandwich menu. I am a simple dessert person, so the cookie platter really hit the spot for me after a fair amount of proteins. The service is friendly but not annoying...and the people who work there seem to genuinely like it...which always enhances the mood of a restaurant from just eh to excellent. The only reason why I am not giving the place 5 stars is I think the wine list needs a few more affordable choices to it, so you can pair accordingly to your meal.

For the birthday boy, they put candles on a number of desserts to make it festive.  Other tables joined in ""Happy Birthday"".   The tiramisu was good.  The chocolate covered cake dessert was a crowd pleaser!  We got competitive over the shared portions!  The Italian cookies really stood out from most Italian cookies I have had.  They were very fine.  Three portions of dessert and two plates of cookies were sufficient for the table of nine.   The noise level was acceptable.

I tried. Oh did I try to down more than one pot. Our waiter tempted me with the various flavors like grand-mere featuring a creamy beer sauce. (All grandmothers should have that quality). Alas, I could not answer the matter-of-fact question of ""So what pot is next?"" but had to yield to my belly's capacity (or lack thereof). $24, Wednesday night, all the mussels you can eat, frites and a Stella or Palm beer to wash it all down with. Gluttonous, yes but good? I had my mussels in the marinieres sauce so this was white wine with lots of garlic and celery. It was the kind of sauce that lends itself to bread dipping and our crusty bread refills were presented seamlessly. The mussels themselves hail from the gentle island, Prince Edward, to be exact and were copious and failed to exhibit the behavior of bad mussels-- no closed shells or bits of sand to impede my feasting. The frites were low on grease but lacked a crispiness I'd expect. They seemed a bit blah but were enhanced when dipped into mayo. For those who opt out of all you can eat offers, the restaurant also offers a prix-fixe $24 menu from 5-6:30pm. My wife had lobster bisque soup of the day, sausage and steump (tasted and looked like mashed potatoes) and a dessert waffle with coffee. I assisted in the eating of the dessert waffle despite my belly full of mussels. (No need to go to the gym anymore) Why not a 4th star? I was a little disappointed with the service, mainly by what was not done. For instance, I was initially missing a fork, my mussels did not come with a small fork to ease prying, my request for mayo resulted in ketchup, our request for the prix fixe menu was initially forgotten and..that's about it. Mind you, our waiter was gracious, friendly and very personable, all things considered. Besides mussels, you can find classic Belgian entrees such as vol au vent, carbonnade flammade, macaroni jambon fromage and more. The beer selection is obviously heavy on Belgian as you can find all the heavy hitters for heavy drinkers (Ommegang, Duvel, Kwak,etc). The interior was cozy as we were led to a back room with a fireplace that felt like it could belong to my Belgian countryside residing uncle, if I had such a relation. Tables were close but not elbow-rattling distance. I'd definitely return to the little bee and perhaps build up the stamina to tackle a second pot of mussels.

"Eating at Feast is like the best family dinner you can imagine, if you happen to come from a family full of great cooks. Comfortable seating, relaxed atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food. The room's lively and vibrant, but quiet enough for talking at a normal level. Seven of us shared the game feast, plus a couple of a la carte veggie dishes, and enjoyed everything. To single out just a few things: The wild boar ribs with root beer foam was absolutely delightful -- meaty, succulent, falling-off-the bone tender. Acorn squash with blue cheese and pumpkin seeds was a lovely balance of sweet, salty, savory, creamy, crunchy. The mushroom agnolotti, light and savory. Who knew I like venison so much?! I wish I had asked for a copy of the wine list -- there are quite a few excellent choices offered by the glass. I started with the albarino (especially great with the smoked trout and farro salad) and moved on to the pinot noir (light enough for the sea bass and quail, complex enough for the duck).

"I used to love going to this place, but I must say that customer service is NOT this restaurants strong point. Food is cheap and good, but the service is horrible! We went last night for dinner at around 9pm was told there would be a 20-30 minute wait.... which we are ok with. We did not sit down at our table untill 10:15pm, on top of that multipe parties with that same amount of people that came in AFTER us were seated BEFORE us. After we sat down we were starving and the waiter did not come up to use for atleast 10 minutes, no apologies.... just attitude. Food came before drinks which made us not even want them anymore. Also no silverware at the tables when the food came, on top of us being starving we were not able to eat and just stared at our appetizers. After the check came still no apology from the waiter but he started arguing with us that the wait was not as long as we had claimed....Instead of arguing, just apologize and keep doing your job. Terrible experience, such a shame! Used to be a great place now I dread ever coming back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
Amazing cozy find near the metro. The lamb sausage sandwich and grilled chicken shish kebab topped off with lentil soup were cooked to perfection.

"I don't know quite where to begin. Last night, amidst the cold wind and snow flurries, I found myself at The Spotted Pig. This place reminded me of a little pub in New Hampshire: warm, cozy and filled with laughter and gastric delight. My friend demanded that we have the pig's ears. Having southern roots you'd think I would have had pig's ears, but I hadn't. I was apprehensive, but willing to try the many items on the menu that sounded impressive. I asked our waitress what were her 4 favorite things on the menu, and thankfully she named delights we were eying: Pig's Ears Salad, Ricotta Gnudi Balls, Calf's Liver and Beef Tongue. Unbelievable. The gnudi balls and pig's ears arrived first. The salty, crispy ear strips tasted finer than bacon over arugula and field greens with a punchy vinaigrette dressing. The surprising balls were a delicate and savory experience with the right balance of salt and cheese. Now I'm not normally drawn to menu items that include such words as ""liver"" or ""tongue,"" but my apprehension vanished with my first bites. The tongue had a delightfully light steak flavor with the tenderness of the best rib eye. An absolute delight. The calf's liver was also tasty and tender, although it didn't pack the ambrosial flavor punch of the other items we selected. I would definitely return, and perhaps soon. But I should warn no one to go there having not eaten all day. The richness of the food (and the richness of the cocktails I had before our table was ready) proved too rich for my painfully empty stomach.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"There was a reason why my parents never brought me here: They did not want me and my sister to get fat. Yes, that's how good their stuff is. We live only a couple of blocks away. The place doesn't seem too clean. Upon entering, the smell of dirtiness kinda hits you. Smelled like my dad's fast food place, heh. Then I looked to the right, and there's a colander full of disposed noodles over a bucket full of disposed soup from the noodle soups. Did I lose my appetite one bit? Nope, the nastier the place, the more delicious the food. And that also means you get to eat for super duper cheap. Sis and I ordered the fried pork and chive dumplings, scallion pancakes and beef stew noodle soup. The fried dumplings were ok. Quite salty to me, but it was juicy to the max. Greasy, yes, but that means the more tasty it is. We failed to locate the spicy vinegar sauce, which was a downer. We also were too health conscious to drizzle the spicy oil over the already oil drenched dumplings. But we did eat it with Sriracha to get the spicy kick. The scallion pancakes were pretty good. Nice crunchy exterior, with the insides soft and chewy. Wish they put more scallions though. Tastes great with Sriracha. The winner for us was the beef stew noodle soup. The noodles were amazing! The texture was perfect. The beef was nice and tender, unlike other places where the meat gets stuck in between your teeth, and it hurts like a bitch until you reach into your mouth and pull the little sucker out of the crevice. The soup base was perfectly seasoned. I hate cilantro, but the noodle soup was so good, that I didn't mind it one bit. We were so stuffed afterwards that we couldn't even eat dinner. Seriously, it was a lot of food, and we only paid $9!! What a steal! Yes, it definitely put a toll on our bodies, but it certainly saved our wallets, and sent our taste buds on an exciting ride. And did we get sick? Nope, absolutely not. We will be back to eat some more. P.S.-I told my parents about this place, and when my dad doesn't work, he comes here to get their fried dumplings or their beef stew noodle soup. ""I can't believe this dump makes such good noodle soups, and for so cheap!!"", he exclaimed the first day he tried it. So basically he goes there quite often.

"Adorable little wine bar.  The leek frittata was good, but a bit greasy. The bread was great, and the wine very nice. I loved the baskets of nuts and fruits/vegetables on both the main and as you go through the wine cellar to the washroom.  They could so easily be cheesy, but instead they totally evoke 'adorable Italian farmhouse.'  The waiters don't rush you about turning the table, even when the bar is hip-deep in people.  (Along those lines, I agree with the other reviews--get there early or gets v. crowded.)  The garden outside looks like it will be great in warmer months too.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We found Vitae by looking at Yelp, and were so impressed!  We called for a table last-minute on a Friday evening, and were able to get right in. When we arrived, the first impression was Wow! Ultra modern, clean lines, beautiful lighting, tables nicely spaced -- just lovely. The service was even more amazing. From the first greeting to the hugs when we departed -- we received attentive care from, I think, 5 different people, and all were professional, friendly, and just plain wonderful. The wine list was good, though I would like a few more of the buttery Calif Chardonnays -- my personal favorite. The manager did point us to a good wine choice, though, and we were happy with it. The menu was artfully prepared, and the food was equally artfully executed. The three of us had: Seared Diver Scallop with Cauliflower, Golden Raisins, Cashews, Thai Curry Sauce for appetizer (shared), duck breast (superb), Alaskan wild salmon (an unusual preparation but nicely cooked), and Grilled Mayan Prawns (appetizer - delicious) paired with a small serving (nice idea) of the Maltagliati with Lamb Sausage, Baby Zucchini, Roasted Tomatoes San Tumas (different and quite good). We enjoyed a chef offering of a small bite-size risotto ball in a divine sauce, and after dinner another chef-offered bite of meringue with raspberry filling. We also shared two desserts: Rosemary-Honey Panna Cotta with Blueberries, Peanut Crumble, and Churros & Chocolate -- both delightful. This chef-owned restaurant has only been open five months, and in our experience a new restaurant often under-delivers - at least for the first year or so. This one was superlative on all counts, right down to the ""Vitae"" printed hand towels in the bathroom. We predict it will gain rapidly in popularity. Not sure if we will be back on this trip to NY, but for sure it will be on our list for any future visit to this city.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I thought for the most part that the prices were really reasonable, except for the scallops. They were delicious - but such a small portion. There were 3 tiny scallops. We expected them to be bigger. The pappardelle was good - but not hot enough. BUT - that fried chicken - huge portion for only $13 and truly the best fried chicken I have ever had - mouth watering and melt in your mouth. Yummy!! Apparently they brine it first in a buttermilk mixture, then cook it sous vide and then fry it. Amazing! And I am not a huge fried chicken fan. I brought the rest home as it was so rich and such a large amount that we could not finish the dish. I had it for lunch today. Great cold too!! Will definitely go back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Really?  Really?!?  How do you blow someones engagement? I want to give a fair and honest review, so first, The Good:  The food at Bouley is absolutely brilliant.  If there was a font for the way British people say ""Brilliant!"" to make it sound more elegant I would use it, but alas, I'm working with Arial.  What I'm saying is, the food really is outstanding:  We had the a mushroom appetizer and the first bite i took may have been the best morsel of food I've ever had.  Also, the beef cheek gnocchi was unreal.  I've been fortunate enough to have a few work events at Per Se, Daniel, and Jean George and i think Bouley is number 2 in NYC strictly from a food standpoint (behind Per Se).  Really Top Top Notch.  So if you are a foodie and don't care too much about service, decor, etc, this is easily the best meal you will have for you dollar anywhere and you can stop reading the review here.  Also, the female sommelier here was terrific.  She was educated enough to take my vague preferences and make some terrific suggestions (while simultaneously giving me a lesson in wine regions) but humble enough to do so without making us feel like uneducated buffoons.  First time thats ever happened in NYC. The Bad:  I'm being a little nitpicky here, but for a top Michelin rated restaurant some people would expect a few improvements.  The service was ok.   Nothing stood out and there were a few times we had to wait for wine to be poured or look around to get a server's attention.  Not a huge deal for me, but some people expect an army of attendants for a $200 a head meal, so i figured i'd mention it.  Also, the menus were old and had food stains on them - which was noteworthy since this is such a top notch place.  Again, I don't care about that, but some ppl reading the review might. The Ugly:  When I made my reservation they asked ""Is this a special occasion?""  I reflexively answered ""Um...well yes actually...I'll be proposing, but not in the restaurant""  I wasn't planning on saying anything, but i was asked, and hey, if it gets us a nicer table or some special treatment all the better.   Well, I couldn't notice any special treatment during the meal...until desert.  The waitress brought us out a creme brulee with the word ""Congratulations!"" written on the top...which would have been nice...except for the fact that I HADN'T PROPOSED YET!!!.  Really?!?  I mean, isn't that one of those things you make absolutely sure of before doing?!?!  Act like you've been there before, all the waitress had to do was look on my girlfriend's finger to see there was no ring there yet!!!  UNBELIEVABLE.  Totally amateur hour, and very disappointing for such a high end place.  I don't know whose fault it was (the person who took down my reservation, the maitre d' that night, the waitress) - but any one of them could have used some basic hospitality 101 skills to recognize the delicacy of the situation and the importance of getting it correct.  I told the maitre d' what happened and he said the pastry chef had a note that this was an engagement dinner.  WHAT?!?! Who cares!?!?  I obviously didn't pass him a note.  I'm just telling you that someone screwed up MASSIVELY.  You telling me the specifics of how you dropped the ball doesn't help my now completely ruined once-in-a-lifetime night.  I'm not looking for a free meal guy (the bill was not reduced at all BTW), just a sincere apology and possibly someone else to share the look of complete shock and embarrassment I just had at the table.  Grade: F. BOTTOM LINE:  If you want one of the tastiest meals in your life, come to Bouley.  If you are looking for a first class dining ""experience"" (service, ambiance, etc), you may want to look elsewhere.  And if you are planning on having a surprise party for your wife there, expect to be greeted at the door with ""Welcome to Bouley, all your guests are hiding in the back waiting to jump out and surprise you when you walk into the dining room...right this way please""","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been here twice. The first time was in a chilly winter, and the second time was today, a cool summer night. Forgot what I ordered for the first time, but the memory did prompt me to try out again when I'm in Williamsburg with a mood for udon. Their homemade papa dressing in mama salad tastes familiar yet special, giving gourmet dabblers like me an illusion that I can find the dressing in any market. White rice and eels with yuzu juice wrapped by crispy seaweed on the seasonal menu delighted me, especially there are three options of sauces which are according to the spicy level by adding more or less wasabi. Tender and stuffed, the delicate eel sushi was literally devoured by me in two bites. Here comes the leading role: Kinokojil kake udon, which is a soup udon with assorted cooked mushrooms. Honestly speaking, it was a bit disappointing. The soup tastes simply as a considerate proportion of soy sauce and water.There's neither wrongness with assorted mushrooms, nor surprise. My friend's pork curry udon was better. I feel like any dish served with their homemade sauce worths expectation somehow. The matcha cocktail is a highlight - by saying that, I still signify neutral. People prefer harder liquor may like it, because it was made by Japanese shochu, so it's really strong, even if its flavor is matcha-based, which is supposed to be light and refreshing; But no matter how much green tea soy milk and powder that they've put in, as long as the basic liquor is a hard one, then...you've got to really think it through before you completely succumb to your curiosity. Wooden furnitures and dilapidated walls gave you a sense of security and authenticity as long as you step in. Back room which across their counter and cupboard area is more quiet. The environment is all about touches of Japan. So don't hesitate, just walk in and forget about the hippie-dippie world outside.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Love, love, love this place. The neighborhood bistro--well worth a trip outside your hood!--serves consistently authentic, comforting, and soul satisfyingly delicious meals in ample proportions. They have a great selection of salads and desserts, and the wine pours are generous. it is affordable and easy, and the head waiter--at least he appears to be the head waiter--is relentlessly friendly and helpful, and unflappable. We love the steak frites, the sole, the sacre de couer salad, the coq au vin. For parents: the chicken fingers are made in house... Quite simply, it is a lovely place for a dinner or brunch for couples, friends, and families alike.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is a paleo mecca! I wish I could explain how excited I was to find this adorable cafe, just a few blocks from my office in Manhattan. For breakfast today I had a mash bowl - vanilla chia pudding with berries and coconut cashew cream, all organic, with a coconut milk latte! YES, you read that right, finally a place (other than my own kitchen) where I can get a coconut milk latte!!!! I also grabbed a paleo strawberry muffin to snack on later. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other paleo muffins (the espresso one was also calling my name), more of the Mashbar breakfast bowls (paleo granola, what?!), and maybe even dinner. I'm obsessed with this place now. True, it's not cheap. I'm lucky that right now I have my travel budget to spend, but even if it was my own money I would be happy to pay for such high-quality, organic ingredients. If you're paleo, primal, gluten-free, or just looking for clean, healthy eats - check out Hu Kitchen!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"came here spontaneously on a Saturday night. Although it was packed we were able to get our party of five seated immediately, even without a reservation.

"Sunday morning walking around in a dull, fog and saw something called Quiche Italiano for brunch. A good strong cup of joe, a slice of quiche, some Motown tunes, a couple of chocolate-dipped Madeleines and Cafe Lore made Sunday look a lot better. Great service in a familiar, relaxed atmosphere. No rush and a little fuss, but these guys have the fuss down to a science and make you feel at home. Almost took my shoes off during my cappuccino. A really enjoyable experience. The menu is simple but covers some great comfort foods, from french toast for breakfast to eggplant rollotini for lunch to mushroom ravioli for dinner to pineapple cheesecake for dessert. In the middle of Sunset Park, Brooklyn grows a really cool restaurant that is a breathe of fresh air.","[0.0, 1.0]"
By far one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC. It is also very romantic. The drinks are to die for. I love the set up. The garden in the back is beautiful.

"This place is really one of the better deals in midtown.  Working in midtown, there are few really great sit down places, that won't leave your pockets empty. In the Rockefeller center area this place is one of the few that you can get a three course meal, with a hot beverage, for around $12. I've tried the cury katsu, the katsu combination, the bento box, the shahimi combo, but I always go back to the katsu lunch. There is something really satisfying about the combination of miso soup, cabbage salad and katsu. Being able to grind out sesame seeds also relieves the mid day tension I keep going back.

They've got 2 and a half tables there, so if you go at a busy time almost surely you will be seated at a communal table. Also, they use old used envelops to take the bill. SO weird.

"While I don't frequent this beautiful palace as much as I'd like to, when I think of a fine dining establishment; this is my mental picture. Located on the second floor of Langham Place (formerly the Setai) is Ai Fiori, an icon of dining at its finest. The venue is absolutely gorgeous. The bar is chic and filled with a diverse crowd. The main dining area is on par with elegant accents and the staff is nothing short of world-class. The moleche (soft shell crab) is plated beautifully and while crisp retains its moist crab meat. The polpo (octopus) was cooked just as well and each bite was very tasty. The pastas is what stood out the most to me. The trofie nero is as delicious as all the reviews say but the spaghetti does it for me. It's fresh made spaghetti with a generous portion of blue crab which blends perfect with the bottarga and chillies. I could eat bowls upon bowls of this and keep going. The lobster tail entree was one of the most succulent tails I've ever eaten. Soft and tender with just sweet robster. Yes, robster. Surprisingly though, the torta di olio (olive oil cake) was one of the best desserts I've ever had. The cake is moist and tastes amazing with the strawberry sorbetto. Great place for a special occasion or if you're looking to grab a quick bite at the bar and mingle with the crowd.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The best pizza in NYC I was told by my friend. The Sicilian is trice baked for extra crispyness it was claimed. The old timer that the boys behind the counter were calling 'Bernie' had other ideas. Afronted at the suggestion the blackened mess masquerading as a pizza was a bit carbon heavy he declared ""That's how is comes, that's the Sicilian, you don't like it, get something else"" Several regulars on our side of the counter confirmed that was not in fact how it comes. Bernie by name, Burny by nature. Old timer just fucked it up and was serving nothing but bad attitude. The knowing looks from his fellow crew which he was oblivious to told their own story. Can't cook BS Bernie aside, the margarita was decent, although I wasn't wowed. Artichoke far too creamy for my liking but that's just personal taste I guess. Nothing to make it stand out from he plethora of dollar a slice joints in the near vicinity.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My husband and I were coming in for a matinee yesterday December 23, 2013. Of all the restaurants I researched online and called for reservations, Trat T was the best choice! Our reservations were for 6:30pm. We arrived to a very busy filled restaurant at 6:15. I got a spot at the bar amazingly while my husband waited in the long line to check in. Both the Hostess and Manager were very helpful, and with all the craziness and people trying for there attention, they were very pleasant.  While we waited at the bar, a charming waiter suggested a delightful red wine to try which we were very happy with and bought a bottle for dinner. We didn't wait long to sit and the manager was very apologetic for the wait (even though it wasn't long at all, 20 min) The food was traditional  Italian with some special chef dishes thrown in. I'm picky being 100% Italian and growing in in a very old school, everything is made from scratch household. So I'm a tough critic! This was great! Pasta's were cooked aldent..the sauces were delish and not runny or acidic at all! The waiter was attentive and very polite, like he was your friend for years! the manager was walking around to tables to make sure everyone was happy. The chef even came out a few times. We are DEF going back!!!!!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Very unassuming hole in the wall with Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine. The only place I've been that's comparable to this place is Himalayan Yak. I think the momos are better here. The meat in the dumplings is more juicy and flavorful, and the momos in general are cooked better. The other dish we ordered, a curry with vegetables, glass noodles, and beef, was pretty meh. First of all, barely any curry flavor, and the dish was watery. Also, this might just be the way it's traditionally served, but really, what is the point of the noodles? They're sort of just barely there and it's all served atop of rice, so you already have your starch there. Food is served quickly and the prices are very reasonable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First review I have ever written and maybe the last I will ever write but this place is worth it.   My fiancée and I were looking for a new place to have some brunch this morning when we stumbled upon this gem. Such an incredible find.   The food was well thought out and flavorful.  I hate soggy home fries. I have basically come to expect that is norm. I was wrong.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect.  My fiancée hates eggs (wtf right?) and the amazing waiter/ bar tender/ barista behind the counter was incredibly accommodating.  I wish I got his name as I would have mentioned it here. The duck hash browns are killer. Get them. Love them. Do not make eye contact with anyone you are with or you may be forced to share them. I got the sausage and onion sandwich with a runny egg to top it off. Give me a runny egg on anything and I am in but this was epic. The sandwich was falling apart all over the place in all the right ways.  This is my new hangover sandwich.   This is the kind of place I mean when I tell my friends ""I moved to Astoria/ LIC for the food"".  Truly one of a kind in an off the beaten path vibe. We'll see you guys soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My brother saw this place featured on Food Network as having ""the best waffle in NY!"" Yeah right! Don't they all say that?  So when my two brothers and I went there for lunch last Friday, it was good to discover that this was no puffery... this place is the real deal my friends. The waffles are light and fluffy, and require little more than some syrup. Between my waffle and the salmon and sour cream egg white omelet I shared wit my brother, I don't know which one to rave about more. The food is excellent, and every bite was better than the last. And the most surprising delight? The mashed potatoes! They serve their omelets with the most delicious mashed potatoes I've ever tasted in my life. Having worked in the restaurant industry briefly, it is rare for me to eat somewhere and not find anything to critique about the service...well this place proved to be one of the few exceptions! To top off a wonderful savory experience, Mr. Thibaut (best waiter in the tri-state) provided us with expert service with his humor and his attentiveness. Even if the food were only decent, I would go back just for him. Th entire staff was nice but his charming personality made the experience even more pleasant than I thought possible.

"Overall better than Fried Dumpling.  I'm starting to realize the uber cheap dumpling may not be my thing, and that either I should only eat them as appetizers, or pay more for quality - you just get a crappy feeling after eating ""cheap"" dumplings in mass quantity.  There are actually people (2 women) here making the dumplings - I don't even want to know what their story is or how much they make per hour, given the $1 menu.  The pancake was very doughly but tasty (almost a full meal given the size), and while the wraps were thinner than places like Joes Shanghai and Fried, I would still consider it on the thicker side.  They sell bags of frozen dumplings here for dirt cheap also, which I'd recommend - there isn't much skill in steaming or pan frying, and you don't have to sit next to a garbage can or door.  But then it's also a lot of pork.  I'm still going to try Dumpling House once it reopens (which looks like mid to late January), but so far, Prosperity ranks way ahead of Fried.  For a good semi healthy but pricier ($4) dumpling, try the chicken dumplings at Excellent Dumpling.  So, this would be five stars as far as dumpling value, but 3 stars overall - wouldn't go out of my way (and it is very much out of the way) to return here and probably won't be back at all.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They were both brought out in less than 10 minutes - very fast..... The pasta was cooked perfectly.... The sauce was very good, just a little heat with some sweetness.... The chicken was sliced thin and cooked very well, still tender..... I would say both dishes were excellent.... The pasta was $20 and the chicken $28.... We had enough for the two of us and leftovers for me to eat for dinner.... That brings me to my one complaint..... We had them pack the leftovers to go, and they poured a lot of the juices from the chicken dish in the container....

"I've never been to this restaurant for dinner, only for brunch.  I have to say this restaurant combines high quality of food, service and class.  It definitely lives up to its reputation.  I love the decor of this restaurant.  The white leather and glass windows give it a very cozy feel.  It also makes it feel like you are at a spa or a hotel restaurant.   This restaurant is a bit difficult to find if you've never been there before.  I would've never noticed this fancy restaurant if I was just walking by the neighborhood.  Parking isn't so hard either (which is a plus).  Though it is inconvenient to get to if you were getting there by subway, but the food and ambience are worth the inconvenience.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came in on a Saturday morning for brunch. Everything sounded yummy on the menu. Asked the waiter for recommendations and he enthusiastically mentioned a few of his personal favorites. I chose to build my own omelette with the homemade sausage, anduoille, spinach and pepper Jack cheese. It was good but the most notable had to be the short rib hash with eggs and toast. OMG, that short rib hash was absolutely delicious! Coffee was exactly the way I like it. Strong but not bitter. Prices are reasonable for the quality that you get.

"We had such an amazing time here on a beautiful Sunday morning yesterday! Took my kids out and travelled all the way here to try their pumpkin pancakes! Me and the kids were early, and got here about 9:45 am. Plenty of seats both inside and outside, we beat the crowd, YAY. Bestie was a little late but the hostess offered to seat us first since my girls were being impatient. We ended up getting the table on the ""other"" side. Was a quiet little corner separated by the stairs to the apartment upstairs, with a table that only fits a party of 4, you would have to walk inside the restaurant towards the end, make a left and walk thru another section of seats. This cozy little space felt somewhat romantic yet private, we had it all to ourselves. Back to the food, Addy finally showed up after a 15 minute delay. Our waitress just had the sweetest smile and was very kind and attentive, also very patient! We ordered the tusinian eggs, pumpkin pancakes, and a plate of buttermilk pancakes. Correction, actually BLUEBERRY pancakes since Kaylen jumped right in and demanded blueberries(another one of her faves) HAHA!   Pancakes, sooo MOIST, yet soo FLUFFY! I've never had such delicious pancakes! Pumpkin pancakes is served with a cinnamon yogurt sauce, it was just phenominal and the sauce just balanced it so well that we didn't even use the syrup! Blueberry pancakes came with warm berry compote made with real fresh fruits, mouth watering finger licking good! Kaylen and Karen both enjoyed the cakes with the sauce, and obviously killed all the blueberries. The tusinian eggs were actually my favorite dish of the entire meal, even though we came for their pumpkin pancakes. Over easy eggs made perfect, the spicy peppers were smoky and flavorful, and the home fries were seasoned well and to wrap it all up the was the homemade pita that I used to ""lick"" the plate, well we were sitting outside gotta keep it classy lol. It was a great experience and our girls brunch date never felt so carefree, for once when the kids are here! Friendly people, satisfying food, great ambience!

"Ladurée = crème de la crème. Can't quite make it to Paris this afternoon? Shame. But if you can manage to get yourself uptown, you can enjoy a little taste of Parisian heaven for less than $3 (but let's be real, you're not leaving here with just one macaron). THE MACARONS ARE FLOWN IN FROM THE MOTHERLAND ON A DAILY BASIS. I tried two of the seasonal flavors and two of the classics. Here they are, ranked in preference: Strawberry mint- just as it sounds. Very refreshing, cool, not overly sweet. Perfect summer indulgence. Vanilla- vanilla bean, actually, and it is the shit. Very close second to the strawberry mint. Coffee- lip smacking and bursting with flavor. Perfect mate to the vanilla. Melon- refreshing but reminded me of (melon) flavored gum. Least fave of the 4. Ladurée is atrocious for my carbon footprint, dangerous for my wallet, and ungodly for my diet... but so, so worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Disclaimer: I'm in love with wine bars right now.  There are so many good ones popping up all over the city and they seem to make such ideal spots for dates or meeting up with a friend or two.  Well, I caught up with a friend recently at Gottino.  I know that Jody Williams (co-partner at Gottino) doesn't call this a wine bar but most of the seats are at a long bar, they have a decent amount of wine on their menu, and small plates ideal for sharing and complementary to wine... thus, voila!  Wine bar it is!   I liked the vibe of the place... it's rustic, yet modern and feels warm and cozy inside.  It almost feels like a home kitchen (well, one with a very long bar in the kitchen)... esp with the decorative touches like bowls of pretty fruit and cookie / ingredient jars.  The long marble bar runs along most of the restaurant (there are a few tables in the back) and saddling up to the bar provides for an unobstructed view of the food being prepared and some of the ingredients at play.  Although some of our dishes seemed to have magically popped up from somewhere behind the bar!   We ordered a bunch of little dishes and most were quite good, not to mention interesting (good use of unexpected and seasonal ingredients to make typical wine bar dishes a bit more interesting ).  However, we did have some long lags b/w some of the dishes.  I don't think they have their timing quite right yet.  Despite that, I did enjoy my food.  The cheese plate (kind of dainty portions, as is the case with most of their food) with the lovely preserved / dried cherries provided a really nice selection to go w/ our prosciutto.  The savory bread stuffing (pieducci e castagne) was quite good... steaming hot and loved the chestnuts in it.  The whipped salt cod, served with toasted bread pieces, was incredibly smooth and perfectly salty / savory.  Went really well with wine too. I wasn't crazy about the wine recommendations by our bartender / waiter... we inquired about a wine and he was having a tough time describing the wine and was completely ineffective when we asked him to compare it to something (""what would you compare it to... a zinfandel, cab, merlot?  what?  help us out here, buddy!"").  He answered in the affirmative that the wine was ""big"" and ""jammy""... but once we tried it ourselves, turned out it was not ""big"" nor ""jammy"".  Whether you want to call this a ""gastro-teca"" or ""wine bar"" or whatever else suits your fancy, I expect the people working there to have SOME clue of the wines on their menu. The other disappointment was with the price.  Most wines were fairly expensive (not much below the $12 / glass mark) and the food was pretty pricey too given the small portions (I left not even close to being full.. thus, went to Pinkberry for dessert afterward!).  Given that the 3 different types of wine I tried (all red) were nothing all that memorable, I wasn't pleased with our final bill.  But then again... maybe I'm becoming a wine snob... I was with one that night so she might have rubbed off on me.   Overall, I'd definitely give Gottino another try but I'm going to seek out someone who knows their wine so that I don't have to rely on the workers there.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Maybe it is all the hype and maybe my expectations were out of alignment but I felt seriously let down by dinner at Applewood. The service was very good and the decor, very inviting.  The wine list was good and we were very pleased with both the selection and with our choice. Unfortunately when it comes to the food, we found the appetizers to be pretty bland and lacking in any imagination, taste or lasting impression. The entrees were equally bland and boring.  The food quality is high but I can go to the market, purchase high quality product and heat it up with no effort.  The prices at Applewood are definitely on the more expensive side, especially for Brooklyn, so I'd like a little more imaginative flavor and taste for my money.   The desserts, while better than the entrees, were just really just ""okay."" Perhaps it was an off evening or we ordered the wrong dishes but I didn't feel Applewood was worth the trip and certainly not worth the price.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ok  so I tend to get disappointed by restaurants with big, pretentious, expensive buzzing bees surrounding them...simply because I find it so much more satisfying to discover an an affordable place that is more low key and just as good. First time I came here it was on my own dollar. Had the halibut, rosemary fries, seasonal vegetables and a salad to split. All very good but I thought egh? It was pricy... Second time I came it was not on my own dollar. I took clients and we ordered a vast majority of the menu and split everything. It was que magnifique! Oysters, greek salad, minted seared herring (oh my so good), gnughi balls- which are just about the tastiest ball of anything I've ever tasted...we got seconds. It is semolina wrapped in a combination of sheep's milk cheese doused with butter herbs and cheese. Scallops- amazing, guinea- amazing though a little small, halibut same same. Succotash and more fries... It was just such a great meal to go all out with. Reason for no 5 stars...they are still a little pretentious despite the lax ambiance. We wanted to order some almonds to snack on for a bit with drinks while we figured out what we wanted to eat. They wouldn't let us do it! Waitress's excuse was the chef likes everything coming in at once...well I know the chef wouldn't be roasting the almonds. I think she was afraid we wouldn't order enough- even though we over ordered. Also I wasn't wowed by the selection of wines by the glass. They were just ok...and we almost ordered the whole dessert menu and same..just ok.  All in all though those balls and the seafood are amazing so I will definitely go back and splurge...even if breaking the bank on my own card.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Extremely disappointing!  I have lived in New York for over 25 years and have tasted much better Italian food for less than half the price.  When a family member visiting from out of town suggested that we meet at this restruant, my family and I had our doubts since the restruant is located in the ""touristy"" area.  We were taken with the ambiance and the friendliness of the staff.  However, the bread turned out to be the best part of the meal!  Three of us ordered the lasagna at $27 each (a speciality of the house).  The presentation was ""artsy"" however, it turned out to be one-dimensional: little cheese, little sauce and very greasy.  In fact, at least three tablespoons of grease leaked out of the leftover bag!  One of us ordered pasta carbonnara; the portion was very small and again it was loaded with grease! Our visitor ordered a fish dish, which she said was good, but like the other dishes was swimming in butter.  In all, these five dishes (no drinks, no extras) cost $153! I am disheartened that this restruant is not up to the standards of NY cuisine.  In fact, it leaves tourists with the misimpression that NYC food is overpriced and mediocre.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm giving this place 5 stars because sentimentally it will never be forgotten. One bite of the wontons, the noodles, the soy sauce chicken or duck will transport me back to my childhood when life was simpler and I looked forward to Sunday mornings out with my hardworking immigrant parents.  It wasn't their day off by any means, they didn't have one. It was their only morning off.   We always braved the hoards of people who had no concept of a line. Somehow we pushed our way through the crowd and got a table, sometimes right next to another strange immigrant family.  And we always got the same thing, wonton noodle soup, fish porridge, soy sauce chicken with rice. And it always tasted the same, never deviated one bit in taste, temperature or price. Always good, always hot and always cheap. They were so busy that it was like a continuously running chinese food machine, cranking it out, stamping it out.  They get you in as quickly as they shoo you out, laying down the check when they bring the food. We would be in and out in 20 minutes, sometimes 15. I love this place because the food is always good but mostly I love it because it gives me just a little feeling, once in a while, of being a kid again. Here's to you Big Wong.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Love the ambiance, service (the first night we had a great woman, 2nd night the guy was awful!) And the food!!!! BBQ Pork buns - a must Tofu and Nasu agedashi - the eggplant (nasu) was delicious! Could do a whole side of only that. Gindara Saikyo Yaki - delicious, but way too small a portion for the price $16!!! I can't even remember which ramen we had..... the first night we each had something different and the 2nd night we tried a different ramen (just one) and did the Kae-dama where you get an extra serving of noodles for $2. This was perfect! And a generous size of extra noodles. We also added extras, which ups the price, but well worth it - can always go for an extra braised pork! They don't take reservations except for the same day.... AND you have to go in.... nothing over the phone! So stop by during lunch and make your evening reservations. Crowded waiting area.

"i'm so mad at this place right now. i would give them a better review because my first experience was pretty good (spring roll vermicelli), but i just ordered delivery on this extremely stormy night and ordered the chicken bahn mi (my bf got it when we first went there and it was good), but they sent me the wrong sandwich...pork, layered with two kinds of ham! or something i couldn't recognize. don't get me wrong, normally i would suck it up and eat it, but i don't normally eat pork and there was just so much of it. so i called to complain and they said they would fix it (poor delivery guy). when he brought the chicken sandwich, he asked for the wrong one to take back...which i dug out of the garbage for him...then he lingered in the hallway as if he was waiting for a tip. i told him, i'm sorry...i would tip you, but i gave you all my cash the first time. he said he was sorry for the mistake and off he went. i opened up my sandwich and, yes, there was chicken...and HAM! and pate and some other meat. grrrrrr! i don't remember sliced meat when my bf got it and i checked the menu and the ingredients don't say anything about pate or ham or anything other than grilled chicken. look, i'm normally not picky, but this is just frustrating. this place is lucky they're the only ones that take CC and the only ones with spring roll vermicelli, otherwise i wouldn't come back. oh - and the first time i went, my friend got the beef pho and said it was super bland. she refuses to go back. best bahn me = bahn mi zon. next time, i'll pull out cash.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It is baffling that this restaurant is so lauded.  I think it may have been something really special a couple of years ago from what I'm reading, but unfortunately sometimes good restaurants fall into coasting on their reputation.  I think this is the case here.  Perry St. is located on the West Side Highway looking across the Hudson.  It's on the ground floor of a techno-looking glass building and the room seems to be all glass.  This does not make for good ambience on a bright sunny evening.  The look and feel was reminiscent of an airport lounge.  There's a notable improvement after dark.  We thought the service was poor.  Full disclosure: we are diners whose experience can be made or broken by the attitude of the server.  Perhaps that's a lot to hang on one person, but when you are expecting an additional 20% on top of the check, we don't think it's a lot to ask for you to act like you're happy we're there.  If you're not, fake it!  Our server seemed a bit peeved that we wanted to sample the wine before ordering a bottle.  We settled on his recommendation of Chablis and when it came he muttered unapologetically ""it's not that cold, shall I put it on ice?""  Twenty minutes later we still didn't have the semi-cold wine or bread and butter (which was delicious) even though there were servers gliding here and there with trays of bread.  We had to request both.  The menu seemed small, approx ten appetizers and ten entrees.  My husband dared to ask the provincial ""are there any specials?"" to which the waiter imperiously retorted ""I have no additions!""  Who talks like that?  This restaurant does not qualify for that kind of pretentiousness; it was ridiculously out of place.  But anyway, about the food.  The crispy poached egg with caviar appetizer was very tasty and imaginative, but a bit pricy at $29.  My husband had the goat cheese and mango salad, which was kind of blah.  I know it's just a salad, but when you order in a restaurant that boasts the reputation of Perry St., you expect even the mundane things to knock your socks off.  This was not the case.  Our entrees were so underwhelming, I had the lobster which was plentiful but rubbery and my husband had the fried chicken, which he had read was one of the specialties.  It was overcooked and bland despite a really spicy 'Scotch Bonnet' sauce.  By the time we got to dessert we just couldn't summon up the energy, we decided to go home and eat Girl Scout cookies instead.  The total was approx $200 for the two of us with one bottle of wine and the tip.  For the tip, I made a small wimpy stand by tipping a strict 15% on the subtotal NOT the total - how radical!  By the end of our meal we're usually so crazy about the service we tip a sloppy 20% on the whole total, plus rounding it up to the nearest pleasing number.  I would like to have left considerably less but I didn't want the server to judge us as neophytes from NJ (hey, if the cap fits....) or even worse, as a foreigner who doesn't know how to tip (I'm from UK)!!  We settled on Perry St. on a recommendation from New York Magazine.  We routinely try their suggestions and are not usually disappointed.  If you want a restaurant like Perry St. but to the power ten, try Commerce on Commerce Street.  The food, room and servers are fantastic.  We'll chalk this one up to experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We went and got drinks elsewhere, and we came back when we got the text that our table was ready. We chatted with the hostess and started following her back to the table. We were then snapped at by ANOTHER woman because they needed an extra minute to wipe down the table, and they wanted us to wait in the front area. If the hostess said this, we honestly did not hear it, and was that really worthy of being snapped at again?! We wound up leaving because after being snapped at by TWO separate people, we just did not feel right giving them our business.

"This place is coined as Zagat top Italian Restaurant 2014...but I'm not sure what the criteria was. The complimentary bread is warm and crisp which is nice, and they throw in a few slices of foccacia. Service is ok, but could be more attentive.  Ordered linguini ala pesto and angel hair with assorted veges in olive oil and garlic. The pasta was only slightly overcooked but seasoned fairly well (but not great)...we ended up adding the shredded parmesan cheese to add salt to balance the flavors. Overall, I don't think I've ""found"" ""authentic"" Italian cuisine in Little Italy...sadly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Lillie's has so much potential.  Came here with 5 friends for a night out.  Like many others have said the atmosphere is pretty great!  Drinks were good.  Food was pretty good.  The killer was the service.  It was downright awful.  Clearly our table was an after thought and the waitress was too busy for her own good.  The hostesses (yes, there were two.  One really should have helped out the drowning server) just sat at the hostess podium and acted like a couple of stuck up snobs.  I don't care what career field you are in NYC trying to break in to, (dancer, actor, dancing actor or starving model) YOU ARE A HOSTESS.  That is your paying job at this point in time, so quit talking shit IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS and do your damn job. In the restaurant/bar industry you are only as good as the people you have working for you.  Lastly, someone should tell the DJ (term used loosely, I don't actually know where the music was coming from)  that it isn't ironic-cool to play ""Baby Got Back"".  It's pretty lame actually.  C'mon Lillie!  You have the perfect ingredients for a kick ass establishment!  Let's kick it up a notch.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Several friends recommended this place and based on the reviews, decided to try it.  Visited last night.  Figured the heavy rain would keep lines short.  waited about 10 minutes for a table at 5:30 pm.  Was initially offered a table in the ""outdoor"" area but passed because waiting patrons were seated right next to diners.  Seemed rather uncomfortable to have those hungry, waiting eyes staring at you all through the meal. We ordered the grilled octopus as our appetizer.  It came out surprisingly fast.  So fast, I think it might have been meant for someone else who had refused it.  In any case, it was amazingly tender and flavorful.  I can see why it is highly recommended.  Though after we were served, I noticed that every other table that ordered the grilled octopus received a plate heaped with octopus and cucumbers while all we received were three ""legs"" and two slices of cucumber thrown on as an afterthought. We ordered Grilled Whiting and Grilled Calamari as entrees.  I had lemon potatoes as my side and my husband had the rice.  Both dishes were substantial in portion size and very tasty.  I think there were about 8 whiting on my husband's plate and my dish was full of calamari.  We both thought the sides were delicious as well. We were fortunate to enjoy the complimentary dessert.  Not quite sure what it was, but it hit the spot.  It was the right size and not too sweet at all. Service was very attentive and friendly, given the hectic atmosphere of the dining room. While we didn't really mind the extremely close seating arrangements or the noise level, we both agreed we would like to visit again on a weeknight to get the full experience of the place.  Those dining immediately next to us when we first sat down were very pleasant.  As we were finishing our meal a loud, obnoxious and inebriated couple was seated next to us.  She took quite a spill on the way to the table, nearly ending up in another patron's lap!  While she visited the restroom her date felt the need to engage us in loud conversation.  Thank goodness we were ready to pay the check! Perhaps we will visit the East Village location.  Is it any more spacious?  It was quite awkward to wait in the small, enclosed area with waiters passing by with orders and diners eating under a tent that was dripping from the rain.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Kofte Piyaz is one of the places I go when I want to be cooked for and feel pampered, and get a lot of food for under $20.  I often do take-out, but eating in is fun, too.  Nice ambience, although I wish the owne, Murat, would turn off the TV.   The red lentil soup is great - one of my favorite things on a rainy, cold day.  The Turkish salad is another regular purchase of mine - Murat makes is spicy, adding red pepper, so be warned and ask him to leave some or all of it off if you don't like spice.  The lamb sausage sandwich is great for when you crave MEAT. And then there are the desserts.  They are all good: the baklava is so sweet that I never eat a whole piece at a time, but keep a piece in my fridge and take little bites when I want a burst of dessert.  The butternut squash is great for something sweet that might also be somewhat healthy.  But the ultimate is the almond pudding.  Just amazingly good - rich, sweet, creamy and tasteful. The lemonade is great for a hot day, and the turkish coffee, served with four different levels of sweetness, great for a pick-me-up on a cold day. Perhaps the best thing, however, is the owner.  He feels like a friend, now, and I am so grateful that he has opened this wonderful oasis in my neighborhood!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Amid our two-and-a-half-hour wait for pizza at the universally acclaimed DiFara's. I was so unimpressed by the customer service experience, which left would-be diners lined up three deep at the counter for at least 25 minutes without a single order taken. But it was completely worth it. We watched Dominic DeMarco painstakingly craft each pizza by hand, using three cheeses, freshly snipped basil and olive oil. We cursed those ordering multiple pies. We listened to the ringing phone go unanswered. We scoffed at those who popped into the pizzeria to ask, 'How long?' After a while, it was like magic to watch DeMarco custom-create each pizza from scratch, as he has been doing for more than 50 years. It no longer mattered that we had spent half the afternoon tucked away in a dingy, greasy little restaurant in Midwood, Brooklyn. Skeptical as every good native New Yorker (and pizza aficionado) should be, I bit into that first slice ready to find fault after waiting TWO-AND-A-HALF HOURS. But there was none. It was perfection.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"How to bypass the wait: Find eight or nine friends and commit to the bo ssam! We started with some BBQ pork buns for everyone. They were the momofuku take on BBQ pork. While tasty, I thought there was way too much BBQ sauce, which detracted from the wonderful crispy pork. Couldn't complain though, since it was still pretty tasty. The bo ssam was larger than anticipated. It was a struggle for nine of us to finish it all, but we did! The pork was fall-off-the-bone tender and perfectly seasoned with salt and sugar. It also comes with a bunch of oysters; some people included the oysters in the pork wrap, and the consensus was it was a bit strange. So I had mine on the side :) The bo ssam comes with a generous portion of the fixins, including kimchi, kimchi puree, ginger-scallion sauce, BBQ sauce, and obviously rice and lettuce. I personally thought the momofuku kimchi was a bit too sweet, but that didn't stop me since I love all kinds of kimchi. Drinks were solid. I had a drink called penicillin, which included whiskey and honey and a really cool, giant ice cube. Service was OK. Took a while to get the check, but not a super unreasonable amount of time. It was just annoying that we couldn't flag someone down... the restaurant certainly is small enough that it's hard to miss you. Overall though, great food, great company, great experience! Worth a try. Tip: Make sure you are comfortable with the people you go with. I've been to my share of small, tight restaurants, but you are literally rubbing elbows with the people sitting next to you here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Decor: 3.5/5 Service: 3/5 Food: 2/5 With over 1000 reviews and a sea of reviews that kept spewing out: ""The BEST Sicilian Pizza!"", I just had to try the square sicilian slice and... I was not the least impressed. The dough is thick with the center dough tasting and having the consistency of being half cooked. There was a thin 4-5mm layer of tomato sauce and thats pretty much your square sicilian for $2.50. I noticed families ordering a whole box of the sicilian. Did I get a bad batch or do people really enjoy eating half cooked pizza? We had a group of 6 and there was a unanimous decision that Spumoni's pizza was probably one of the least palatable we've ever tried. In hopes to redeem themselves I had to try their spumoni ice. I asked for a sample of two flavors but I was served a small serving ($2.50) with the requested flavors. I brushed it off since he may have misunderstood me. The flavors were watermelon and kiwi. The flavor was there but mild.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The service was fantastic, the staff (specifically our waitress, Tina) could not have been more pleasant and accomodating. The fire bread waiting for us at the table was out of the world!!

"Went for dinner here with a couple friends. It does get rather packed around dinner time so expect to wait. I had some familiarity with Korean food, but never a menu this in depth. Right off the bat, however, I was disappointed to learn that some of the things they had on their menu they didn't actually have. One of the dishes was stir-fried octopus, which I ordered, only to be told they didn't have it. Not that they ran out, but that they simply didn't serve it despite putting it on the menu. I ordered the stir fry beef and noodles, which was good. Plenty of food, flavor, and spice, and served pretty quickly. Despite disappearing for a while at first, the staff redeemed themselves and served us pretty fast. The main complaint I have about this place is the price. I don't think any of the dishes warranted the price they commanded. My dish was $21, while my friend ordered the short ribs, which were not as ample, and it cost $33. Honestly, it's good food, but not worth the money.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Who knows, but you get five deliciously crisp, gooey ribs for eight dollars? That's a steal! I have one criticism, though, and it's not about the food. The interior of the restaurant belies its talented kitchen. It's dark, it's underwhelming, there are random sparsely placed pieces of artwork on their long, awkward wall.

I ordered the Spanish scramble and others at the table ordered the Southern Breakfast, the Country Breakfast, and the Brioche French Toast.

It was just a couple blocks off Times Square, quick, and very tasty pizza - crispy thin crust, tasty sauce, fresh toppings (I did the tomato, basil garlic one) - $4/slice. Definitely recommend.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you are looking for delectable meats, moist poultry, succulent sides, and microbrewed excellence, look no further. Dino BBQ has it all. NYC is a very underrated BBQ town (southern folk please do not kill me) and there are several places that I REALLY like a lot- DBBQ takes the funnel cake. It isn't even close. The wings here are absolutely tremendous. They are (as noted above) MOIST and JUICY, voluptuous and flat out meat-tastic. I would be completely satisfied going here and order 18 wings for myself and calling it a night. Except I wouldn't because I would be cheating myself out of the BEST PULLED PORK AND BRISKET AND SIDES YOU CAN GET.   Great place to go and meat up with friends and family, or take that special someone. Nothing says ""I love you"" like a slab of ribs with a side of salt potatoes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Today I got a full force experience of stoop life in Sheepshead bay. I was starving so I asked my stoop host to PLEASE GET ME PIZZA.' He came back with a Sicilian and regular pie along with a big tub of spumoni. Now I have traveled long distances for pizza.I think 70% of my reviews are on pizza so I really dont play around. The Sicilian was ""okay"" and was extremely similar to a chain of pizza places called Albert's out in western Suffolk (the pizza critics know what I'm Talking about). The Round had a sweet dough which I liked but it was also doughy which I did not like...so the pizza gets 3 stars. The Spumoni gets 5 stars!! That stuff was fantastic!!!  What a classic way to enjoy my stoop experience. People screaming and yelling in the streets...some random old Asian man giving me a shitload of Oriental tobacco as he goes back to his stoop to smoke Opium.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Not being a big fan of wine, I asked the waiter to recommend me white wine on the sweeter side.

Manager told me that this place is not a wine tasting opportunity. Waiter added that he is busy serving others and will come back. If I could review this place 0 stars, I definitely would.

"Yum yum and more yum. I know I will be dreaming of lovely pork buns tonight! The only drawback to the thick slices of pork belly on soft steamed buns is that you only get two to an order. If you go with a friend, either call dibs on both or get two orders (trust me you will want more than one). I would have been perfectly happy with about half a dozen porklicious buns for dinner. Then on to the Spicy Sausage with rice cakes - if you like spicy, this is the way to go. The crispy crunchy things on top gave the dish great texture. Everything in this place has ususual combinations of food (i.e. rose and strawberry ice cream with a pea puree - really?). It was light and refreshing for dessert. The only reason I am giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is that it got very noisy (I sat across the bar from a friend and it was very hard to hear). If you are ready for a little adventurous dinner with awesome combinations of food, GO HERE!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is one of those rare places, that actually make you feel like you are eating an authentic food, straight from the source. Everything is so fresh and delicious, that i sometime wish i lived closer, or that they will open one next to my house. Their Falafel Sandwich is very good (sometime a bit oily), but the smell of the fresh spices, chopped vegetables and amazing Pita bread make it disappear. The only reason i took off one star, is due to a loud argument between one of the waiters and one of the guests. I think that the waiter/manager could easily take it to a different place, and not let all the customers feel a bit uncomfortable. Try it, unique experience!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is the best Sushi I have had in New York.  Yasuda is a very serious Sushi chef.  He is almost a ""sushi nazi"" (in the style of the ""soup nazi"" in Seinfeld).  He once got upset with a Japanese friend of mine who was sitting at the bar and put a large piece of wasabi on his sushi.  As Yasuda puts wasabi and seasonings under each piece of fish, in amounts delicately balanced to suit that particular fish, he was very offended that someone would disturb that balance.  If it was an american he would excuse their ignorance, but since he was Japanese he got a scolding.   He has a right to be upset though, his sushi only needs a touch of soy sauce to reach perfection.   Also, the sizes of the sushi are just right.  One bite, as it should be.  Many places will make huge pieces of sushi that are impossible to eat in one bite, at least impossible to do with grace.   The decor is also worth the trip.  Very Japanese modern.  Overall this is a great place for top of the line sushi.  Be sure to try the Unagi kuro, freshly grilled and perfectly seasoned.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came here with my friends yesterday. At first I was very impressed, the interior was very nice and it smelled amazing in there. However my good impression was quickly demolished by the terrible service we received. We were served by a waitress with dyed blonde hair with brown roots growing out and bad eyebrows. She had such an attitude while she took our order (she looked like she really hates her job) and would walk by every 3 minutes to keep an eye on us even though we weren't doing anything. It happened to be my friends 17th birthday and we had a cake on our table and she came and told us to ""keep it on the down low"" but with her tone and facial expression you could clearly see she was telling us to put it away. Afterwards the man serving us water(who was very kind) offered to put the cake on a plate for us and although we declined he insisted. This lead to an argument between him and the waitress in the back where they even had to consult their manager in a different room. He came back with the cake and apologized for not being able to put our cake out and wished my friend happy birthday once more. Before we were finished with our pizza the waitress swung by again and gave us our check, which clearly meant she was trying to get us out as soon as possible. Don't get me wrong the pizza was really delicious but I think the next time I'm craving pizza I'de rather call up Dominos.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Beautifully decorated, airy Greek restaurant downtown, not too far from NYU. The cuisine was described as ""rustic Greek"", and I honestly am not that familiar with fine Greek cuisine and/or comfort food so I just figured, look for something on the menu that sticks out to me and go with that because none of us had any expertise in this dining category whatsoever. We started off with a complimentary plate of warm, toasted pita bread pieces accompanied by what looked like pureed mongo beans and olive oil. After some deliberation, we were able to order - I'm not even going to attempt to type out the name of what I ordered, but for an appetizer I had a roasted red bell pepper that was stuffed with spicy feta cheese that had been whipped with sweet and hot peppers - that was delicious beyond belief. My friends had the lamb shank and the lamb chops respectively, and I ordered a steak. The food took extremely long to get there, and our server almost forgot to bring my friend his beer, but it was well worth the wait because the food was excellent. The lamb shank fell off the bone, and it was accompanied by what looked like rice and yogurt stuffed into an eggplant and a tomato, respectively. The lamb chops were tender, as was my steak, and both were served with a helping of thick-cut seasoned fries and spinach, which I devoured without a single thought to the current e.coli scare because I was hungry as fuck and that's how I roll. If I found myself in this area again, I'd like to come back. There were many other things on the menu - mainly appetizers - that appealed to me. I gotta find a place like this in California!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Happened upon this bar by accident while exploring the city. Its a very quiet dark and romantic bar with a cozy bar and a few tables. It feels like there should be a little hidden back room or something. The  beer selection was fun and the Bartender seemed to know who to engage and who was there to be left alone.

Service: Our server took forever to come to us to take our order, then left halfway through the order because she became impatient with us.  Then, she didn't come back until the end of the meal, even though we needed more drinks, etc..  I had to ask the bus boy to help us several times.   The food was great, but the service was so bad I won't go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

This is a tasty little neighborhood gem - great value for the quality. The food is fresh and the service is quick and friendly. The food was good -some of the dishes were better than others. The thai fried sea bass special was delish fried in a tasty crisp batter full of spices and layered flavor. The watercress salad was light & refreshing. The drunken noodles were outstanding wth a with delightful sauce that has a bit of a kick. The vegetable dumplings were standard. The sea bass lettuce cups were nice and light but could have used more flavor. The salt & pepper shrimp was fried with salt & pepper - too dry for my taste and could have used a dipping sauce to provide some moisture. The Salmon entree & the ribs were a hit. The Jade Lemonade cocktails were very refreshing! Has a ovely garden but the overall place is small so plan ahead.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"THIS REVIEW IS FOR TAKEOUT/DELIVERY SERVICE ONLY:  Me and my wife LOVE Song.  The food is amazing.  But dont try to order over the phone.  EVERY time you call, they ""can't hear you"".  It gets to the point where you're literally yelling into the phone, yet they still ""can't hear you"".  It's actually pretty ridiculous.  And what's even worse, Song doesn't participate in Seamless Web/GrubHub or any online ordering site, so you HAVE to call.  Whether it's 4pm or 11pm at night, they can never hear you and you have to repeat yourself a dozen times.  I just tried to place an order now and it got to the point where they hung up on me.  And it's NOT our phones, this happens with multiple phones, different people.

"A friend and I decided to try our luck and walk into Minetta Tavern without reservations on Wednesday night. We arrived at 7pm and were lucky enough to get past the bouncer to secure a spot by the bar. The couple behind us wasn't as fortunate and was told the place was full and wouldn't accept walk-ins until 10pm. Seating at the bar is first-come first-served but we found the bartenders were surprisingly accommodative. We ordered a round of drinks and within 10 minutes were seated at the middle of the bar. The cocktails were expertly crafted - we started with the Hemingway Daiquiri followed by a Gin Blossom. An order of Pommes Frites kept us satisfied while we waited for the Couet de Boeuf for two. The Couet de Boeuf served medium rare was mouthwateringly tender. The meat was perfectly cooked, the bone marrow incredibly flavorful. A side of sauteed spinach was a nice complement. We polished the meal off with two Dark 'n' Stormy's (the cocktail menu advertises a Stormy Cider, Minetta's riff on the original, however the bartender was able to serve us the real deal. Needless to say, our experience left nothing to be desired.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Walked by on a Sunday afternoon and saw that they were open with only a 3 person line.  My boyfriend and I each got a spinach artichoke slice.  I'll agree with others that the guy who takes the money at the counter is a bit 'rough around the edges' but we got our pizza quickly.  No complaints on the size of the slice - big enough to have to hold with two hands.  Also saw them making a spinach artichoke pizza and using 1"" cubes of cheese.  WOW... that's a lot- and they look like pretty quality ingredients. Other than that though I'll admit that the pizza wasn't to my liking.  They add olive oil in addition to the cheese so it makes for a very very very greasy/oily slice - which I didn't love.  The artichoke spinach combo tasted great but was overshadowed by the amount of oil-  I was only able to have a few bites before it became too much for me.   I'm not sure if the rumor about them putting cream in their pizza topping is true but I'll tell you that I'd rather have cream than the extra olive oil. Bottom line - Go at least once to see what it's all about.  If you like it, great if not then you know that you can move on.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"et's put it this way: I had hyped up how good dinner would be in my head for weeks before finally eating here. And it was still amazing. Then, I hyped up how good brunch and dinner a second time would be despite knowing how dangerous overhyping food is. And again, still amazing. There is nothing that Andrew Carmellini, pastry chef Karen DeMasco, and all those LV bartenders can cook/bake/concoct that is short of utterly delicious. Since you definitely want to try everything on the menu (food and cocktail alike), I recommend going with a larger group (despite having to wait a couple of weeks for your reservation) so that you can taste everything. Or you can do what I do and compulsively go back every other week, pretending like I can afford it. But can you really put a price on a meal that could allow you to die happily? Ok, this may be a slight exaggeration but the point is, the food is Good. Real Good. appetizers: - ricotta - a Carmellini classic that you definitely want to try. Even the toast itself is stupidly perfect. - lamb sliders - only two per order, but eat this. entrees: - grandmother's ravioli - not your ordinary ravioli. this guy's grandma knows what's up. - orechiette - the broccoli rabe lends a really nice crunchy texture and vegetable element that most of the other pasta dishes lack - gigatone - mixed into a hearty, deeply satisfying ragu - papardelle - lamb bolognese topped with ricotta. great stuff. - porchetta sandwich - infinitely superior to Porchetta's version, constructed from thin cuts of juicy, well-seasoned porchetta and gooey melted provolone. - chicken dinner - must come back to try this. I hear it's a winner. desserts: - lemon tart - nicely textured filling with a rich lemony taste - almond semifreddo - the best thing ever. - panna cotta - heavenly. - fantasia di cioccolato - it's delicious gelato, but nothing particularly worth trying. right. So, I generally don't condone absurdly long reviews but I've made an exception because I simply can't contain how much I love this place. Do yourself a favor; eat here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Was skeptical after my wife found this place online. We were staying at a nearby Brooklyn Sheraton.  We went and after being a little nervous about the neighborhood we went inside to an immediate seat and I enjoyed the best fried chicken I've ever had - hands down. I live in Texas and my wife is a native (and a great cook) and neither of us had had it so good.  My 3 boys thought the same. I had chicken and greens - both amazing.  Mac & Cheese is all good too. Wife had 3 sides - beans, corn, asparagus - all top shelf. Services was not great but the kid seemed new and he was friendly. Prices were fair and not typical New York. Place is really small so go early or plan on waiting. Highly recommend this hideaway for Soul Food in Brooklyn. Tom H - Austin TX","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friends and I went here to try out Joe's Shanghai.  We had to try out the soup dumplings and we just ordered a side of fried rice.  I've had Dinh Tai Fung's soup dumplings in Arcadia, Ca and I must say, Joe's Shanghai is pretty descent.  Nothing beats Dinh Tai Fung (since they have a VARIETY of soup dumplings), but Joe's is pretty close.  Unfortunately they only have Pork Dumplings so vegetarians or pescatarians be informed.  For the price, its reasonable.  8 dumplings for 4.25 ~ 0.50 cents each.  Try it out, I am sure you will like it! Couple of things to know on how to eat the soup dumpling. 1.  Place soup dumpling on spoon. 2.  Use chopsticks and puncture one whole allowing soup to seep out a little. 3.  Place sauce on top.  (IF you want the sauce to be a bit spicier, mix the chili in, helps enhance your taste buds!) 4.  Devour in one bite to enjoy party in mouth!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Would have given a 3.5 if I could. Went there on a Saturday night and got a table with no problem (we must have gotten lucky). It took a bit of time for us to get our water and our drink order in, and I was starting to get a little displeased, BUT, when the drinks did arrive, they were absolutely splendid (I got the Fig Side Car and my bf got the Mint Julep-yummy in the tummy). AND we never went without water the rest of the eve. And I am a total water drinker, so I dig that. Always suckers for a raw bar, we got a half dozen oysters and I ordered the king crab legs for an entree. The oysters were amazing. I'm not sure if the stars were aligned or it was the right month (something about ending in 'R' or whatever), but they were tast-T! We stuck with our preferred east coast selection and tried a new VA one. All were really spot on. The waiter was professional and knowledgeable and the vibe was cool. Call me arrogant, but the music was pretty much everything on my i-pod, so I was cool wit dat. Okay, the not-so amazing part. The place was overpriced. Granted, the food was good, but not gourmet. I like the philosophy of keeping it simple  and  doin' it well and that is totally respectable, BUT $9 drinks instead of $11 is all I'm saying. Plus, my boyfriend got the Lobster Roll Sandwich and I was not impressed with the portion size or presentation on the plate. For $24, make it friggin special and give him a whole plate full goddammit! I mean, he ate it up and I mean all of it, and it was good, but I thought it tasted pretty much like a crab cake, so I wasn't blown away.

Interior's what you would expect in a restaurant that's over a century old.  The dining areas are broken up into a maze of rooms spanning the entire building.  Not the most ergonomic floor-plan, but probably the result of decades of adding little bits and pieces onto the structure.  One of the benefits of this odd arrangement is that you may even get a chance to walk through the kitchen to get to your dining area as we did.   We saw the oven and felt the heat. I think I got a glimpse of what hell would feel like standing next to those flames... that and hearing wifey yap into my ear all night long. My control pizza is always the margherita.  You can't get any simpler than mozzarella, basil, and tomato.  As with all things in life, the simplest things are oftentimes the hardest to perfect. Lombardi's definitely gets it right.  They've got a paper-thin crust that's crispy and chewy.  The sauce is punchy but not overwhelming.  And the mozzarella and basil are fresh.  All ingredients are laid out in perfect proportion so you get the right amount with each bite. A top quality pie, my friends. Tell your server that Pauly sent you... that way, they'll know what to do with your bodies.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It was worth the 45+ min. wait for a table. Staff is very pleasant. Glasses of wine were passed out to those waiting a long time for a table. Everything was delicious. Spanekopita was crispy outside and fluffy inside with a nice hint of lemon. Calamari crunchy and fresh. Tzaziki fantastic with a whole small loaf of break drizzled with olive oil. Fried cheese was terrific. They were out of the snapper, so I got bronzini and it was moist and so fresh. The lemon potatoes are a must as a side. Complentary dessert was a thick plain yogurt (or ricotta, was hard to tell), drizzled with dried cherries that were soaked and partially rehydrated and their sauce. Very nice.

The ""Lechon"" (roast pork) was very well seasoned and beautifully presented...the ""Moqueca"" (Brazilian paella) was also very good but not very generous in terms of the seafood portions.

"I was having a bit of trouble deciding where to take my mother in law for her birthday; I called a couple of places the night before. I had dinner @ blend on Vernon for valentines day and actually enjoyed it with a little misshape from the waiter so I was reluctant to try a place expanded of them  but I called anyway I spoke to Carlos on the phone we all know customer service starts with a great deal of patience a great attitude and being flexible which the gentleman had plenty of I had a feeling he may be the manager if not he showed great leadership because after about a min our two on the phone I decided blend on the water was  our choice the issue I had was it being ash Wednesday my mother in law wanted to eat shrimp particularly but he automatically offered  various  choices and even said he would go as far to ask the chef which I was extremely please with this all before we even dined   So to make this short I was very close to giving the place 4 stars due to the waitress she was generally nice as was the entire staff but I believe  maybe she can review a bit of the customer service values I asked her about a shrimp  plate she said no we don't have that I really hate going to a place  hear  a flat no especially after I spoke to someone over the phone so I mentioned Carlos and asked about the appetizer schrauwn shrimp or a substation, I felt she could have explained the menu better instead of waiting for me to name drop and I ended up explaining the menu to my mother in law myself she was pleased with the dish she wanted a pina colda, she not much of a drinker but she wanted that unfortunately this was not on the menu the waitress redeemed  herself by offering an alternative I was a tad annoyed about the menu issue  but over all it was a great time beautiful view and great food.

"Taverna Kyclades is truly what Greek food in Astoria / LIC is all about. As a loyal fan of Opa! Opa! for years, migrating with carloads of friends hungry for souvlaki and gyro from the Bronx, Opa was the gold standard for me. Until I discovered Kyclades. Firstly, don't be thrown off by the wait, when you're talking about the best of something, there's going to be alot of people clamoring for their Greek salads, impeccable cold dips, and perfectly grilled meat and fish, for sub-market costs. To quench the clamoring, the lovely Greek woman who greets you at the door, and is extremely good at her job, hands you some wine and tells you to have a drink while you wait. Never saw that anywhere, and hooked me from the first time. Last night was my 4th visit, and as always, there's some new thing I discover there and swear will be the only thing I order next time because I over-ordered. First, it was the char-broiled, yet somehow impeccably juicy chicken kabob, the size of my forearm, and served with their tzatziki. The time after that, the Greek style shrimp, with a light tomato sauce, crumbled feta and large broiled shrimp that combined to form a somewhat melted, feta-ey tomato cream sauce while the grilled shrimp bathed in it, really good stuff. Last night, it was the swordfish kabob. Basically everything I said about the chicken, but better if that's possible. Tender in the middle, charred on the edges, and fall apart flaky, with a dollop of tzatiki, doesn't get any better. It also comes with a nicely prepared rice pilaf, loaded with flavor and not dry at all. The dessert is a custard wrapped in filo, smothered with honey and cinnamon, that creates the perfect sweet bite after all the savoriness. And it's complimentary, but I would gladly pay for it. All in all, go with a group, have some wine, and have a great time at Astoria's best Greek spot, hands down.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Five stars for the brunch at Cheryl's.  The food is made from scratch and with love.  During our year in Brooklyn, this was our go-to place.  I am still trying to find a place in the Bay Area to fill the void.  So good was the food that it elicited a moan of ""Mmmm!"" and ""Sublime!"" from my normally taciturn Midwestern sweetheart.   We usually ordered from the prix-fix menu offering mimosas or bloody marys with your meal.   The pancakes are nice and light, not heavy and made from a mix.  Cheryl makes her pancakes topped iwth fresh berries and whipped cream, not that partially hydrogenated ""whipped topping"" crap, but real whipped cream. Bacon hits the ""Goldilocks"" sweet spot of chewy but not limp, with the fat rendered out and drained properly instead of slung on a plate still  dripping oil from the pan.  Omelettes are light and fluffy with three different fillings to choose from.  My favorite was the apple and brie omelette.  other tasty offerings included red velvet cupcakes, huevos ranchos, and fritattas.   The decor resembles the inside of a ship on one side and the opposite wall hosts pieces from local artists.  During warmer weather, the patio overlooking the well-tended gardens of the neighbors opens up.   Noon gets pretty busy, with waits of up to an hour, but if you get there by 10:30 or 11, it's much better.   One star taken off for the one time we went to dinner.  Despite not being that busy, service was still slow and got our order wrong.  The only way I picked up that we were brought the wrong food was that they brought me a fish dish instead of meat.  Pretty presentation, but not what I ordered.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I ordered the quinoa veggie burger build your own. I have to say it is the BEST veggie burger I have ever tried, and I have tried many. It was not overly greasy or fake tasting. It was perfection. It tasted fresh and every bite was a wonderful surprise. I shared a basket of fries with a friend and I have to say they are quite generous with their fry portions. They were crisp and their fry sauces were great. The curry ketchup had something off about it... not the best I've tried. The service was phenomenal. The water kept coming and I never felt rushed or pressured into anything. I have to say dining here was great and the fact that the food was amazing made it all the better. Will definitely be coming back to try out their other burger selections. For a VEGGIE burger they definitely have my vote as one of the best.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here for a BYOB with 3 others.  We didn't have to wait long, but only because we made a reservation 2 days in advance.  I was skeptical about how timely the reservation would be honored, considering how tiny the interior was, but we were out of the rain and into the restaurant within 10 minutes of arriving. It is pretty cramped inside, and we were seated right by the heater, which meant two of our party were quite cozy throughout the meal (could be a good or a bad thing).   The waitress was very nice, and pretty responsive.  They were out of wine glasses when we arrived, which is a bit... ehhhhh.  I drank out of a champagne flute for a bit, then exchanged it for a wine glass once it became available. The food was pretty good.  MUCH better than Ivo & Lulu.  I ordered the Sashimi Peppered Tuna with avocado, which I'd highly recommend to anyone coming here.  Not only is it gorgeous, but it is the perfect portion, and you walk out feeling pretty healthy and satisfied. We sat around and milked the last bottle of wine after our meal, and weren't pressured to hurry, which is somewhat of a rarity when dining at small places like this on a Saturday night. Four stars for good service, good food, and an overall great experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Betti Bar! Above Hourglass Tavern, there is Betti Bar.  You go up a narrow flight of stairs, duck into a door on the left, and arrive in a small, cramped bar.  There are a couple of booths, maybe a table or two, and a tiny bar.  There is also an actual hourglass on the wall, that they flip.  The beers they offer are lined up on the wall, including the beer in a bag with a shot.  We decided to go with that since it seems to be the ""thing"" to do while you're there.  We each received a different beer, but the same sweet shot.  My beer was a Denver something and it was pretty good.  One friend had a beer with eyes on the neck of the bottle so it looked creepy coming out of the paper bag.  It's kind of cool to drink out of a paper bag, in a ""secret"" location, with not too many people around.  The music selection is also great, it's full of 90s alternative that everyone can sing along to.  I really like this place.  It isn't loud, it isn't crazy, it isn't crowded, and you get to drink like you're drinking in secret.  Very cool spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've had this place bookmarked for a year and been on a tapas kick lately and had to scratch this place off my list. Started with a glass of pomegranate/berry sangria that was so refreshing considering the weather for the day was in the low 60s. Zesty and sweet and not tarty like I was expecting from the pomegranate. My friend and I split the duck sausage with quail eggs & chorizo on a skewer, mussels and meatballs. Everything was amazing but in order I preferred the mussels, duck sausage and then the meatballs. The quail had a smoky taste to it but I liked how all the flavors came together and I was glad it wasn't spicy. The duck wasn't gamey. The mussels- I was expecting a small portion but it was huge after the mussels there was no point eating the meatballs. The mussels were cooked and had texture but the sauce, I wanted to know the recipe it was in. It was light and sweet. So finger-licking- dipping bread in sauce GOOD. The meatballs were heavy for me but I mean..it is a meatball after all. I liked the cheese dribbled on top of it. By the time the meatballs came I was full. Just wish I didn't have the group of girls literally sitting on top of me and service at one point I was wondering, where was my glass of sangria?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Obviously, all of the Momofuku joints in the city are popular and rated on every list possible. Thus far, I've been to three (Ssam Bar, Noodle Bar, and Milk Bar) and in general they're all decent but not great. In some instances, I would say that they're odd. With the line of people waiting outside before he restaurant opened, I expected the food to be wait-worthy spectacular. It was not so, although I did very much enjoy the pork buns and spicy pork sausage with rice cake. I would've said, ""More please,"" but the buns in particular are overpriced. $9 for two buns is a little ridiculous in my opinion. I'd order more if it was $9 for four buns because I can wolf those down like White Castle burgers. The rest of the meal was interesting in a huh-I've-never-tasted-that-before kind of way. I know it's considered fusion but some flavors seemed odd to me such as those in the long island crescent duck breast (duck, mushroom, daikon, and orange) and the gravy that came with the ham. Aside from the buns and sausage, I thought it wasn't worth the wait and for some dishes, the price. There are much cheaper versions of the buns in Chinatown even if it's usually duck instead of pork. The ingredients are more or less the same. Assembly may be required but at least you could get a whole duck instead of a few pieces of pork. I thought the atmosphere was stylish and the staff was nice. However, in the end, I wouldn't wait more than ten minutes to get in.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And the food (not necessarily in the right order): Amuse of 1 each (ham and apple croqueta, cod skin tempura thing, potato tortilla wrapper thing filled with quail yolk) - this isn't counted towards the 10 courses!! *Razor clam foam thing *Monkfish liver in bonito broth with black radishes and blood orange Grilled cuttle fish with radishes Grilled sardine with Spanish blue cheese and grilled artichoke Duck confit on top of a crispy cracker thing *Goat meatball with squid fritters Duck egg mousse with lamb bacon Roast wagyu cheese steak Pre dessert - bourbon panna cotta with lemon foam *Torija - Soaked brioche that gets caramelized *These items were my faves!

"If I could give this a 4.5, I would.... not only because I like decimals (Come On, Playas!  Who don't like the dot?!), but because it is not quite a 5 and Definitely More than a 4! My lady and I have eaten there twice and both times, the food was fantastic, all around the table.  So, I'll focus on some of my favorites: Oysters on the Half Shell - Yup.  Slurp.  Scream ""Yum! Now that is what I'm talking about!""  Repeat. The Popcorn Shrimp with Bacon Mouse - THIS IS THE DISH THAT MAKES YOU SLAP HIGH-FIVE WITH RANDOM PEOPLE & then get into a Foodie conversation with them!  Crispy on the outside with some bite left on the perfectly cooked shrimp, inside.  Then you have the Bacon Mouse - WHAT?!  HUH?! YES!  YES PLEASE! - which is light and creamy (not heavy like some mouses... it almost has an aioli consistency) and smokey and bacon-ey.  It is the perfect outfit to compliment the hot body of this supermodel starter. Spicey Fisherman's Stew - Rich, hearty, stew-ey goodness.  Delicious! The thing that would keep this from rolling into the ""5-Star"" bracket for me would be the two fish dishes I ordered (on two different occasions).  One was the Blackened Catfish and the other was the fish special.  Both were cooked perfectly - that was not the problem.  My issue with both dishes is that they were very, very small... too small.  In fact, they both could have been a large starter, and though they were tasty, neither was quite worth the price point. On the plus side, the servers & bar staff were all well informed and excited to talk about the food. In the fabulous foodie area of Fort Greene, Brooklyn, this has jumped up to one of my favorite restaurants!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"UGH SO GOOD!!! My family went here after we were so over the wait at Joe's Shanghai and proceeded to get a shitload of food as typical Asian families do. We had the fried noodles (which were a lot like udon noodles), the mock duck, dumplings, veggie dumplings, the chinese watercress/enoki mushroom dish, some mustard green/tofu skin/pork soup, and some other stuff. I can only speak to the vegetarian dishes but I was soooo happy and satisfied. I don't know if it's that I haven't had Chinese food in a while and I was just so excited, but I am pretty sure it was all very good. None of us had any complaints. The veggie dumplings were okay - I don't remember them much. The udon noodles wree great, but I really loved the mock duck and the watercress/mushroom dish. I kept helping myself to the veggies, thinking, I'm vegetarian, I can eat as much as I want since everyone else has everything else to eat. It was sooo good. And the mock duck was super good too! It's not at all like duck. It's soy-sauce seasoned tofu skin wrapped around a mix of shiitake mushrooms. It's just slightly sweet, which was really nice; I don't always like Shanghainese food because it can be way too sweet for my tastes. I actually thought it was a pretty nice restaurant, so I'm surprised to read the other reviews. It's not a place you'd have a banquet, but much more than a hole-in-the-wall. I left a happy camper and cannot wait to go back this weekend!! Mock duck and vegetables for meee!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Soups are supposed to be burning hot, especially french onion soup that is covered with cheese. Because it was lukewarm, the cheese was nowhere near gooey. Escargots were too small...

36322	308	2009-10-24	We had a large group - jammed in at a round table in a large, but crowded restaurant. I ordered the pasta special but was disappointed that I could not substitute an appetizer which would have been much more interesting than the salads that are offered.  The pastas that night were penne with tomato basil, fettucine with bolognese sauce and gnudi in sage butter sauce.  Gnudi was very good, fettucine was too al dente for my taste (looked homemade but virtually uncooked) and the penne tomato basil was eh - nothing special.  Asked for more gnudi but it took more than 10 minutes for the roaming server to circle back. At the most it was worth $10 rather than the $22 charged.  Would have loved to see some really imaginative pasta specials.  Panacotta was good.
1141	308	2014-12-06	For the price and the hype i thought it would be way better.... A little disappointed considering the high hopes we had.,
13181	308	2014-11-12	I have not dined at Becco in several years. Having had the pleasure of remembering a better dining experience, I was quite disappointed when I visited a few days ago. The waitress seemed to be going through the motions of doing what she was trained to do. Cold and sterile. As it was not busy when we arrived, I expected better.The breads were cold and unappetizing. The 3 choice pasta dishes, which I ordered were fair to good with unlimited helpings. My guest ordered veal picatta which was very tasty. As the restaurant, which is in the Theatre district, filled up, the service got worse. Not a relaxing meal.. Happy to leave.
23105	308	2014-11-10	Came here for my boyfriends birthday. I give 3/5 for the experience and a 4/5 for food, because it was delicious and dessert was amazing But I was dissapointed a bit at my first time visiting becco. The restaurant called the night before to confirm my reservations and when asked i specifically mentioned I didn't want them to sing when the desert came aroud which I guess they didn't note down. Luckily I managed to stop them before too much embarrassment. And the second dissapointing thing was when ordering I mentioned I wanted to add the 3 Unlimited pastas to the meal I ordered which the menu did say I could do, but apparently they forgot that too. I ended up just having the meal which was delicious. But for the great ratings this restaurant received I did expect our night to be a little more pleasurable
36323	308	2014-10-20	Been there many times.  But never again, out of anger. My advice: never, never take a group of more than four to Becco before the theater. My wife invited a large family group of our children and grandkids to dinner and the theater in honor of my 70th birthday.  She called Becco a month ahead of time.  Reserved a table for 10.  Specified 6:00.  Specifically asked for the upstairs or the back room.  Specifically asked Becco to note that we had to make a theater curtain: 10 tickets to Matilda to make.  (For us, at least, not a small expense.) Becco called my wife several times during the month to reconfirm.  Each time, she was asked to confirm that we had theater tickets. Finally, the evening arrived.  Our whole party was at reception desk by 5:50.  Told it would be just a few minutes.  Got told it would be just a few minutes 6 more times.  Finally got seated at 6:35.  That is got seated at a crowded table.  In the bar.  With one of our party's back up against a narrow crowded corridor of people standing between the bar stools and his back. No waiter, no menus until one of us went up to one of the managers to complain.  Nearly 7:00. The end result: no time for appetizers, no time for desserts, no time for a comfortable family dinner to start the evening. What should Becco have done?  It's pretty simple.  You have a sell-out restaurant.  You have no problems with the number of turns"" you have to make per night.  Don't overbook.  If you can't handle a party, tell your customers instead of taking a reservation. Don't protect your profitability at your customers'  expense.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I was hungover so I was expecting a place with a lot of greasy fried crap, but instead Kelly took me to a healthy little restaurant. What I ate wasn't too memorable because it took me a few minutes to remember what I actually ate, but I had a mushroom/veg quiche, which was tasty but very very heavy, and a salad. The salad was good, it was arugula and lemon/oil dressing. The food was good, but nothing great, and it's a really small place which does not allow for private conversation. Kelly wouldn't keep her mouth shut about talking smack about guys with mustaches, and she didn't realize there was one sitting right next to us listening in the whole time.

"I came here last night with my friend and we both sat at their bar area because we simply thought it would be the best spot and it was! The restaurant is very well dressed. It was simple with it's wood infused decor. The soft lighting from the hanging paper lanterns made the restaurant feeling comfortable and relaxing. With jazz playing in the background, we were immediately greeted with warm towels to clean our hands. Personally I thought it was a very nice touch indeed! I ordered their homemade soba with grated yam and raw egg yolk ($16) and it was absolutely delightful -- I wanted more. I enjoyed the sliminess of the yolk over the sliminess of the grated yam and when combined with the soy sauce, it had the perfect amount of salt to bring out the flavor and taste. We also tried some of their yakitori but I thought it was okay. The meat was a bit dry and tough. I thought it was over cooked and wasn't seasoned well enough. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it as it's overpriced and not worth a shot. Although watching the guy making them was pretty entertaining. Their homemade tofu ($6) that comes with three different flavored salts are also worth a try! My friend and I shared it and the taste of the tofu was silky, chilled and just utterly refreshing. Let's just say, If you can't figure out what fresh tofu should taste like, imagine processed mozzarella from the supermarket vs. freshly made mozzarella from the a deli. It's just that good!!!! Best of all I like this place because they are a chain restaurant from Japan. I assume most of their ingredients are local but their menu probably mirrors the same ones from Japan so that is a plus in my book.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The first time they didn't get the order right and I ordered a mild spice, and it tasted good but left a very fishy taste in my mouth afterwards. I decided to try it again and the waitress was friendly, attractive and attentive and the mussels were huge. I ordered it spicy so maybe that helped in it not being fishy. I'm looking forward to trying more of their exotic dishes.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Say hello to the next Roberta's / Momofuku.  Go there now before the enthusiastic 2-star NYT review, because that will happen and the lines will make the Roberta's wait look measly.   Reason why?  Easy.  This is dining a la now - comfort-ish food served in a playful attitude environment using high-end ingredients and unique concoctions.  Nestled on a rapidly-gentrifying block of Bed-Stuy (the wine bar, Sud, down the street being the dead giveaway), Do or Dine, like the places I compared it to, brings all the components of a winning formula together without it seeming like a formula at all.   Per the chef owner, when recommending dishes: ""Some of our dishes are just really satisfying.  The others are ... really interesting.  Depends which end of the spectrum you fall on [as to what to pick]"".   And so roll the dice with ""interesting"" and you get a serious chunk of head cheese served with an extra-tangy mole mustard, deviled eggs with fried baby octopus sticking out of the top, whole; a grilled caesar salad, served as a single giant grilled chunk of romaine on a butcher's block with a knife jammed in it (""Et tu Brute"" is the name of the dish; get it?); a chilled corn soup, studded with caramel corn; and an explosive, perfectly cooked sliced duck breast, with an ample, steak-like char, tender inside.   The menu is playful, often hilarious.  ""District 9"" was the name of a new prawn dish; if you've seen the movie, most of it is spent with the main character saying ""f--king prawns!"" over and over and over again.  See the aforementioned ""Et tu Brute"".  This place is zero-attitude and all game.   They are also BYOB for now; they'll keep your beers cold in the back, and open your wine for you. One of the chef owners saw me using my phone right before we ordered and said, ""You Yelping?""  No - I was actually trying to figure out what artichoke escabeche was (didn't try it, but sounded great).  But I had already planned to politely do him the honors after the meal - even if I'm going to hate the 60-min wait the next time I go...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Like many other BBQ lovers who have traveled throughout the country, I was sure I knew what great brisket was. But my first visit to Delaney BBQ gave me a new perspective on the experience. Descriptions like "" succulent"" or"" melt in your mouth"" sort of fit here, but cannot really convey just how delicious and rewarding my meal was. I choose equal portions of fatty and lean cuts, a half pound in total. As I watched the carving of one beautiful steaming brisket, with perfect smoke ring and pepper crusting, I was thinking that my trek to Brooklyn was about to pay off. I chose coleslaw as a side and added few slices of white bread, and found a seat. I lifted my plate to breath in the glorious aroma and began to sense that this was going to be special. My first mouthful gave a rush of flavor that I knew would set a new hallmark for all of my future BBQ life. I love this brisket and Delaney BBQ is a great place to enjoy it.

"It was not by choice that one stumbles into Calle Ocho.  For starters, I'm a novice of Latin Cuisine.  Nevertheless, when the guests from our of town make a reservation for 15 and requests your presence, it's difficult to frown upon a visitors hospitable invite. The Setting:  Upon arriving at Calle Ocho, one can't help but notice the compartmentalized framework of the establishment.  Luckily, this is only segmented to the bar area as our escort to the dining room revealed a cavernous and spacious setting.  In many ways, the atmospheric feel of Calle Ocho can best be described and tranquil and serene.  Everything ranging from the soothing orange color tones of the wall décor to the subtle magenta lighting of the overhead fixtures, the feeling itself is nothing short of relaxing. The Sangria:  During our dinner, the restaurant offered unlimited Sangria.  With numerous varieties to choose from, one can be certain that a heightened level of inebriation is bestowed.  One should emphasize that the Sangria itself is not as potent in terms flavor in the fruit abstract used in its cultivation.  Nevertheless, when anything is served in buffet form, quality is hindered.  Not to mention that the Sangria is consumed for a buzz, not for taste... Entrée:  Salmon - The application consists of a Spice Rubbed Salmon that's served over a Lobster Mash and topped with Mango Chutney.  One thing I hate most about any restaurant is overcooked fish! At initial visual observation, the marvel that is bestowed is a sight worth appreciating!  With the array of colors ranging from the bright orange of the salmon to the vibrant white of the Lobster Mash, the entrée itself appeared more to be an art form than consumption.  Prior to ordering, I made a request to have the Salmon cooked Medium Rare.  How was the fish served?  WELL DONE! During consumption, it was revealed that the Salmon was excessively overcooked and dry.  The wonderful seasoning consisting of Paprika and Cayenne Pepper was dismissed the chance of elevating the flavors of the Salmon due to the lack of moisture within the fish.  When consumed, patrons will find that the fish is flakey and dry, which adds to a highly segmented flavor of the seasoning.  Furthermore, the Lobster Mash only contained a 0.25 oz of Lobster Meat.  It was more Mash than Lobster Mash.  Looking back, I question why I didn't send this dish back and request the Seafood Paella instead. $27.00 in the hole and slightly buzzed...  One should always heed the warnings, never order fish in a Latin America, Mexican, Cuban, or Spanish Restaurant.  Just stick to the Steak or Paella. Never again! Notes on Calle Ocho: - Two Words...  Unlimited Sangria!  With over 8 flavors to choose from, one can't help but sample each (twice)! - Learn from my mistake...  DO NOT ORDER THE FISH!  My girlfriend's Paella was pretty good. - Expect to drop about $80.00 per person.  ""Cheap"" is not a term used at Calle Ocho.","[1.0, 0.0]"

That being said, I am a firm believer in that more than the process to achieve the final result, it is, in the end, the final result itself that matters most at the table, and unfortunately, I just don't think Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles lives up to the hype of Best Thing I Ever Ate (in a bowl).  Perhaps I had overly high expectations going in, but whether that be the case or not, I still came out underwhelmed.  The broth seemed lifeless and lacking in pizzazz, and the overall ambiance of the place didn't help the mood either.  Too bad, really.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"They were pretty good. The thing that got me the most was the culture and service. When we went it felt like we were automatically in a different country. While we were about to order it was someones birthday and they did a birthday song and celebration very different from most restaurants which made it very entertaining. The drinks were all white which was a little odd cuz he ordered lemonade and i ordered the papaya shake. They were dialed down but it was still pretty good. Not too sweet. We decided on this restaurant because i was craving sushi. So when we yelped it, it sent us here. I ordered the oxtail with avocado and sweet plantains while my friend got the sirloin steak with rice and beans with potatoes with garlic. The oxtail was a bit salty but woulda been nice with some carrots perhaps but honestly i've had better. His Sirloin Steak was good but even the medium rare felt over cooked. The sweet plantains were really good but they only gave five pieces. Where as the avocado they were really generous with but didn't taste ripe. The rice on beans was a compliment to the salty oxtail and the garlic potato we had a bite each and that was enough. Overall would I come here again, yes but will definitely have to try something new.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was very fresh and delicious, and much more filling than I expected! Service was friendly, but a bit slow. They initially brought us another table's dishes and then took a bit long to bring the food we had ordered. (The food they accidentally brought was the ravioli, and after seeing it I would recommend ordering the gnocchi instead, as the ravioli portion looked so small!)

"The first thing that caught my eye about Cafe Condesa was the one page menu.  I like a place that will do only a few things because, it usually means that's what they do right.  A recent visit confirmed my theory. Cafe Condesa successfully combines the hip atmosphere of the West Village with a casual, carefree vibe.  It's not a big place.  If you blink, you literally could miss it.  The staff, while very sweet, seems a little ragtag - not a bad thing, more part of the charm.  The cafe itself, has no uniform look.  Our table for two was even a little unsteady.  None of it was a problem at all.   We started with wine and an appetizer of the artichoke ravioli.  I can't recall the wine other than that I liked it.  The ravioli were surprising.  I hoped for something tasty but, there was a lot more than the somewhat salty taste you usually associate with a brined artichoke heart.  The texture was similar to that of a ricotta ravioli but the taste was more complex and it came in a simple but very supportive tomato sauce. For Dinner we had the Scallops and the Snapper.   The scallops were very evenly cooked and tender enough so the fork passed effortlessly through them.  The cauliflower and brussel sprouts were simply prepared and tossed together.  In the middle of the dish was a line of delicious roasted poblano sauce which really tied everything together quite nicely.  The snapper I tried was equally well prepared and simply delicious.  Overall, this was a really strong performance by this little place.   Given how small the room, reservations are a good idea for weekends.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After much deliberation, I have to give credit where credit's due. Riverpark is amazing!! Out of the basic categories: Food, Atmosphere, Service. Riverpark is VERY close to perfection. We ordered the Sweet Potato Ravioli and Lobster Salad to start. The lobster was some of the freshest I ever had, but since the centerpiece for the salad is the lobster there is not much else going on on the plate and it sort of ends up being a flat one note. The sweet potato ravioli is DIVINE. All kinds of good flavors jump out at you as you chew. We had the Veal Chop and Chatham Cod. My bf loved the veal, although I think it was his first time having veal in his life. My Cod was simply alright. I think the chef tries to bring out the subtle and fresh flavors of the fish, but again, it was a bit flat for me. The potatoes were a bit to creamy and liquidy. I like to be reminded that I'm eating real potatoes, in whatever form they're in. The clams were nice and tender and a good accompaniment. For dessert, we tried the Apple Crisps and the Rice Pudding. Please DO NOT get the rice pudding. They put some sort of seed in it to give it a south Asian (Indian) flavor and it does not go over well. The seed sort of crumbles and sours the dish. The creamy pudding is too liquidy and the rice seems a bit undercooked and they did not pick a starchy enough rice. The fruit in the small cup is just an add on, which doesn't help the disappointment. I almost knocked off one star because of this dish :-( The Apple Crisp is a solid dessert though. Not fancy and exactly how it should be. (Almost) every dish was impeccable, but the ravioli and veal were true standouts. The atmosphere is very much upscale with beautiful lighting and modern decor. Although you might need to be a bit strategic in where you sit since you cannot see the beautiful view from all tables. Luckily the centerback of the restaurant rests atop a platform, giving you a bit of a vantage point. However, they undermine that a bit by putting the bar in the middle of the restaurant. Oh well. Service is very attentive and friendly. When I grabbed the bottle of wine to top up our glasses, a waiter (not ours) came out of nowhere and politely took it out of my hand and began to pour. They really do have a lot of people milling around ready to please, so take advantage! Anyways, I can't wait to try it out again in the summer when there are more sunny hours and the sunset is later. It will be beautiful!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"God DAMN. This was excellent. I'm not sure what's up with all the haters for this place, but I just got done with an excellent meal and wouldn't hesitate to go back. The food wasn't just great, the price made it a bargain. We ordered 6 small dishes, my parents got a beer and a soda, and we also got dessert. No, the bacon popcorn isn't great. It's salty and a little bacon-y, but nothing to be wowed about. It was nice to start off, though. The fuji apple salad was good--I thought the dressing was a bit strong, but the spicy walnuts and goat cheese made a great balance. The scallops were AWESOME. Ours were cooked flawlessly, the carrot puree was out of this world, and the capers were roasted. I mean...they were crunchy! Something so simple just amazed me by how good it came out. BLT buns were great, if a little overwhelmed by the spicy mayo. Those ultra-thick slices of bacon were delicious. And the mussels! Oh my goodness--wonderful, wonderful broth, delicious chorizo, cooked perfectly...again! We had to get more bread to sop up the broth. The pork belly was the loan so-so dish of the night, and calling it anything less than good was a stretch. The creme fraiche was a nice touch. The oxtail was the highlight, for me--it was cooked flawlessly, not remotely dry, and coupled with that onion puree? NOM CITY. Dessert was the curried carrot cake with buttermilk ice cream. SO DAMN GOOD. Everything was great. Winning all around. The total, with a 20%+ tip, was about $105--$35/person. For what we got? Yeah, I'd go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Please understand this is for the WHOLE experience of Chef's Table and not JUST for the food. Food: 5 stars The first part of the meal was some of the best food I have had.  I especially loved the Hokkaido uni with truffle and the osetra caviar.  The flavors were very clean, complex and bright.  And your plates are beautiful.  But then again, I think anything will look beautiful if you are using Hering Berlin and put edible flowers on those plates.  But as the meal progressed, I felt like it was a complete different person cooking the food.  As dessert came, it was just ordinary. I have to look at the career of Cesar.  He was at Danube as Mario Loniger's sous chef.  Then he was at Bouley as the CDC.  Where did he learn to make sashimi/crudo?  Certainly not at Danube or at Bouely.  Hmm...I have to think maybe his ex executive sous chef might have had a lot of influence perhaps in the first part of the meal.  His ex-executive sous chef was/is a sushi chef.   Then his warm food, the cooked part seemed very familiar.  The food was executed with nary a flaw, but the flavors were all too familiar and seemed to lack the innovation as the first part of the meal.  Maybe Cesar did create the first part of the meal, but looking at his history and his experience, I suspect....just a thought...  Also, for a three star Michelin restaurant, I noticed repeats of some flavors and ingredients such as the repeat of shiso in three of his courses.  Just saying. Service: 3.5 Service was cold and sterile with very little explanations of the dishes.  Yes, it was technically proficient, but it lacked any soul. Now here comes the parts that really made Chef's Table a place that I really don't care for.  Price to Experience ratio.  I feel if you pay $400 dollars a person, the experience should be well, an experience that you want to come back for over and over again.  I however will never go back to Chef's Table for so many reasons.   The rules of engagement are ridiculous.  It is ALL on the Chef's terms.  The difficulty of getting a reservation, how it is COMPLETELY inflexible, the jumping through hoops, are all frustrating. I wanted a reservation of 6 but was told the max they will allow is a party of 4.  This made for a very awkward situation for who shall come to Chef's Table with us.  Upon eating at Chef's Table at 10pm, there were 8 unseated at the counter.  Why could you not allow 6 of us if there are 8 vacant seats? The no pictures/note taking.  How ridiculous is this?  I understand the no picture or the use of phone.  Yes, this can be distracting, but seriously dude, it is JUST FOOD.  I think people should refrain as much as possible in not using their phone when eating in an establishment like this, but to scold people is just brazen and rude.  Your food is not a secret.  There is no need to be afraid of someone ""figuring"" out your food.  In the end, it is ONLY FOOD. Dress code.  Why the business attire?  I can understand the jacket or a certain dress code, but seriously, no jeans?  Who is paying the bill?  The chef or us the patrons/guests? Now here is the big part of the equation; THE HOSPITALITY.   Where is the hospitality part of this equation?  We as guests/patrons pay THE VERY MINIMUM of 300 a person, SERVICE PRE-PAID ahead of time.  WHERE IS THE HOSPITALITY PART?  When the meal started, commenced and ended, not a word from Cesar.  Not even a hi, welcome or thank you.  NOT EVEN EYE CONTACT OR A SMILE from Cesar.  Did you forget the reason why we pay to come to your place?  You are a terrible HOST in your own HOUSE meaning Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.  Where is your sense of hospitality, your interaction with the guests, where is your charm, where is your thankfulness that people pay a lot of money to eat at your establishment?  Maybe you think your food is the only reason people come to your place and you may be right to a point.  Yes, your food over all is some of the best food in town, but it is not the best ever.   I could forgive almost everything and my over all experience would have been so much better and I would have given you 5 stars if you had just shown some GRACE, GRACIOUSNESS, AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, A THANK YOU, A WELCOME, EYE CONTACT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, A SENSE OF HOSPITALITY.  For this part, Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare is a COMPLETE FAIL. Considering the price to experience ratio, I give this place 3 stars.  Yes, some of the food is exceptional and very memorable...yes, the food is executed nearly flawlessly.... but if you are going to ""cook in front of your guests"", it should not be cold and sterile with no interaction.  YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITALITY business or did you forget that?  Did your ego really blind you? Been there, done that, but will not return.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Overpriced and with poor service and food!  First, let's begin with the service - Saturday afternoon when no guests were at the restaurant we sat for like 10 min to get someone's attention. Finally, after waiving to the waiter the menus were brought and  we were explained a little bit about the cuisine. I'm not a picky eater, but I do know what a good ukrainian food tastes like - and that was NOT good. Most of the food was dry and needed tons of sour cream to be added to make it taste edible. Borch soup was ok, but nothing to remember. We didn't try alcoholic drinks, but the soft drinks (fruit punch type) were good but the priced almost like cocktails - so be aware.

"I love Thai food. Sri Pra Phai is hands down is the best Thai restaurant in NY in terms of authenticity. I've traveled to Thailand last year and this restaurant is the only one that brings back the true taste of Thailand. When I get cravings, I would come here for the shredded green mango salad or the papaya salad, the soft shell crab served with green curry sauce, and the Tom-yum shrimp soup. I would also recommend the green curry roasted duck(yes! green curry! It's more spicy than the red curry but it's much more flavorful), crispy Chinese watercress salad, and fried fish cakes. It's absolutely to die for!!! The only thing I have to complain about is their service. I think it's because they have so many customers that they don't even try anymore. I come here once a month for almost a year now and not once have I received great customer service. They're usually more busy on the weekends so that makes it even worse.

"Just had lunch there for fathers day. There were six of us who all ordered food and drinks at the same time. The waitress did not write anything down and I thought to myself ""how can you get that many orders correct without writing anything down?"". When lunch was served, I was served scrambled eggs. The problem being I had ordered steak med rare and eggs over easy, so I sent it back. By the time they served me the replacement, everyone else was finished. As if that wasn't bad enough, the steak was cooked to a lovely shade of well done.  Totally frustrated, I sent It back and was too mad to order anything else at that point. Then, since we were a party of six, they automatically added a tip to the bill.  The reality was there we were only five people since I never actually ate anything.   Bottom line, the restaurant only had one waitress there serving the whole place. Considering it was her mistake that caused my food not to be delivered, an automatic 18% tip was really aggressive especially considering nothing was given to us to try and rectify the situation other than removing the meal I didn't eat from the bill; not a comped drink, nothing.

"After reading so many great YELP reviews on this truck, I''d figure this would be the most orgasmic thing I would eat and gave it a shot. I went to the truck on Park during my lunch hour. The guys on the truck were really nice and sweet and suggested the ""Maine Lobster Roll"" which I agreed too. Considering they aren't fishing for the lobster in their trucking, boiling it, and then cooking it to make this lobster roll, I thought $16 was a bit steep for the size of what would be equal to a 6in sub at SUBWAYS . From the first bite, this roll lacked flavor. It was suppose to be tossed in a lemon mayo and I tasted no lemon whatsoever. For me, it was just lobster, with lettuce and a sprinkle of  paprika on top.  I was waiting for the kick of flavor but that never came thru. I was truly disappointed in not only the roll, but the fact that now i am $16 poorer. Frankly I don't know why this place has so many great reviews. I like food with a lot of depth and flavor and this place just didn't deliver. I will give 2 stars though, because the bread was awesome as well as the workers' attitude ( and they were cute).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I loved this place! It's a great little restaurant, which I heard becomes overflowing as the night goes on. I came on the early side with a friend who had been there previously. She recommended the spaghetti al limone and it was amazing. Fresh pasta cooked correctly (al dente!) with sauces that don't overwhelm the pasta. Really really good. I will be going back! And I think they also do take-away/delivery.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Me and my hubby are almost done polishing off all of the MIchelin Star restaurants.  I am happy to say that some of the best are last.  I have dined at a lot of restaurants and I would put this at my top 10. I asked the staff how many courses the tasting was and they didn't even know because so many dishes were coming out.  He reminded of what Alinea's former tour that they discontinued because it was so time consuming. be prepared to carve out almost 3 hours to eat.  Set up is similar to that of the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare except with less seats for a more intimate an in depth dining experience.  I personally think I got one of the best seats in the house being right next to the kitchen on the left.  We were of the first to be served and got the best view of what was going on in the kitchen. The pace of the meal was perfect.  The portions were perfect tiny sizes so you can keep eating.  They also didn't make you wait too long.  They were right after another.   It's hard to believe that with almost 24 courses that each one was perfect.   I am into the art of plating.   I very much appreciated their use of all ceramic dining ware that was just to the right temperature.  They used the material either to chill or heat at the appropriate temperature. Their staff is extremely knowledgeable. Being surrounded by fellow foodies; of course they would start asking crazy questions.  One diner was asking extremely detailed questions about the tea they were serving.  They knew the answer for everything and served it more artistically than you would see at a tea bar.   You can go to their lounge area is definitely a must as it is on a secret lower level of the restaurant.  Beautiful with amazing drinks and a talented bartender.  Both all alcoholic drinks and non alcoholic are a go here.  I always like a good house made ginger soda.   Just an FYI it is at 77 Worth.  Look lost, and they will come out to get you.  Yes, THEY DO NOT HAVE A SIGN on their restaurant.  lol","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Everything at SoCo was great from the environment to the customer service we had felt very welcomed. First off I have to say that the mac and cheese will change your life! There's just no other way to put it. One bite and me and my boyfriend just stopped talking and started digging in. I ordered the red velvet waffles w/ fried chicken and my boyfriend had ordered the salmon. As for the waffles, they were delicious although I found the chicken to be a bit dry on the inside. A little syrup helped soften it up but the waffles were the perfect texture. Moving on to the salmon my boyfriend is a chef and would usually have something to say about what he eats but he seemed extremely satisfied. The salmon was seasoned to perfection everything complimented each other pretty well. I'd give this place a 10/10","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Amigos! If you are from Southern Cali (or not) you must eat here for your Mex food. It's still up there as one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food in all of NYC! Not just because it reminds me of home (Native San Diegan), but because the food is fresh and what I remember good Mexican food to be like! Yes, mom, yours in the best and yes dear, yours is really good too, but if you want to sit down and have some fun while you eat some darn good simple Mexican food this place is it. If you miss your rolled tacos like I do, ask for the flautas. We've had them a few times now and they are consistently good. Nothing special about them, just fresh and good with your choice of meat. They have a limited menu, which is what I prefer, so just about everything here is good. I hope you go on a day that they are playing Airplane (The movie) on TV while Mariachi music is going on. It's a fun cozy place for about 4 people any more than that and you'll be chatting with your neighbor, whether you like it or not. ;0) Remember, good Mexican food is made by Mexicans. iOrale! ~r Allergy info: No peanuts, eggs, sesame seeds and the oil is vegetable.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After some mishigas trying to set up a reservation, we found the restaurant to be cute, cramped and lively. The staff are in constant motion from taking your water order to getting you a small parting sweet. Service was attentive at all times and we had all of the servers waiters and mangers at our table at some point during the evening. The open kitchen was hopping. The menu is all share plates but some are larger than others. We wanted to eat everything from the descriptions. We did eat frito mixto which were fried oysters, portobellas and zucchini with a spicy dipping sauce; burrata and avocado cream salad with micro greens and a tangy dressing. Then came delicious chopped chicken livers with balsamic toast and rosemary. The bone marrow was somewhat disappointing. I prefer the bones to be sliced lengthwise for easier access to the marrow. The plate came with bocarones, a sausage pate and a veggie escabeche. The sausage brought out the taste of the marrow, but anchovies clashed; some added salt would have improved it. The last dish was maybe the most fabulous and I wish I had had enough appetite to consume every morsel - sauteed broccoli rabe with portobella truffle toast, with creamy gravy and a fried egg. A real taste treat. Wines were eccentric, interesting and tasty. I had a white picpoul. The small beer list was food but could improve with at least one Belgian style Tripel. All and all a great place to spend time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"3.5 stars. Very decent Mexican food in a cute and cozy space. The service is kind of slow but that can be fixed with good company and a little bit of patience. I recommend the -chorizo nachos: Tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, topped with fried chorizo. HOLY QUESOS. Do not leave this establishment without ordering this dish. -tres leches: One of the better ones I've had. VERY moist and soaked in leches. Not overly sweet. -coconut flan: SO rich. Perfect texture and flavor. This CAN get a bit overly sweet for me towards the end so I recommend sharing. As for the non-stand out dishes: -The carnitas tacos: too dry, not enough salt, seemed a bit underseasoned -The beef tacos: too dry, not enough salt, seemed underseasoned. -the spicy pork tacos: the best of the 3. Not dry. Good spice, good flavor, but something was still missing. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for the appetizers and desserts but caution everyone on the tacos. Perhaps next time I will try a burrito or torta.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My girlfriend and I want to enjoy this place. We love Italian food, live only a short subway ride away, and think the setting is fantastic. But twice we've gone, and twice we've waited not only well over an hour, but also longer than parties of our size who arrived after us--likely an offshoot of the rude host/manager, who seems to play favorites among patrons. First, the wait. It would be tolerable if not for the fact that they usher you outside with little to no regard for the current weather conditions. Are they allergic to gas heat lamps? It's obnoxious to expect people to wait an hour or more in overcast, chilly weather because of your reputation. Get over yourself and pony up; judging by the wait times, they certainly must have some money left over to invest in several lamps. Second, the food. The crostini are very well done, and at $3 reasonably priced. The pasta is al dente, and, well, that's about the best you can say for it. The sausage cavatelli made both of us ill (literally... it kept my girlfriend up all night), and the bolognese tasted like Chef Boyardee, with a few extra spices to throw you off the scent. A subpar dining experience, even if the prices aren't outrageous. My suggestion: Try Caffe e Vino in Fort Greene. Much more authentic, and better bang for your buck.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Tartine's a nice little shop in the middle of the more residential part of West Village. It's not huge though, so if you are aiming for brunch here - definitely show up on the earlier end to make sure you get a table, whether it's inside or outside. We got there 15 minutes early (Yelp lies - they open at 10 AM, not 9), but the gentleman manning the pastries at the front was kind enough to let us sit down and take a load off before ordering brunch. Service is pretty much just placing your order at the beginning - the food gets brought out, but otherwise you're pretty much left to your own devices. Following the advice of a good numbers of Yelpers here, we ended up going with the croque-madame and the eggs Norvegienne. The croque-madame is pretty much a croque-monsieur with a poached eggs added on top. It adds a bit of depth to the sandwich, but I really enjoyed the homemade brioche here - it's fluffy but not too dense, allowing the flavors of the Swiss cheese (which isn't too sharp) and the ham to come through. The eggs Norwegian were very well-executed as well; it's a subtle nuance, but the thinner cuts of salmon made it much easier to eat (usually, I find the gravlox to be a bit too chewy in most brunch dishes I've had). I also appreciated the lighter hollandaise, which didn't overwhelm the eggs and make the dish as heavy as it could be. The side potatoes were pretty standard, and the bacon was solidly executed. It's not the hearty, thick slices I usually think of when you see 'applewood-smoked bacon' on the menu, but you do get several slices of bacon that are cooked pretty well - not too crispy, but with plenty of greasiness left on to add even more decadence to each bite. You won't find as many of the innovative or super-interesting dishes you might find at other brunch spots, but everything we had on the menu was well-executed, and we were able to tidy up brunch nicely within an hour. With old-school radio playing in the background playing hits in this cozy little joint, you might be forgiven for forgetting, at least just for a little bit, that you're in the heart of a cosmopolitan 21st-century city.","[1.0, 0.0]"

After reading so many great reviews on this place we ventured out of our cozy bay ridge and decided to give brunch a try. SOOO very glad we did!! There was a wait when we got there around 12:30 which we expected so we saddled up to the bar and were offered to have brunch there. Sure!! No wait! Our bartender/server was Sumaiya and she was PHENOMENAL. Her suggestions on drinks and food were on point. I had the hibiscus margarita and my bf had the strawberry moonshine. Both delicious! I ordered the crawfish eggs Benedict and he had the crowd favorite of fried chicken and waffle but it's a RED VELVET waffle! On her suggestion we got a side of the Mac n cheese. To call it a side doesn't do it justice because it's a meal on its own! My bf doesn't really like waffles but these waffles made him a believer! Now he says he just likes THESE waffles. They were fluffy and perfect! My Benedict was amazing with perfectly poached eggs and an old bay hollandaise that was beyond good! We will definitely be back and most likely for dinner next time!!

"I have been to Uva twice, once at midnight for a late dinner with my hungry, just-off-the-bus-from-Boston-boyfriend and once on a Wednesday night at 7 with a friend.   The bruschetta both times has been really delicious--as you know if you read my reviews, I'm a sucker for great bruschetta.  I got the goat cheese (again--when do I ever turn down goat cheese?) bruschetta the first time and the traditional (with yellow and red tomatoes) the second and both were spot on.   The appetizers were good, but they could have been a little hotter.  We tried the involtini di melanzane which was rich and delicious and some sort of mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and then fried.  It was pretty salty (how could it not have been with those ingredients) but it was still tasty.   For entrees, I have tried the pappardelle ragu and the fettucine in pink sauce with scallops and shrimp, and both were good.  I thought the ragu was much better, but I think that's because I don't normally like cream sauce and just ordered wrong for my taste.  My friend's ravioli caserecci was excellent! As was my boyfriend's eggplant parmigiano.   Both times the atmosphere has been great--busy while at the same time intimate, warm, and friendly. Try to sit in the hidden backyard garden.  Uva is a great neighborhood spot to grab a glass of wine and some food with a friend and enjoy a warm summer evening.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After seeing all the 5 start ratings on Yelp I decided I had to check it out and see if Pisillo lived up to it's reputation and the short answer is yes, yes it does. The service and atmosphere was great with the cashier and owner only able to communicate in a mix of Italian and Spanish as the owner only speaks an Italian dialect. They were also extremely accommodating to our 1 year old daughter giving her something to snack on while we were waiting for our sandwiches to arrive. And the sandwiches themselves were delicious. I particularly recommend the one with mozzarella, prosciutto, arugala, and balsamic vinegar. Overall a great (but not inexpensive) experience. Steven","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Twitter version of this Review: Go to Gaia Italian Cafe.  Eat.  Thank me later. If you are in this neighborhood, GO HERE.  Even if you are nowhere nearby, GO HERE. I had a Prosciutto & Brie Panini on Saturday that I am still thinking about today, on Monday morning.  And it's not just me - my co-workers and I were in the area and have since that moment been talking this place up to anyone who has taste buds. The prosciutto alone was worth the price, but the brie was a perfect complement to it and was heated and melted to just the right consistency.  And the bread?  Oh, so good! A very close second to the food itself as a reason to eat here: the price.  $5 for that sandwich!   So if you're in the neighborhood, try Katz once to say you've been there & done that; frequent Gaia often if you love excellent food and also like being able to spend your money on other things.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Amazing French food that won't break your wallet. That is the bottom line with this place. For the quality and options at Le Barricou you will really get your money's worth. Their menu changes slightly here and there and the pasta and fish of the day are always flavorful and interesting without 100 different bizarre, intense flavors all at once that seems to be dominating the culinary scene these days. Their wine selection is very good and there are great options at many different price points. It is always nice to find a place that keep an affordable Bordeaux. The cocktails and beer selections are always different, which is good considering most restaurants and bars seem to be supplying the same options these days. They have some absinthe options, while expensive is a bit different. Their desserts are all very good, and as they are in France not too huge, which could be good or bad depending on your appetite, and sweet tooth. The staff and owner are all attentive, accommodating, and cool without being irritating during your meal.  they always remember you and are super nice. A lot of people come here for the brunch which has a good value, and some great French dishes like the spinach and goat cheese omelet with a croissant. Perfect start to a weekend.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And i had their riesling wine that was good for sure :P .. It took like around 25-30 minutes to get the food but it was so yummy that delay was genuine coz to make good food u need some time.. Food was excellent .. Our server, Peter was very nice and friendly.. He described the menu quite well and grabbed d best food for us . Music was cool too..

"Late last year my wife and I were in the East Village looking for a Galician tapas and found  Nai. It was a Saturday afternoon, in between meal times, and the place had few customers. We sat down at a high stool table, looked at the decently priced wine list (mostly Spanish and Argentine good wines), ordered some tempranillo, and we proceeded to tackle some pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod (to die for), some grilled sardines (delicious), some exquisite cod croquettes and then, la piece de resistance, octopus Galician style (sauteed in olive oil and with pimentón/paprika: just like in Galicia). At  $5 to $6 for a tapa or about $11 for a ración (double the size of the tapa), food of this caliber is a steal when compared with trendier or faux-upscale similar establishments catering to Catalan or Basque tapas in the West Village. The best way to appreciate Nai is to sit in your high table, have a bottle, let the tapas flow, and see and absorb the young atmosphere. And so we found ourselves returning to Nai several times. Last night, we visited again for the pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod; croquettes of goat cheese wrapped in jamón serrano (delicious); meatballs in brandy (quite tasty); grilled chorizos (just as it reads, which left us wanting next time for the chorizos in an onion sauce and chorizo in cider), and toppled with a desert of fresh lime-laced strawberries stuffed with custard (exquisite). It is heartening that we still have so many items in the menu to work through..... What brings us back to Nai?  Is it the young and low-key atmosphere which seems so true to form to tapas places in university towns like Santiago de Compostela?  Is it the warm and attentive treatment at the hands of David (the owner) or Raúl, the genial attendant from the Basque country?  Is it the high quality Galician tapas that are thoroughly authentic, like back in Galicia, without contamination or ""adjustments"" to fit ""what the NY market would expect""? I don't know (but who's asking?)  One think for sure: the way David and his co-owner chef constantly and solidly deliver the goodies, I don't think that I will have to worry for a while about high-priced debatable experiments involving chorizos toppled with mango and cilantro, just to appear hip. Nai delivers what is truly needed in NY: a real, authentic tapas place from Galicia, authentic to its roots in food and  ambiance, all for very good value. Keep it up, guys! Well be baaaack!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Lobster Joint is located in a new commercial area with street parking available. Light up lobster sign with lead you through the gateway. Picnic style tables with a few pub tables available. Open french doors make for a nice breeze during the summer. Menu written on a chalkboard style board above their register. Noise level was normal, was able to have a conversation without yelling. Staff was helpful in answering questions on the menu and making accurate recommendations. Beers on tap and bottled as well as wine available. After you order they hand you a number and you choose your seat. Moderate prices for lobster as $17 for each dish. Excellent food for a great value. The New England Lobster roll was warm and flavorful. Fries that came with it were seasoned appropriately with what may have been old bay.  Lobster tasted fresh with an even balance between their herb mayo and lobster. The Lobster Mac'n'Cheese was hearty and filling. There were nice chunks of lobster. Top layer was nicely crusted with a creamy center.

"Things that generally turn me off of restaurants: cash only, communal seating, smell of BO and long bathroom lines. You probably get where I'm going with this but ALL of those were present at my last visit to Momo. Despite all that, the food is AMAZING and the atmosphere only just dampened my mood. I came here on a girls night out this past weekend and we couldn't have picked a better spot. Some of our favorite menu items included: vegan gyoza, spicy scallop temaki, spicy mcbomb and a seared tuna appetizer that the waitress recommended. We really benefited from the staff's impeccable knowledge of their food and menu. The sake was SUPERB. Oh and, if you're reading this and not already full by dessert, don't be afraid to try the vegan chocolate cake. It's soft, moist and delicious (& you won't even know it's vegan).

"This place is very good, but very pricey. Good luck getting out for under $100 per person. Granted, we did enjoy appetizers, entrees, and a bottle of wine...but still. Here are my thoughts: Bread basket: Awesome. They bring fresh bread--ciabatta, focaccia, and something that had salami wrapped into it (so be careful if you're vegetarian). They bring good dipping options, too. Tuna ""susci"": If you get one appetizer, get this. It's really light and fresh and unique. Spaghetti: We couldn't bring ourselves to order ""just spaghetti"" as an appetizer, but we'd heard such good things about this dish, so we shared it as an appetizer. It IS amazing for ""just spaghetti."" The noodles are perfectly cooked and the basil is...zesty (and I never use the word ""zesty""). Branzino: I didn't even know this was sea bass. Glad I asked, and glad I got it. This was probably the most delicious fish I've had in ages. The crispy skin was amazing. My friend got the halibut and loved that, too. It's richer, wrapped in bacon (so be careful if you're pescetarian). Black farfalle with lobster: My fiance got this dish and I may have snagged a bite...or two...or three. If I ever come back to this restaurant, I'll order this. For dessert, they'll bring you a plate of mini tarts and whatnot. If you're not that hungry, this totally suffices to satisfy the sweet tooth. I'm not sure they always bring it though. We had already ordered desserts before we got this. We got the chocolate cake and some raspberry thing that I barely remember...or maybe it was lemon. The wine had hit me by this point. It was good. I remember that much.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place continues to blow my mind. My boyfriend and I moved to the neighborhood in October, and first happened upon this after passing their storefront and seeing a sign for happy hour oysters and $2 tacos. I live for oysters and also work at an oyster restaurant, so I had to check it out. Patio was wonderful, the place was surprisingly near empty. I guess on weekdays in Park Slope happy hour is a bit barren most places. The place had a wildly delicious looking menu, so we decided to come here for my birthday at the end of October. The place was very quiet, but the staff was wonderfully attentive and accommodating. This is when we met Ermira. She is unbelievably sweet, knowledgeable, and all around a great server. And this is coming from someone who's served for around ten years. She heard it was my birthday, and we got a complimentary amuse, and a dessert with port! Such a treat. We left high on food and great vibes. We came back for brunch with my family from Jersey, and while she wasn't there, the service was great. We made sure to make reservations a week in advance, since there were seven of us for Saturday brunch. GREAT brunch food. But really, nothing compares to their service and food at dinner time. We THEN had to come back for my boyfriend's birthday, and she remembered us! Again, there were few tables in the place, and we sat in our same spot. Same treatment as last time, she hooked us UP. This is why I always say, treat your servers very well, and they will return the favor. It's not that hard of a concept to understand, but so few in this city get it. Just last week we came again because my sister and her fiance were in town. She remembered our names, was her super cheerful, effervescent self, and my family loved her. THEN, with all of us just having happy hour oysters, tacos, and a couple appetizers with a couple drinks, she STILL hooks us up with an amuse and a dessert.  I have never left this place feeling anything less than elated. Ermira is amazing. The food is SENSATIONAL, and easily one of our favorite restaurants in the city right now, but I find myself thinking; if not for her infectious attitude and amazing service, would I still think this is one of the best spots? Who knows, but I will not stop coming here for as long as she works here. :]","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I would give 4 stars for the food, and I'd like to give 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down for the unpleasant surprises. When I found out that Totto Ramen was unexpectedly closed on July 4th, I desperately Yelped an alternative. Not sure why Yakitori Totto showed up under ""ramen"" in the area, but it did. Needless to say, there is no ramen here; do not come here expecting ramen. Since it was reviewed so positively on Yelp and it was getting late, I made the decision to eat here and bear out the long wait (30-45 minutes?). The ambiance is great; it's trendy and muted, with dark, clean colors. As I perused the menu, pleased by the selection and the relatively low prices, I casually glanced at the back cover - and froze. $20 minimum per person? Where did that come from? When the cogs in my head started working again, I understood; with such a long wait, and with the yakitori costing about $3-4 a piece, the restaurant wouldn't want to have people just pop in for a snack and linger for hours. There isn't a lot of seating, and it makes sense to get as much money as possible from the customer. I'm just really upset that that there wasn't a (warning) sign on the front door, so that I would've known before I waited so long. By the time I saw this tiny footprint on the bottom, it was too late; I was too tired and hungry to move. (To boot, I thought it would've been really rude to leave after we've been seated). That said, I was still greatly displeased by the $20 minimum. I'm not opposed to paying $20 for a meal; I've done so plenty of times, and greatly enjoyed my food. I was irked by its being forced on me; all I wanted was a bowl of noodle soup, and the noodle soups were around $10. What was I going to do with the rest of the money that I needed to spend? Instead of sitting there, comfortably enjoying my experience, I felt panicky and pressured, frantically looking through the menu to find out what would cost a lot and give me very little food. I hate wasting food, and the idea of ordering food that I could not eat bothered me immensely. Luckily, my companion ate most of my food, and we ordered a dessert. Even so, the ordering experience was extremely unpleasant. When it comes to the food, however, it really is great. For the most part, Yakitori Totto, I'm sure, will please everyone with a larger appetite than mine. I got the tofu in broth, which was fried to lightly-crispy perfection and silky smoothness on the inside. The broth (which isn't actually potable, btw) was addicting; I kept dousing my pieces of tofu in it. The yakitori chicken, whether with salt or sauce, is amazing. I definitely recommend those; the meat clearly tastes fresh and extremely well-prepared. The salt / sauce highlight the flavor of the meat and transcends mere chicken. I'm so used to having bland chicken smothered in sauce to disguise the blandness that this was truly a welcome reprieve. (I only get real, flavorful chicken from my mom, who goes to the butcher to get a just-slaughtered chicken). I was not impressed by the beef tongue, which was a lot tougher and rubbery than I had expected and would want. The karaage chicken was good - when is it not? The green tea mochi and the cup of green tea that I got was satisfying, but I've never had bad green tea mochi or bad green tea. All in all, delicious food. Do go, if you're able and willing to spend $20+ for a variety of large-portioned foods.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here on a whim w friends then brought hubby back. I'm often a creature of habit so both times, I thoroughly enjoyed the Tomato Soup w Cheddar & Mozzarella Grilled Cheese...sounds boring but soup tasted like the tomatoes were freshly picked. The Grilled Cheese was ooey & gooey buttery goodness. Hubs had Gruyere & Guava Jam Sandwich-divine. Our waitpersons were helpful in allowing us to try & experience the Local Ciders & Meads.  Hubs & I weren't fans of the Meads but it's an acquired taste. The Cotes du Rhone More Than hit the spot. Tight quarters. Reminds you of a Starbucks coffee shop. Be prepared for seats taken up with laptops & shopping bags. And like riding the subway, politely ask them to move em.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So I left a bit perplexed about their whole tasting menu concept and if they could tweak it a little I would love this place. They offer 3 different 'feasts' a vegetarian, a seafood and a meat. They all sounded scrumptious but they're very restricting on how you can experience them. Everyone in the party has to have the same menu and you can't  share 1 tasting amongst 2 people? Well when I go to a restaurant I like to try a bunch of different things so I always make sure that I don't order the same thing that everyone else at the table gets. You better go to this place with people that all have the same taste as you or you're shit out of luck. If you don't want one of the tastings the a la carte menu is very limited and none of what's on the tastings can be ordered a la carte, quite a conundrum. My friend wanted the scallop tasting , I love seafood but scallops are my least favorite. I wanted the vegetarian, she said no...see where I'm going with this? The very sweet bartender explained that this was the way it was because the kitchen has limited space. The restaurant is small and cute and I get that but then don't offer the tastings. We sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of the Malbec which was more than decent for the price. We were forced to then only order off the very limited a la carte menu. We started with the spring pea salad and it was delish! Spring peas, sliced radishes, pea tendrils and  some falafel dressed in a creamy but light dressing. The portion size was large and perfect to share. For entrees we went with the sliced pork loin with mango salsa and the scallops. The pork was perfectly pink on the inside and crispy on the out. All of the plates are beautifully presented. The scallops were served on a bed of polenta with some sauteed kale and I loved them even though I'm not a huge fan of scallops. The food is really good at this spot I just wish they were a bit more flexible with their menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Always been a fan of Pommes Frites.  Always wondered whats the big deal with Belgian fries, the answer is a lot. Went in to this tiny local that looks like a tavern, and ordered a double. Then having to decide what sauce I was going to dip, the fries in.  So I got the combo ( three sauces for $2.50). Blue Cheese Dressing because you can't go wrong with that, Wild Mushroom Mayo, and Smoked Eggplant Mayo. Sat down; as the dude brought the cone with, the immense amount of fries and the hole, which drips the oil, which their isn't really any of, and begin dipping the fries into the sauces. Blue Cheese with fries is great, the smokey flavor of the sauce is amazing with, the fries, and the wild mushroom is delicious looks like ""Grey Poupon"", but tastes much better. Although, Pommes Frites is tiny and seats 15 at most.  It's always busy and the combination of the fries, and sauces make it worth standing in a really tight space.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Flat Top is exactly what so many of us have been waiting for! let's start with the food. the food is top notch and simply so so delicious. the chef seriously knows what he's doing and the flavors of the dishes are unique and perfectly put together. for the yelper below, flat top is now back to serving bone marrow (which is amazing)!!! i ordered their new lamb chop entree last week that is amazing. the lamb is not too gamey, and it goes perfectly with the eggplant stuffed with butternut squash, broccoli rabe, roasted garlic and tomatoes. my husband and i were blown away with this new dish, like all the other entrees we've tried (our favorites are the burger, chicken, bass, and steak). Flat top has become our go-to date night spot. it has such a romantic vibe at night and provides the fine dining experience the area lacks. service is always on point and everyone is very friendly and accommodating. we are always excited to see our server there who never fails to make our experience so great every time. now, onto the coffee and the perfect cafe spot it is during the day time. they serve blue bottle coffee, and for those who don't know it is really the best! i'm obsessed with their iced chicory and their seasonal pumpkin latter is also up there on my list (SO much better than starbucks)! we've also gone a couple time for brunch, which is also really great! the scallion and cheddar cheese biscuits they give us when we sit down is so delicious! im always tempted to ask for one more. love their spinach egg white omelette and bangers and mash! flat top really is the best place in the area and is worth a visit if you haven't been.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The great Ramen search continues... Today's stop was Minca.   Located in a far corner of the East Village, the place seems kinda like an afterthought in terms of location. Wifey and I read some favorable snippets in various sources and decided to give the place a try. It's small, but exactly like you'd imagine a ramen shop to look like.  Ain't much on the menu except ramen and a choice of broths you'd like the noodles floating in... I respect simplicity in my ramen joints. I went with the toroniku (slow-braised pork) in the Minca mix broth (a combo of chicken and pork base), while wifey went with Minca Sio, a more traditional shio-style broth w/ garlic flava. The pork was heavenly.  Lots of fatty, porky goodness swimming in my broth today.  The ramen was fantastic too.  The noodles were fine (almost angel hair pasta thin) and texture was spot-on (chewy, with a slight crunch). Weather was warm and Minca served a refreshing iced buckwheat tea that took the edge off. Some damn good ramen in New York!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First of all, best restaurant name ever. Every time I hear it, it makes me smile because you can feel the GENKI behind it. If you don't know what ""genki"" is, just imagine energetic japanese people (e.g. at a yankees baseball game) and there you go! Unfortunately, I couldn't find the ""genki"" behind the curry here. The best thing about Go! Go! Curry! is that they are super price-friendly, which makes it great for college students. Go! Go! Curry! has different curry sizes ranging from S, M, L, XL, starting from $5.00 for the plain small. Also, every time you go on the 5th, 15th, 25th, you can get a coupon for a free topping next time. I don't recommend that you just get a plain curry here though. I would really suggest adding on some kind of katsu (standard is pork), whether it be pork, chicken, shrimp or sausage. For me, I eat a medium-sized standard Katsu curry. ($7.50) I used to have a coworker who said he always ate the ""Grand-Slam"" ($12.50) size, which is Go! Go! Curry!'s specialty of ALL katsu + two hard-boiled egg halves. Seriously, google that baby's picture. It's beautiful. Although I wish I could, I can't eat that much so I haven't tried that one yet. Despite liking aspects of Go! Go! Curry!, ultimately the curry is just pretty standard (although mildly spicy). It is certainly not bad at all, and I can see how many people could like Go! Go! Curry. Who doesn't love affordable, comforting food? However, the curry is just not special enough to warrant a place in my ""must-visit"" if i'm in the city list. (I hope I have not created a wave of ungenkiness in the genki hearts of the japanese businessmen and women who own the go! go! curry company.)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Le Grainne Cafe was a random pick from Yelp that was within walking distance to where I was staying in Chelsea. What attracted me was that it's a French cafe that is casual for me to have dinner. When I arrived to Le Grainne Cafe, it seemed a bit more fancy and intimate with its dim lighting and tea light candles on its table, but that didn't bother me. I was quickly seated and greeted by the server and I asked for any recommendations of what Le Grainne Cafe has to offer, but the server practically named a bunch of things from each section of the menu. So I settled with the Poulet Aux Legumes (Chicken and Ratatouille) Savory Crepe and it came with a side salad. I thought it was pretty good with the chicken not being dry and it complimented well with the ratatouille. It was enough in portion that I couldn't finish my side salad. Le Grainne Cafe includes a glass bottle for every table for water. I wanted to try out their dessert crepes, but I passed on it since I wanted to try desserts at other places New York City has to offer. The pricing was not bad at all as plate was valued at $14. It's a decent French cafe that has reasonable pricing that I wouldn't mind coming back to again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I recently made a reservation for my wife and daughter for breakfast. I had requested that they be seated in the court yard since they both really enjoy dining outdoors. I had spoken to the restaurant on 2 occasions to confirm the reservation and was never told that the court yard was reserved for hotel guests only. Since the court yard was the main reason I had chosen the restaurant it was very disappointing when my wife and daughter arrived and were not allowed to sit in the court yard.

"3.5 stars. When I first walked in, the place was completely empty at 7:30pm on a Friday evening, which was quite strange to me. Seems like for such a highly rated place, they should have a few more customers. However, the place quickly filled up after about 45 minutes. Apparently 7:30pm is early for dinner nowadays. Boy, am I gettin' old. Everything here is done tapas style, with a lot of small plates. Prices are pretty reasonable and while I'm not usually a huge fan of tapas, the portions here are big enough that you feel like you're getting a good value. We got the pretzel-crusted fried chicken, gnocchi, beets, mussels, and grown-up grilled cheese. Grown-up grilled cheese is definitely a good value and comes with a big portion of rosemary seasoned fries. Pretzel-crusted fried chicken was nice and crunchy, but definitely needed the sauce because it was very dry. Beets were pretty standard, and much, much sweeter than I'm used to. Mussels were also pretty run-of-the-mill but came in a pretty good portion. My favorite was definitely the gnocchi, which came in a mushroom truffle sauce. The gnocchi was pretty well cooked, and the mushroom truffle sauce had a nice creamy texture. Anyways, the decor is pretty cool. Mirrors, giant utensils but done pretty well, and not tacky. Beer and wine selection is decent and well-priced too. The service was generally attentive and pretty patient, since we had taken a pretty long time to decide what to order. Also, at the end of our meal, our check came in a Goosebumps book. Talk about a blast from the past. Anyways, the ingredients here are definitely high quality, and the ambiance is definitely intimate and suitable for small groups and dates. Overall, nothing really stood out, but I do think Tink's is a solid place for a low-key, intimate meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a New York Staple!  The Mixed with Rice is fantastic. The white sauce is primarily made out of crack and is unstoppably delicious. The recipe that truly interests me though is the red-hot sauce. The sauce is something else, just one or two drops of the stuff are sure to send you to the infirmary. I am pretty sure it is made out of red peppers, childrens dreams, unicorn tears and a dash of black pepper. SO very very good! The only real downside is that they raised their prices from 5 bucks to 6 and there is always a line of tourists waiting in line not really knowing whats going on.  These guys run all the carts on this corner and the one across 6th Ave is the same food by the same people and usually has less people waiting in line.

"This is probably a 2 star review, but I'm going to be pretty general in my review, so I'll bump it to 3. The reason I'm actually writing this review since I don't recall any dish I actually ate is just to sort of comment on the sentiment that I'm not quite sure what the hoopla is all about here. Along with finding nothing any too legendary here, they're also running quite a program. You wait in line, you put your name on the list, you go next door and order super expensive drinks and a few bites at their sister bar/restaurant, you get called, you go next door and order super expensive food and more drinks and so on. The wings were decent, but not sure why they get so much street cred. We felt like herded cattle and the food came out so quickly that we didn't even get to enjoy our meal and then we were out. I ate here over the Christmas holidays with a group of 8-10 and I can't recall any dish we ate. I do know there were a few dishes that were amazing, but for the most part small portions and pricy summed up my feelings. I wouldn't return in a group setting.

"The fact that I have been here 3 times in the past week and a half says something. It's so cheap and so good, I can't get enough. I pretty much just compare everything I eat now to how much food I could get at Vanessa's... The wonton noodle soup is ridiculous ($3.50). You could definitely share it between 2 people. I recommend the boiled dumplings if you want to try more authentic cuisine (8 for $2.50 I think). Fried pork buns are also good. 3 for $1! Only cons, that I feel are just whatever... Bubble tea is $3.00 ... which is a little overpriced, but whatever. There's very little seating, so you have to watch the tables. The sriracha is watered down, but still spicy. It's cheap. Go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Agree with previous reviews - do not miss the spinach gnocchi or grilled calamari. The gnocchi were so creamy and delicious! Eating the grilled calamari, I envisioned myself sitting at a beachside grill somewhere in the Mediterranean. Also tried the the tagliatelle with meat sauce - it was good but the homemade pasta was a little too al dente for my taste. Tiramisu was also good, but not spectacular.

"OMFG. Hands down the best pizza place in NY.   I've heard all the hype- two boots, lombardi's, EFF that.  Grimaldi's by far has the freshest best tasting dough out there.  They make the crust fresh and they don't use the shredded mozzarella cheese like most places.  Instead they use real blocks of cheese and place those liberally throughout the pizza.  Surprisingly enough they don't even use that much tomato sauce, while most people think that's how pizza should be made, i think that's part of the Grimaldi secret- less sauce, more real mozzarella.  who knows, they probably lace their dough with crack.  Either way, the shit's bananas.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wait..why is this place rated off the charts? I wish I could give it 3.5 stars since everyone else is raving about the place and I'm thinking maybe I missed something. This ambiance you all speak of, what ambiance?? Perhaps you're referring to the oh-so-original tea light set up? Personally, I thought it was crowded, loud and kind of dingy. The tables were pushed so close together this girl practically sat in my drink when she tried to squeeze by. Positive reviews about the drinks are no exaggeration though - I got the west side (delicious), the EO Gimlet (strong), and a vodka martini (meh-can't really screw that one up). My friend got the provencale - which was amazing. Order it - very herbal, unique and refreshing. I'm reading the menu as I write this and am realizing that all the good reviews must be in reference to the food. The only thing I ate here were the bone marrow poppers, which certainly were delectable, but I definitely need to come back for the food. Elk loin?? Bacon wrapped lamb chops?? How did I miss this??

"Visited this venue on a random Saturday afternoon while walking through the neighborhood. The decor of the place along with the name of the establishment just lured me in! The place is cool, young and inviting! We sat at the bar because we were looking to have a few drinks and maybe a small bite to eat. Unfortunately, the staff this particular afternoon was less than friendly, engaging and/or interested in our business. I cannot say they were rude because it would be unfair but their inattentiveness was really a sour note to what could've been a pleasant experience! My girlfriends and I are friendly, easy going people that just like to go out and have a good time experiencing new things. We are engaging, like to ask questions and maybe exchange a few laughs but this staff would not even make eye contact long enough to get a word in! Needless to say after the second drink we decided to find somewhere else to eat and just leave. I would like to mention that on our way out we decided to have a Cuban cortadito and the young man that we met at the coffee counter was a breath of fresh air! He made delicious cortaditos for us and told us it was his first day on the job (hope the bad attitude does not taint him) and if I happen to be in the neighborhood again I would stop in just for his coffee and friendly smile!

"in short: delicious, not-to-adventurous food in quintessential west village cuteness. the wait:  no wait at 7:30 on a thursday for a party of 3 to eat: sliders: the perfect appetizer when shared skillet braised calamari with spinach and lardo croutons: this was just ok, wouldn't order again ricotta cavatelli with fava beans, tomato broth, and bacon: delicate, straightforward and utterly edible. halibut with shrimp, escarole, and lobster ravioli: perfectly cooked halibut, lovely broth, could've done without the ravioli (lobster was tough). PORK CHOP!!!: i love you, pork chop.  perfectly pink, succulent, flavored with fennel seed and accompanied by butter beans, arugula and fennel.   cookie plate: normally I think biscotti is a waste of space, but the biscotti here is outstanding; served warm and tasting of anise, i could eat a whole plate of them. everything was perfectly seasoned-- there wasn't a single thing we had that needed salt or more of anything. to drink: we had a bottle of red from northern italy near the german border, forget the name but it was delicious and $50. downsides:  really loud and kinda spendy, but the price is about right for the caliber of the food and the location.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My friend and I dined here last night and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. The night started with drinks at the bar (I recommend the Big Brooklyn), before we were moved upstairs to our table. The first course was lamb meatballs and bone marrow. The meatballs, especially the sauce, were absolutely superb. The marrow on the other hand was pretty good, but the consistency seemed a bit off. I'm not sure if I'd order that again. Our mains were the lamb shank and the scallops, which were both excellently prepared. We capped the night off with a recommended bottle of wine and the chocolate mousse. All in all, the staff was friendly, the food was out-of-this-world and the experience was great. The only reason I'm not giving Landmarc 5 stars? I ordered a beer for $8 and it came in a can. That in itself is fine, but to charge $8 for a beer I could get just about anywhere else for $3 or $4 is a bit crazy. If they ever decide to lower their drink prices a bit or at least offer beers worth $8, they will certainly deserve that extra star.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It was a cold night and a perfect night for a hot bowl of ramen. I met up with a friend to try this ramen place that have been getting really great reviews. I think I've passed this place many times and always thought it was a bit out of its neighborhood of the Japanese restaurants on the 50's East side. The place is small and quaint. You know when it is a true Japanese restaurant when you are greeted with ""Irrashaimase!"" when you enter. We ordered the  Char Siu mayo don to start and the Totto Spicy Ramen and Miso ramen. It was worth the wait of 30 minutes. The broth was deep and just right of fattiness unlike other places...minca ramen where the soup was so fatty it was hard to eat. I know some people like that but not for me. The noodles wasn't soggy and the spicy level was just right for me. The pork charred just right with the egg and corn. I recommend extra pork. Oh, and it is cash only but it won't bust your wallet. I know everyone will compare it to the other popular ramen in the east village and I prefer this one. Ippudo is wildly popular and rightly so because Totto will give it a run for its money. For me, I prefer the low decor, and little shops you can find in Japan over the overly hyped, yuppified, EV haunt wait for 2 hours.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It's such a great feeling when you discover a restaurant that has great food AND warm, personal service. The service:   We came in early on a Monday evening and were one of three tables, so for the first part of our meal, the owner's son, Yusef, lavished us with attention and good humor. By the time we left, every single table was full, and the clearly overwhelmed staff was running around to accommodate everyone. Wafa's daughter--who had not been scheduled to work and had just stopped in to say hi to mom and eat dinner--and a friendly regular customer were both pressed into service to fill the gaps left by two servers they'd sent home early in the evening because they expected it to be slow. They both had great attitudes about it, and the guy who was the regular customer was bussing tables and refilling drinks and trying his best to answer menu questions, which was adorable and just went to show how much he cares about that restaurant. Wafa herself came out to our table to thanks us for visiting, but then she had to race back into the kitchen to work her magic for other people. The food:   Absolutely delicious mint iced tea, tinged with cinnamon flavor. I had the falafel sandwich, was wonderful, a little spicy, and HUGE. I could only eat half of it after our appetizers--a delightfully garlicky and super-smooth hummus, and a tasty and filling order of spinach pie (seriously, one appetizer of spinach pie to yourself could serve as a meal). The spinach was freshly cooked and lightly spiced, completely lacking that weird teeth-clinging sensation that cooked spinach often has. The dough was flavorful and substantial.  My husband had lamb kebabs and lamb shawarma. I liked the kebabs better (a nice char on the outside, juicy inside) than the shawarma (didn't love the texture from the marinade), but both were good. Our dining partners ordered mujadara and mousaka and enjoyed both. The table next to us ordered wine, and they are VERY generous with their wine pours. We're talking a full glass, probably twice what you'd get in another restaurant, for seven bucks. Not a bad deal at all! Definitely ordering some wine next time, or coming on Wednesdays for their BYOB night. There's a liquor store right next door to Wafa's that has a decent selection, too. Also, the portions are bananas. You get a lot of bang for your buck. We'll definitely be back soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I LOVE PIO PIO! They have never disappointed. The sangria is great, the chicken is always great, and the green sauce is my favorite! (You can actually buy the sauce separate and put it on anything and everything.) The food comes super fast and I usually get the same thing every time because it is so good. This place is great for groups especially if you order something like the Matador Combo which comes with the chicken, rice, beans, a salad, and other things. I have shared that between four people before. The only down side is that it can get really loud because there are so many people, and you sometimes have to wait like 20-30mins to be seated, but that is just because they are so popular! I have been to most of the locations and this one is pretty much the biggest and fanciest one.

"First, it's one of the few LATE NIGHT joints in Chinatown (open til 1am), perfect for people who dine late like I do. Points for that. It's a small place with a lot of two- and four-tops. It can get a bit cold in the winter with the door opening constantly, but other than that, it's surprisingly CLEAN for a cheap Chinese place. Obviously, you've got the typical grumpy old-Chinese man service, but they ain't so bad. Just watch for the tacked-on service charge on your bill so you don't double tip. A lot of places in Chinatown do this, so just ask if you aren't sure. Har Kow (shrimp 'crystal' dumplings on the dim sum menu): these were not the very best I've ever had but they were pretty darn good. It's a bit pricey here at $5.00, but the shrimp tastes clean and fresh. The wrap was JUST a tad too chewy, thick and dry for my taste, but again, it was probably better than 80% of the har kow I've had in joints like this and I love this dish... B+/A- Rice Congee: I had both the PLAIN congee $2.50 and the SLICED BEEF congee $5.00, and both were great. The plain congee tasted creamy, the rice was cooked to a nice porridgey, milky consistency... it was great. Wo Hop is okay if you're looking for a ginormous bowl, but for authentic congee with fresh tasting beef, have a bowl here. It's smaller but tastier. Beef Chow Fun $8.00: a staple of my childhood. It was well done. The noodles had a good texture, and it was made authentically (i.e. no canned mushrooms thrown in for good measure). It could be a tad saltier, but that's an easy fix. Roast Duck Shanghai Noodle $6.00: I wasn't crazy about the shanghai noodle itself, it's just kind of a boring udon-type noodle. I think you're better off going with the yellow egg noodle they use in wonton. The clear broth is okay. Maybe a bit bland, but the roast duck blew me away. It was *awesome*. We got some leaner cuts, but damn, the skin was perfection with a great balance of fatty and crispy. I'm totally coming back for JUST the roast duck next time. THE WINNING DISH OF THE NIGHT: I'm embarrassed to say this as a Chinese person who has always scoffed at Americanized Chinese food... but we ordered their ORANGE BEEF ($12.95). It's on the separate menu for their American audience... and that was actually the BEST dish we had! It wasn't drenched in sauce but nicely distributed, and it came with actual pieces of orange peels and perfectly steamed broccoli. It was aromatic, sweet but not too sweet, and the beef was the perfect balance of crispy, chewy and tender. WOW! A++ I would only say that if you're looking for Wonton Soup, this place has plenty but probably isn't the place to hit up. The bowls of soup are a bit small, and I'm pretty sure the wonton joint around the corner serves a better and bigger bowl. (Forgot the name -- Wonton Noodle Garden?) Can't wait for my next sampling!","[1.0, 0.0]"

So if you come during a busy time you'd probably have to wait. The food has a lot of Indian influence in it, something like an Indian/East Asian/American fusion. There are a lot of spices in the food but not so much that it kills the taste of the meat. The chef took part in the next Iron Chef and apparently was a runner up.

"have had great experiences at so many of Little Wisco's restaurants.  Jeffery's Grocery is my current favorite.  But Joseph Leonard was a disappointment.  The food was up to par but it didn't save it.  The service brings the rating down to 2 stars. We were greeted by a person who rolled his eyes at all our normal requests- 4 people for dinner.  We wanted a table but they didn't have one, so we sat at the bar.  Then before we ordered anything a table opened up and we took it.  Normal, right?  Then why did it all feel so painful?  The guy was soooooo troubled to have us enter his restaurant, it took sooooo much out of him to show us to the bar, then when 2 two-tops left and that meant our party of 4 could sit?  OMG could he have rolled his eyes any more?  He seemed soooooo inconvenienced  to put the tables together and seat us.  Everything was a complete chore for him.  Stuff that should have been done to make us feel welcome made us feel the complete opposite. So then we sit and the server is fine, but when she spilled a cocktail on someone in my party she went on and on about how the cocktail got on her shoes and she's upset because she doesn't want to ruin them.  She should have profusely apologized and said she'd be right back to clean it up, instead of going on about ruining her own shoes.  To be fair the word sorry did come out of her mouth and she did ask if my friend was ok, to which my friend replied yes, it only got on me a little (my friend is super nice and uber non-confrontational).  But a customer not making a big deal over a spilled drink is not an invitation to bitch continuously about your own ruined shoes.  You are a server (I am also a server).  Your job is to serve people.  Make them feel at home.  Take care of THEM, not concern them with your own problems.   So because of the service I don't recommend Joseph Leonard and I won't go back.  Get over bitchy, entitled service, NYC.  Seriously.  Why is it accepted?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Good pork and chives dumplings for the price ... for $1 you get 5 dumplings, steamed or fried your pick. Tiny teeny place with quite a long line at around 4 pm on a weekday. While I was there, there were a couple kids lining up ahead of me. There was one Chinese man who has no manners whatsoever, trying to cut ahead of me and the kids in front of me. He pushed in between two kids in front of me, waving $2 and demanding dumplings. Thankfully the owner served the two kids first, despite the obnoxious guy's attempt to get his attention. The man brazenly cut ahead of me though, which pissed me off, but since I am 2nd generation Asian who doesn't speak Mandarin Chinese, I couldn't tell him to get in line. Anyways, on to the dumpling itself. It was just OK. I like the thin dumpling skin, but I feel like they cook too much dumplings on the stove at one time the skin doesn't get crisp enough. There were too many dumplings stacked up close, sometimes on top of one another, that I am afraid they got steamed and the skin won't get crisp. If you happen to be around the neighborhood and hungry for some cheap snack, then by all means stop by. If you plan to make a trip here, I think it's not worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had never tried Georgian food (and had no idea what it was) before going here, and it was definitely some of the best food I have ever eaten. We had the waiter give us recommendations (bc we had no idea what anything was) and everything was so unique, flavorful and delicious. The waitress recommended the Acharuli Khachapuri as an appetizer, which is a really famous dish in Georgia that consists of this huge hunk of fresh chewy dough with melted cheese inside, and warm cheese/a sunny side up egg in the middle. The bread was so fresh and amazing, and the cheese oozed out perfectly--the combination of tastes were delightful! We also got this grilled marinated veggie dish with eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and onions--the spices were all so unique and everything tasted so fresh. She also recommended the Khinkali, which are soup dumplings with beef or lamb. Again, they were cooked perfectly and everything was so flavorful--it all melted in our mouths!! For my entree I got a dish that the waitress recommended--I am forgetting the name but it was pieces of chicken in this really unique sauce with peppers and onions, and some chewy warm bread came with it. Again, the flavors were all very unique and blended together so well, and EVERYTHING WAS COOKED PERFECTLY. The meat was so tender, the bread was hot, chewy, and fresh, and the spices were blended perfectly. The wait staff was also very nice and attentive, and the owner even sent over a complimentary bottle of Georgian wine! It is a GREAT ATMOSPHERE as well--very cute and well decorated on the inside (a lot of Georgian flair!!) and there is a garden/waterfall outside where people can dine! All in all, a great experience.

It's fine that she messed up but to not acknowledge two people waiting while you continue to seat guests walking in is a huge fail. That fact that it never crossed her mind to ask...crazy.

"For ramen, it's okay. I've definitely had better, and it's nothing to rave about, much less wait over an hour for. We came here right when they opened so we didn't have much of a wait at all. Service was fine, restaurant atmosphere is great. The reason I am giving this location a 2-star is because I've eaten Ippudo in Japan, and the quality of this location is a pale comparison to its Japanese location. I may be bias, but if they're going to carry the name, they should uphold the same quality. The broth wasn't anywhere as good and quite bland, the chashu was tough and the ramen noodles' texture left a bad taste in my mouth. The only consistency they maintain with their Japanese counterpart besides the name is the fact that they don't give refills on soda. It was a chore for me to finish the bowl I had, and I didn't even manage that. I would never return to this location, and the only reason this is not a 1-star rating is because they have a great front of house staff and atmosphere.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Holy god that was good! My WIfe and I had dinner last Friday at Skytown, a new cafe/bar that just opened a couple of weeks ago. Very nicely done interior with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, and a really nice overall vibe. Had a couple of interesting beers (the IPA was outstanding!) and a sip of some sort of amazing lemonade cocktail with fresh blueberries that I think the bartender invented right on the spot...if I hadn't been driving later that night I might still be there drinking them! But the food- holy cow. We shared a lamb sausage sandwich and a roasted yellow beet sandwich that was simply and astoundingly good. The beet slices were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and somehow magically I could taste all of the individual flavors of the various fresh greens inside the sandwich. The bread was crispy on the outside, and chewy/yeasty tasting on the inside- just the way I like it. Add in some amazing roasted potato slices and several very tasty dipping sauces, and this was a memorably delicious dinner. Their food artistry and the care they put into selecting and preparing their dishes is evident throughout- very highly recommended.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If I could eat here every day, I most certainly would.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is simply divine & the service always perfect.

BREAD PUDDING, oh my gosh I can't possibly say enough about it.  I have ventured & tried the other desserts (which were all delicious) but I always come back to the bread pudding. I've had many dishes, but I have to say my favorite is anything with the duck.  Chef Kat knows how to cook her duck, there is no doubt about that!

"You can't beat that even some of the employees are French! Service was very friendly, and the employees are patient with you as you look through the flavors and flavors of macarons to pick and chose what you want. They also make recommendations if you are having trouble with deciding. I picked up a box of eight macarons which I must say, is quite pricey. There were three gift box designs and I actually got to chose which one I wanted. I almost feel like I paid for the box too, and for this reason, I haven't even thrown it away and will likely keep it for storing something. It's cute so I don't mind actually using it. Also, they include a little pamphlet thing in your box which explains the history of Laduree and is also date stamped on the back. I tried the following flavors: 1) Caramel with Salted Butter 2) Coffee 3) Lime Basil 4) Raspberry 5) Red Fruits 6) Rose 7) Strawberry Candy 8) Yuzu Chocolate Overall, I thought that each of the flavors were spot on but the texture of the cookies and the fillings weren't as amazing as I hoped, and the crunchiness of each flavored cookie was inconsistent. But of all eight, I most enjoyed the Caramel and Rose macarons. The Strawberry Candy macaron had a marshmallow-like center and tasted very similar to strawberry pocky.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Even the glass of wine that was spilled by us was handled with speed and professionalism.  Very impressive but not intimidating in the least. Would definitely go back next time I'm in NY","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have to say, Yelp has always done me right and so I was optimistic going into Ilili since it has a lot of reviews and the average is 4 stars. You people let me down. I mean, not tremendously. But a little bit. Everything was good -- it was. I especially liked the lentils and the yogurt (larbe? can't remember the lebanese word), and the desserts were tasty. But....it felt a little weird to be eating street food (shout out to Mamouns) like falafel and humous on a white table cloth. Everything was fine...just not great or even very good.   As a main, I had the hamachi (tasted very oily but was oddly also light) and my husband had the lamb chop. He made a ""meh"" face when I asked him how the chop was. And -- and perhaps this ages me -- but the joint was LOUD. We were seated at a table right by one of the speakers and that sucked a wee bit. Anyway, stop by Ilili if you're in the hood, but definitely don't go out of your way to go.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I was excited about trying this place for a while. Its been on my foodie list for quite some time. Its very quaint so I ordered to go since the wait for a seat was so long. The chicken biscuit was just ok at best. The chicken cutlet was huge and flavorful. It was tender and drenched w/hot sauce. The biscuit was a total fail. I have a serious pet peeve about hard biscuits. It was almost inedible. But the ppl were nice and friendly. And I only waited about 10 minutes for my order.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

I was in a weird mood and wanted a cobb salad, but was not feeling like any of the meat or cheese elements. I requested that the cobb salad be made w/ only veggies and it was GREAT! We also had the brie (which was so great w/ the nuts and honey) and my friend got the goat cheese and red pepper salad. The waitress was super nice and very accommodating and the ambiance was a great little quiet, candlelit place in the middle of the rowdy village.

"When I first moved to New York, I was OBSESSED with this place. I'd find myself steering friends down 2nd Avenue so I could feign surprise at passing by Pommes Frites: ""Oh! Would you look at that. And I was feeling kinda peckish, too."" And then, something happened. Years passed. My palate must have changed, because I no longer love these fries as much as I used to. Sure, they're still fresh out of the fryer, and the sauces are myriad. But now, the frites taste too potato-ey, and the mayo sauces go sour in my mouth. This is not to say that a 2am frites stop isn't a glorious rite of passage; it's just that this city has so many better fries to offer. I encourage you to put down the cone and find them.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great BBQ for sure. Our friends from the north up in Syracuse started this spot and boy am I glad that it made its way to Brooklyn. The spot is huge and has a bunch of TVs so I will be going to check out a game there soon enough. On to the food. For starters I had the chicken wings and the poutine. The wings were awesome. I had the garlic flavor which was perfect spice mixed with some heat. The poutine was the best thing we had the whole meal. I couldn't stop shoveling it into my mouth haha. For those who don't know about poutine I suggest you try it ASAP. It's a combo of French fries, meat, gravy, and cheese. Unbelievable. For the main menu I had a combination platter which included ribs, brisket, and the hot links. All were really good but the best was the ribs. Very juicy and tender with awesome flavor. For sides I had cornbread, chili, and the baked beans. The bakes beans were really good. However I was not impressed with the cornbread or the chili. I've had better from other BBQ spots. Overall though I will def be going back to this spot a bunch of times.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A piping hot cider liberally spiked with spiced rum was just the thing to warm me up after a cold afternoon's walk. Upon walking in, I was enveloped by the warmth and cheer that Sweet Afton offers to its patrons. A late Sunday afternoon (helped by the fact that a football game was on and SA does not have a screen) meant that it was far more laid-back and less crowded than what you would find on a weekend night. Dim lighting and flickering candles set a cozy romantic mood or a very chill atmosphere for relaxing with friends. No wonder Sweet Afton is a very very very close second in terms of my favorite places to have a drink. The bartender handed me the hot cider in a glass cup that was wearing a little paper neckerchief. How cute! I enjoyed a basket of beer-battered deep fried pickles along with the cider. Thick little medallions of McClure pickles were dipped and fried in a light, airy, and crispy batter. Although deep fried, it was absolutely not at all oily or greasy. It left no residue on my fingers. Be careful when you take the first bite because it's soooo hot. A burst of hot pickle juice will explode in your mouth causing you to salivate even more with its tart taste. A hot juicy pickle surrounded by a crispy yet light beer batter made a delightful snack on such a cold day. Don't hate me because I live so close to Sweet Afton.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place was pretty good for brunch. There were 4 of us that came on a last Sunday. The tables are tiny and you sit pretty close to all the other patrons, but it's a pretty cute spot with nice tables outside. We tried the baked eggs, basque scramble and famous french toast. All 5 were delicious! My favorite was probably the french toast...it's as good as everyone says! It doesn't come with a lot of bananas which would be my only complaint. The basque scramble was my second favorite. It was the perfect blend of egg, chorizo and a dollop of avocado on top. The baked eggs were good - careful for those who don't like runny eggs because the eggs come pretty raw. It was probably the healthiest dish though because under the eggs were a piece of toast and TONS of spinach and tomatoes.  I highly recommend this place:)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is a great find in the Wall Street area for a delicious sit-down-and-be-served lunch.  And, they get you in and out in under an hour and for less than $15 a person. This isn't the usual NYC slice of pizza; they actually make it in a rectangular tray (I guess that means it's fried - oh well).  Only $15 for one tray which is plenty for 2 people.  (add more for toppings) My recommendation is to start with one of their delicious salads, then order a tray with one topping.  They have a good by-the-glass wine list, which works very well with the pizza and salad. I've only been for lunch, but it also looks like a great place to go for a drink and dinner after work.  I'll update my review after I've been!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First off, the Social scene there is none!   So if you want to have a drink while waiting for friends - impossible.  It's also in a very dark, very isolated, off the beaten path in China Town, NOT Nolita.  So it's a bit scary going with your girlfriends all dressed up. The name has Social in it, trying to be trendy and upwardly mobile as New York can be.  NOT.  Mostly empty and well, a boring local clientele.  Hey, I'm calling it like it is.

"It's terribly funny how restaurants with foods in their names don't necessarily do their best with the food in question. This isn't to say that BrisketTown doesn't do a good brisket. But it would hard to place it above their pulled pork (according to the ravings of my dining companions) or, even more surprising, their mac and cheese. But I think what's most important about going to BrisketTown is expectations. I came in at lunchtime with two other friends. You're not going to get bbq sauce (we're some sort of bbq heathens in that respect since we prefer such condiments). You're going to eat family style (fair enough, that's what a lot of bbq places do). You can order by the quarter pound (CONTRARY TO THE MENU; we were a bit disappointed that we didn't know in advance). You're going to enjoy the mac & cheese (just trust me on this one). All in all, the cuts of meat were great, which explains the price. It's a very limited menu selection so keep that in mind, if you think you'll have a lot to choose from.

"There is no easy way to write up Eataly.  It truly is something you need to experience yourself.  The good, the bad, and the delicious.   First the bad.  There seems to be a lot of talk about the bad.  And a lot of it is warranted.  But its imperfections are part of the charm.  Or maybe that's just the wine talking.  First, lets talk about that terrible, terrible name.  Just gotta put it out there.  No matter how much I love puns and punny names - Eataly is just terrible.  Then there's the schizophrenia inside.  Part import market, part restaurant, part food court.  And on that note, we can talk claustrophobia too.  This place is apparently packed all day and all night.  I'm sure as time goes on, this will even out, but when we went on a weekend night, the place was a zoo.  We put our name down at the pizza/pasta restaurant and were told the wait would be 45 minutes.  It came out to a lot closer to two hours. But somehow we managed to find a way to pass the time in the standing bar where they will happily serve you amazing wine and meat plates.  Seriously, even if all you do is stand at the marble tables and chow down on salumi, you are in for a treat.  It's that good.   The pizza and pasta is solid.  After a wait like that, I can't report anything mind blowing, but it was damn good regardless.   All in all, I think the place's imperfections and insanity kind of add to the charm.  It's got a distinctly chaotic European feel that just works.  And delicious plates of meat.  Can't forget about that.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Five stars is the only appropriate rating to give to this incredible sushi venue - ESPECIALLY if you are partial to eel and urchin. As soon as you step in you are greeted by warm, no frills, all-bamboo interior.  The minimalist design and intriguing quiet of the restaurant offers a hint into the style of sushi that you are about to enjoy.   The service from the wait-staff and our personal sushi chef for the evening was quick and attentive.  Not long after we sat down our journey through the seas of Japan, California and the Northeast began! Our chef immediately started us with a traditional piece of yellowtail, a flavorful, buttery beginning to our omakase.  I also noted that the rice and a unique level acidity to it and added to the depth of flavor of each of the pieces.  Our chef immediately shifted gears with a delightful piece of orato and then scallop, drizzled with sea salt and lemon juice for a refreshing and tangy approach I've never experienced before.  We were then treated to a warm, hearty piece of saltwater eel - pleasingly moist and full of taste.  Additional traditional pieces quickly followed with a serving of mackerel and squid.  The squid, which is typically a chewy, rubbery piece was delightfully soft and tender.  I actually was growing a bit concerned because our chef was working very swiftly and I was concerned that we would go through the tasting menu too quickly. As if sensing our concern, our chef provided us with a brief respite to process the pieces we just consumed and to lead into one of the highlight pieces of the omakase - the uni.  Similar to the uni at Ichimura, it was not prepared with nori and we were rewarded with a cool splash of oceanic flavor which lingered long after it was fully consumed.  By now, our chef was starting to enjoy the fact that we were so engaged and appreciative of each piece he provided us with. As if challenged to garner an even bigger reaction from us, he kept swinging for the fences with his next pieces and executed brilliantly with pieces of o-toro and scallop guts to keep our senses and taste buds absolutely delighted.  We also found the various salt water and fresh water eels to be particularly delicious, all of which had unique and varying blends of sweetness and depth of flavor.   As we continued our wonderful journey with sardine, cherry stone clam, arctic char, and rock crab, we took the time to observe.  Our chef was a pleasure to watch as he elegantly and deftly prepared our sushi.  Not a single wasted movement as he gracefully presented us with his masterpieces! You could look away for a brief moment only to find that he has prepared an extensive plate of sushi for one of the other tables at the restaurant.  It was also very interesting to watch the other chefs at the bar prepare their pieces and observe their styles and technique.   The showstopper fwas the uni roll.  I watched our chef lift a sheet of nori from a tin and effortlessly apply and distribute the rice across it.  When I saw him pull out the all too familiar wooden box of uni, I realized that what we were about to taste would be very, very special.  He generously scooped portions of uni onto the rice and lightly applied some soy sauce.  He rolled it up and to keep its shape, he personally handed each roll to us.  To date, I can easily say that this was the best piece of sushi that I have tasted in my entire life.  The crispness of the nori, balanced against the tangy rice along with the incomparable fresh burst of uni was a life-altering culinary experience.  It literally gave me chills and the guests on either side of us immediately asked us what we just had as they noticed how blown away we were by this piece. We tried to thank our chef adequately for what he just provided us; he shyly smiled and continued on with one of the most satisfying meals I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.   When all was said and done, we enjoyed 30 unique pieces of simple, elegant, wonderful sushi.  30 unique destinations with our chef and chef Yasuda's philosophies as our guides.   I cannot wait to return here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was a bit disappointed with this David Burke restaurant given that I'm a fan of his other restaurants. The atmosphere here is adorable with the red chairs and high ceilings and is very spacious for a NYC restaurant. I love the logo and branding of the restaurant. I came here with two other people and we shared the following: -shrimp and octopus tacos (if you get the large portion you get to try both shrimp and octopus -avocado pannacotta -bacon -spaghetti with lobster -cheeseburger Shrimp and octopus tacos were pretty good. The avocado pannacotta was nothing special and it came with very few chips. We asked for more and they were nice enough to give us more without charge. I don't love bacon but my friends who do said it was very good. The spaghetti was super spicy. It had a good amount of lobster but i was too focused on getting my mouth to not be on fire. The cheeseburger was good but nothing mind-blowing. All in all, I left full and content. The service was pretty slow but the ambience was cute.

I didn't think that was very professional for a classy looking Yakitori place. Our server barely checked up on us and they've forgot some of our food. The food is average for the price. Could be better.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Loved the red curry here! It was tasty and had just the right amount of spiciness. The papaya salad was delicious and definitely spicy but I wouldn't have ordered it any other way. The restaurant is definitely no-frills, they are cash only and some nights they get super busy. However, the restaurant is big and they get their customers in and out quickly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This little gem in Lennox Hill is incredible. The truffle gnocchi is the best I've had, meat ball veal (sorry for veal haters) takes it to the next level. It's our second time here, and both times it has been great. A bit pricey, but with the salt comes the sugar. Why the four and not the five? Open table time has about a one hour wait past reservation time and it's a tad balmy inside. If you're wiling to trudge through the adversity I suggest this little Italian Spot.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I live nearby and used to come here fairly often.  The food is good for what it is (and excellent as hangover treatment) and I like the atmosphere, generally speaking. But I gave up on Jimmy's about a year ago because of the service.  I think casual service at a neighborhood diner is a fine thing, but there's such a thing as too casual.  Nearly every time I went alone, I'd find myself falling off the stool trying to get the attention of staff who were busy chatting with each other at the other end of the counter, while my food went cold waiting for silverware or hot sauce or whatever.  And it seemed like every 3rd or 4th time I went, my order would come out wrong and I'd have to either wait on another go round or suck it up if I was hungry enough.  It makes an impression to feel ignored in such a small place, particularly as a semi-regular, and after a while, it started to feel like too much trouble for a comfort-food meal. Of course, it took repeated exposure for me to get burned off this place, so it's perfectly possible to have a good experience here.  As an aside, the ""tater tots"" are good, but they're not what most people are going to be expecting from that name.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The very first restaurant my husband took me to when we moved to nyc in 2009, love it as much now as I did then. Food is amazing, service is wonderful. Ambiance is very sexy and ""NYC"". Truly one of my absolute favorites. Service is great and they have a sense of humor. i've spent a lot of wonderful, special nights with good friends here over the years. Truly a special place with excellent food, wine and cocktails!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Even though they were closing shortly after we arrived the service was friendly and efficient which I always appreciate.   There is something about their hummus that is to die for; plenty of roasted garlic and perfectly nutty and smooth chickpeas purreed into creamy perfection. The atmosphere felt very warm and cozy, which made me feel at home. There was a recipe box next to our table with old cut out newspaper recipes.   Charming and delicious.","[0.0, 1.0]"
