"Uuuuuuugh, who the hell knows what i was fed that night because it sure as hell wasnt a 4star rating. Maybe if you rate based on price, but it has to be a combination of everything. Walked in here late one night, since its right next to the station, hoping to eat delicious shawarmas, i was wrong. It was filled with this salty cabbage mix - no bueno. After gutting out half of the cabbage I tried the thing, it was salty cold bread. I couldnt finish it, and believe me, i am not a diva eater. I threw half of it away, and so did my 2 starving friends. Not only that, but my friend bought a drink and one of the employees got out from around the serving bar to make sure he was getting the canned coke and not the bottled one (one guy told his friend something in another language and motioned over to my friend). I dont think we looked shady, i hope not, i hope we didnt look like we were looking to rip them off with 35 cent bottle difference after 3 people had bought and paid for full meals. Anyway, ive only been there once, might have been a bad night, might have been a full moon, who knows, but one visit is all it takes to not go back, theres a ton of food around there - including pizza around the corner that was pretty good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"hurray habana outpost! i give five stars with no reservations to this place.  love the $2 beers, the killer mojitos and margaritas, sitting outside, etc etc.  food is fine but i come here to drink with pals on a warm night.   and awesomest of all is their rainwater catchment system, composting, biodegradable utensils and other green features.  hopefully this place will serve as a model for other restaurants to operate more sustainably... the only bummer is that i always think to come here on a tuesday when they happen to be CLOSED.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Unbelievable. I've been following Daniel Delaney for a while and was impressed that he  created BrisketLabs - pop up events to test his brisket recipes. He succeeded: he came up with the best tasting brisket and pork ribs I've ever had in my life. It was melting in my mouth, with the right smokiness that you can only find in Texas. Heavenly. I had an amazing cole slaw side, I don't know what spices he put in there, but it was absolutely delicious. Besides that, the interior is simple, elegant, and relaxed, and Dan is the most charming host you can imagine. And the band added the right atmosphere. The whole restaurant was a great experience, cozy, delicious, fun. I will become a regular.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place may seem like a hole in the wall in the middle of Chinatown, but it's always packed.  And there's good reason because the food is good and cheap.  Two favorites of a Chinese person.  When you see a packed Chinese restaurant full of black haired yellow-skinned people, you've come to the right place.  Just to warn you, if you have a small party, you'll probably be sharing your table with another small party.   It was also a pretty long wait during the dinner rush.   The main attraction here is the Xiao Long Bao.  Their Chinese dumplings are filled with pork and crab meat wrapped in a thin wrapping.  The Xiao Long Bao is traditionally filled with pork.  The key thing to look for Xiao Long Bao is a thin wrapping, flavorful fillings, and each dumpling comes with a mouthful of soup.  Joe's Shanghai possesses all 3.  I took one big bite of the dumping and soup fills my mouth with aromatic goodness.   The taste here is a lot heavier than the Ding Tai Fung xiao bao long from the filling and wrapping.  I personally think Ding Tai Fung's is a bit better, but Joe's Shanghai still produces quality food.   The side comes with a traditional mixture of black vinegar and ginger for dipping.   Besides the xiao long bao, this place serves many local favorites typically seen in Shanghai such as hot and sour soup, sweet pancakes, and onion pancakes, and won ton soup.  Some dishes we've tried.  All were classically delicious and oily as expected.   The food is delicious, but with all delicious Chinese food be prepared for extra oil and grease.     You're not going to find ambience or that great of a service, but that's ok because there's good cheap food.   Tip:  bring cash","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Awful service - go somewhere else! I have been to Juniper before so I knew that it takes them a long time to make a burger.  Despite that I decided to get takeout yesterday - ordered 2 cheeseburgers with fries - so we wouldn't have to sit there for a long time just waiting.  The woman on the phone tells me it will be 25 to 30 minutes.  Not great but at least we can do other things in the meantime because it is takeout.  I go to pick up the food 35 minutes after I called, meaning I gave them an extra 5 minutes, and the woman tells me the food isn't ready yet! After about 5 more minutes it was ready.  That's a total of 40 minutes for two burgers, and there were no customers at all in the place when I arrived.  What were they doing for 40 minutes? In all fairness my burger was very good, but not worth a 40 minute wait, so I will never go there again...especially since there are other good places right on Berry St just a few doors away.  There are literally two places to get a good burger right down the street.  If you want mac and cheese I recommend the new place on Norman Avenue (delivery).  And if you want barbeque try Fette Sau. Oh, and the prices on their menu pages listing are all $1 less than what they actually charge.   My advice, avoid this place, especially if you have to be somewhere afterwards and time is an important factor.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ah, Eataly. The holy mecca of all things Italian located in New York City. Eataly is one of my favorite destinations in New York. Located on 23rd and Park by the Flatiron, Eataly is a massive portal of Italian food counters, delis, supermarkets, and numerous restaurants. The first time I walked into Eataly (before knowing anything about it) I walked into the entrance where they serve gelato. Completely naive, I started wandering towards the back as I saw swarms of people, wondering what on earth they were all doing, in what I seemingly thought was a tiny gelateria. As I continued to walk back, and the space continued to open up, and I saw more people, and the noise volume grew. I felt like a little kid in the M&M store in Times Square. The NY Eataly is designed after the superstore located in Turin, Italy. Eataly offers a bakery, a butcher counter, seafood, fresh pasta, dry pasta, every cheese under the sun, hundreds of olive oils and vinegars, a massive selection of dairy, fresh produce, and so much more... In addition to the markets and counters, there are 7 restaurants in Eataly. Yes, seven. Each of the restaurants are located next to the fresh market that provides its ingredients. I have had the glorious pleasure to have eaten at La Pizza & Pasta, and Birreria. Kyle and I went on a Saturday to La Pizza & Pasta and waited for about an hour. The plus side to the wait is you can walk around and explore (and spend money on imported Italian goods). It's bustling with people, a bit cramped, but the smell alone, of the authentic Italian flavors and fresh buffalo mozzarella melting onto the pizza in the oven nearby, makes it all worth it. We started out with wine, served with fresh bread from the bakery and olive oil, a deep golden yellow, almost green. The greener the oil, the better the oil. The olive oil at Eataly is phenomenal--fruity, a bit salty with an overall deep, earthy flavor. The bread is served in a paper sleeve, piping hot out of the oven. We started with the San Marzano pizza- a Margherita pizza. Authentic. Simple. The cheese is fresh and creamy, drizzled with their olive oil, and the crust is buttery, slightly crispy and not too chewy. It sent me right back to Florence. The pies ranges from $9 to $18 - surprisingly reasonably priced, and great for sharing. We then couldn't resist trying another pie (oops) and ordered the Quattro Formagio (my favorite while in Italy, so I had to try it here). With mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmigiano, and cacio cavallo, this pizza is something that I cannot even try to describe. You've got to go and try it for yourself.  Two pies are perfect for two hungry people (with maybe a few leftover slices that will be great thrown in the oven the next day). My second experience at Eataly, was with my friends Liz, Gaby and Jules. Birreria is Eataly's rooftop restaurant, specializing in house-brewed beer and Italian food with a twist. It was a warm summer night, getting closer to Fall. There was a slight cool breeze making it enjoyable outdoor dining. The rooftop looks out onto Flatiron and all the tall buildings surrounding Madison Square Park.  We started with the Formaggi sample (you can choose either 3, 5 or 7 of the cheeses) for our first appetizer. We of course choose the sampler of 7, for the 4 of us to share. The plate arrived with Ricotta, Parmigiano, Asiago, Robiola Bosina, Tallegio, and Gorgonzola. Each one is unique. Served with hot bread, oil and honey, it's the perfect appetizer to share! We also ordered the meat plate (deep apologies for not having a picture, it was devoured quickly) to accompany the cheese, which included a sampling of Speck, Sopressata, Mortadella, Cacciatorini, and Coppa. The Sopressata and Cacciatorini were my favorite. My other favorite at Birreria (and also one of my favorite appetizers of all time) are the Shiitake Fritti Con Salvia. I intensely crave this appetizer regularly. Whoever thought of deep frying mushrooms was an absolute genius, and I'd like to personally meet them and thank them myself. A heaping portion of hot, fried shittake mushrooms with sage. Perfectly crispy, crunchy and salty, with the warm, tonal flavors of the mushrooms. Last, we ordered the Pork Shoulder, braised with their homemade beer, celery, local apples, and mustard vinaigrette. Creamy, tender, and flavorful. Birreria is perfect for any occasion with anyone. Delicious food and fantastic beer. The beer I got was a special, that I can longer find on the menu. It was slightly hoppy, with delicious summer flavors of apple and pear. Eataly is sure to thoroughly impress anyone you take. I recommend La Pizza & Pasta for a weekend lunch, and Birreria for dinner. It's an epic experience you don't want to miss. Also, if you're wondering, Eataly also has a bookstore and offers food classes.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Bouley has officially been on my recommended list since I discovered their lunch $55 for 5 course deal. I know there are plenty of fine dining options in the city and you can blow the money and be fancy, with mediocre food and service. That make Bouley stands out with impeccable services, mind-blowing food and you still can walk out from the restaurant with a fat wallet. I chose Bouley to take my Taiwanese friends who were shortly visiting in town to show the glamorous of manhattan fine dinning. Decor:4.5/5 What's the smell? Wow there is an apple wall foyer welcoming customers while walking in. Feeling that you have arrived at a gracious French farm with loyal Baroque red velvet pride. Crystal chandeliers with pears,apples and grapes pendants. You will find your girlfriend lost herself in the powder room taking selfies , or lost herself in the hall way still taking selfie with beautiful wall mirrors. Service: 4.5/5 Impeccable is not enough to describe. , our waitress elaborates to introduce the ingredients, the gentlemen who serves bread cart always walking by to cut some pieces of freshly made bread to customers. Utensils are replaced after every dish. Swiftly fold your napkins if you walk away to the washroom and help you to seat again after you come back. You can feel everyone here work with passion to serve their customers. Food:4.7/5 Amuse bouche - How can a piece of white mouse black truffles canape be so savory? Open up your taste bud and mind, a journey of flavor has begun. Warm porcini flan with Alaska carb and black truffles- great news for those folks hating to take the carb meats with their sharp teeth! Fluffy carb meats with black truffles. Amazing combination that making you feel sad for the last bite. Wild Alaskan salmon - You can chew it slightly and it starts melting in your mouth. Chill coconut soup with coconut ice cream- Love the freshness of coconut and the ice cream is perfectly sweet! At the end of meal, we received a tower of sweets and chocolates in stead of petit four!!! The cute little tower bought my heart right away. One the way out each of us received a big cake as take home gift.  Bouley. Why you only crowned with one star Michelin？I defiantly will take more friends back to visit you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yes, it IS small, but don't let that fool you.  The food is amazing, the place is cozy and comfortable...very laid back.  And they were able to accommodate our party of six on a Saturday night (NOTE:  arrive at 6:00.  Unfashionable, maybe, but it's the only time to score a sitting for a large party.)  The hostess was very welcoming, and let us sit and wait for two latecomers even though she informed us the policy was not seating incomplete parties.   We knew about the BYOB and cash-only policy before we came (and BYOB was one of the main reasons for choosing Tartine) so there were no awkward surprises.  We were all very, very appreciative of the informal-but-attentive service (water bottles replaced as soon as they were emptied), even when the room filled up and things became rushed (for the staff, not for the diners).   The food?  Outstanding.  Fresh, beautifully presented, thoughtfully prepared with excellent ingredients...a quality and standard not expected from the size and vibe of this place.  Pacing was perfect; our starters arrived soon after we ordered, and everyone was served at the same time, but there was no rush for us to finish before entrees came.  We all ordered from the regular menu and we all enjoyed everything (there was much sharing of plates).   Will definitely go again (not in a party of six...this was a 30th birthday celebration), and again, and again, even if we have to wait for a table on another visit.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"no wait at 8:15 on a thursday evening for a party of two, although two groups of four had to wait.  the inside is cozy, to put it diplomatically.  get ready for your neighbors to know whatever intimate details you spill.   no doubt the biggest draw of this place is that it's BYOB, because the food is a bit expensive for what it is.  entrees are all in the $17 - $22 range, and none of it is very interesting (e.g., $17 for some chicken and french fries).  but when you average it out over what you would save on a markup on the wine, it's downright affordable.   we split a beet and watercress salad ($8.50), and my friend had the onion soup ($7) and escargot ($9), and i had the indian curry mussels with frites ($18).  nothing was amazing, but everything was solid (except for the salad-- i don't like surprise ingredients and our lovely beet and watercress salad with bleu d'auvergne also came with tomatoes and corn-- weird).  the frites were excellent.  we lingered over one of the giant chocolate macarons and second bottle of wine.  the pastries all looked very respectable.  i think if i were to come back, it would be late at night, just to enjoy a bottle of wine and some dessert.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I never made it to SHO, so when I read that Shaun Hergatt was opening a new place, I was excited.  My partner and I went last Thursday, 8/22. Yes, it's a splurge:  4 courses for $90, 6 for $120, and the tasting menu for $180, but well worth it. The space is quiet, elegant and restrained.  The decor is not perfect, but it is very nice.  I very much like the menu format: with the 4 and 6 course meals, you can create your own meal: there are 5 categories: cold apps, hot apps, fish, meat and dessert - with 3 choices each, and you can chose any of the 15 for each course - great flexibility. (I use a 3 star rating system for each course, based on the Michelin restaurant rating system)   They served 3 amuses: a carrot tulle with goat cheese - **, a corn chowder custard - ***, and a wild mushroom ragout (or something) - **/***, all excellent - and they gave us 2 of each, so fortunately, ghw912's experience was not repeated here. summer squash - langoustine - naval orange reduction - marigold:  ** (out of ***) Three well-sized Langoustine in a squash puree. The meat and sauce were very delicate and lively.  I think the citrus notes were a little strong, and some of the meat was just slightly soft - overcooked I think. Still, quite wonderful. satur farms toy box tomatoes - bush basil - tomato gelée - blue basil flowers - * My partner's dish - I only had a taste.  We are both familiar with Satur Farms' produce, and we both felt that this was tasty, but not at the level it should be - the tomatoes ARE the dish, and they were good, but not overwhelming with flavor like great heirlooms or Satur at their best. potato fondant - black bass - flourless gnocchi - curls - truffle sabayon: *** Just fabulous. This was laid out like a village with the Bass at the center. Each element was great, and the combination of flavors when I took bites together was sublime.  The bass was done perfectly - light but rich in flavor with succulent skin. The gnocchi were airy with explosive chive flavor, and the sabayon was transcendent. My only issue was that there were fennel buds on top of some components, and I hate fennel, but I easily took them off and put them to the side. I think their flavor was too strong for the dish anyway. purple artichokes - ravioli - sylvetta arugula - pinenuts: ** My partner's dish. I have a food aversion to artichokes, but I can eat them occasionally if they are done exceptionally well, as they were here.  Substantial artichoke ravioli. My Partner was thrilled with these and rightly so - great texture and flavor - light with a nice chewiness in the filling and a great juxtaposition between the dough and the inside.   anise hyssop - grimaud duck - chef's garden candy beets - hibiscus jus: *** When I took a bite of the duck, it was so rich and flavorful (and I eat A LOT of duck) that I actually said 'WOW' out loud.  Juicy and rich, but firm.  I was worried about the anise hyssop, but it was delicious and spicy,  adding some rough texture to the creamy duck and an earthiness/vegetal/spiciness.  The Beets were ok, and the jus was like a sweet, super-concentrated gravy - divine.  Overall, one of the best duck dishes I have ever had. peaches and cream - cucumber - basil: ** This was my dessert. It was a dollop of peach ice cream on a layer of basil ice, I think - with cucumber yogurt mixed with peaches underneath.  To be honest, this wasn't my exact style of dessert, with the yogurt and vegetal aspects, but it was so complex and tasty that it won me over.  So many different textures and flavors combining. Frozen meringue - lemon - blueberry - sage: *** My partner's dessert.  Wow, just wow.  Now THIS is my type of dessert. After a few bites, I told K that she better take it back or I would finish it.  The richness and sweetness of the light meringue were offset by the crisp and tart of the fruit, and the herbal essence of the sage.  K referred to it as a 'deconstructed pavlova' and I think that is right on.   The petite fours were black mission fig beignets - ***, beet tulle - */**, anise leaves in chocolate - *, and nougat with celery salt - ***.  The beignets were some of the best things we have eaten in the last year, and the nougat with celery salt was a crazy but brilliant combination that worked perfectly. Overall, the food was delicate, complex, focused, somewhat innovative, and delicious.  As you can see from my ratings, there were a number of high notes, and the mean was consistent enough to categorize it as great. The service was very good, still finding its groove in places, but our primary server (Jason, I believe) was so good, spectacular actually, that I give the service the highest marks.  The wine list is small, seasonal, and focused on solid boutique producers.  I had a glass each of Riesling, Morgon VV, and Moscato D'Asti - all very good and reasonably priced.  Overall, I would say that Juni is a welcome addition to the top tier restaurants in NYC, and I look to going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Meatballs are middle of the road. Baby Jesus Cake was very good. Service could have been better. David? Nice guy, but acted a little bit unprofessional with us. If a guy brings a girl to your restaurant make sure you make an effort to not give the girl too much attention. It makes the experience awkward, which is just what happened.

"Eataly is obviously a great restaurant and grocery shopping place, but I had one unfortunate episode there. On a week night, the place was going to close in about thirty minutes, it was aound 10:30 pm, and I was checking out some grocery items I had purchased in the front part of the store. I was instructed to place the items on the counter (the front section), which I did, and abruptly the two front cashiers (one of them was a female supervisor) became rude to me, saying that ""it is not the right place for such heavy items"". They were argumentative and sort of arrogant. Actually there was no sign stating the contrary, and I had purchased similar items and checked them out at same counter before. I thought, these people showed no concern for my loyalty as a customer, and offered no other option for me to check out the items that I had purchased. It was late, and I was completely left on my own, I scrambled around and got lucky that another counter was still opened in the back section of the store ( close to 23rd street). That cashier was actually nice and helpful!The place itself is terrific, but hiring the wrong people will tarnish its reputation.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Walter Foods is a neighborhood standby and they've never really done me wrong, but last night's dinner is worth a special mention. All of the food was delicious and the addition of the cranberry beans is very welcome. All that said, the BEST thing about dinner was Laura, our server. I'm not exaggerating when I say that there is nothing (within reason) Laura could have done differently or better to have improved our dining experience last night. She made me feel as welcome, comfortable, and un-pressured as any server I've ever had. This isn't to say that the rest of the staff is inferior; I've never had a bad experience at Walter. It's just that Laura elevated the dining experience to a level that I just don't generally expect. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more comfortable, welcoming environment in Williamsburg than the one that Walter Foods creates, in great part by hiring people like Laura.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As I was planning my next trip to NYC it dawned on me that I hadn't yet reviewed one of my favorite places in the city! First, I come here because it's cozy, warm (love it in the winter) and the people are super friendly. The really great food is secondary. I've only had the grilled cheese here, but I dare you to find better grilled cheese in all of Manhattan. It's delicious! I also love their draft beer. Beer and cheese. As god intended. They have an extensive menu, you'll have a hard time choosing. Bring friends. Again, the ambiance is what does it for me. It's never too, too crowded, but it's a sort of, kind of small space so I wouldn't suggest going at peak times.

"You get what you pay for. The $48  prix fixe menu is well priced and was thoughtfully composed, but was a total let down in execution. Delaware and Hudson was just ""meh"". I don't know who got paid, but Michelin Star quality this is not.The ambiance was pretty sterile as well. There is no bar in the restaurant, so you really feel like you are in someone's old dining room with walls that have been painted over one too many times and decorated with garage sale specials (and not the cool vintage kind. More like the stuff people put in the boxes marked ""free""). On a positive note, the staff is very friendly (if not a bit overbearing with how they stand around on the floor of the dining room). Maybe that wasn't as positive as I intended for it to be... In closing (if you have made it this far in the review), I want to be proven wrong about this place, but I don't think I would waste another dining experience when there are so many other great places in Williamsburg.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Thanks for the many great reviews by your Yelpers that helped  me decide to try this restaurant during a recent visit to New York.  Picolo Angolo is a wonderfully warm atmosphere and great food.  Come hungry, because there are many delicious items to select from.  The owners personal touch is what makes this  such a special place.

We are from Toronto with a love from smoked food. We smoke our own so we know what it's supposed to taste like.  We were taken aback by the huge lineup but then decided that was a good thing.  It must be good if people will lineup this long.  We weren't disappointed.  The smoked brisket was perfect with a proper pink ring from the smoke. The chicken was very tender and moist. Best pulled pork I've ever tried.  Also tried the baked beans with burnt ends and it was as good as my own.  Also tried the edamame succotash and enjoyed that as well. The prices were reasonable. I think it's safe to say everything here is great.  Blows away every BBQ restaurant in Toronto.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I hate this place. This is one of those places where the atmosphere totally ruins it for me. I usually find it annoying when people complain about food not being ""authentic"" (that's not really a negative by itself; it just means it's a different/new category of food) but I'm sorry, ramen is cheap drunk food. I shouldn't have to wait an hour in a pretentious nightclub atmosphere for the privilege of buying a $15 bowl. It doesn't help that the hostesses are all the snotty, bored-looking type, who never seem to do anything but ignore customers despite the fact that there always seems to be at three of them. Thankfully, once you're actually seated, the staff is your typical friendly, polite, boisterous type, through your tolerance may vary on suffering skinny white dudes shouting ""Irrasyaimase."" Admittedly, the ramen is pretty good here, if overrated. I prefer a slightly thicker, chewier noodle, and thin pork slices rather than the big chunks they use here, but that's just personal preference. The broth is generally pretty good. The main ""modern"" or ""classic"" ramen flavors seem to be the way to go here; I tried the shoyu duck once and found it thoroughly plain and unimpressive. I grudgingly admit that the steamed pork buns are among the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life. Worth dealing with all the annoyances that comes with eating here, at least occasionally. All in all though, I'd rather go to the at-least-as-good Kambi for my ramen fix.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Groupon deal made this place more than worth it. I came twice with my boyfriend. 1st time entree: Salmon which my boyfriend said was really good. I had the chicken penne vodka which was absolutely fantastic! It was really good and I seriously couldn't finish it all. Dessert: The tiramisu was just okay. It had this powder on top that made us choke whenever we had a bite. Although comical as heck, it wasn't the ideal dessert for a cute date. 2nd time entree: We both had the Burgers with seasoned fries which were so good!!! They were HUGE burgers and seriously filled us up. The seasoned fries are a whole lot of YES so I highly recommend paying a bit more for those. Dessert: The Canolis were pretty good. It came with 2 small Canolis. Overall I love coming here and would recommend it to everyone. The waiters are friendly but aren't as attentive as I'd like.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This Westville location has really good food and I was impressed by it. The food alone is worth coming back for. However, I am deducting two stars for rushed service on a Saturday night. I came here with my friend on Saturday November 1st. We arrived around 6 pm and didn't have to wait long for a table. Once we were seated, my friend and I ordered a drink. About five minutes later, the waitress was already asking us what we wanted to order even though it was clear that we still hadn't decided yet. The food arrived quickly, which was great. I ordered the tempeh salmon special and was very happy with it. My friend was happy with her meal as well. Portions were large, which is a plus. However, within a couple of seconds of finishing, the staff was already clearing our plates (my friend and I ate within 10 minutes).  When the waitress checked in, she didn't offer us dessert or any more drinks. After a couple of minutes, she returned and asked if we were ready for the check. My friend and I then decided to just go somewhere else for more drinks and dessert. We felt incredibly rushed by the waitress and the other staff. While I do understand that it gets busy on a Saturday night and Westville isn't the biggest restaurant around, we were literally there for only 25 minutes. I definitely don't recommend Westville if you're looking to have a relaxing atmosphere where you can catch up with a friend and not feel rushed. Definitely not impressed with the type of service we received.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cafecito is an inviting, warm and casual little restaurant on Avenue C that delivers tasty Cuban food for a fair price. When date and I arrived last Saturday night for a late dinner, the place was packed but we were greeted at the door with a smile and led to a great table. While our waitress wasn't overly friendly, she got the job done. We skipped apps and went straight for the main courses -- churrasco steak (a nice cut of skirt skirt served with rice, beans and tasty fried plaintains) and the fish of the day (striped bass served with rice, platanos and a white garlicky sauce). Both meals were delicious. My only qualm is the cash-only policy -- man that really bugs me but what can you do?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great food and ambiance. It has a very rustic style that seems to be inspired by their muse, bacon. I had the Bacon Torta, which was flavorful but had too many flavors. I feel that a lot of great flavors were squished by the bacon. But then again is that a bad thing? I also had the Cobb Salad. Now if you are tired of ordering a Cobb Salad of which contains scarcely any bacon then come here. The portion is relatively perfect for the price. Finally the Open Face Bacon Chicken Sandwich wasn't much of a sandwich but I haven't seen that much chicken on a plate in years. Now my pet peeve is that the rims of my glass were salty. Now if that is a shtick then fine but if not.......well I will still live. My next meal to conquer is the Lobster Loves Bacon Mac and Cheese. Now tell me that doesn't sound good and you are nuts.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"1 star for the location. 2 stars for the short wait we had upon arrival even with reservations. 3 stars for the charming Argentinean waitress who squealed with delight when we told her we are big foodies and planned to order copious amounts of food and wine. 4 stars for the manager/owner ensuring our pleasure levels remained high (offered us a free wine tasting along with two free glasses of wine while we waiting for our table). 5 stars for the OUTSTANDING food. I have similar comments as other 4 & 5 star raters here about the food and ambiance so I'll skip over that commentary. An absolute MUST to try is the grilled octopus.  It is simply fantastic!  Any time I see grilled octopus on the menu, I go for it.  I am usually disappointed with the rubbery, small invertebrates that are served to me but this one was sublime.  No exaggeration. Also, I am no huge fan of Malbec, but the Pannunzio 2010 had a rich, smooth, and fruity (though not acidic) taste.  It paired perfectly with the food we ordered and I will be sure to purchase this wine to keep at home.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Update: Since I posted this review earlier today, the owner contacted me, which I very much appreciated. Like I said below, the staff are very friendly and they want to give you a great experience in their restaurant. To be fair, my coffee/price issues aside, I would try this place again, maybe for dinner since I already had brunch there and it seems dinner has received good reviews. The food was good and the environment was very warm and friendly. I really hope they succeed, since it's clear they value their customers. (Why am I even on Yelp at 11:40pm on a Friday night? Because I can't sleep knowing that I gave a bad review to people who are genuinely nice and deserve better than my pre-lunch hunger-fueled negative review. Oh, and a lifetime of Catholic-infused guilt.) Like so many earnest new restaurants, they try. They really try. And like my husband who tries to make the bed or put away the dishes..... it's a sweet gesture, but oh, look at you! You have thumbs and you're trying to use them. Like people! As my mom would say, god love 'em. Anyway, I came here for brunch a few weeks with a group of 6. I wanted to see if the new occupiers of the old Dubuque space would do them any justice. Nope. Food was good, not great. I would go back there again IF they didn't supremely annoy me with the fact that there are neither prices nor basic descriptions on the brunch menu. And THEY CHARGE FOR COFFEE BY THE CUP and nowhere on the menu do they indicate that. In fact, my friend asked the waitress (who I think might also have been the owner perhaps) ""Is this fancy coffee?"". Any person with a niblet-sized amount of social skills would interpret this is as ""Did you have to use an espresso machine or anything other than a regular drip machine to make this coffee and therefore it would be charged per cup?"". She said no, it was regular coffee. And when other wait staff came around to ask if we wanted more coffee, they never said, Oh by the way, that's going to be $2.50 for another cup of coffee. Between the 6 of us, we had about 12 or 13 cups of coffee. When we got the bill we were dumbfounded. And for some weird reason, we had three of those coffees comped. Maybe because they realized how stupid it is to charge by the cup and not tell their patrons? But not quite stupid enough to comp all but the first six cups? At that point I didn't really care that my huevos rancheros was actually pretty decent, a lot better than most places that end up making dog breakfasts out of it. I don't want to give this place two stars. I wish I could give it five, since everyone was very friendly and they clearly were trying to give us a great experience. But come ON! List your brunch prices, make it clear that you charge per cup, and give us a description beyond ""tacos"". Because I can imagine a lot of different tacos.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"5 stars for the incredible service, 3.5 stars for the food. Service: We arrived around 10:30 and got seated immediately. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. Gave us water whenever we needed more water -- and fast. At the end when we were paying the bill, she was very accommodating to our need to split the bill. It was quite complicated but she seemed happy to help us no matter what. Gave her a big tip! Food: Just average. I got the frittata. The pesto sauce was pretty good but the eggs themselves seemed a little bland. My friends got the Huervo Rancheros -- it was quite a big plate. I got a taste of it and it was filled with flavor. We all finished our food and licked our plates clean. The appetizer we got was some crab thing. Don't get it -- totally not worth the money we paid.

Are we suppose to cook it in plain water? -why do I need to tip a acceptable amount.  I mean what service am I getting here?  All they do is enter your order on a tablet and bring it to your table.  I'm doing all the cooking.

"So my husband and I on our honeymoon decided to go to NYC as our trip! We were really excited and made a list of ""to-do's"". Lombardi's happened to be one of them.  On our last night of NYC we thought a pizza was a great night to top off our NYC experience. We took a cab and spent $20 to get there. We walked in and were sat almost right away. We walked through the kitchen area which I thought was kinda cool and were seated.  We attempted to order the clam pie but they had run out. So we went with the margherita and half meatballs. And drinks of RC and iced tea.   Now, my husband had mentioned as we were sitting and waiting for pizza that for the ""first pizzeria"" in the country, they decor seems to be very generic every where else pizza joint. Same red and white table cloths, same pictures on the walls.  We even noticed that they don't serve pizza at the bar? What? Why not? It would be good for solos who want just a slice or two since I also noticed that they only sell them by the pie. Our food came and it was good.  It was okay. The crust was nice, crispy and sturdy, but overall bland. Maybe I put too much of the hype that I heard about this place and just ended up saying ""meh"" to the pizza. So we asked for our check. Fifteen minutes it took to ask for our check and get change. FIFTEEN minutes! Are you kidding me?!?!?!? So my husband and I sat there watching the clock for 15 minutes while we were thirsty as refills were not available nor were we served water to wait. So when the change finally showed up, I didn't want it to be unsaid so I told the waitress what's the deal is with 15 minutes to ask for check and get change. It's not like there were lines out the door. She basically gave an unapologetic ""sorry"" while looking around trying to get out of the conversation.  WTF???? What kind of service is that? Really? You are the face of your establishment and you should look someone in the eye and be sincere about what happened. Look, I generally don't complain much about this industry. Being a waitress is hard. I'm a GM at an Irish Pub in California, but if I found out one of my staff treated a customer with that much disregard, I would have a very long unfortunate conversation with said employee. I was always taught that the staff are the front face of the company - No matter how horrible your day or life is, you put a smile on your face and if you make a mistake, own it be sincere and make up for it any way you can or you'll end up with an unfortunate yelp and a unhappy customer for life who will probably tell everyone else they know never to go there because of their own experience. So pizza okay - service not so much.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"When I walked into the door of Distilled I said I had a reservation & they automatically walked us to our table. Now that's what I call care. We got to our table & were given garlic & curry flavored popcorn on the house. It was packed, but not so packed that you had to yell loudly for someone to hear you.Within another 5 minutes the waitress came back to ask if we were ready! I liked this because they didn't take a lot of time to take our order. You get annoyed and leave if they don't pay attention to you. I waited for my guest to come back from the restroom before I ordered their cauliflower & coconut soup and steak tartar to start.     I was informed by my guest that a different waitress, not serving our table, said I was cute while I was in the restroom. That was nice. When we got our appetizers we ate it all up. DELISH!!! While we were in the middle of eating I was told the chef invited me to the counter to chat. THE CHEF! No restaurant does that. It's very welcoming! I got his autograph & had an awesome time with Chef Shane. I ordered the mussels with spicy sausage as an entree.............       THEY WERE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I tried my guest's ""Country Fried Duck & Waffles"" and it was good too, but the waffle could have been crisper. The mussels were a little bit too spicy for my taste, but my guest loved the flavor. I ordered the s'mores that were divided into chocolate with chili mousse, graham cracker, whipped & toasted marshmallow, and vanilla ice cream. I was given my dessert in minutes and the spicy chocolate mousse was good, but, again, had a little bit too much spice for me. I ordered the lemon/lime sorbet and loved it. I loved the idea of the dried sugared lime zests. Altogether, I suggest DISTILLED for any occasion!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I got a tossed green salad to start and that could have been more than half of my meal.  I also got the steakburger which was enormous and just ok.  I had to get the cheesecake since they're famous for it and it didn't disappoint.  It was definitely rich and I wish I hadn't eaten so much beforehand so I could have really enjoyed it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went there for the first time for an early Friday night dinner. The restaurant itself is very unassuming from the outside and the location is hidden - it's tucked away on Hicks St right next to the BQE. I passed it by chance when I walking to Red Hook from Cobble Hill, and I would've never noticed it except I decided to walk on Hicks Street. We got there at 7PM and if was already getting crowded. Had delicious whole Branzino with fried oysters. I can honestly say it's probably one of my best dining experiences I've had in Brooklyn (food and service.) Compliments to the chef! Very nice waiter - attentive and friendly and the seafood was excellent. Decor added to the experience - it was very eclectic and rustic - lots of different decorations of fish. I will definitely come back! At LEAST once a month!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Bare Burger on 35th and 3rd; words cannot describe my feelings for this restaurant. As you approach the restaurant from the outside, all you see is this plastic make-shift hut coming out of the building, marking the entrance to a magical world beyond. Open the primary door to find another, heavier, glass door and enter. The lighting sets a natural glow upon the restored wood (collected after disasters), used to create an organic feel to an otherwise naked brick wall. The tables are of a sweet amber honey wood slab from which a cylinder of metal is attached at the bottom, connecting it to the floor. The tables are righteously equipped with all organic condiments and the menu boasts a wide range of meats all organic and free-range. Aside from the impressively fresh, quality of the food, the setting is just homey and quaint. The service is friendly and the energy is all around positive. I've had many a burger in my life; traveling through the serpentines at shake shack and the speedy service of five guys, but no where in my travels for the most perfect burger have I ever come across a creation such as the one found at bare burger. The zest, and the strikingly fresh ingredients, all but augmented to my amazing burger. The wide variety of even the type of bread made my burger seem all the more tailored to me which made eating it, all the more delightful. One bite into your food and you feel as if the heavens beacon to you; the burger caresses your taste buds and assures them that all will be fine. It is a door to a new world of burgers, a new race, and a new standard for burgers all together and such is the bare truth. The burger transcended upon me like a message from above in the form of the godliest food I have ever experienced. The occurrence was so magical that I was almost drawn to tears at the delicate nature of the refined taste. I recommend this experience for all those looking to change their opinions of burgers. Note: Bare Burger even accompanies the vegans and vegetarians in the same manner as the carnivores; so everyone can enjoy the glory that is Bare Burger. WARNING: not for the faint-hearted, or those who cannot stomach the taste of Jesus in a blender.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've never given a restaurant a bad public review, but the experience I had at this one was so frustrating I felt like I had to share so that others don't find themselves in a similar situation. We knew we'd be arriving with a large group, so we called in advance to make a reservation and to ensure that we'd be able to order from the restaurant week menu. We came on a Monday night with the expectation that it would be easier to service ag group of that size on a Monday. When we made a reservation, we let them know we'd have a party of 11 or 12, and they accepted the reservation with no qualifications. When we arrived, we immediately told the hostess that we were a party of 12. Only once we were all seated at the table (which had only been set for 11) and ready to order drinks were we informed that we couldn't order off of the restaurant week menu because we were a party of 11, not 12. Again, we'd made a reservation in advance and weren't notified of this potential issue. Instead, we were told we'd have to order off of the traditional menu, which would have essentially doubled the cost per person. The manager absolutely refused to work with us. We offered a number of solutions, including splitting into two tables, having some of us order off the regular menu so others could order off the restaurant week menu, or even having some of us only order drinks. She kept telling us she couldn't make the call that we could add one additional person, but she also flatly refused to call anyone who might be able to make that decision. The end result is that, after attempting to develop a number of compromises, our party of 12 left the restaurant and had a delightful experience spending our money at Wine:30. It was the most frustrating New York restaurant experience that I've ever had, and I will never go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The way I look at pizza is forever changed. Spumoni gardens, where have you been all my life? After an afternoon at smorgasburg we decided to continue the party and get what my friend claimed was ""the best pizza in all of America"". I was kinda hoping he was right and it wasn't just over hyped. The place itself is cute for summer months. It was the first warm day in a while, so being able to sit outdoors was super nice. I had a square slice. My God, was this pizza good. Thick, perfect dough with just enough cheese topped with perfect sauce. I am in love. I can't explain just how good it was in words. I did say it would be worth the hour drive from home for a slice of that heavenly pie. I love you spumoni gardens. I regret not taking a slice to go,  a half hour after leaving I couldn't help but crave  it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Something I will shamefully admit is my smugness while standing on a short line at Juliana's watching the extremely long line at Grimaldi's. Little do they know that Mr. Patsy Grimaldi himself is finding eager patrons their tables 100 feet away. And while the Grimaldi's folk will leave wondering what the fuss was all about and how they possibly waited like an hour for mediocre pizza, the rest of us at Juliana's will scarf down delicious pizza, and leave immensely satisfied, looking forward to their next pie. Sadly, I never tried Grimaldi's before it was bought and moved to its current location on the corner. Thankfully, the pizza gods must have sensed great disturbance in the NY pizza scene and encouraged Patsy Grimaldi to open a new pizza restaurant, thus restoring order to the universe. All is right again. So, my experience - At 7:30 on a warm Friday night in May, three of us waited for about twenty minutes before being seated. Not too bad, eh? Waiting for the menus did take a while - about 10 minutes - as there were only two waiters. Nevertheless, the restaurant was so packed, it's hard to imagine adding another one to the room. We ordered two large pizzas: one margherita and one heartstopper. The waiter cautioned us that it might be too much food. He said that generally, two people share one large pie, and maybe it might be better if we ordered one small pie instead of two large pies. That was very considerate of him, but thanks, we know our stomachs well. Two large pies? Done, and gone, crust and all, and we still have room for more. One test that countless pizza places fail at, including neighborhood slice joints, is the droopiness test. Lift a slice by the crust without supporting the tip, and see if it falls over. Both of our pizzas passed. I love thin-crusted pizza that can hold itself up without being too thick and doughy, and maintain its crispiness. You don't need to fold, you don't need to cut. Just lift, and take that first, most satisfying bite of the slice. The margherita is top-notch, and a great classic choice if that's what you're craving. The tomato sauce is light and sweet. The mozzarella is fresh, with just the right amount of stringiness. The heartstopper doesn't have tomatoes, but that doesn't make it any less flavorful. It is topped with mozzarella, Scamorza, pancetta, scallions, and truffle oil. The pancetta can get a little too salty, considering how thin the pizza is, but the other toppings, particularly the scallions, help cut the saltiness down. The different cheeses also add another dimension. If you're looking for somewhere less crowded, don't feel like Juliana's can't fit your bill. The Manhattan skyline is just a few steps away, so order a pie to go and eat at the park instead. Perfect date, no?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This was a surprise last minute restaurant choice that turned into a very pleasant one.  I was in the city for the day and my excursion bus dropped us off at a different spot, nowhere near the one originally promised, making my original dinner plans not feasible.  After some frantic searching on Yelp found this place.  I've had Katsu before at other Japanese restaurants but never been to a place devoted to it.  We were the only non-Asians there, generally a good sign.  Décor was nice, although the wood seats are not particularly comfortable, nice jazz music.  Temperature in the restaurant varied widely, when the air conditioner was blowing it was pleasant, when it stopped, the place got hot quickly.  The meals come with pickle and very good miso soup.  The soup had many more vegetables than I'm accustomed to in Miso but I liked it.  They give you seeds in a mortar and pestle and the table and there are three sauces.  Our server was only okay, he never offered any explanations regarding the menu or helped identify the sauces, he also was poor at refilling water glasses.  However, a very nice young woman server came over and was very helpful with explaining the use of the seeds and sauces.  Companion had one of the pork katsus, which comes with cabbage and rice.  He really loved it.  I had the chicken donburi, which is a bowl with rice, onions, your chicken and a fried egg.  I liked but didn't love it, it seemed to be a little lacking in flavor despite the sauce cooked in it.  I had the green tea ice cream for dessert, good and not too overly frozen, companion loved the pumpkin pudding.  We're definitely planning on going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Never had the desire to seek out traditional Polish fare, Until my curiosity of Greenpoint led me here. This was our first foray into Little Warsaw, After many transfers to the G train heading to Nassau. At first I was amused by the odd-looking cozy granny décor. The mounted deer head with ribbons & flowers is something I can't ignore. The brick walls, lace table clothes, & mini lamps give this place a homey feel. The friendly staff made us feel like we're being prepared a home cooked meal. They do serve Polish beer and you can also BYOB. They're kind enough not to charge you a corkage fee. We each had the generously huge Polish platter for $7.50. It came with kielbasa, stuffed cabbage, bigos, potatoes, & pierogies. I liked the pierogies crispy, golden, & fried. I felt the mashed potatoes were a little dry. The bigos (stew of cabbage and meat) had a slightly sour taste. The stuffed cabbage was so huge and filling that it widened my waist. The kielbasa is the most flavorful part of the meal. Ooohhh...I love how each bite makes my taste buds feel. It has a smoky flavor and spiciness to the palate. Its claim of being a top quality and fresh meat is certainly valid. This is not something you get from a Hillshire Farms vacuum pack.

"So after NOT returning to Woorijip for a good year and a half, decided to give it a shot for dinner today. This place has changed a lot throughout the years. I remember back in 2008 when I first moved to New York, it was sort of a cozy little place with a hot food buffet wit hot box displays with pre-packaged food in the middle of the store selling Korean soul food. Seating and selection of food items were quite limited back then, but nevertheless it was a very homey place. In addition, prices were very affordable at that time. A small container of Shrimp Fried Rice used to cost $1.50 (now it has gotten up to $3) and a combo of Spicy Korean Chicken with rice and an egg omelett used to be like $4.50 (now it's around $6). On the bright side, they have somehow expanded the place to offer many more items and accomodate more seats for customers. It also used to be 90% Korean customers most of the time but throughout the years, as Americans and non-Koreans adapt and discover how tasty Korean food is, this place caters to just about anyone: office workers, tourists, students, foreigners, hispanic workers, homeless...JK lol It's so crowded that it seems like a ""Mini-Times Square""  in that small little restaurant. When I came today to grab a quick dinner, I saw that it has turned into something like a Hipster and Tourist Hangout. Hipsters who want to look cool by eating Asian food (YES, Asian food is hip I KNOW) and tourists who probably got lost in Koreatown, too broke to spend money in a sit-down Italian restaurant nearby, or curious to try out a new cuisine. All in all, I do miss the old days when it wasn't this crowded and was a ""homey"" and ""safe"" place for International students as well as Korean workers to grab some home-style Korean food when they were missing it. Guess that's part of globalization and gentrification of Koreatown and NYC as a whole... **CREDIT CARD $10 MINIMUM**","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The fella & I were spoiled to have Bouley as the beginning leg of our trip!  All the meals thereafter (even though delicious in their own light) were competitively compared to our meal at Bouley.  Due to a slight delay of our flight, we had rushed to our hotel to quickly change and rushed back out to Bouley.  We arrived about ten minutes past our reservation, but luckily, just before the kitchen closed.  Initially, we felt a bit rushed with the various servers that came by our tables.  But once we placed our orders, everything was smooth sailing.  We greatly appreciated the amazing and friendly service from the servers even after we had arrived a bit late. The ambiance of Bouley was very romantic with it's candlelit tables, Victorian like chairs, and small vases of fresh picked flowers.  Upon entrance, you definitely feel like you're about to wine and dine!  One very noticeable attribute at Bouley was at the entrance - there are rows and rows of fresh apples shelved on the walls of the entrance.  This gave off a very refreshing scent of autumn apples on a cold Winter night. While deciding what to order for dinner, we were greeted by various servers for different items (one for wine, another for bread, etc).  I highly recommend sampling both the pistachio bread and the one with a touch of anise.  Both are tasty in their own ways!  After glancing over the menu, the fella and I ordered the following: - North Carolina Pink Shrimp & Cape Cod Sea Scallops with Sweet Maine Princess Crab and Point Judith Calamari in an Ocean Herbal Broth: I'm a big fan of scallops, so when I saw this on the menu, I knew I had to give it a try!  Each item was cooked to perfection - just enough to taste the sweet and succulent pieces by the bite.  The shrimp even had a slight crunch!  On top of the natural aroma and flavor of each seafood piece, the herbal broth further enhanced each piece. - Chatham Day Boat Lobster with Brown and White Honshimeji Mushrooms, Passion Fruit & Mango, Fresh Lychee, and Hyssop: My plump lobster was delectable!  I wish I had a stronger palate to further distinguish all the flavors that played in this dish, but all I can say is that it was delicious! - Organic Long Island Duckling with Roasted with Truffle, Honey, Puree of Nevada Organic dates with Turnips, and Julienne of Local Beets: Medium rare duck will change your taste buds forever! I never knew you can have duck medium rare, but it's quite amazing!  Moist and tender on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside, I almost wished that I had ordered the duck instead (and I'm not even a duck fan!) - Pineapple Carpaccio with Ten exotic fruit sorbet: This was a complimentary dessert from the chef.  We had originally ordered the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear with Valrhona Chocolate , Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce with Réglisse Sorbet and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream.  Both desserts were extremely tasty in their own way.  The carpaccio is perfect if you're looking for a light, fresh type of dessert! On top of all the amazing dishes that we tried, we were served addition mini dishes between each course.  Prior to starting our starter, the server brought out this amazing amuse bouche that tantalized my taste buds.  A creamy pumpkin soup with a shy dollop of mascarpone cheese, I was left wanting more!  The star side dish that accompanied our entrees was the puree mashed potatoes.  I have NEVER had mash potatoes as creamy as the one at Bouley.  It was so smooth and lump-less that it could almost be mistaken for butter!!  On top of the soup and puree potatoes, we also received a pre-dessert to our desserts!  A creamy coconut soup with a touch of mango sorbet danced on my tongue, leaving my sweet tooth almost content (ALMOST.)  After we finished our carpaccio and caramelized pear, the fella & I were presented with MORE mini dessert treats!  A tier of macaroons, chocolate covered mint chips, etc. teased my eyes and taste buds.  Amazing!  It was Christmas in my belly! If you're looking to be wined and dined, Bouley is the perfect gentlemen to do so!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It was a special day, my mother's 83rd birthday, a show and dinner in one of NYC finest, or so I thought.  What a disappointment to say the least!! After reading the reviews I was quite secure in my choice, after all who wants a bad experience after a show like Le Miss....but it tuned out to be like a bad dream with a hungry stomach. We made the reservation and confirmed them.  Arrived at the place on time  and they shoved us (literally) In a cramped beyond words space near the bar where if  it was not for the kindness of a couple from Toronto who gave my mother a seat at the bar, we would of left because of serious safety issues. We waited and waited while the place keep getting crowded and crowded, my only ray of hope was.....well the food has to be amazing! another disappointment. Finally we were seated in a table for 5 , my chair was so close to the next table that every time I moved, I elbowed my neighbor in the ribs...after apologizing several times he opted for moving his chair just to find himself in the same predicament with another patron. The noise level was insane, kudos to the staff the works under those conditions, and keep a smile every time. We order the food, it came out quite fast.  I had the Osso Buco,  okay, the price does not justifies the plate or any other plates we had. The waitress was a trooper,  navigating that unhealthy environment with grace and patience! No idea how the fire department has not finde them for allowing so many people in one place. The dessert was good, panna cotta and the coffee perfect.  the only reason I am giving this place two starts is because of the waitress and the staff.   Don't spend your money...go to a place where actually the dinning experience leaves you with a sense of peace and good company.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Totto Ramen is superb! I really like to go to this place. I could eat their noodles every day. I have been there twice and both times the place was packed. Usually I get there just before they open so I can have a lucnh in the first round. Try the tuna sashimi and the tuna with avocado is pretty awesome too.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. This is Danny Meyer at his finest, taking a semi-subterranean space on an offbeat block of midtown south and turning into one of the greatest restaurants in New York City. Maialino gets everything right - from the minute they answer your phone call until after the check drops. Every detail is accounted for, including the perfect crispness of the dazzling sweetbread appetizer, the bright and acidic balance of the house white wines, and the hauntingly chewy perfection of the homemade pastas. For someone like myself who generally avoids Manhattan at all costs, it's refreshing to know that there is still a reason to go there for reasonably-priced special occasions. Maialino has surpassed my expectations time and time again, and I can't wait until the day when I can afford to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place has its high's and low's.  Following the compliment sandwich, I will start with the good first, then go into the bad, and end with a good.  I liked the service here, the staff was smiling and courteous.  They made sure my cup was topped off frequently, and gave us warm towels to clean off before our meal.  However, for all the hype this place received, the food was only mediocre.  We had the kitsune and stamina noodle soups, they tasted fine.  However, it didn't have the wow factor that I was expecting.  It was good, but not spectacular for the price and wait time (over half an hour for dinner).  Otherwise, the setting was nice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Umm, firstly, I saw John Oliver here, so that was... amazing. On top of that, the overall experience was pretty good. The paninis are large and probably one of the better values. When I got there, though, I was told that the ventilator had given out, so no flatbreads were possible. I saw people who beat out the ventilation and had good-sized pizzas, though, so I coveted those options. But I digress. Ambiance was fine, nothing amazing or frilly. Menu was decent. Service was fine. So, in the end, there's really not much that stands out. But I am glad I took a chance and ate here so I can share the same air with an amazing actor.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was here yesterday with my gf... They have 30 beers on draft and several interesting small plates. We had their bacon and cheddar matzo balls (pretty tasty, but kinda dry) and the frog legs.

"I want to live in that teeny tiny bamboo house, with a black sesame creame brulee in one hand and a teapot in the other. Mmhm, that'd be the life. We both had the Chef's Dessert Assortment ($17 = 3 dessert courses + your choice of tea). I wanted to try the famous Black Sesame Creame Brulee, but wanted the chef's menu. The waitress suggested that I put in a request for that item to be part of my tasting, which the chef complied with. + star for being so accommodating. Between the two of us, we got: Ice Cream: - Mixed Fruit Ice Cream - Green Tea Ice Cream Mini versions of: - Green Tea Swiss Roll - Flan in azuki bean - Black Sesame Creame Brulee - Chocolate mochi Cookies: - Green Tea Macaron - Chocolate cookie Teas: - Hojicha - Flower Craft Tea I definitely recommend the Green Tea items. All of the desserts were made with a light hand in sugar, so nothing was too cloying. To me, the creame brulee was the standout dessert, but my companion loved the swiss roll too. The chocolate mochi was the weakest, with a super soft mochi shell but a cold, stiff dark chocolate interior.  The Flower Craft Tea has flowers that blossom beautifully inside the pot. Go there, chat, enjoy a relaxing evening. And don't disturb me inside my bamboo house.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"To the owners: 1. Your waitstaff sucks. I'm sure you're getting into the groove, but no one seems to have a clue what's going on. After arguing over whose section was whose, my waiter basically ignored me. There were 5 staff members hanging out and joking while I waited to order.  Professional staff and a friendly atmosphere will make people want to come back. 2.  Your food is overpriced. Nine bones for a biscuit and ham and jam? And an extra FIVE for taters? This ain't soho. Stumptown coffees supreme, but $3 for a large and no refills? Recession specials lure in customers instead of alienating them. Granted Blue had its grime, but the people were nice, professional and the food was cheap. While I love to indulge ocassionally in the gourmet fare, the thought of over priced yuppie gringo comfort food in my neighborhood makes me want to throw up. Lower your prices and train your staff and have a brunch that's actually brunch and you'll not only get my business, but you'll get the after church crowd that lines outside Ministar across the street.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tasty pizza, but the owner was pretty rude to me over the phone. I called to let them know the size of their pizzas online wasn't clear to me, and he interrupted me, insulted me for using GrubHub, said this is how it is done in Italy, and hung up on me. Again, seemed like great food, but it was clear the owner didn't value my business or care about my experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"When cocoron first came out, I really wanted to try it, but never gotten to. After putting it off for a while, and hearing that their second store just opened near work, I had to drag a co-worker there to try it out. We arrived on a Monday night around 8pm, and the place was packed! We were lucky to snag the last 2 seats by the bar. The menu is lengthy, I never knew ordering soba was such a difficult task. I think it would have been easier to order if there was a picture associated with the sobas, as that is normally the norm in Japan. Nevertheless, I picked the Stamina warm soba and my co-worker ordered the dipping meat one, which I forgot the name already. I have also ordered the Mochi cake. The food took some time to come, and when my appetizer came, I was ready to chow that thing down. The Mochi thing was kind of bland, I guess that's why it was served with yuzu pepper and grained daikon. But even with that, it was a bit unseasoned. The texture reminds me of Chinese Carrot/Radish Cake, it was good, but definitely need some more heavier sauce!! Since they are known for their soba not appetizer, lets not put too much emphasis on that. Then came the soba, it was piping hot, and looked really yummy. The broth was flavorful, and the soba noodle went well with it. My co-worker liked his order as well, but one complaint that we both have were the portion. Even though we both opt for the large order, we were still hungry after finishing it. Lol. Such fat asses. The meal really left us feeling warm inside, and it's definitely a good place to go during the winter time. Will be back to try their cold soba and other items on the menu. Note: Cash Only.","[1.0, 0.0]"

When my friend arrived, despite a table being offered to us, we decided to eat at the bar. I took the mushroom and gruyere burger (loved the dijon added) while my friend had the Bash burger. It was hard not to inhale the burgers. We ordered medium and we got medium. It was perfect. Our tap beers (IPA and the Milk Stout) perfectly complemented the meal. I will definitely be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"this place is a gem hidden in the basement of an office building. seriously one of the best japanese restaurants out there. 1) pork belly--to die for. it feel apart in my mouth and the meat just melted. also a huge portion for just $5!! 2) the sea urchin cold ramen....omfg. this is probably one of the best dishes ive ever tasted. absolutely perfect. it was delicious and the urchin soup was to die for. its got this silky flavor...yum. 3) duck app was pretty decent.  it was a tad over cooked, but flavors were great, the saltiness marinated all the way through the whole duck. 4) rice balls--very fresh salmon roe, rice had great texture and had he vinegar and salt taste in the rice (huge plus) a must try.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Though I don't eat here nearly often enough, when I'm in NYC and looking for a can't-go-wrong meal, I head to Blue Ribbon Brasserie on Sullivan Street. Popularity has its price, and at BRB, this means waiting for a table. No reason to despair, because the bartenders are friendly and skilled in their trade, so we usually enjoy a cocktail or two at the bar before our meal. For appetizers, I typically select some combination of the beef marrow & oxtail marmalade, fried oysters, country pate, or escargot. However, if you are limited to only one indulgence, choose the beef marrow and you won't be disappointed. Spoon and smear the marrow onto toasted bread, top with a little bit of oxtail marmalade, salt to taste, and enjoy the buttery, creaminess of the marrow against the rich, sweetness of the oxtail. Yum! For salads, I've sampled both the watercress, endive & blue cheese salad, and the smoked trout salad. Though I would recommend either, the smoked trout really impressed me. For entrees, I either order the skate or hangar steak, depending on whether I am feeling more surf or turf. I've never had a desert here, but this is not because I dislike the selection our doubt the quality. It's because I simply cannot eat another bite by the time I finish my entree. Go to BRB for consistently delicious food, friendly service, and the opportunity to give your cardiologist a heart condition when you tell him or her what you've been eating lately.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We were really excited about this place when it first opened, and have been coming regularly for our favorite dish - the calamari platter. Tonight we were told that calamari has been permanently removed from the menu. So sad. We ordered chicken and salmon instead, and the food was all quite bland and flavorless. Not much better than your standard chicken 'n rice to be honest: pretty disappointing. We concluded that this place was a one-dish wonder, and we won't be back anytime soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I joined Yelp today SPECIFICALLY to talk about this restaurant and how deliciously amazing the brunch is. My gf and I started off by splitting the herring, which was impeccable, served with a delicious sauce and some sort of cracker.  We don't usually get appetizers for brunch, but we wanted to try as much as possible! For our entree, I had the Black Label burger (obviously) served medium rare, and I'm not even kidding that it was the best burger I've had in my entire life.  The burger itself was almost crunchy on the outside, but the quality of the meat was incredibly savory.  The bun was buttery and delicious and sopped up all the meat juice.  Absolutely perfect. My gf had the shirred eggs, which were also delicious.  The eggs had a great baked consistency, and were cheesy and gooey-- perfect with the bread served on the side. For dessert, we split the pots de creme, which were essentially three little pots of mousse-- chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.  They were served with two crispy little sweet wafers that were perfect for dipping.  All mousses were creamy and delectable.  The perfect size, too, for something small and sweet to split after the meal. We finished off with a round of drinks.  I had the Kentucky Dawn-- an orangey, espresso-y cocktail that was way better than it sounds.  It almost tasted like one of those chocolate oranges, except way more refreshing.  She had the French Toast Flip, which tasted just like french toast, except in a creamy martini form. The service was awesome-- we both agreed that our waiter was just the right amount of ""there"", always around when we wanted him but not annoying or trying to pressure us to order more.  I also appreciated it that we were there lingering for two hours, and no one was asking us or hinting to leave.   I have to admit, the meal was a bit pricey-- $140 after tax for brunch, which is something I've never spent on a meal-- but the service, ambience, and food were worth the price tag.  I'd gladly trade three mediocre brunches across town for one delicious brunch at Minetta Tavern. Make yourself a reservation NOW!  The wait might be a few weeks long, but trust me.. it's worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Score!  Waiters are mad busy but always super nice. Feel bad for the fella who manages the massive waitlist but he is always fair and on the ball. The vegetarian ramen was a bit weird - a whole garden full of veg (not a bad thing, necessarily) crammed into the bowl. Seemed like a giant salad with broth poured over it. The only sucky thing about this place is the LINE OUTSIDE!!!! Gross! The staff does a great job of keeping track of it, and it's a testament to how good this place is, but it is still awkward and cramped and makes me angry to be that close to other humans when I am starving for delicious ramen. I have never NOT seen a gigantic line outside this place, no matter what day or time (I used to work around the corner). Terrible wait line not the reason why I gave 4 stars. My hearty belongs to Minca, which gets 5. But Totto is awesome if you happen to be in that shitville known as Midtown.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is one of the best gyros in NYC.  This is a genuine Gyro place where the gyro is on the spit and roasting all the time until the moment the meat is sliced for you to eat - perfectly juicy gyro meat.  I have been a dedicated Village resident from NYU days and always returned to NYC to go to Yatagan (closed and replaced by a Turkish place that is clean and good but more expensive) and Mamoun's but the trip to the Village for my cravings is a stretch and I was fortunate fo find Istanbul Kebab House.   The sandwich lunch special (12-2 weekdays, 2-4 weekends and soda is great $6-7 total but the quality is fantastic - they actually grill the kebabs and Kubideh fresh- I have had four different sandwiches and the mixed grill platter.   The gyro meat sandwich portion is very generous.  The white sauce is excellent. They also offer grilled Branzini (must try next) at a reasonable price compared to the restaurants.  The lemon soup was great.   Their food is better than you would find in Turkey and as good as any place in the village although I prefer Mamoun's for the falafel.   The meats here are phenomenal and the place is super - clean.  The bathroom, everything and their Turkish soda is worth trying.   It is easy to miss, small front, but they also allow BYOB and there is liquor store within a few stores away.   And it is perfectly located, near the Theatre district so that I can get to the show on time and MOMA .  It is great that I can do all my favorite things in NYC and eat well  within blocks of each other.   I don't have to go to the Village to eat well and reasonably.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The empanadas are good, but I can't say that they are phenoms. However, for the price they go for considering it's the city, isn't too shabby. Out of the ones I have tried, I enjoyed all of them. (I always order the Viagra...you know...just cuz!) On the other hand, the plantain chips and guac is a tantalizing appetizer! I have also had the avocado salad with cumin dressing and grilled steak. I was trying to decide if I liked that there was more avocado on my plate than greens, though I am a big avocado fan, and wished that I had more steak in it for the $5.50 extra charge. The cumin dressing was different and much appreciated. Just a warning that this place is cramped. They seem busy every time I stopped by, which means you are literally touching elbows with the person seated next to you...who you most likely don't know. I can't say that groups will be accommodated well? The last time (yesternight) I went I was just a tad upset that the waiter did not ask how spicy we wanted our guac (it is more bland if you don't have a little heat to it) nor did he ask me what kind of dressing I wanted on my salad (they give you an option between cumin or mustard vinaigrette).","[1.0, 0.0]"

The chef might be getting arrogant since there is not much competition in Flatbush/Ditmas Park area, and what can you do when you order an $18 dish that you could prepare better at home?

"This was my first taste of NY food. My friend who's a trained chef had been wanting to check this place out for awhile and when I called to ask what's a good spot, he suggested we check it out  for brunch.Out waiter was the coolest dude ever. One of our friends was running late and we were taking forever to order but he did not seem annoyed by us at all. When we finally decided to order, I got the spinach, caramelized onion, swiss cheese omelet with grits and OJ. I consider myself a grits connoisseur being from the south and I'm always expecting the worst.These grits will make you slap yr mama good. They were simple buttered yellow corn grits with just a hint of sugar. The omelet was amazing, just the right amount of fluffiness and butter and the caramelized onions were on point. My friend got the homestyle chicken fingers that came with  a honey mustard sauce and a new aioli sauce. I don't care for honey mustard anything so I tried the aioli sauce.That aioli sauce is the business. OMG, it was so delicious I had to refrain from eating the rest of the food on my friend's plate with the sauce. The food servings were very well proportioned that you were guaranteed to leave full. My friend finally arrived and after being lost for about an hour in NY's winter storm she wanted some alcohol. She ordered a Bloody Mary that i have to take her word for was delicious.The drinks were pretty decent sized drinks and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. i ordered the ""Black President,"" ya know, cuz I had to so I could bring it back to DC with me. It was amazing! I would have had a second and a third, but unfortunately had a meeting after brunch. Overall, the food was 5 star, the service was 5 star and the drinks were 5 star. The decor was simple and very well put together. The atmosphere was chill even when it got busy. The menu leans to the expensive side but not so expensive that it's inaccessible to anyone coming through the door on a budget. I did take notice, as a former veggie, that there were vegetarian and vegan friendly options as well. Basically this place is like the Black cheers and I can get down with that.  I will definitely being going back on my next trip to BK.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Both of my parents grew up in chinatown in Bangkok, and so Ba Mee is a dish near and dear to my heart. Ba Mee is a Chinese egg noodle dish that's done Thai style with lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, soy sauce, chili, garlic, and then some kind of protein and vegetable toppings. Larb Ubol serves their ba mee hang with Chinese bbq-style roast pork, yu choy, and crab meat. While their ba mee hang is not the best I've ever had (or Larb Ubol's best dish), it definitely hits the spot. Some of my favorite dishes from Larb Ubol: - Pad Ped Moo Krob (super cripsy pork - like cracklins)   - Pad Kra Prao (juicy as hell ground pork with chili, thai basil, and garlic over rice) - Som Tum Avocado (a classic but the avocado really makes it special) - Ped Larb Salad (gotta try the larb, as it's in their name) To all the uneducated / untrained people reviewing Larb Ubol who think they had ""food poisoning,"" I'm sorry your stomach can't handle the spice. Please come back again when you've trained your stomach to handle real Thai spice. This place is NOT for the weak of stomach. Even level 3 spiciness (out of 5 levels) was almost too much for me.

Only cons - he burned one pizza and the place filled up with smoke, and stayed smoky for about an hour.  There's no real rhyme or reason for ordering and you have to just kind of invade the counter to figure it out.  It's not challenging, but a little annoying.  Because tables are hard to come by, there's definitely no sitting for waiting customers (so if you're waiting for 90 minutes, be ready to stand).  The standing space is so small that in the winter I expect that it would get crowded and uncomfortable pretty quickly.  Go for the pizza not the ambiance.  Or experience - it's not a great ""experience"" place...it's about the pizza.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Made an RSVP for 3 for a business dinner on a Wednesday night. We were seated early (!!) and promptly, and the waitress was really great with recommending drinks and food for us. Even the doorman and hostess were nothing but kind to us. None of the snootiness that I expected from such a famous place, to be honest. The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've been to quite a few gastropub inspired eateries, and this was really phenomenal, which I totally wasn't expecting. What I was expecting, was the care and attention to their cocktails. We all had a great time, and I was praised by my superiors for finding such a great place that was perfectly priced for the quality. Can't wait to come back when I'm back in NY sometime soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My son recommended this restaurant. He loves it.  We were visiting from ou tof state.  It was beautifully decorated, and the service was very good. My husband loved the salmon, and the other three of us ordered the mezze vegetarian platters.  They were stunningly presented, in sections divided by nice lemon slices,  and all of the choices in the platter  were delicous. The red lentil soup was wonderful, and the baklava and halva for dessert was excellent. This was a wonderful NY experience!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Casa Mono is really a cute lil restaurant! Luckily we made a reservation cuz even on a wednesday evening, it gets packed. I think the best seat in the house is the 5 seater table in front of the kitchen so you can watch the 4 chefs cooking in the open kitchen. I'm not sure if the exhaust wasn't working last night or something but it got really smoky! Now onto the food... the menu requires a spanish-english dictionary! but luckily our waiter was very knowledgable and friendly and helped out. The dishes are bigger than usual tapas plates and smaller than entree plates. So for two ppl, we shared 6 dishes, and 2 desserts. The foie gras is too die for! i almost ordered a second one but had to restrain myself. We also had the clams with pasta and chorizo (yum), mussels in spicy broth (yum), patatas bravas (yum), lamb (was ok), pork shoulder (was ok)... dessert i had the cantoloupe sorbet in moscato wine (YUMMIE!) and my husband had the crema catalana which was very good... esp the breaded warm bay leaves that came with it. All in all, it was a very delicious meal, will definitely go back and try the duck, and baby octupus... and foie gras!!! Definitely make a reservation and sit in front of the kitchen!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We went as a group of ~8 for dinner, after a couple of the group had enjoyed a lunch here.  Even they were surprised at the extensive wait, and the portion/price ratio.  Others have noted the 'patio'. The furniture looked like it was purchased from a condemned high school. Traveling past the bar to the dining area was difficult to manage. The Servings were small, and expensive.  I don't mean that they could have been a little larger; Several of us literally walked around the corner to the Subway shop, on Park, due to lingering hunger. I guess cannibals must be pretty thin. The pig's head looked nice, but was too pricey. The food we received was long in coming, and nothing special.  The bartenders were nice.

"Watching that chick, working the grill is enough to grant this place 4 Stars: she salts surface, flattens the meatball into a patty, plops down a handful of onions, peppers the whole thing, melts the cheese and warms the buns - it's an art. The steak fries are imperfect in that they're REAL fries and not just McDonald's processed. On top of that, they've got a Jalapeno & BBQ sauce and regular and chipotle ketchup. Order up some pickles, sneak one in there, hit it with one of the sauces and you've got yourself one GREAT slider. I'll be back for the chili and Guinness Float (yes you read that right). If they're as good as I anticipate - you have earned that 5th and coveted star.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The lamb and rice with red sauce and white sauce is among the most delicious and memorable meals a person can have on this earth. I grew up in New York but don't live there anymore, and whenever I go back this is what I look forward to in the way I hear other people talk about returning to their mom's cooking. This is not good food for a date, as it basically incapacitates you.  You may need to lay on your back and have no human contact for a while after eating this, either because of stomach pain or because you just need to reflect on how tasty the lamb and rice was. The serving is always enough for two meals, and the containers can go in the oven to be reheated (though I prefer to fry the leftovers to reheat them). Also, the line is not always that long, so it's always worth taking a look to see if it's worth getting in line. You probably shouldn't eat this meal more than once a month. It can't be good for your insides. be careful with the red sauce. A little goes a long way.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"came here for a girlfriend's birthday a couple of weeks ago - i love this place! SETTING: this dining area is pretty small. the long and narrow layout only allows for two table widthwise that's why i was so surprised that they were able to fit our party of over 10 people. so accommodating. the setting is super cute: brick walls, twinkle lights, perfect for date nights (or girls' dinner) FOOD: the portion is like tapas style. they always recommend getting two dishes per person anyway. my party got Gnocchi, Lobster Pot Pie, Grown Up Mac n Cheese and Shrimp n Grits - everyone seemed satisfied with their meals. i only got the Scallops (planned on going out that night and didn't want to be too full). it was really good - and even better when washed off with like 3 glasses of wine haha PRICE: price isn't bad - for two dishes (which basically equals one entree), the cost is comparable. i really like this place a lot so i'll definitely be back if i'm in the area. xx","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been coming to Anella since they opened up a few years ago and it remains one of the few consistently delicious New York City dining experiences. This restaurant is my go-to for friends and family visiting from out of town or for a romantic date with my husband. The space is cozy, rustic and warmly lit with a wonderfully charming outdoor garden where it's not unusual to see the kitchen staff clipping fresh herbs for your meal! Food is mouthwateringly delicious and the menu is constantly changing to reflect the season. The meal begins with warm, fresh baked bread in a flower pot, which I start to obsess about as soon as I walk through the door. My current favorite dishes are the Homemade Burrata, the Spicy Corn Soup (it's to die for - I hope it stays on the menu forever!), Ricotta Gnocci, Strip Steak, and the Chocolate Tart for dessert. Service is always friendly, attentive and informative. Refreshing cocktails and a nice wine list with some local selections. A rare & special gem of a restaurant!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"best panini in NYC. fresh cheese and pasta that reminds me of a visit to a small town in italy with a chef/owner who clearly puts her soul in her work. great find for Manhattan.   best to go before there is a block long line to get in. follow-up note on the chef/owner:  several reviews say that she is gruff, rude, and anything but hospitable, especially for somebody in the hospitality business.   This all misses the point. She cooks for herself, an artist among many cooks.   If you don't like it, that's fine.  If you don't like it when she barks (as she did to us) ""nobody is coming over to your table"", too bad.  In an unusual way, she has a refreshing honesty and, if you did a little deeper, a lot more depth than some reviewers realize.   She is raw and real, and her food is fantastic. second note:  this is the first review i've ever written on yelp, and i did so because this is such a great find.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We ordered nachos, which were very tasty, and ordered tacos and sandwiches as a quick option. The nachos came out quickly, but after 45 minutes passed, we were still without food. Our waiter never checked on our table or noticed that we had not received our orders. Another employee walked by and we asked for our food. No food came. We then asked for it to be boxed, and he seemed put off by this comment. 10 minutes later, our food arrived in boxes and no comp on the receipt (we did get a drink voucher, but would I come back?).

"For a laid back cool cocktail place, this is the spot to come to in Boerum Hill. Decor is awesome and very unique. They also have a great happy hour. Cocktails are usually $10 so you get 2 for the price of 1. Keep in mind, it is two for one per person, so you and a friend can't get one cocktail each for $10 total. Still, a good deal. Beer list is pretty good too. They keep a fire going in the winter, which is nice to sit by on these cold winter days. Their food is good too.

"Like everyone else has said, probably the best macarons (only one o, that's crucial) in NYC - if not the world.

The pistachio is delicious and you can tell it's made with real pistachios. I'm also a sucker for anything salted caramel flavored, and the Laduree macaron did not disappoint.

"I found myself at the Ssam bar upon the recommendation I found online as well as from some locals here in New York. Being a fan of traditional Korean cuisine, I arrived with an appetite full of anticipation. Being a busy spot, the genial hostess was unfortunately unable to put our names down for a table until our group was complete. That was fair enough, considering that there was a growing mass spilling onto the pathway waiting for tables. While our group waited for a table at the adorable Milk Bar, there seems to be a sense of camaraderie amongst the crowd as I was offered some of a stranger's blueberry cookie while sipping on my Rose.   Finally, we were ushered to our communal table where we immediately placed an order for a dozen oysters and two servings of pork buns (2 buns per serve). The oysters arrived casually on a utilitarian platter of ice- each mollusk cradled in its half shell dotted with a version of kimchi sauce. The result is a melodic marriage of heat (chilli) and cold. Fabulous! My company were very excited about the pork buns. While they were admittedly delish and more-ish, I can't help but draw parallels to its better tasting traditional version which includes crisp lettuce. For our main courses, we had soft shell crab and hanger steak- both of which were beautifully prepared and in a serving that is ideal for each person. If you are hanging for a a gastronomic feast expecting to be fed as much as a goose for foie gras, don't waste your time here. But if you want to enjoy a good meal through grazing over delicate yet bombastic platters with good company in an energetic yet intimate space, make sure you arrive early!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been here a few times in the past where I have had their steaks which were good, but as previously stated are not the best to be had in the city or Lugers. However I went in the other night, wife out of town and just sat down at a table by the bar and ordered an Old Speckled Hen and the the Black Label Burger with a glass of red. Having heard that the burger is quite filling I opted out of any appetizer. Well I must say that the burger was indeed excellent. I will not go into the ingredients, preparation etc...suffice it to say that it is worth the price and should be tried by any meat or burger lover. The fries were good however their prep at Balthazar for fries is better and I don't know why this would be...still good. Next time I would order an appetizer as I actually thought the burger was kind of on the small side, could have eaten at least another half and I am not a big eater, or maybe it just was THAT good. After my dining neighbor from Germany finished his two appetizers, he just had to order one as well and concurred that it was the best burger he ever had as well. Finished with a cappuccino.

"Stay far away if you've been happy with subpar sushi and don't want to be faced with what it should be (Teriyaki Boy comes to mind). Sushi Yasuda brings to light what fresh sashimi or sushi should be and what is apparent at Yasuda is the simplicity of it.  There aren't creative rolls made in left field here.  No, you won't find any cream cheese rolls either.  What you should expect and will receive are immaculate pieces of sushi/sashimi that would never swim their way to any other sushi restaurant's menu. We had the omakase which is probably the way to go given the number of different pieces of sushi they have to offer.  Unknown to me during dinner, Chef Yasuda was our chef at the sushi bar and he could have sold water to a well.  Listening to him interact with the customers was part of what made the dinner wonderful.  Based on his recommendations on what sushi was good and how to eat them to how much wasabi to place on them rounded out this incredible dining experience. For instance, we were told that the soy sauce was unlike any other soy sauce because of the blend of soy and sake.. yes, true to his word, it didn't taste like commercial soy sauce.  The wasabi was made from fresh root and while a bit more subtle than the paste that we receive from supermarket sushi, it is authentic and doesn't serve that tear enducing kick we are used to but a true wasabi  taste. Usually I would like to check out other restaurants; this time, we made an appointment in 2 weeks to revisit Sushi Yasuda.  Yes, it was that great!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Best ramen I've had in the city thus far (I've tried all the places in midtown).  The menu is very minimalist (with really just a handful of ramen options), but quality trumps quantity/variety here.  Totto's ramen is the straight kind and is firmer, springier and overall more chewy than the curly ramen staple to most other ramen shops around town.  I'd go with the spicy ramen, which is amazing, and the miso broth can be a bit bland.  The pork is extremely well flavored (Japanese bbq) and tender, though my favorite topping is, oddly enough, the boiled egg. The only drawback is, as others have mentioned, the limited space.  I also didn't think the waitress was very friendly or helpful, though the ramen chefs behind the bar were always super attentive and nice.  I've never had to wait too long here - if possible, try to get there earlier (such as when it first opens!) to beat the midtown lunch crowd.  Later may be risky - a friend of mine had to wait an hour to get a table around 3-4pm.  Definitely not the best place for a large group, though one time they did sit our group of 8 along the bar.  Bottom-line: 5 star ramen, minus 1 star for ""luck of the draw"" wait and service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really wish I could give this restaurant more stars, because the food that I actually got was decent, but the service was HORRENDOUS.  The reason I decided to go to this restaurant was because it was listed as pet-friendly on bringfido.com, but it really should remove itself from there because it's not really pet-friendly.  I called earlier to confirm they were actually pet-friendly, and made a reservation because I wanted to make sure that no one took that table.  When we arrived, I obviously had to let the hostess know that I was there, and my dog was in her dog bag.  The minute manager saw me, she was SUPER RUDE - ""you cannot have that in here!  NO, you cannot have that in here"".  Ummm, I thought it is pet-friendly?  Then the hostess came up to me, to she asked if I was the person who made the reservation for 9PM and I said yes, she kindly told me that my table was up front.  We realized it was just a sliding door, and she said the dogs have to stay outside the sliding doors - mind you, it was about 50* outside.  Fine - we obliged.   My friend got up to use the bathroom, and asked the manager, how come this restaurant is advertised as pet-friendly, but when we walked in she acted like she had no idea why we had our dogs AND if no pets were allowed IN the restaurant, they should clearly state where the dogs would actually be or remove themselves from the listing.  She said she didn't know? We ordered our food and a half hour goes by, nothing... at the hour minute mark, we get the 2 dishes that we ordered out of the four.  We start  to wonder, where is the rest of the food.  We ask the waiter and he explain that a bunch of people came at one time, and the kitchen a bit backed up, ok - fine.  Then another 30+ minutes go by, and still no food.  I explain to him that I completely understand the kitchen being slammed, but no one has come to check on us, or offer an explanation since we've been here for almost an hour and a half.  He said he'd check again, another half hour goes by, and finally I've just had enough.  The food was still NOT ready.  Just as we were saying how we noticed that another table that came after us was already eating, the manager walks by - who might also be the chef - not sure because she looks like her, but was never IN the kitchen and I saw her leave on a scooter to make a delivery?  I overheard her saying ""the kids are starving"" so maybe she went home to feed her own children?  In any case, she overheard us telling the waiter that there was another table that came in after us and they were already eating, and she walked over and said, ""No, actually that table came from the outside seating area in the back, and we moved them to this table."" and as my friend is explaining the circumstances to her calmly, she cuts her off and was RUDE again.   Unfortunately, the wait hit almost 2 hours and we just got up and left.  My friend went up to the waiter and said we didn't want to wait any longer and he said we have no bill, so the two dishes we got were on the house. However, I am truly disappointed because I was really looking forward to trying their food and reading all the good reviews.  The way the manager/chef treated us at the door, to the 2 hour wait, and the waiter/hostess not checking on us, and then when the 2 dishes did arrive - no plates, and when we were frustrated and expressing our dissatisfaction, the manager/chef was RUDE again.   Cheryl - you might be a good cook, but you are one rude lady.  Sad, since your video shows you being such a nice woman and friendly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here several times and have enjoyed the staff, the atmosphere, and most of all the great food. I noticed in a previous review that someone complained of the portion size and the ""bangladesh"" bartender- 1. The food portions are quite generous so I seriosuly question anyone who needs more than what they give. 2. What relevance does the bartenders ethnicity have in whether he's a smartass or not? (one reviewer mentioned this) Which in my opinion he's not- he's actually friendly and polite. Actually all 3 bartenders who I know work there are great! In any case, I highly recomend this place for the great overall experience it provides!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A recent New York Times article quoted, I believe, the owner of La Superior as complaining that ""...everyone has their own idea of what Mexican food should taste like, especially [sic.] Californians..."" Well, you're damned right we do!  And why not?  With all the gorgeous holes-in-the-wall around the Bay Area that consistently turn out the good stuff, there's every reason to be picky about our (admittedly very specific) notion of what Mexican food is.  AND I'LL SAY THIS: every time any of us sees that strip mall crap-wagon, Chipotle, used as the basis for ANY kind of taqueria comparison, we go into the sort of fits that require all caps, and a great deal of creative punctuation.  SO, this review is coming from a son of that great state, comparing it to the roach mobiles and rat shacks of his home. On to the review. My first impression of Dos Toros on a busy Friday night was that everyone, from the bikey kids out front to the tattooed lotharios behind the counter, was high.  I was not mistaken.  My burrito-making episode began with a fey girl with bloodshot eyes asking me if I ""wanted to revolutionize my burrito experience"", & ended with a guy staring stonily down at the aluminum vessel in his hands saying, with great gravitas, ""that's the sweetest motherf[CENSORED] burrito I've ever rolled.""  BUT, we (former) Californians don't judge a burrito by the color of its maker's sclera, rather, we judge it by the contents of its delicious floury tortilla. Full disclosure: I dig vegan burritos.  There's an alchemy in the combination of well-made rice, deeply flavorful beans, so-hot-you-cry salsa, and creamy guacamole that hits every button for me.  Dos Toros got it quite straight indeed.  Their rice was fluffy and tasty, but got right out of the way of the pinto beans' rich, smokey flavor.  Best of all, the salsa roja was actually reasonably hot, the guacamole was made with ripe avocados & hadn't been killed with garlic, and the two of them did that lovely fire-and-ice dance all throughout the dense little monster. Overall, the burrito was everything I'd been hankering for since leaving my foggy home. Some cons: The ""sweetest mother[CENSORED] burrito"" that dude ever rolled had lost critical hull integrity, and was coming apart at the seams.  Whoops!  Also, if you're a strict vegetarian or vegan, don't bother; the rice is made with chicken stock. These are minor gripes, and I can say without reservation that for men and women homesick for a taste of Pancho Villa's, Roosevelt's, &c, Dos Toros delivers.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"As a Frenchy, I am usually super critical about anything French in the US. After all, I'm French, so complaining is part of my culture! I booked a table at Amelie shortly after Valentine's Day, as I was out of town on that day and couldn't take my better half out for dinner. Overall, we had a great time  food was delicious, portions were more than decent, and service was super courteous. My favorite part: when our waiter figured that my girlfriend didn't speak French, he instantly offered to switch to English. Kudos! That doesn't happen much, and my girlfriend felt even better at that place. The good: we were at a table in the corner, which gave us some intimacy in a very crowded restaurant. Also, the waiter would just jump over the bar to serve us, which meant that he wouldn't have to struggle through the whole crowd to bring us our plates. The bad: it was pretty cold outside, and when some *cough idiots cough* careless customers would enter or leave while leaving both doors open! it could get pretty cold at our table too. The ugly: I'm not sure I would have enjoyed our dinner as much had we sat at a table behind the bar. Looked like some people's heads got knocked over a few times. But hey, it's New York!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I find myself more critical when it comes to hyped up places like this one, but this definitely lived up to the hype! Had the gyro and the combo plate and both were delicious. I would probably opt for the combo plate (only $6) for the amount of food, and it's less messy. Perfect for a chilly day. I always take extra sauces to go - the hot sauce has a real kick! The line goes fast and it's so worth it. I usually can't finish a plate in one sitting unless I'm starving.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After learning that a higher quality sushi place was less than a block away from my residence, I immediately set up a reservation for the sushi bar (I find the bar at sushi restaurants to be the best experience - intimacy, proximity, more of a connection to the food).  The Moria-esque entrance to the restaurant forced a double-take and a tentative approach, but the restaurant caverns open inside.   We were lucky enough to be seated in front of The Man; clearly the head chef.  His knowledge of the menu and the origins of all the sea creatures available was inexhaustible (who knew that there were more than 300 types of squid, or that one should leave the fish to age 5 days before optimal texture and taste?).  While I was not partial to the sea urchin, my dinnermates seemed to buckle under the weight of its taste.  My memorables were the jack mackerel and the freshwater eel.   It was not cheap, though not obscene, and the meal was well worth the price.  I will return.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The restaurant is dated but I'm sure most of the patrons are there only for the food.

"Ah-mazing!!!!! My boyfriend and I happened upon this cart at 5pm Saturday on the way back to our hotel after a matinee show - dinner reservations weren't for 2 hours and we were hungry for a snack. For $6 we got a HUGE helping of food - the platter included yummy rice, pita, chicken and gyro meat with sauce and lettuce. DELICIOUS!!!! Who knew that you could get such an affordable meal in NY and feel so satisfied after eating it? The two of us shared a platter and we were both full. Very generous portions. After dinner - around 8:30pm there was a massive line waiting at the 53rd and 6th cart. There had to be 40 people in line. The cart at 53rd had the same name as the cart at 52nd - I am assuming they are owned by the same person. So glad we stumbled on this gem! Will definitely eat here again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I can't be objective about this review, because Swine is my dream restaurant. They have a statue of Wolverine. There are no words. At first blush, Swine seems yet another restaurant simply opening to take advantage of a craze - in this case, the current obsession with meat driven menus. This particular menu reads like an amalgamation of a Texas state fair and Chelsea trendsetters: Potato Chip Nachos or Lardo? Swine Chop with crispy fingerlings or Foie Gras Torchon? As someone who's nearly exclusively carnivorous, I was excited, but having been disappointed by other, similar concepts, my skepticism tempered said excitement. To forgo the foreshadowing: believe the hype. This place is damn good. I ordered a ""Buck Up"" cocktail; rum infused (appreciably) with pink peppercorn, mixed with grapefruit and ginger, topped with soda. The ginger doesn't overwhelm all the other components, as it is often wont to do, and the grapefruit provides a necessary tartness to balance the inherent sweetness of the rum. It also serves as an excellent palate cleanser between bites of various small plates. M and I shared the ricotta stuffed zucchini blossoms, which unexpectedly came on a bed of heirloom tomatoes, whose juice was mixed with orange zest and sea salt, creating a wonderful brine for the excess ricotta that spilled from the blossoms. The combination of creaminess and acidity is a staple to cooking, and worked as well in this dish as any other, with the orange zest elevating it to something interesting and unique, as opposed to another caprese knockoff. For our mains, M ordered the roast chicken (as someone who does not eat red meat, there weren't many options) while I ordered the bone marrow and brisket burger. I try not to use superlatives in reviews, as they're frequently unwarranted, but this was one of the best burgers I've eaten in the city. I was a little worried that the brisket was going to make the ensuing burger a little tougher than normal, but my fears were assuaged after my first bite. The light egginess of the bun, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the funk of the gruyere, and the salty, tender, savoriness of the meat all went together as perfectly as they can in a burger. The crust stood up to the substantial juiciness of the ground beef, the brisket added a rich smokiness, and the bone marrow added an even richer, more intense meatiness. The fact that it came with a side of perfectly crisped potato wedges and was only $18 makes this one of the top five burgers in New York, hands down. The roast chicken was perfectly acceptable, but after that knockout of a burger, I couldn't care less. Sorry, chicken. We finished the night with their only dessert; a bacon hot fudge sundae. I don't typically like meaty desserts, and if you're like me, you likely won't enjoy this sundae: it is preposterously bacon-y. That said, it's my fault for ordering it, knowing full well my own preferences. In truth, I only ordered it in the hopes that as M and I lingered, the old couple who were blocking the amazing Wolverine statue would leave, so I could take a picture. When they didn't, I just asked if they would move, and took a picture around them. Block my Wolverine, eh? Give it up bub. Also, to the waitress who confirmed to M that it was indeed Wolverine, you are the (wo)man. With the sheer volume of interesting small plates, the well-executed entrees, and affordable yet enticing beer selection, I'm going to be back sooner rather than later. If you want to catch Swine flu before the hipsters do, I'd suggest you visit soon as well.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"beWas here for a birthday dinner. First let me say the menu is refreshingly different.  Of note is the Dentice (fish). I've never seen this fish offered on a US menu. They also have Bronzino which has become increasingly popular here in the US.  This is definitley not your typical Italian menu.  For apps, we ordered the grilled calamari, and stuffed egglplant.  The calamari came out super tender, drizzled with olive oil and served with arugula. The stuffed eggplant was done with a goat cheese and again served with arugula.  Both apps were exceptional.  Dinner we had the Bronzino which they offer as a fillet or the whole fish, and the Spaghetti with Lamb ragu.  The Bronzino was great, very fresh. The lamb ragu was something to go back for. FYI they not only offer lamb but sausage and beef as well.  Oh yeah, the pasta is home made. Definitely home made and you can tell by the spaghetti's imperfections. Dessert, we had the Tiramisu made with marscapone not cream cheese, and some homeade crepes.  One cricitcism Basso56....how can you offer homeade crepes and not stuff them with Nutella??? Just plain chocolate. Oh well you guys did everything else right.  Lastly, I don'y think I've seen more reasonable prices in the city for great Italian. $8-12 for apps, $16-$30 for entrees.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Your lobster ravioli was deemed ""the best damn lobster ravioli"" by my husband - and believe me, the man has tried a lot of it. 4. Your wine selection - a bottle of fabulous Chianti for under $50? In Manhattan? Who am I to argue? 5. Your Crème Brulee is a work of art and pure deliciousness. Creamy, flavorful custard and a perfectly caramelized shell. It's OMG worthy 6.

"Let's get reminded that this is the middle of theater district and in Time Square, also at the height of the winter season (Dec 27th). However, I've had better service in the midst of all the chaos. We opted out to go to the downstairs part of the restaurant since it seemed to have a shorter wait! The actual restaurant part upstairs was already on a 90 mins wait (We went around 8 p.m. ish on a Saturday). When we went downstairs, at first it was a 60 min wait, but fortunately (the only fortunate part of the whole experience) the people who were waiting before us didn't answer their phone so we got sat at the bar area right away! There are table seats downstairs with servers-- which I feel like if we were there, it may have been a different experience! (NOTE: Your cell will not work down stairs-- probably a reason why the hostess had to use the landline. They also don't have WIFI!!) Whoever the bar guy was, I was shocked on his demeanor, attitude and blatant rudeness. I will say that he did fill our waters with promptness though-- as well as the rest of the bar area (which was about 8-10). My friend and I were sitting down for a while (15 mins) with menus, and asked ""excuse me"" so we can order. I'm going to give him, that although he was busy too, he really didn't have to put a hand up with his finger like we were back in grade school. He came up and we ordered, then he wanted the menus back-- and I told him that can we keep one since we were going to order more and he said, ""Well I'll give it back to you when you need it"". Again, totally understandable if he needed it for when people sat down--- which I was surprised when he wasn't even the one to give any of us menus, because you know I would be actually looking to see if he needed the menus. After we ordered, we were talking and the food came out. It was the udon with the spicy fish flavor--- extremely salty. We had to put some water down in it to even it out. The meat was good, I think maybe just the broth. We also noticed, although he gave us two bowls for us to share, just one spoon. So a few minutes later, I asked him if he could give us an extra spoon. He CLEARLY rolled his eyes and went in to give us a spoon. At this point, my friend and I looked at each other and was like--- did we do something wrong? He said they didn't have extra so that's why he gave us this metal spoon rather than the spoon you're supposed to use. (If you know which spoons I'm talking about-- it's shorter, usually found in Asian restaurants, especially pho places). About 20 mins later (when it didn't even look like we were done), the bar guy asked if we wanted to order anything else. I told him, not yet-- and he rudely told us ""To let you know, sitting here, you have a $10 minimum each and you're away about $3"". Again, I would have been totally fine with this-- had I not been rudely told... So we ordered a hot sake-- which was nice and hot. Careful when you first get it because it's sooo hot! The hostess was nice and the vibe is what you would see during the winter holiday, Christmas season (although after Christmas but before New Years). You can tell I did NOT like the bartender guy--- I was relieved that another person came toward the end to switch with him. Too bad it was only for about 10 mins or so when we had to pay for the check. Two stars because of the other bartender and the food wasn't horrible. I don't think we'll ever be back again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The single food focus really works with this place.  These spherical protein servings sure are some DAMN TASTY BALLS!  Had to put it that way, sorry, the word balls is funny, especially when listed all over the menu.  Friends had gone recently and totally were glad they recommended this spot.  So as a surprise last night, I whisked the Fiance on over to the LES for a fun dinner.  The place was buzzing and a 45 minute wait turned out to be 15 seconds when the hostess (who was handling the chaos very well) offered us seats at the bar.   Our adventures began with 4 sliders (beef with spicy meat, spicy pork with mushroom, chicken with parmasean cream and the special of lamb with olives and feta mixed in with tomato sauce).  These were all really tasty.  We also got the risotto which was delicious and cooked to order and had some herb in it that gave it a nice flavor.  The other side of the market vegetable of honey glazed carrots with walnuts and I think figs or dates was delicious!  I also managed to stuff down the beef meatball smash with provolone and regular tomato sauce on a brioche bun that comes with the arugula and apple side salad.   All in all the place was fun and every dish was delish!  Ordering by writing directly on the menu with dry erase markers was a fun little gimmick as well.   And the homemade ice cream on the chocolate chip cookies were especially nice to end the meal.  The dessert was a generous serving compared to what was expected.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of my coworkers raved about the CRISP falafel truck and managed to get five coworkers, including myself, to go with her to the CRISP truck.  We were all truly excited to experience ""one of the best falafels"" as my coworker stated.  Therefore, we checked the CRISP website and called the CRISP hotline to find out where the truck would be on Wednesday June 1, 2011.  The truck and hotline mentioned that the truck would be located at 46th St. and 6th Ave.  Apparently, the information on the website and the hotline were both outdated.  However, our coworker insisted we would enjoy the falafels so we decided to walk over 10 blocks  in 90 degree very humid weather to the CRISP restaurant on 40th and 6th Ave. With a lot of excitement and eagerness to quench my hunger, I placed two orders at the restaurant; I ordered a meal for myself and a meal for my coworker that could not leave the office to pick up her own lunch.   I ordered ""The Crisp"" which according to their online menu is a falafel and a side order of fries.   For my coworker I placed an order for a babaganoush falafel.  I asked the cashier, Ian, if I could remove the goat cheese and substitute the goat cheese for roasted peppers.  Ian was very firm and adamant in saying that I could not substitute items in my order.  I find it very strange that I could not substitute one item for another when falafels are made fresh upon order.  I also find it strange that Ian did not say I could even add additional items for an extra charge.  As goat cheese is also more expensive than roasted peppers I would think it would be cheaper to substitute this option.   However, Ian continued to be dismissive and said no substitutions.  I was told ""you get the cheese or you don't get the cheese.""   I patiently waited on a long line for my meal.  When I received my meal, I realized that it was not a falafel.  I was given a burger instead.  Against my better judgment, I ate the burger in the restaurant in disappointment.  I asked one of my coworkers, who also ordered from Ian, if her order was correct.  It seems like she was also given a burger instead of a falafel!  Before leaving, I decided to see what was given to my coworker in the 2nd order since Ian had gotten so many orders incorrect and lo and behold it was a burger.  I went to another cashier to ask if the order could be switched so that at least one person could enjoy their lunch.  The other cashier didn't even get a chance to respond because Ian jumped into the discussion and said we could not switch orders. He was very dismissive and said ""That's what you ordered"" and ""you can purchase additional items but we won't be switching anything.""   Not only was I disappointed and unhappy with this poor customer service experience but my coworkers were also unhappy because of this.  Thanks to Ian I've given this experience an F for FAIL!  Ian FAILED to provide me or my coworkers with the customer service experience that we are used to. CRISP has now lost customers...all five of us!   We spread the word through our department and I'm sure they will spread the word to their families and friends. Lets just say that the next time I want a falafel I can go to Moashes falafel truck in midtown on 46th and 6th or I'll go to mamouns  on MacDougal Street.   Frustrated and hugely disappointed","[0.0, 1.0]"

"First off, want some authentic Vietnamese food? Go to Chinatown. 1) I went in with my boyfriend and two other friends, and waited half an hour for a table. The lady who served us actually allowed her family friends to go ahead of us. Terrible. When we sat down, she didn't say, ""How may I help you?"" Instead, she said, ""What do you want?"" Talk about rude. 2) After we got our food, I realized that mine had a hair in it, and I asked for a new bowl, but the lady said no. Talk about rude. I mean, come on. There was a long strand of black hair in it! After she said no, I just sat there and didn't eat. No way was I going to eat that. My friends told me their soup was bland and cold. Their food was disgusting. 3) After, we left. The lady who served us spoke in Vietnamese something the line of, ""Oh, she thinks she's all that? Not eating something with hair? Don't come back, bitch."" I didn't say anything because I did not want to cause any trouble. When she realized I didn't leave a tip, she ran out and screamed at us requesting for a $5 tip. I walked away and ignored her. The food is disgusting. The customer service is beyond horrible. The place smells so badly. It's loud. Seriously, the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had.

"I've been here many times and use to love this place. The waiter - Juan was so rude. You would ask him a question and he would answer like he was annoyed. Maybe he was having a bad day, who knows. I'm huge when it comes to customer service and if anything I'm usually patient. Now the food: it wasn't it's best or what I'm used to. The rice was undercooked and I found long piece of hair in my food. Disgusting. I'm not one to cause a scene. I simply called waiter over and told him. I asked for the check and I just wanted to leave. The manager was nice enough to come over and apologized and did not charge for the ropa vieja - that's why I give it a two stars.

"Fresh, thin, crispy, cheesy pizza is found at Grimaldi's. We worked up an appetite by walking on the Brooklyn Bridge so we were hungry but of course, when we got there, there was a line. It looked short at first and the guy who comes out to let people in, said it was only a 15 minute wait but Hubby knew better. We actually waited for about 30-40 minutes before we were seated. The place is small and the owner/manger who was working the door are very strict who walks in. We ordered one small pepperoni which is 16"" $14 and one small white pizza for also $14. I have to tell ya, the first bite and the first slice was delicious. The thin crispiness of the over bricked crust, the fresh tomatoes sauce and mozzarella cheese with the pepperoni was just amazing. I love how it tasted. The white pizza was just as good with the fresh garlicky tastes and the fresh cheeses. Both pizzas also had some fresh basil on it which gave a great compliment to the the pizzas. The cheese was stringy at the first time just as I like it. I have to emphasize on the first bite/slice because once it gets cool, it doesn't have that wow factor anymore but still good. The service was quick and prompt but can't not say they were friendly. Note: when you are in line, make sure to stay within the rope.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went for a birthday and was seated at the back, even with cold weather outside. The place is warm enough to have dinner there. i like the entrance and window facing the Bleecker sidewalk, though the space where the bar is, is really slim, and not a lot of people can fit there. The location is a big plus. It is right on Bleecker St, I love this area. We had the rabbit meatballs to share. Good but not eceptionnal. I am a big fan of rabbit dishes and this one is tasting like,,,different. We then had the bronzino and the pasta with swordfish. Everything was nice, well prepared, quite tasty. Nothing crazy but overall everybody seemed happy with what they had. Even the service runned smoothly. i will be back especially because it is so well located.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I really wanted to like Ippudo. There's a lot of hype surrounding this place, and when I went there on a Friday night and was told there was a 2 1/2 hour wait (which actually came closer to 3 hours...shoutout to Butter Lane cupcakes up the road for helping us survive that wait!), I thought ""well it MUST be good!"" Sadly though, I was disappointed. I've eaten at enough good ramen places between California and New York, and even had the chance to go to Japan for the real deal, but unfortunately Ippudo did not come close to any of those experiences. After reading reviews from others (the one benefit of a long wait, it gives you PLENTY of time to read through other's experiences), I went with the akamaru modern ramen with nitamago and an appetizer of pork buns. I also decided to try one of their cocktails (a sake/gin/grapefruit concoction) while I waited. Everything came out super fast from the attentive staff (definitely the highlight of the experience, the customer service was outstanding). I barely ordered my drink before they brought it to the table. Unfortunately, it ended up tasting a bit too much like watered down sake with no real gin or grapefruit flavor to speak of (a lack of flavor was kind of the theme of the whole experience). Next came the pork buns. I had heard from others that these pork buns were incredible, and when they came to the table they definitely looked great. I couldn't wait to bite into them, and when I did I was met with a pretty satisfying pork flavor. As I took my second bite though, I started to notice that the pork was a little dry (not the tender and juicy pieces of pork you generally hope for), and the flavor was overpowered by their ""special sauce"" that tasted an awful lot like mayonnaise. One astute diner I was with likened the flavor of the sauce to what you would find in a McChicken sandwich (the fact that the bun was also filled with wilted lettuce definitely didn't help this association). The buns weren't necessarily ""bad,"" they just weren't all that good. After a few moments, our Ramen came out, and again it looked absolutely delicious. The broth looked nice and cloudy with all the fixings laid out on top. I immediately dipped my spoon in for a bite....and tasted nothing. The broth was seriously lacking in flavor. I usually love the rich pork flavor of Hakata style ramen, but this had none of that. The pork was another disappointment. The pieces were really lean, so they didn't have the ""melts-in-your-mouth"" flavor you usually get from good ramen. The noodles on the other hand were nice and tender with just the right amount of al dente firmness and the egg was cooked to perfection (but again, seriously lacking in flavor). There were things to like about the Ramen, but not enough to outweigh the overall blandness. I'm sure this place will continue to be packed on Friday nights, but with other (better) options like Menkui Tei or Totto in the city, I can't see myself ever coming back here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was very excited about going to Cafe Luluc, I heard really good things about this place from other friends. Sadly my experience there was the worst I ever had in my life!. I went there with group of 8 people to dining at this establishment. First, we were greeted by a robotic and unfriendly waiter. He was not helpful or hospitable towards his customers. For instance, we asked him something regarding the menus, he replies with an attitude which suggests that he might hate his job and takes it out on his customers. Our waiter was the guy that was running the bar area during the early shift on 12-21-2012. Despite the waiter's rudeness, he got my order mess up with my neighbor. He didn't bother to ask me how I would like my burger? although, he had asked other people who order hamburgers. He got my order wrong cause he asked the wrong person "" What temperature you would like your burger?"" ( IT'S ""How well would you like your burger?"" or ""How would you like burger?"") I told him when he brought my burger back that is WELL WELL done and it too dry to be consume, he replies that I order it well done when he did ask me how I would had liked my burger. He asked my friend next to me which order a turkey burger, and that can only come well done!. When the burger actually came it was WELL done to a point where it was over done. Not only did he not notice he's mistake, but had the nerves to correct me that I order my burger well done and went back to ask the chef. When he finally got my order right After all that he finally got my order correct but at the point I no longer had an appetite  , After waiting 20 minutes for my first burger which was wrong and then another 20 minutes for my burger the second time. The service was horrible from the entire time we were there, from unfriendly host to an angry waiter. IF THE WAITER SO HAPPENS TO SEE THIS POSTING OF YOUR HORRIBLE SERVICE. I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT YOU JUST PISS OFF 8 CULINARY STUDENTS. From the 8 people you just lost 2 loyal customers that go there very often and has been saying good things about your service and food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Yes the place is a dump. Yes it may take more than an hour to get your pizza (there is a secret to get your pizza a lot faster but if I told you it wouldn't be a secret, would it? Let me just say when I go there, I usually get it within 5 minutes). Yes they have no AC so it can become insanely hot in the summer. Yes $4 a slice is the most expensive slice I've ever paid for. However, I usually get a though. Comes out much cheaper that way. They favor their regular customers. They will serve their regular customers considerably faster than others. When there is a crowd, it gets very disorganized. Just fight your way to the front and order. Being agressive works to your advantage here. Talk to Dominic (the guy making the pizza) and he will like you and will know to serve you faster in the future. All that will help you. I still haven't and refuse to tell you the biggest secret though. Regardless of how long you wait, it is worth it though as this is the best pizza that exists. I have never met a person who didn't like it and about 75-80 percent of people I know would agree that this is by far the best pizza that exists. So what are you waiting for?

"We visited this place last saturday with a friend before a performance at MET. As a Turkish living in NY, I know how much to expect from Turkish restaurants considering some of the non-existent special ingredients that are easily found in Turkiye that may change a lot in a traditional dish. I also went to a few different Turkish restaurants before when my home-like food craving was intolarable and I was mostly disappointed either with the quality of the food or the service. However Beyoglu is exceptional! The service was good, we ordered and after 3 minutes we had everything on our table! The waitresses were welcoming and nice. We ordered meze and a chicken plate to share and I was surprised to taste that delicious meze plate. It was like my mum's style! I also ordered yogurt soup and that was very good too. (In other places what you'd get as yogurt soup is an inhomogeneous mixture of watery yogurt and rice) The place is also beautiful. The dinner tables are blue with ornaments that are traditional Turkish porcelain art. I had to wait a little for the rest room and when I was in the line I had a chance to have a quick look in the kitchen: I liked what I saw, it looked neat and clean. We had to rush because we were a little late, so we didn't have the chance to taste their dessert and Turkish coffee. I'm looking forward to visit the place to taste those goodies soon ;) I'd advise everyone to go check Beyoglu ASAP :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came by for brunch on a Sunday morning right when they opened. I'll review food and service separately. I ordered the Royal Eggs, with bacon. They were absolutely amazing, I generally am not a runny yolk person but these would be my exception. They came with toast, great combination. I opted to add bacon, which was a great choice. Bacon was perfectly cooked, crisp but not overdone. I don't even think this is the best brunch dish on the menu, i.e. It gets even BETTER. I will be back. Now, service. They have 5 star food, but 3 star service. We arrived right as the restaurant opened and were having a leisurely brunch, as it should be. The server came over within 3 minutes of us sitting down and asked if we were ready to order. Asked for a minute. Server came back every 3-5 minutes and was a bit pestering. Restaurant was still half empty, I wasn't sure what the hurry was and I don't enjoy being rushed. Ordered, asked to add bacon to my Royal Eggs. Got a massive plate of bacon that was just ridiculous for one person. I thought, no way $1 gets me this much bacon. I was right. Server added a full side of bacon. Not a big deal, just annoying. If I wanted a pound of bacon, I would ask for it. Lastly, asked to split the check between two cards and server put the wrong amount on the cards... Not sure if maybe it was an off day, or server was new, etc. I'll be back but will request another person. Would definitely recommend. Great place for brunch and I'm excited to go back and try their dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was led to Turco Mediterranean Grill by a friend who is a huge fan of lamb meat. In a spot that used to house a roast chicken joint, meat on a spit is still the theme. I had the Lamb Doner plate, which included a tasty, dressed salad, pita bread (a bit ordinary), excellent buttery rice, and nicely crisped lamb, cut right off the spit. My only complaint here is that the lamb didn't come off the spit in chips, but is one big meaty slice. My plate contained about 6 thin, yet large slices, each about 4 to 5 inches long. For $10, the plate is a bargain and was filling. There are also many sides that could be had for $5, mainly vegetable dishes. We also tried a Turkish yogurt drink, which was salty instead of sweet. If you could take salty yogurt, definitely give this $2 drink a try. Finally there is no table service at Turco, but the that's alright as the dining area is very utilitarian. The staff was also very friendly. For $10, friendly service and more than decent food, that is what the Cheap Guy wants!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had my friends birthday party at this place.  It was recommended by a buddy that works up there near 54th, and it was a great call.  The 3 Monkeys is an awesome place if you like a good times, sports, many, many draft beers, and food that is off the beaten path.  You might be able to get wings and a burger on the menu but the mussels were amazing, their sliders kicked ass, and it's just better and different than the typical american fare bar menu. The service was great. The bartenders all know their draft beers.  They know where their from, and most importantly how to describe how they taste. Lastly, the atmosphere was great for a Theater District bar.  It isn't very touristy,  Happy Hour specials were great, and they had a DJ later on.  I'm looking forward to going back there sometime soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After reading several rave reviews on this site, I decided to try what so many people were saying is basically the best ramen possible. I am a big fan of ramen but had never eaten it at a restaurant before. I often order udon at Japanese restaurants and I enjoy that very much, so I was expecting to be impressed by Ippudo's ramen. I ordered the Akamaru Modern and was decidedly underwhelmed. The noodles (in the straight Kyushu style unlike most ramen) were good, but the broth that so many people were raving about was nothing special. It was quite flavorful, but just wasn't all that memorable. My girlfriend who is from Korea and is more familiar with Japanese food than I am liked the Akamaru Modern less than I did. It was a decent bowl of ramen but I felt like an idiot paying 13 dollars for it (actually 15 if you want an egg boiled in the soup) when I can pick up a case of 24 instant Shin Ramyuns for 13 dollars at Costco. I wonder if people who rave about this ramen have had really good instant ramen. I for one believe that some of the Korean and Japanese brands of instant ramen, including the aforementioned Nong Shim Shin Ramyun, are better than Ippudo's ramen. If you want to go to a noodle restaurant go to Rai Rai Ken and save yourself some money or get a set of udon, kalbi, and rice for 11 dollars at the nearby Udon West instead of paying 16 dollars for ramen and four tiny strips of chicken over rice at Ippudo. That being said, the staff were very friendly at Ippudo and the decor wasn't bad either. If you simply want to try all the ramen that New York City has to offer and don't mind the price, try Ippudo. I caution you not expect the best ramen on the face of the planet though.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"There was a table of toddlers next to us. They (and their parents!) were acting like we were at a playground. I like kids. I'm a babysitter and a camp counselor. I don't like feeling them bump up against the table while I'm trying to eat. I know that it's not the restaurant's fault that other customers were acting like this. BUT when I said something to the staff, there was no response besides ""Well, they're paying the bill now."" As we were leaving we looked for a manager, but the hostess told us that the owner had stepped out, and that she wasn't sure who we should talk to about this. This meant there was an issue, and nobody who could actually fix it. The burger was alright, though kind of small. The onion rings were fine, and the sweet potato fries were good. I don't plan on going back (especially because the burgers at Pete's are way better!).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If it weren't so expensive, we would be regulars here. Service: 5 stars Drinks: 5 stars Food: 5 stars Atmosphere: 5 stars My husband and I came here for an early dinner, hoping to get walk-in seats at 6:30. Luckily, they had a table ready in 15 minutes! Had a cocktail while we waited, something with limoncello and lemonade, which was delicious but not too sweet. Every item of food was amazing. The smoked buffalo mozzarella had a delicious smoky flavor, the grilled calamari were clearly fresh and perfectly cooked, and the arugula complemented it nicely. My personal favorite was the scallops with wild mushrooms, which were quite large (they give you 3 scallops), perfectly cooked and went extremely well with the consistency of the mushrooms. Also had the arugula and pear salad, and branzino entree which consisted of fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection. Simple, and delicious. Service was friendly and helpful, without being overbearing. Though the place was a bit nondescript, it was refreshing to have an Italian restaurant that was neither too romantic nor too loud.

"What happens when a Williamsburg restaurant decides to appropriate soul food for the hipster set? Best case scenario: you get Pies-n-Thighs.

The sides are all fantastic, especially the cheese grits and burnt end baked beans. Portions are all huge, and the service is quick and friendly.

"To receive FIVE stars from me is rare, because it has to be more than just good food.  It has to impact me in such a way that I leave the restaurant location being very impressed and inspired to come back.  I will get to that in another paragraph. So I needed a place to hold a group dinner.  I came across this place on yelp! being that it was convenient and not really gearing towards good food. Further, I saw other reviews with 'fresh sushi' or all these five/four stars and was like HUH??  I assumed that no way in hell this place will have fresh anything because this is not ""megu' or 'morimoto' of the likes. haha.  Besides, it is next to another Japanese restaurant that is ALWAYS packed, even on mondays so how in the world Zest can compare?   So I literally came to this restaurant not expecting much except a place for normal food and drinks.  But boy was I wrong! I actually ordered scallop sashimi (a type of seafood that NOT MANY restaurants have it fresh and I rarely order it because of that. Further, I figure I test this place with scallop.)  After the first order, I had to order a SECOND one! HAHA! So I guess all these other reviews were not rigged after all!  (seriously, that is what I thought initially.)  Therefore, I do want to verify that I am very shocked by this but at the same time, I am happy that there is a joint with cute decor, great service AND food is seriously impeccable.  In addition, the tempura was great, the gyoza dumplings were awesome (the skin being thin and really discretely fried, wow!) AND the avocado salad was FRESH. I picked up the avocado and was like WHOA ~   IT was definitely freshly cut but the actual avocado seemed like it was chosen perfectly for that moment.   Obviously you can have GREAT food but if a location is lacking in other areas, I feel that it is not enough to deem it worthy for five stars. But with this place, what I noticed is the attention to detail - from the staff service to the owner's awareness of everything happening around him.  That to me, ladies and gentlemen, is priceless - there are no stars in the world that can be rated for these types of conscientious behaviors.  It is how they view as customers as being #1 and to go above and beyond customer service 101.  First up is that the time we arrived, the restaurant was busy.  Only my table was available because I reserved it.  The space we were situated in were a bit tight, so I suggested that I take the table next to me, once that party leaves. The waiter said of course I .  But that party was still trying to pay their bill (it would've been like another 4 min wait?) yet the owner saw that another area with more space opened up and recommended that we shift to that area.  VERY NICE!  Think about it - all i needed to was wait a few more minutes and to move to another area requires more work from the staff (I had a lot of things and people with me and it was a busy weeknight.)   We did not mind the shift because we definitely would love more room but usually the staff would want the 'easy way out'.  Not this time.  Although this situation may have seemed minor - it is not for someone who likes to pick on details and intentions of wait staff/managers/owners.  In addition, they felt that the music was a bit too loud for us (had kids)  and asked me if he would want us to lower the music just to accommodate us. They will turn it back up once we leave.  HELLO!!!  I Throughout the night, it was nonstop busy but the wait staff managed to service our group while running around attending to all the other tables. Bathroom was well-kept and the overall ambiance seemed like a happy one.  New customers looking at the menu outside seemed to walk in without much hesitation too.   Overall,  I am touched by these actions, although minor, it certainly goes a LOOOONG WAY.  Not just with me and my group yet these mini details will be greatly benefited in the long term towards the success of this joint.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Rarely have I encountered such a case when the gustatory component of an upscale dining experience was so unbalanced with the quality of service provided. Before you read on, I want to clarify. I definitely recommend Bouley! Let yourself become enveloped by the warmth and grandeur of the restaurant, with its floral curtains and indoor white pillars. My mother and I had the lunch tasting menu. If I were to describe the day's meal, I would say that it was a compilation of simple and yet sophisticated tastes and flavors that were both comforting and creative at the same time. The breads to start, the apple raisin mini loaf, herbed baguette, pistacchio rye, olive sourdough, and walnut rye were fun to taste. The bib salad, upon first inspection, seemed boring - a pretty arrangement of clean leaves, but beneath the greenery was heart of palm thinly sliced and paired with trumpet mushrooms that were tossed in a refreshing dressing. My tongue could not dissect the intricate flavors of the sauce, but truly, it was perfect for the marrying of crisp heart of palm and tender mushrooms. The porcini flan, OH the porcini flan!! If I hadn't known any better I would've thought this to be a Chinese crab soup complete with the corn starched broth. Hints of butter tickle your fancy, and you're brought back to the French essence of the dish. My mom, after her first spoonful, covered her mouth and said to me ""can we come back again?!"" The duck came with a most brilliant sauce, a trick of both the sweet and savory - honey and porcini puree. Even the palate clearing selection was excellent - perhaps even more notable than the actual dessert dish - a yogurt gelato, whose tartness so wonderfully contrasted with the slightly sweet and crunchy pineapple granite, all atop a smooth coconut soup. Bouley serves spectacular food - 5 stars!! But the service leaves much to be desired. Inconsistency was the theme of the day. Some servers were incredibly polite, thoughtful, and accommodating (from folding your napkin to pulling out your chair for you to directing you to the restroom), while others were not so attentive and even a bit cold. Our neighbors at a nearby table were given full descriptions of the ingredients of each dish when dishes were brought to their table, while our servers only did so for the amuse bouche and otherwise somewhat carelessly dropped off our other food and left. Lastly I'll note that the dishes came out a bit too fast, so I did feel like I was getting rushed to finish my lunch. At a fine dining restaurant such as Bouley, that's definitely not something a patron should experience. I sincerely hope that servers and managers alike read this review. Every restaurant could benefit from some constructive criticism, and I do hope that upon my return the service at Bouley will be just as wonderful as the food served. I can't wait to be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you are longing for a close to your apartment delicious barbecue, look no further and go now! I am a fan of Texas barbecue. I love Memphis as well. I strongly dislike anything from NC. That said, this brisket and pulled pork took me on an adventure to Texas and Memphis combined. It's remarkably tender and juicy and packed with unique spice.

"Okay so the food really is as amazing as they say.  The pork tacos will change your life. But the service.  Wowzers.  *Bad*. I've been going for a year with no problems but I went tonight and the manager - a nasty bearded fellow named Vincenzo (a.k.a. ""Che Che"" or something?) - was *awful*.  Completely ruined the experience and I won't be going back. Just a sampling of his behaviour: After my whole group of eight ordered (rather expensive) margaritas and (rather expensive) guacamole, everyone mentioned how thirsty we were.  They hadn't brought us any water.  So I asked the group who wanted water and everyone said yes.  I then asked this Che Che guy, very politely, for waters.  And with a huge amount of attitude, he said, ""WHO exactly wants water?""  And I replied, ""Everybody please."" And he turned to the group and demanded, ""Who wants water???"" and only a couple of people heard him and said yes.  So he turns to me and says, ""Only three people want waters.  I know how it goes otherwise - I bring people water and they don't drink it.""  Seriously buddy?  A fight over a request for water?  When we weren't even finished our food and drinks, he told us that people were waiting and that we needed to move to the bar.  We had been there about 40 minutes, 20 of which were spent waiting for our (delicious) tacos.  I said we'd leave just as soon as we finished our food and drinks and paid - we were by no means lingering and had no intention of doing so.  He freaked.  I'll save you having to hear the rest of the drama.

"The broth is so fulfilling, but that's about it. The noodles are literally RAMEN? Well not for all the dishes, but the most famous/ippudo noodle with ippudo sauce.  Its pure ramen. We also ordered the tuna tartar which was delicious, but deserved more lotus chips. I asked for a refill and they said the chips will cost $2. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Theyre worth NOTHING. I can buy a whole dam lotus in chinatown for less than a buck! Of course i said HECK NO.  We also had the galbi dish, which was just as yummy, but def not worth the money! Their pork ration in the noodles are cheap, along with the eggs. I honestly did not think it was anything much special. But you get filled up if you had appetizers. A word of advice: make reservations, otherwise you'd be waiting at their bar area which is cramped as heck, for about 2 hours for a table. RIDICULOUS. I think this place is just WAY overrated. You want asian food? or good noodles? for a cheap price? go to chinatown. you want to overpay? go to ippudo.

"Great pizza but insane wait times. I have visited this establishment on several occasions. Its a bit of a novelty among NY pizza shops, its one of the few places where the owner is making the pizza exclusively. The round slices are great but what puts this place over the top are the squares, its also expensive, $5 a slice, double many other places. The one warning is that you should not get a slice with artichokes, it will take forever for you to get your pizza if you do, I waited an hour and half for one of them, it was not worth the wait, in most ways the pizza is so perfect, toppings are unnecessary. Dom puts fresh Basil and parmesan on the pizza which makes it perfect. This place is also packed on weekends. It kind of feels like a tourist trap but its not, they also have articles about the best rated pizza shops in NY, this place is one of the best but I would have really hard time saying it is the best. Quite a few places in the five boroughs can easily compete with Difara's, L&B is one of them. I have to update, this review, I recently went there again a week ago, and I noticed the round pies are a lot smaller and the square pies also a bit smaller. Still they actually taste even better now. Still its a long wait and its best to be there early.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Finally! I got in. Just like that feeling when you finally beat your dad in basketball. And that was last week. HE HAS MOVES FOR A 69 YEAR OLD MAN! It's hard to get in. Like like Fort Knox, you can easily walk into the restaurant, however they may laugh at you if you expect to get a table for four at 8 at night. You'll probably have to walk right back out. So I planned to get there at 6:30 on a Wednesday evening. I was in a race against the clock and it was close, but I prevailed. Glad I did too, within minutes of getting inside and grabbing a table for two, the place was packed. Nothing but a good sign! We started off by ordering the famous sides I heard so much about. We were hungry and wanted to eat some of them as appetizers. We got the spinach gratin and the pan fried mashed potatoes. I was really excited for the potatoes, but I have to say, I wasn't overly thrilled. They were still great though. The spinach was just superb though, in comparison. I'm glad we split it, because I could have eaten trays of it if no one stopped me. As for our cuts of meat, I ordered the butcher's steak while my girlfriend ordered the veal flank steak. Now, I don't like medium well. My girlfriend does, but I don't. It seems unholy. But wow, that veal flank was phenomenal, despite the fact it was medium well. My butcher's steak, done rare, was fantastic as well. I can't wait to get the veal for myself next time though, the way I like it. You must get the veal if you come here. In the end, the place doesn't hurt your wallet either. Very fair prices for some great pieces of meat. You should plan you own near impossible mission inside of St. Anslem.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Long wait, but worth it! Put your name down, then go get a coffee. I really love how some NYC restaurants are taking phone numbers and will text you when your table is ready. You then have 5 minutes to get there for your table (so don't go too far for coffee). BLT Bloody Mary is awesome, and a good move especially if you're really hungry because it's essentially an appetizer with half a hard boiled egg and a slice of crispy bacon in it! Biscuit breakfast sandwich was great too! I got sausage and it was enormous. I'm usually hesitant to just get a sandwich when there are no sides, but it was plenty to eat, esp. since I had the Bloody Mary too. They have some communal tables, which is where I sat with my two friends, which I don't have a problem with, although the girl next to me stabbed a cherry tomato and it squirted on to my white sweater, but she was really nice about it and gave me her Tide To Go pen.

"Holy Lemon Pasta!!!!! Coming from an Italian mother and Spanish father, I know good food- let me tell ya! I've been coming to Supper for years, but had a particularly good meal there the other day and thought I would jump back into my yelping. This place has solid pastas all around- their ""priest stranglers"" are light and delicious, the bolognese's meat sauce is rich and flavorful, and the tomato and basil spaghetti is just as good as any you'd eat in Italy. However, the lemon pasta is the number one thing that keeps me coming back. I've tart so that you literally feel like you are eating a lemon, or not enough and it just tastes like you're eating pasta with cheese. Supper achieves the perfect balance and it's just right every time. Seems to be the case with most of their food, and that's why I gave them four stars. Not five stars because they are cash only, which is just annoying and SO East Village- and also because there is ALWAYS a wait. I guess other people share my sentiments about the food!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I ordered their special blackberry lemonade which is served in a cute little jar glass, and it was a little sweet for my taste, but nevertheless great. Now, I love their breakfast foods, they're classics but always with a little twist on it such as their lemon ricotta pancakes. Yummm. I had their buttermilk fried chicken salad. I didn't like the buttermilk ranch dressing so I only used the chipotle dressing but I thought it was great. The chicken has a little spice to it which was a pleasant surprise. I haven't been able to get dessert once because I've been so full but they all look amazing and the people around us definitely devoured theirs! It's a great place to grab Sunday brunch or just go to for a casual dinner with friends.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Absolutely overrated.  The noodle was terrible, canned soup taste better than their soup/broth and the pork.......the pork was so thick, dry and had no flavor.  This is the worst noodle I have ever eaten.  The only suggestion I have for everyone is ""DON'T GO!"" And there was tuna appetizer dish. Way to salty.  Horrible place!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"What a darling place! I had a lovely brunch at Jack's Wife Freda, and would certainly recommend it. The space is pretty small and most parties are seated at long community tables, but a few two-tops are available as well. I came in a party of three and we were seated in about 15 minutes, and they gave us coffee and juice while we waited outside. The food itself was unbelievable. I had the Mediterranean breakfast and rose water waffle and absolutely loved both. The atmosphere is lovely and the place doesn't feel cramped, despite being small. I recommend it wholeheartedly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of the very first places I ate at visiting NY for the first time. And since then I've been back numerous times introducing as many people as possible to this hole in the wall. The restaurant is located on the other side of Chinatown where not too many tourists frequent. The front is very reminiscent of places in Taiwan, especially how they keep the refrigerated drinks outside. The only thing missing is the lady that sits out front making dumplings from a bucket. Inside, there are probably 12 seats max. Noodle dishes are roughly $5. And 12 fried dumplings can be had for $3. The noodles are hand pulled on the marble slab located in the back. It is entertaining but loud and shocking especially while trying to eat. The array of sauces in squeeze bottles are unlabeled so I randomly choose what to add. Favorite right now is #11 noodles with minced pork. We also usually leave with 50 frozen dumplings ($9.50).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Il Bambino is not only one of the best spots in Astoria, but if it were placed in NYC, it would be one of the best there as well. The vibe is real cool, laid back. The decor is not overdone.

The paninis are not something I mess with as they are too big, but that doesnt mean they are bad. Everyone I have been with has good things to say. ***UPDATE - They now have dessert options.

"I never understand why Korean food is so expensive (maybe someone can explain it to me). But thanks to Woorijip, I'm allowed to enjoy the flavor of Korean cuisine, without having to fork over an arm, a leg or even my wallet. After some serious shopping, I decided to take a quick break to grab something good to eat. Without any hesitation, I decided to go to Woorijip because here, their foods are always fresh, the selections are good, and there are always enough seats to go around. Being that Woorijip is also a buffet ($6.99/lb), I usually like to try a little bit of everything when I'm there. Their food is never disappointing; in fact, some of them taste pretty interesting yet always yummy. If buffet is not your style, Woorijip also offer pre-packaged food for you to grab and go (perfect for microwave dinners or the office) and if that still doesn't fancy your interest, well then you can order food from their in-house kitchen, which I have yet to try.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"if you're expecting the typical blah dining experience, this isn't for you. nothing is what it seems, but it's pretty f*cking amazing. i definitely don't go often enough, but when i do, i am always pleased. here's what i've had: nippon nachos - tasty, good for beginners e666s-6 - flavorful and different shishito quatre sel - tasty, not mind blowing, but good to snack on foie gras doughnut - first of all, dough (the doughnut spot also in bk) is great to begin with, throw some foie gras in it? decadent. i do recommend to share this because it's super rich. a chicken and woffals - delish a fish and some chips - it's a whole fish, people. delish. i was also one of the few that had the opportunity to try the biggie special - a t-bone steak, cheese eggs & (not welch's) grape. served on a ginormous platter. shared it with my 2 roommates, awesome. other tips: 1. get their version of a pickleback. ask one of the owners how it's made. science. 2. dine outside when it's nice out. that backyard isn't there for nothing. i had no idea who justin warner was when i first ate there, one of my manhattan friends wanted to try it when it first opened and we did. now i live 3 blocks away. the staff, as well as justin, are super friendly and accommodating (i've gone there with a lactose intolerant friend). and i like listening to hip hop while i dine.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Having recently watched the Bourdain episode where he explore Emilia Romagna with Michael White, my husband and I decided we had to eat at Michael's restaurant when we would be in NY the next month for my work trip.  Literally, the minute the show was over we booked a table at Osteria Morini! I made reservations for 4 of us on a Tuesday night at 8pm.  We arrived at the cute, dark, small, bustling space a few minutes early and ordered some interesting cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table.  We were sat promptly at 8 in the small dining room.  The space has lots of energy, and is lively without being too loud/noisy.  There were four of us, and we could all hear each other without having to yell ""what?!?"" over the table.  We had to wait a bit for our server to come over, but we were enjoying ourselves and the many menu options so didn't really mind.   If it had been just my husband and I, we would've done lots of the meats and cheese options, but we were with two other diners who weren't very into it...so passed on that route.  We decided to share a bunch of stuff and here's what we got: For starters, we got the Polpettine prosciutto & mortadella (meatballs baked in tomato sauce); Calamari stuffed with parmigiano with kale and stewed tomatoes; and the Stracci pasta dish: pasta rags, braised wild mushrooms, rosemary oil.  They were all amazing.  The meatballs were so flavorful and the perfect texture, and the marinara sauce had just the right hint of sweetness.  The calamari were just oozing with cheese, and even though you wouldn't normally think calamari and cheese are a good pairing, they are.  Trust me.  The pasta was like super wide paperdelle (my favorite pasta) and was cooked perfectly.  All of us thoroughly enjoyed the starters. For my entree I got the striped bass special, which had perfectly seared crispy skin and was delicious.  Eric got the Porchetta spit roasted hampshire pork, sage, rosemary, which was a giant portion.  It was really good and flavorful, but he thought it was definitely over-salted.  One friend got the gnocchi with beef cheek ragú, dried cherries, black olives.  We all tried and liked the dish.  I wasn't crazy about the dried cherries (odd I thought) but there weren't many so it was only a hint.  The beef cheek ragu was of course delicious because, well, it's beef cheek and can't be anything but delicious.  Our other friend got the grilled Mediterranean sea bass fillets, salsa verde, market beans, tomato sofrito.  We all tried bites of everyone's meal and we all liked what we tasted.   We shared two desserts...a rosemary panna cotta with fall apples and pine nuts and olive oil gelato.  Both were to die for.  Well, we only each got a tiny taste of the panna cotta as it's Eric's favorite dessert ever and he wouldn't really share.  We were lucky we got to taste it! The service was just okay.  That was my only thing I wasn't crazy about.  He was decent, but not very attentive.  Took our order, brought our wine, but didn't check in to see how things were or if we needed anything.  Then we had a real problem finding our server after we made a mistake paying the bill.  He dropped the check and literally disappeared.  It took quite a bit of time for us to get him to come back to fix the mistake. The food was very good, but I did feel it was a tad expensive for the ""osteria"" casual vibe.  It was $420 with tax and tip for the 4 of us.  Granted, it's NYC, and all meals are expensive, but I felt it was slightly high for what we got.   I would recommend it though, just realize you aren't getting out cheap.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a great tapas place. It's tiny and not much to look at from the outside, or even the inside really, but the food and service speak for themselves. I had a groupon and the staff immediately put in our sangria order so the fun could begin. We got the patatas bravas, cheese platter, salad with fried artichokes, and the pan con tomate. The patatas bravas were excellent.  The cheese platter came with fruit-studded bread and a small bit of marcona almonds, Spanish olives, and these amazing soaked cherries. The salad was so delicious, especially the dressing. The waiter was nice to ask the kitchen about  the dressing because we were curious (it's a reduced aoili-type dressing.) The tomato bread came with olive tapenade, fava bean dip (delicious!), and a sweet pepper mix. It was the perfect amount to share and feel satisfied but not overly stuffed. Everything tasted very, very good and fresh, and the service was probably the best I've had in the city in terms of overall politeness/friendliness. Much better than I expected, great experience overall. I will be coming back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wanted to like it, I l really did. But this was my second visit here and I just can't recommend this place. The communal tables are awkwardly placed. It's one thing to share a table with strangers, it's quite another to be hemmed in against the wall with no means of egress. Not well thought out. The music is a tad too loud and not suitable to dining or having a conversation. The menu has changed and became smaller. Not much if a choice if you don't want a burger, a hot dog, a flat bread or mac and cheese. The food, while it tastes good, is EXTREMELY salty. And that's from someone who has pretty high tolerance for pickes, Bulgarian feta and all things salty. Still feeling like I drank some sea water the morning after is not a good feeling. It's expensive for what it is. Two burgers, one juice and a shared appetiser will set you back sixty dollars without tip. All in all, while I'm always searching for that perfect veggie burger, I'll have to pass on MOB in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had shrimp moqueca and neither I nor her thought it was acceptable. The caipirinhas weren't right, and overpriced ($8). The music was American pop music instead of Brazilian mpb, funk, axe, samba, bossa nova... anything but Britney Spears. Another thing that struck me as strange was that working the grill were two Central American gentleman. Not problematic for any reason, but surprising. Wasn't a very Brazilian experience for us overall. I recommend Brazil grill in midtown. Caipirinhas are $4 usually, and mixed perfect, especially by Samuel. Food is outstanding, too. The service was fine, and nothing stood out as terribly negative, but it wasn't enjoyable overall.

"I went to drop by a visit to my friend Draven in Midtown last week and we were setting out to have ramen since it was frigid outside, but little did we know the line was out the door and the wait was long. Next, we went into Joe's Shanghai and it was packed, long wait. So we finally stuck with Tina's Cuban Cuisine. It's been a while since I had Cuban food and I was a little nervous, but curious as to what Tina's had to offer. It was very busy since it was smacked dabbed at lunch hour, but luckily there was a table and seats for us. I was in a mood for big and juicy pieces of beef stew, so I ordered the beef stew with rice and beans. I was amazed at how the dish was so filled up. Besidse the beef stew, rice and beans; the dish also came with: potatoes and pepper. Overall, I loved the dish especially the sauce that was all over the rice and beans, it was absolutely perfect. Unfortunately, two or three pieces of my beef stew was dried, which wasn't good. I really didn't like the texture, so I didn't eat it, but I think the dish overall was perfect. Draven ordered the ground beef stew with rice and beans, which looked amazing. Both of the dishes were $9.00, which isn't so bad especially for the portion size. Hot food & stew  is great for a cold day. It really hit all the spots. I haven't had  Cuban food in a long time, so when I had it I instantly fell in love and was totally happy. It put a smile on my face. The service was pretty good and the food was pretty damn good and I may want to return here if I'm ever in the area. Now, I'm craving for Cuban food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"BRUSH YOUR TONGUE W/ FALSETTO 4.5STARS! It was avg at best! This place is ideal for those who have a show in the Theater District and need a quick meal. They definitely are quick, but too bad the quality isn't all that. If you go to their website and read about the history of the restaurant, you will come to know that it's owned by a Gonzalez. Last I checked, Speedy Gonzalez was a Mexican mouse right? A Gonzalez opening an Italian restaurant made me skeptical but I had to try the squid ink pasta based on reading many kudos here. As we were waiting for our food, we overheard the table next to us, who ordered the clam chowder ($7), say that it tasted more like clam broth. It definitely looked super watered down to me. That's what the waiter refers to as 'it's very light' in his description of the soup. Saved myself $7 right there. The bad thing is if you are a party of 2 w/o resys, you are stuck by the cocktail table, a small round table w/ stool chairs.  The good thing is that you can order half pasta entrees for 1/2 price plus a dollar. I could get better pasta at Dean & Deluca. No joke. I WON'T BE BACK!!!! Bread - basket is a joke, w/ sesame italian bread. It's not even gourmet. Ordered: -Linguine Neri alla Monsignori Homemade ""black linguini"" pasta ($18) [sautéed with fresh shrimp, scallops, squid, little neck clams, & mussels in a light marinara sauce] - ample seafood, but tasteless sauce and lackluster pasta made for a WAY OVERHYPED DISH!!! -Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($9/half portion) [Italian bacon, herbs, & onions sauteed with cream or chicken broth] - Spaghetti wasn't bad, this dish was the lesser of the two evils, but that's not saying much, the pancetta wasn't crispy at all. Total came out to $18/pp after everything","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went in without a reservation and had to sit and eat at the bar. Unfortunately the bartender looked like he wanted nothing to do with us and his disgust grew as we couldn't pronounce half of the menu. However.....the food was AMAZING! We started with a cheese and meat plate, then ordered the meatballs. Probably the best meatball I've ever had. Then one of the managers....I think his name was Phil...came by to make sure we were enjoying everything. We were about to pay but he encouraged us to order it least one pasta dish. We ordered the one he recommended and I must say, that was the best pasta I have ever had! I am glad he mentioned it! Next time I would avoid the bar entirely. Not only for the rude bartender but also because it really got crowded. I left to use the restroom towards the end of the meal, had to squeeze through a crowd and then return to find several people asking if I was leaving anytime soon. Next time we'll make a reservation and have Phil order for us :) But really.....best Italian I have found in NYC so far.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Maybe I didn't have enough to drink before enjoying NYC's most famous landmark to it's fullest, but the dehydration I had next morning makes that doubtful. Personally, I found chicken and rice to be mostly just hype and everyone you see up there and not actually the food itself. After grabbing a cab up, we waited in line. The wait itself wasn't too bad. It seems like half of New York is looking to grab a chicken and rice fix at the late hours and you get some interesting characters. The line moves quick since they have it all down to a streamlined process. For 6 bucks you get a tin filled with a boatload of food: meat (finely chopped chicken and/or gyro meat), jasmine rice, a couple pieces of pita, and a small amount of iceberg lettuce. As a survivor of various college diets such as the ""hot pocket diet"", the ""Domino's diet"" and the ""lots of beer diet"", I don't underplay any sort of vegetation that reaches my body. I ended up smothering everything with white sauce and some hot sauce before we got our seats. After mixing it all up and eating a bit, I realized the small bits that didn't get a generous coating of white sauce ended up lacking flavor and slightly dry. Heading back to get more sauce, this time instead of hot sauce I grabbed bbq sauce by accident. It adds good flavor too. I dunno. I wish the meat was at least slightly seasoned. I guess it's the downfall to all the hype; to keep output high enough to feed the drunken masses, there has to be a drop in quality. A couple friends confirmed my thoughts noting that it used to be much better before it's fame grew to be larger than that of the Statue of Liberty. Realistically it shouldn't be called halal cart, it should be called white sauce cart; too bad that would make it sound a bit too sexual.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you're reading about Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare on Yelp you're either wishing you get the opportunity to eat here, reminiscing about your amazing meal, or just heard about the place and want to know what the all the fuss is about. For me personally, this was the best meal of my life.  It was also the best experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Yes I'm not a rich man and it cost me $700+ for 2 people but with that combination plus the fact it was for a special occasion made it worth it. I can sit here and give you the whole megillah but as others have also mentioned I can't do it any justice.  I will list the highlights. - Such an intimate setting.  Just 18 guests who are all as eager as you sitting around a semicircle table watching the kitchen prepare all the meals.  It's always amazing seeing professionals do their thing whether its artists or athletes.  This time it was chefs. - The chef Cesar is such a humble, cool guy.  The whole staff for that matter.  I chatted with most of them throughout the night.  They really made the night feel special. - 20+ tasting course of just amazing fresh seafood.  I am not a foodie and I don't pretend to be so I can't tell you what they did to make everything so excellent but they served dishes I've never seen before.  For me that was the best, tasting things I never have before and might never taste again. - Desert and wine were just as amazing. I anxiously awaited eating here for the entire 6 weeks since I was able to make a reservation.  The night exceeded expectations and then some.  If you can do it make the call and hopefully you can get a reservation.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"On our vacation in New York, the boyfriend and I were looking for a good bar for beer on tap to just sit back and relax. The selection of beer here is definitely good, but the douchebaggery was almost unbearable. We should have known what we were getting ourselves into the moment we walked in - too-loud music, and people who were trying really REALLY hard to seem like the nonchalant-but-cool kid in class. But we figured hey, it was worth it for this kind of selection of beer in an unfamiliar town. So we sat there minding our own business, trying to focus on the sports news on the flat-screens over the bar. Which normally would have worked, if the douchebag with the popped collar didn't alternate with the too-drunk dumb breezy, rubbing up all over me because they lost their sense of a personal bubble because they were too busy playing aloof with one another. Not to mention that service left a lot to be desired. The chick behind the bar definitely thought she was hot stuff. Haha. To the point where I'm pretty sure she forgot that the point of her being there was actually serving drinks? A lot of the time that we spent at the bar consisted of watching her flipping her rat's nest of a mess of hair around while perpetually holding an empty pint glass with a confused look on her face. We did look forward to this place because a review we read specifically mentioned the lack of douchebaggery, and there were a bunch of different types of beers available. I unfortunately would not agree (about the douchbaggery). I almost choked here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Loved this place. I'm Middle Eastern so I can be particular about my falafel. This place is one of my favorites in the city. I had the deluxe sandwich both times, and love the spinach and hot falafel. Never had any of the sides, but my friend had the fries and said they were good. Love the lemonade drink with the fresh sen-sen. Place is pricey for falafel, and gets crowded as everything in this area does at lunchtime. But when I get a hankering for falafel it's my go-to place in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After two years of living in New York, this former southerner has found a restaurant that has hands down perfected the chicken biscuit/sandwich. Originally found by googling for places to find Po Boys in NYC, Cheeky's is now my favorite place to spend lunchtime on a Sunday. Nestled neatly on Orchard Street, you might pass right by it unless you're looking for a seemingly signless spot that appears to have been transported from New Orleans, post Katrina. As previously mentioned, the Chicken Biscuit is simple and perfect. A delicious biscuit, sweet pink cole slaw, white gravy and Crispy Fried Chicken. (Although the biscuit was a bit well done the second time around, it didn't hinder the flavor.) The Shrimp Po Boy is exactly what you're looking for if you're longing for the taste of Burbon Street. Also... Bite size Cafe Du Monde style beignets are available while you wait for your sandwich. The place is small so there isn't much room, but if you can sit at the table which was once a Winn Dixie sign, sip a Root Beer and take pleasure in chowing down at one of the best sandwich places in the city. Definitely my favorite.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm looking at some of the reviews below and I would probably say that my two stars are the result of bad timing.  Unfortunate, but these things happen. A bit of a trek, for sure, but we were hanging out with friends who live in Carroll Garden and had a car so it was no big deal. The setup is not unlike Hill Country, in that it's cafeteria style (you go get your vittles from the guy behind the counter, etc.) and there's a room with a stage for live music. It was a Saturday and we got there at 8:30ish and maybe got on the food line at 8:45.  By the time we got to the front, they had run out of half the items on the menu.  This is somewhat of a problem if your menu only has like five items on it. They were out of the pulled pork and the baby back ribs when we got to the front.  Additionally, I believe we snagged the last of the jalapeno sausages.  On top of that, the beef ribs we got were extremely fatty.  The brisket was not bad. On the plus side, the drinks were great.  They have a good selection of booze and suds and the bartenders were fun. So, while I won't be going back there anytime soon, if you're going to check it out, my suggestion would be to go early.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Every time I am in the Lower East Side (LES), no matter what day of the week it is, I always end up at the Meatball Shop. On weekends, I walk up Orchard to find my favorite restaurant still packed at 3:30 AM but manage to find a spot at the bar or standing in the corner to the right. This place is amazing. It has never let me down and I have come to trust their food and service to the point where I insist on bringing everyone I know that is visiting NY to this little shop in the LES. It's almost always usually packed and when it is, the host can take down your phone number and call you when there are seats available. The wait can take some time but it's so worth it! When you do have the fortunate chance of getting a seat during peak hours, you'll be given a laminated menu and an erasable marker for you to mark your order. My meal has not changed in the past two years: spicy pork meatballs, spicy meat sauce, and a side of spaghetti w/ no cheese. Of course I'll recommend that but don't restrict yourself to the menu! Look at the chalkboard on the wall next to the kitchen. The Meatball shop will list any daily specials on here and sometimes these are absolutely incredible. I love the Meatball Shop and I hope you do too!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came in with 3 friends and we started with 4 different cocktails, everyone tasting each others, the drinks are innovative and very flavourful. We then decided to order pretty much everything on the menu to share so we could experience every dish. I have to say that each dish is unique as well as delicious. The menu is well thought out and creative, using great quality ingredients. The Smoked Char Rillette and Beef Tendon puffs got everyone's attention and surely a great sign of what was to come. Everything that followed was met with pleasure sighs and positive comments. The Ribeye melts in your mouth and was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the Gnocchi is out of this world! The desserts are suberb and original. The service is fantastic, not one  detail was overlooked. Bravo. I look forward to returning.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It will be great it they make it a minimum $10 order because they may be losing customers who just don't need so much food - my dinner was complete with $7.50 worth of food, the rest was extra order to take it over $10, so $15 would be a challenge!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Living across from Westville is a gift from the heavens. They serve a wide variety of fresh foods with something for everyone. Particularly wonderful is the plate of market sides. These will almost certainly be the most tasty vegetables you will ever eat. Westville also has a great turkey burger. I've even had a perfect steak (from a specials list) there. The only problem is the long lines to get in for lunch, dinner or weekend brunch. That's why my review is not 5 stars. I don't have the patience to wait 45+ minutes, and they don't take reservations. That said, their takeout and delivery is well organized and speedy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Found this place on Yelp. Awesome. You must order the gnocchi with pancetta appetizer and the grilled octopus is absolutely delicious. My duck was cooked perfected, medium, but the risotto was a bit hard. The kale (I hope I remember correctly) was great too. My friend had the sirloin it had a such a great seared crust on the outside and cooked perfectly medium. Delicious. All the proteins were farm raised, organic and free range. The restaurant prides itself using and support local farms. Desert was kind of a miss. We just ordered the ice cream and sorbet. Vanilla was great, dark bitter chocolate sorbet was heavy and rich and the apple cider sorbet was a bit too icy but still has enough flavor to enjoy. Would return and check out the bar on the 16th floor. Sweet views.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Their pizzas taste good because their ingredients taste fresh as promised. The tomato sauce is definitely a level above average but not excellent. It tasted really good the first 5 visits and then I started hunting for white-pizza options. And that's how I discovered their special clam-garlic pizza. This is definitely worth the long wait and your moolah. This flavor maybe available in many pizza/pasta restaurants. But, very few get the flavor right. I'm not a too much of a fan of garlic. However, Lombardi managed to strike a good balance with plenty of clams and garlic to make this pizza an A. If you go lombardi's, even if you are not a fan of ""white "" pizzas, you will not regret this!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I recently dined at blend on the water . I must say I was in aw with the restaurant it self it was beautiful with breath taking views . The service is extremely attentive from the moment you walk in and your greeted by Syeda at the deskshe is  very sweet welcoming efficient and professional . I was accommodated as promptly as possible considering it was a Saturday night and my party did not have a reservation . We even received a text when our table was ready . The server Michelle was truly awesome very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly and made us feel comfortable .Michelle even noticed our food was taking too  long and with out us having to ask she came told us that she would find out what was taking so long . I've been in the hospitality industry for quite sometime  and that kind of initiative could turn a bad situation right around which it did . The spiced shrimp were to die for I honestly think it should be an entree as I could not get enough, next time I go I  will just order three of those. We ordered the churrasco and the pollo a la plancha . The churrasco was cooked just as I ordered and it was succulent and juicy  but smaller than I had imagined very thin but other wise yummy.  The pollo a la plancha which by definition should be grilled, it was not , might of been poached (truth in menu laws people) but my friend said it was still very good although she preferred my chimichurri sauce to her mystery sauce.  Over all it was a great experience, I did forget to mention how delicious they're passion fruit margaritas are OMG . I would definitely return and recommend it to my friends .","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is mediocre at best, and I'm only giving it three stars because so many people honestly like coming here.  Personally, I think the Levee is on par with all the young townie bars every city has.  You have your cheap drinks, billiard table, crummy food, and arcade games at the back.  A few booths so you can shout at your friends while sitting down and a handful of incomplete board games to play when you're really far gone.  This place follows a tried and true formula and doesn't offer anything special or unique.   I think the appeal is that the Levee could be anywhere, Cleveland, Ohio, Buffalo, NY, or Des Moines, Iowa, it doesn't matter!  You can feel like you're back where you grew up, hanging out with all the lifers; without worrying about sitting next to your ex girlfriend or bumping into that bully from 9th grade at the urinal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Friday nights always mean hanging out with friends for happy hour until 9 and then meet my girlfriend for dinner. This week we decided to swing out to Brooklyn again and for Pies 'n' Thighs. Checked yet another place off out to try list. We ordered the Fried Chicken Box with Mac 'n' Cheese and also a Chicken Biscuit with Smoked Pork Collards. For dessert we had the Banana Cream Pie. The fried chicken was really good. Crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was also perfectly seasoned; not too salty but not too bland. Unfortunately that was really the highlight of the meal. The biscuit that came with it was just ehh. Same with the mac. I've had better mac and cheese before. The Chicken Biscuit was really nothing special. The chicken was a bit dry but that wasn't even the worst part. The proclaimed spicy sauce and maple butter was on the plate with the biscuit which just made everything one soggy mess to eat. The collard greens were good enough but still not great. Finally for the banana cream pie, I'd pass on this too. The crust was rock hard. It took two hands to force the spoon through the crust. Good banana flavor in the cream but a pain to eat. I don't like banana flavored foods enough to make that effort. They're a pretty busy and popular place although I don't really understand why. Yeah their fried chicken is really good but a lot of places make good fried chicken. My girlfriend even went as far as saying that my homemade fried chicken is better. I don't pay her to say these things! Really I don't!","[1.0, 0.0]"

We were adventurous and ordered apps we've never tried before and were very happy with our selections. The taro wontons are addictive. Give it a second cuz they come out pretty much straight out from the fryer. Crispy outside and rich purple taro yumminess on the inside. The steamed shrimp dumplings topped with pumpkin/coconut sauce was really tasty too. It has chunks of pumpkin... So ready for the fall... Bring on the pumpkin everything! We weren't too original for our entrees and both ordered our favorite... Pad Thai. I got shrimp and the hub got it with beef. The plates came just as I saw in pictures on yelp... Plentiful, not too dry or wet with the sauce. It was the right level of sweet and my shrimp did not have a fishy taste or smell so they were fresh.

The complimentary bread is crispy and delicious, and the olive oil was genuine. The two of us each tried a lunch special -- I the fried flounder and he the fried sardines. Both were enormous and we were very happy we didn't get appetizers! The flounder portion was enormous and we ended up eating half of it for dinner.

Of course that was in 2002.Wont be able to do that any more. Also ate some delish meals at very reasonable prices. Italian ices were great.

"AWWWW YEAH. LOVING IT. damn this place is good. my friends took me here after a whole day of me not eating, and i was ready TO GO TO TOWN when I got to this small, and yes kind of cramped joint. however, their food is downright phenomenal so the loooong wait, the cramped seating, and even the shitty waitress only got me annoyed enough to take a single star off. let me start off with the positives: JUST GET THE CHICKEN ENCHILADA. do it now. just go. right now. best experience of your life, man. I am a life-long devotee of their red sauce. The texture of the beans, the flavor of the rice, the oomph of their chicken. YUMMY!!!! THE NACHOS THAT THEY GIVE YOU FOR FREE IN THE BEGINNING, plus the incredible and SPICY salsa that comes with it. I went through like two baskets of these bad boys. Soooooo tastayyyy. POLLO FLAUTA. MMMMMMMMMM. so good. so goood. I was still hungry after my enchilada (because I hadn't eaten all day, not because it wasn't filling) so I went ahead and got this perfectly crunchy, light and hearty deliciousosity (yes i made this word up) and it was a wonderland on my taste buds. negatives: - waitress was inattentive, tried to rush us, seated us really late, and miscalculated the cash we gave her (read: tried to steal our 5 bucks!) - they weren't quick with the water - i had to ask personally for a refill, and my friends who had ordered drinks needed to also specifically tag down our waitress to get some water for themselves. - its super crowded, so its kind of loud and cramped (decor is really cute though, so it kind of makes up for it) THE POINT: Don't expect the service to rock. Come here for the FOOD. because it IS SO GOOD, AND NOT REALLY EXPENSIVE AT ALL. best mexican joint in lower east side I've had yet!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As a vegetarian, it's hard to find mexican food that extends beyond beans and rice so I was thrilled to try Taqueria Diana's poblano taco.  Unfortunately, it's the only veggie option (mushroom taco or summer squash with kale are some other things I'd love to see on the menu), but it IS delicious (and surprisingly not too spicy). The tacos are all priced around $3, add an extra $1 for cheese, guacamole, and sour cream.  You'll need at least 3 tacos for a light meal and up to five or six for a full tummy- so it can get pricey fast.  But for a grab and go satisfying snack, it's definitely worth a trip.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I don't know the exact number of restaurants the city has to offer, what i do know is that  Yerbabuena is one of those places where you always feel at home. We had our wedding in the city and decided to stop by and toast with a couple of ""poquito picantes"" that is their best drink and our favorite  so do yourself a favor and try it!! don't be afraid if by reading the cocktail menu you think you are about to drink a salad, The flavor's that this drink have will blow your mind away. The food was an outstanding mix of traditional latin food with a gourmet twist, just the right amount of spices and even if you are not used to spicy food i promise you that the explotion of flavor's that your mouth will experience will take your mind back home wherever that may be. If you are in the mood for a Latin American tour without living the city go ahead and try their whole menu as you will find a mix of cultures combined in a fantastic  way from Mexico's fish taco's to a succulent Rib eye steak from Argentina and do not miss a Moqueca (a brazilian paella) the ceviche from Peru will go perfect with a Pisco Sour that not even in Peru you will be able to taste. The service was amazing as always, the super friendly  will made us feel right at home so i am sure you will experience the same type of treatment  thank you Gio and Mario for making our special day beyond anything we expected.

"The coolest one-stop culinary mecca for gastronomical goodies of the Italian variety. It's a 50,000 square feet gourmet marketplace & retail center dedicated to produce, fresh meats, cured meats and cheeses, fresh fish, handmade pastas, cookware and, best of all if you're visiting New York and won't have a kitchen to work with (or don't cook, like yours truly), a coffeeshop, baked goods and some eateries. Even if you don't cook and don't eat (in which case, what are you doing here and HOW ARE YOU EVEN ALIVE!?!), this is a great place for window shopping. I was here mid-afternoon on a weekday, and it was still pretty crowded. I'd imagine if you were ever curious about what it felt like to be a sardine in a can, this place would be a pretty good representation during the weekend.

"I started off at the bar; and ordered a dark & stormy; something i like to have if i'm being good for the night.  the bartender let me know there wasn't any ginger beer behind the bar, and mixed a fabulous dark run with ginger ale instead.  she worried it may not taste good, and let me know i could switch drinks if i didn't like it.  it wasn't a dark & stormy, but it was delicious.  By using the high quality run, with something as light as ginger ale, it was a mellow drink that highlighted the rum.  the bartender really is fantastic. As for the food; i typically don't expect to feel fed in restaurants that garner 4/5 stars from various sources, but i walked away feeling like the happiest balloon ever.   my friend and i started off with the spicy duck meatballs and the wild boar belly.  The texture of the spicy duck meatballs were melt in your mouth rich; unfortunately the quail egg was lost in the dish.  the wild boar belly was lean, leaner than i like for my pork belly dishes, but definitely full of flavor.   entrees; my friend got the seared duck breast, i got the mild fed veal three ways. as a side, we got the farro risotto. i definitely liked my dish, but i loved the duck breast dish.  it was seared perfectly and i just couldn't get enough of it.  i will say that the purple yam hash could have been any sort of sweet potato and it probably would ahve tasted the same.  The veal i had was also cooked perfectly - the tenderloin was tender and medium rare, the cheek had great flavor and was so delicate with the bed of greens it came with. the sausage with cheese pudding (i really don't know what else to call it), was okay; a bit on the dry side for me.   farro risotto = best dish of the night.  i am in love with this dish.  it is creamy without losing the al dente bite of the grain.  fantasic.  honestly, i would come back for drinks, risotto and the duck entree. we planned to wrap up the meal with the chocolae souffle (something we had heard great things about), but the kitchen turned us down and we were incredibly disappointed. especially since it was to celebrate my birthday and sweets are my favorite part of the meal.  we did see a souffle served to a table next to us within 15 min of us beings denied.  this is the reason why i deducted a star. we ended up with the donuts, which were light and not overly sweet.  a very good choice if you don't have a huge sweet tooth.   Overall; the portions were gigantic for such a well known restaurant, and i was not disappointed with any of the dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This was not our first time at Jane and will most certainly not be our last! For starters we got the gnocchi and goat cheese flat bread. Let's just say the gnocchi was truly a mound of gooey cheesy soft fluffy pillows that were absolutely heavenly. Have never had a better plate of gnocchi and cannot wait to go back for more! The goat cheese flat bread was also delicious, covered in sauteed onions and a TON of goat cheese. Warning: the portion size is pretty big and definitely has plenty of goat cheese on it. Good thing we love goat cheese but we were also glad that we decided to share our entree after we ordered this! As if these two apps. weren't enough the waiter was nice enough to bring us out a sample of the scallop special and a taste of the meatball appetizer. The hash which came under the scallop was delicious and the pine nuts mixed in with the meatballs were a nice touch. While these were great, the goat cheese flat bread and gnocchi appetizers still stole the show. For our entree, we shared the Jane Burger. The burger was done just right with a crusty bun and absolutely delicious crispy fries. Once again the portion size was very nice and we really enjoyed the rosemary that was mixed in with the fries. While everything was delicious, make sure you save room for dessert! The milk and cookies was by far the best thing of the night. We were served  3 LARGE warm chocolate chip cookies which were sweet and perfect. Next to the cookies was a tall glass of cold milk with a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside. Truly a match made in foodie heaven!! Overall, this place gets a 5! The service was wonderful and food was just divine! We can't wait to go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Food - 3.5 stars Service & atmosphere - 2 stars We went on a Saturday evening around 8pm, got the bomba arepa, pabellon de pollo, and beer.  Ingredients seemed fresh, good flavor, and good-sized portions.  The arepa, however, was warm on the bottom and cold on top (as if it had just come out of the refrigerator), as if the cook forgot to flip it on the grill before plating it - kind of gross for an otherwise tasty arepa.  The pabellon came with a healthy serving of white rice and black beans - nothing special, but tasty for sure. So, I know this is a busy little cafe, but there were at least three waitstaff, and the service was kind of terrible - waited for menus for awhile, rushed ordering, slightly off on the orders, and tiny cups of water that were never refilled.  The tables are also too big for the layout of the cafe, so it means people's butts brushing along your table constantly while they maneuver to their seats. Bill was $23 for an arepa, entree, and one beer, before tip.  I'd go back again to give them another chance because the food was good, but probably at a less busy time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been going to this place for many years and I refer clients there as my business is in the neighborhood. I have probably sent hundreds of people there over the years. (I have been in SoHo for over 2 decades.) Yesterday as we were going in for the umpteenth time, I heard a lady outside refusing to go in because she felt they were rude and arrogant. I was quite surprised to hear this. We sat down and ordered but was told by an icy waiter that the salad I wanted couldn't have the asparagus it normally came with as they were out of asparagus. I said it wasn't a problem and asked for some extra avocado instead. Well...you would have thought I had asked for the world. He told me to find something else on the menu, pretty much refusing to take my order. I said I preferred the avo but he got snootier and snootier. We're talking about a $9 salad here folks...and so I asked for the manager. He sneered at me and told me it would take a long time to see the manager as he ""was too busy"" and so I got up to go to him myself but he ""got to him"" before I did and again was told there were no substitutions and if I didn't like it, I could eat somewhere else. Well we did...across the street at the ever fabulous Peep -- and let me say this, I will never eat at Il Corallo ever again, and nor will I refer the dozens of hungry tourists that seek our advice for an eatery in SoHo. Horrible, unfriendly service that doesn't deserve the loyalty of an old timer and all of his referrals.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I didn't have the live octopus at Sik Gaek. The so-called foodies probably already stopped reading this review -- isn't the prospect of eating writhing tentacles the whole point of Sik Gaek? To a non-Korean, perhaps. And I am not Korean. But when a Korean co-worker invited me to join him and a few of his Korean friends there, I knew something more than food thrill-seeking was afoot. I agreed immediately. Sik Gaek is something of a Korean version of what the Japanese call an izakaya -- a drinking den that also serves food tailored for the inebriated. This does not mean that the food is an afterthought. Far from it. These are Asians we're talking about, after all: eating is never going to take a total backseat. We started with complimentary eggs fried overeasy right in front of us, a curiously compelling egg custard dish, and the classic ddeokbokki (thick rice noodles in a spicy gochujang sauce). An odd set of palate cleansers, but when the makgeolli (fermented rice wine) started to flow, it somehow all made sense. The lightly alcoholic drink, served from an amusingly downscale plastic bottle into shallow silver bowls, was a refreshing mist over the proceedings. Then, our main food event: a cauldron full of the sea's bounty, bubbling on the table's built-in burner. Here were mussels, multiple kinds of clams, abalone, rings of squid, shrimp, and who knows what else. In lieu of octopus (not present because monsoons in Korea had interfered with export), a live lobster was vivisected and deposited on top. Thin slices of raw rib-eye were quickly cooking as well. Udon noodles, cabbage, and my favorite kind of mushrooms, enoki, rounded out the toppings. All was partly immersed in a gochujang-based broth: spicy, deeply flavored, and only growing more so as the seafood released their juices into the soup. The servers gave us floor buckets to toss shells into -- now that's the kind of utilitarian addition I'd like to see at Le Bernardin. Other reviews have complained that the disparate elements get cooked to different levels of doneness. The solution is obvious: eat each element before it gets rubbery. This means starting with, say, the squid, then moving on to the clams, etc. It's really quite simple in theory, but the cauldron is so huge that it would take at least five normal people to do it appropriately. In point of fact, when the stew first came, only three of us were seated, but three Asian males counts as AT LEAST five normal eaters, so. But three more convives arrived at this stage, diving into what we hadn't already razed. This also triggered an alcoholic escalation: a bottle of the soju appeared. Someone asked for an empty kettle and, incongruously, a glass of Sprite. He then combined aliquots of the makgeolli, soju, and Sprite into the kettle, mixed it all up, and poured out a dangerously smooth, addictive low-rent cocktail. Now THIS was more like the Koreans I'd known and loved. All this was happening in a little booth under dim lighting, a call button embedded into a corner of the table so that we could keep the makgeolli rolling in. I'd be hard-pressed to come up with more conducive environs for steady inebriation mixed with solid food. Time passed. The mound of seafood eventually dwindled, the broth quietly reducing into more of a sauce. We were more than two hours into the meal, but a kicker still awaited. Another press of the button, and a server appeared with a huge bowl of seaweed-topped white rice. (I love sushi rice, but does anyone make consistently better straight-up white rice than the Koreans?) The server threw it in the pan, mixed it thoroughly, and left us to it. I almost reached for the ladle, but the lone girl among us said, ""You think it's ready. But it's not."" If a lifetime of eating has taught me anything, it's that whenever an Asian woman tells you to lay off a rice dish, you lay the fuck off the rice dish. A few minutes passed while I learned more from my reveling convives about the vagaries of Korean club life and early 90s K-pop, which was continually playing on the restaurant's sound system. The aroma of the seafood/gochujang fried rice, crisping on the edges like in a dolsot bibimbap, was driving me insane. When it finally came time to dig in, it did not disappoint: only a sense of decorum and the fact that I'd already crammed down several pounds of seafood prevented me from inhaling more of the stuff. It is not every day that you get to experience something like this, a glimpse into neither the highbrow nor lowbrow of an ethnicity's food, but into its youth culture, the social bonding aspects of its eating. I felt a little out of place, but not unpleasantly so; mostly, I felt privileged to be there. That the diners of NYC continue to support venues like Sik Gaek which encourage this... Who can be down on that? Probability of return within 1 year: I sort of need to get invited again by a bunch of Koreans; 100% if I am","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In my youth, I was able to booze, and booze heavily. I would do shot after shot, and be 100% cool.

"I stumbled upon Der Kommissar by accident. I had just received a full eye exam a block over and hadn't brought any sunglasses. As such, I was blinded by the light when I stepped outside of the eye doctor's office, as my pupils were dilated. It was a bright and sunny day and I was desperately looking for some darkness. I walked by Der Kommissar's door and was immediately struck by the name, as I've spent many years in both Germany and Austria and am well aware of the Falco song by this title. There was a beer and sausage special written on the outside chalk board, which immediately sold me on cooling off my eyes here for awhile. I had a bratwurst and beer combo, which came with a roll and some sauerkraut. I subsequently had another combo, this time with the Käsekrainer, which is a cheese-infused kielbasa. I started to look around the bar and kept finding things I liked. From the authentic streetcar routemaps to the correct offerings of condiments, namely: ketchup, spicy mustard, and sweet mustard, which seemed to be the exact formula (Kremser-style) that I became familiar with in Austria. Der Kommissar is pretty small, but this is actually the average size of authentic Viennese bars in Downtown Vienna. The size gives it a very cozy feel and also gets you talking to the staff. The beer selection is very typical of what you would find in an Austrian bar as well. A couple lagers and one or two Weißbiers are on draft. There are a couple oddities on there such as the German Köstritzer Schwarzbier and Reissdorf Kölsch, but the more the merrier. There are also a couple New York brews. About the only things unauthentic in this bar is the fact that the sausage stand is in the bar (In Vienna I'd have to make a trek outside through all sorts of weather) - I can certainly live with this! The other unauthentic thing would be that Der Kommissar takes credit cards, which I was quite happy for by the time night had fallen (~3 hours) and I was ready to pay my tab, kept track of authentically by pen-on-paper inside a little glass!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of the best deals in Brooklyn. I've tried probably half the menu and I've enjoyed everything. Wonderful roast pork, wonderful chicken. Love the black beans. And $1 empanadas with $3 beers before 7PM? It's the best happy hour in New York City. Seriously, those empanadas. Easy place to have a great dinner for 2 and keep it under $30.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went against my Korean friends suggestion to skip the buffet. I'm the kind of person who likes a little bit of variety. So I did the buffet anyway (pay per pound), and it was all well worth it. I love Woorijip period. They got all the Korean staple dish that you could ever think of: kim chi fried rice, panjeon, chap jae, sundubu, bulgogi, etc. They're priced very reasonably compared to all other Korean restaurants I've ever been too. The humble cafetaria seating arrangement also made me feel really cozy and home-y. Big plus: liquors and Korean beers of course! Next time, I'm definitely stocking up on the take-out dishes for either my work lunch or picnic.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The restaurant is sleek, modern, tiny, and congested.  It's a little noisy and a little too friendly with the neighbors seated next to you. The nice thing about these tiny little places, is that the eavesdropping is usually fantastic and so is ordering off of other people's tables.   We of course started things off right with a couple of cocktails and some five spice chicharrons with coconut vinegar.  They were fresh, hot, crunchy, spicy, salty... the best.  I had a Michelada, (Genesee beer, P&K sangrita, Thai chili salt) and my friend had the Phuket Punch (Prosecco, grapefruit-cinnamon syrup, and mint), which I determined tasted exactly like applesauce, and we agreed that was not a bad thing at all. Our next course was Grilled Pork Jowl with watermelon, chicharron, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce, and herbs.  This dish was so damn near perfect that I dream about it at night.  The pork jowl was grilled perfectly and melted in your mouth as soon as it hit your tongue.  The jowl paired with the sweet, refreshing watermelon, spicy, salty, crunchy chicharrons and the perfect hit of acid from sauce and a little cool cilantro - it was truly amazing.  We practically licked the plate clean! As an entree we ordered the Grilled Curry Lamb Ribs that came with an  a little yogurt sauce, pickled beets, whole wheat roti chapatti.  We also ordered a side of their vegetable of the day, which was some sort of Asian green with a tasty little sauce on it.  These lamb ribs were fantastic!  They were tender, well seasoned and grilled, and not gamy or fatty (which can happen with lamb).  The combination of the meaty smoky lamb, with the cool yogurt, tang of the beets, bitterness of the greens, sweetness of the coconut rice rolled up in that light and delicious roti was amazing! For dessert - yeah, we managed to shovel some more food down our throats - we got the Turon (banana fritter, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream).  This was probably our least favorite dish of the night.  I mean don't get me wrong, we ate it, but it was lowest on the list.  These were essentially pastry wrapped bananas, like you'd see at any typical Thai restaurant.  Nothing to write home about for sure.  However, I would write home about that salted caramel ice cream, because it was fantastic.  I recommend just ordering a dish of that. At the end of this amazing meal, we definitely felt like pigs and cows... not to be confused with Pig and Khao!  It was excellent, and I am soooooooooooo excited to go back when their garden is open! ordinarylifeextraordinar…","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As a new yelper, but longtime foodie I feel quite satisfied with the reviews given about La Lanterna. I booked reservations for valentines 5 days in advance and when I called the day before to reschedule to an earlier time, they were very accommodating. When I asked who I was speaking to, it was very nice when the answer was ""Vittorio, Im the owner here.""  Before we even got there, I was happy about the service thus far. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an older gentleman that I could only assume was the father, or patriarch of the family. We were an hour late and he asked us ""whether the watch we had was swiss or Italian."" in a joking manner. I felt like I was coming into somebody's home to eat a meal. We were seated in the winter garden which was absolutely stunning. Though they had a good number of tables there, it was not overcrowded at all. The tasteful decor, waterfall and giant colorful lampshade adorned trees added to the ambiance in a lovely way.  At this point I was quite content as was my girlfriend.  Our server, Valentina was prompt in coming over with passionfruit champagne cocktails and taking our order. For valentines day it was a four course price fixe. Now the verdict on the food. Our soups were fair to amazing. Meaning, my minestrone, was good, but slightly bland. I thought the sweet potato soup was much better, with a good consistency and sweetness. The salads were also very good.  The arugola was very fresh, as was the parmigiano. It was lightly dressed in what tasted like a citrus vinaigrette. It was a very good compliment to the saltiness in the cheese.  For our main course we had a choice between three lasagnas. I had the bolognese and she had the four cheese.  While we each thought the other one was the better one, in reality they were both very tasty.  Fresh and flavorful, with what I thought was sheets of homemade pasta. The only qualm I had were that they were served WAY TOO HOT. Though I enjoy a hot meal, I don't want to worry about scalding my mouth. Those stray pieces of hot cheese that hit your chin have been known to put people in hospitals. I survived and ate not only mine, but a 1/4 of my girlfriends as well. ( My manners are exceptional) Finally dessert was served. The strawberry shortcake that was presented was light and flavorful. The cream was neither too heavy nor sweet, but complimented the cake very nicely.  I believe the bill with the 18 percent tip they tacked on came to about 115. Though we did not have wine, I believe that was an exceptional value for the food, service and atmosphere. I would definitely return for another meal!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Friday is date night. Time for something special. Came with the intention of coming to Sakagura but knowing that there might be a wait. All good as we came during a Friday evening right at the beginning of opening (roughly 6:10-6-15pm). As i met my lovely, we traverse the building towards the back and headed down the stairs to what seems to be a hidden area. Practically being a speakeasy type of joint, It might seem hard to find but i acutally researched before I made the troop.As we made our way passed the  elevator and down the stairs, we found a sign that said ""Sakagura"" at which we  knew were at the right place. Lovely hostess asked us if we had a reservation but we sadly declined. Thou our hopes were met with "" please wait a few mins"". Happily as about 5 mins later, she said that she would seat us if we were to be done by 845pm which is well over 2 hours. We wholeheartedly agreed and took our seat towards the back. As our host lead us towards the back, the decor and ambiance definitely felt like there was a Japanese ambiance to it. Wooden chairs, tables and even plagues that had  words which probably meant some type of good luck. It even had that bamboo type of smell. LOVED IT! We sat and our wait gave us the menu and we started to browse. Being me, of course i looked at the sake menu first! lulz joke laters please :P About 5 mins into it, our waiter came over and asked if we had any question and if we would like to order drinks. I said i'll like to order this bottle of sake. Then he started asking me if i had to tried this particular type of sake and tried to upsell me the special. I repeated told the waiter that I'm ok and i would like this bottle. He didn't seem to understand and continue to try to upsell me with the special. I told him that this is what i wanted and he replied to me - "" are you choosing by the price? "" WHAT THE FUCK? You're a waiter for 3 years and you have the audacity to ask me that question? What a fucking joke. Granted, this put a damp in my mood but i chose not to say a word at that point. He reluctantly agreed and moved away. Baby had to calm me down after at this point. I was FUMING. Long story short, the waiter fucked up some shit and i actually went off on our waiter. Telling him how he should do his job and how fucking embarrassing it was for him to ask me that question. He replied that he didn't know and he apologized. Eventually they had another waiter bring us some type of drink to try and compensate. Now if any other cause i would be abliged and be ok with it but if you're a waiter and you make money off tips, dont' try and make the customer feel like they're second class. ESPECIALLY NOT ME.  I brushed it off and said "" dont' fucking insult me with this shit"". Am i coming back? Yea, but i'll make sure i get the same waiter. Let's see if he makes the same mistake. Name starts with an  ""A"". Bald head with glasses and skinny. I probably spend more money on a few dinners than your salary in 2 years you little shit. PS - Bring me the RIGHT check next time. The place was 70 percent empty and you still brought us the wrong check? Are you purposely being an asshole?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is great if you want something inexpensive, yummy, and fast. i typically order the fish tacos with guacamole, and kimchi fried chicken wings. the fish tacos are light and moist, and the mango salsa gives it a nice hit of acid and sweetness. The kimchi fried chicken wings are crispy and saucy (they're not too spicy, in case your wondering). only disappointing thing on this menu is the korean rice gnocchi. the texture was dry and the taste was bland. i've had korean gnocchi before and it was one of my favorite dishes, but kimchi grill's gnocchi is not so good. still, i eat here all the time - food is super consistent and the staff and delivery guys are nice, laid back, and professional.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I feel bad writing a review after just one visit, but this place was so aggressively mediocre, and with the force of such great praise behind it, that I feel compelled. Start off arriving at 10 am on a sunday morning, and being assured a 20 minute wait for a table for 2. 40 minutes pass - with multiple parties (often, it seemed, the host's friends or acquaintances) arriving far later than we did getting a seat, with said host making a point of not keeping track of these things - and we were finally given the worst table in the house, right in front of the restroom. I ordered an iced coffee (after getting an excellent one from the window during our too-long wait), a ""sage scrambled egg panini with tomato jam,"" and a side of truffle fries. The iced coffe comes as the most bitter iced americano I've had in a very long time, the panini consists of underdone, flavorless scrambled eggs on a kaiser roll, and the ""tomato jam"" is a boring, if chunky, marinara sauce in a condiment cup. The only aspect of the meal worth mentioning were the truffle fries, but in light of the overwhelming mediocrity of everything else, a run-of-the-mill side of french fries drizzled with truffle oil came as a godsend (even if at twice the price). All of which is to say that there was nothing wrong, in and of itself, with anything I had at five leaves. But with such high praise, and at a place that so stridently cultivates its image as a purveyor of the brooklyn haute-brunch, to have to suffer such bland and boring food, and after an inexcusable wait time, was too much to bear. There are dozens and dozens more of these restaurants - maybe, admittedly, without the so precious graphic identity - with so much more to offer. I'd urge you to keep looking (it's unlikely, given the inexplicable mass of stellar reviews) rather than waste your time and your money here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Worth the wait for the food. Pretty packed for the weekend which was expected. Hard to even get a drink from the bar, I would say, awkwardly packed trying to hang inside. That says something about their breakfast though. I couldn't pass up the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles. The best of both worlds, sweet and savory. Hit the spot. Couldn't have asked for more on this breakfast occasion. I also guzzled down a Star of the Sea Bloody Mary. Celery and peppercorn infused vodka garnished with a fresh shucked oyster.

"This place has the best soba I have ever had in the U.S., so I have the to give it a 5 star.  I am sure there are many more places that are better in Japan, but I think this might be the best here.   I took my roommate, a white boy who had never had soba before, to this place.  After he finished his soba, he said, ""Damn, I can have another one of this!""  My reply was....""Me too!""  But I didn't know why he gave it a 4 star..haha. So if you ever go, get the soba, specifically the cold soba.  This is how you can really tell how good the texture of the noodle is and the ""tenderness"" of the noodle.  I have never tried their udon (cold or hot) or their hot soba, so I cannot give any comments on them.  But their noodle is very very good (get any cold soba).  They also have good appetizers.  Interestingly, they carry a soba beer.  I tried it, not bad, but nothing special.  Whenever I go to New York, I will try to go there when I have the time!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Now is sit down service, which I usually prefer.   Well service would not be the word I use.  It took over 30 min to get out food and no one checked on us during that time.

"This is the stuff legends are made of. This food tastes like you stepped into a busy restaurant in downtown Tokyo. Yakitori means grilled chicken in Japanese, and this place serves delicious assorted skewered bits of our aviary friend in spades! Besides the chicken, they have an excellent assortment of grilled meats (kobe beef anyone?) and veggie options (eringi mushrooms, shitake, green peppers).  The grilled rice ball is one of my favorites. Also, a must order dish is the cold noodles that arrive served on a block of ice along with dipping sauce and freshly chopped scallions.  This dish is a work of art and worth way more than you pay for it!  All connoisseurs and fiends of the noodle should flock to this chilly dish of perfection. The sake is tasty (and warm if you prefer), the line may be long (get there early, like at 5:30PM if you don't want to wait), and the actual seating room is tiny.

"The recently re-branded Onyx (sans Cafe now) is attempting to be a neighborhood sports bar. The trouble is that even the bartender on their 'grand opening' night admitted that the owner isn't so gung-ho on his own idea. Still, this is a step in the right direction, but a lot of work is needed. First, it's been only a weekend since that grand opening, and already they're closed on the weekdays, just like the old Onyx Cafe. It is in a lousy location at the end of Nassau Avenue, where there's industrial businesses and three more blocks of residents who might be interested in stopping in for a quick drink, and this will always be their problem, because they don't put forth the effort to being a destination that it very much wants to be. Prior to this new veneer, the only times they ever had some kind of special going as ""Hot Catholic Girl Night"" when the waitresses were dressed in school girl outfits, or ""Beer Drinking Contest,"" wherein the winner received a 'Grey Goose Bottle.' No word on whether there was any Grey Goose IN the bottle, but it still sounded like a fun experiment. Now, the only way Onyx could possibly compete with their new 'sports bar' image is if they either add frivolous fun like Trivia and Karaoke nights -- ideas that are a dime a dozen at any bar, but if done right, make or break bars from the norm. Likewise, the old Onyx was fashioned as part Euro-Trash Dance Club, part Beer Garden (the yard was always nice, despite the lack of a varied beer menu). If it wants to succeed in their new image, they're going to need more of an appropriate design than just cheap Wal-Mart Jets and Giants posters hung up above bench-style wood seats. It was almost heart-breaking in how half-assed it was. But the reality is that it's grand opening special was about the best thing it had going for it. One of the things they could do to become a real destination is keep $3 beer and $5 drinks a regular feature. As far as I know, the only place where you could find such a deal (when it's not Happy Hour) is on Staten Island -- and there are people willing to take the free ferry ride to get that deal, believe me. All in all, a move toward the more general bar is a better move in general, but there needs to be some commitment to consistency if they expect more business.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am not one to ever eat from a cart or wait in line, but I make an exception here. Sometimes when you had a long night out in NYC and you're hungry but don't want to go eat at a 24 hour place this is the go to place. This cart is always packed so yes it is that good. The chicken and lamb gyro over rice with lettuce and pita is so delicious especially if you drench it in their white sauce and hot sauce on top! Another big plus here is that it's always very clean and the food is super fresh!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here with my boyfriend.  We're big fans of the sweet potato fries, and I'm usually a ""meh"" fan of sweet potatoes.  And these were ""!!!"".  The burger was pretty fantastic--the only reason I wouldn't rate it 5 stars is that it's a bit pricey ($15+ per burger).  It's also pretty loud.  If you're looking for a quiet date, this is not the place.  However, if you're going to get a group of people together and are good with shelling out $20, it's a good place. :)  Get ready for a wait though.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After finding out that one of the people in my party recently went to places like Per Se, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, and Daniel, I had to choose a really good restaurant. Obviously, this place is not like any of those 4 places I mentioned, but I decided to make some reservations for 4 people at this place after hearing some good things. Walking into this place, and I felt like I walked into a really good French bistro in a better city. We had the Baked Goat Cheese and the Steamed Mussels in white wine, and I thought they were excellent. The flavor and the texture of the cheese were excellent, there was a nice softness and the flavor was not too sweet or overly savory, so it was almost a perfect balance. The flavor of the mussels was also excellent and it made every piece almost addicting to eat. I had the Coq au Vin, which is supposedly one of the most quintessential French dishes. The flavor of the chicken was pretty good, almost like I was eating home cooked chicken, and the flavors were excellent, especially from the red wine. Portions were excellent, the chicken came with some deliciously good and freshly cooked vegetables as side dishes. They complemented the dish really well. Other dishes that were ordered were the Seared Rohan Duck Breast and the Cassoulet Toulouse. Everyone really liked the food here, so dinner was a success. We were very pleased that they are starting to accept American Express credit cards, so it made things a little convenient. The interior has a nice, somewhat comfortable but cosy feel and vibe. Overall, I thought I had one of the tastiest French style dinners for the first time in several months. This is probably one of the best French restaurants I have visited so far, and if you are looking for a great dinner to ""kick-start"" a fun night in New York, this place is a really good choice. Nice and cosy interior, tasty and excellent food, and the prices are not too high, but definitely not cheap. I love France. I love New York. I really liked eating at this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Great little French bistrot  in Murray HIll. It s like being in  Paris.  I had the French onion soup and the roast chicken. Both dishes were excellent.  Service was very attentive and prices very reasonable. They are serving a $ 12.95 Prix fixe brunch Saturdays  and Sundays.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is definitely worth a try just for the unique sauces.  We had a large order with the combo sauce offering of sundried tomato, mango chutney, and pomegranate teriyaki.  Of the three, I preferred the mango and ponegranate, in that order.  The sundried tomato was nothing to write home about and basically reminded me of ketchup mixed with mayo.  Like mentioned before, makes for great late night or beer munchies.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Wow. The Omakase is the way to go. I don't know what to say but it's amazing. The sushi is so so so fresh. The rice is vinegared perfectly and they brush a special sauce right on top of the sushi so there is no need to dip. Each piece is perfection. You can ask for additional pieces of what you enjoy the most (of course you pay for it). The service is friendly but aloof and perfect for a catch-up with a friend or a date. The uni hand roll was the most amazing thing. It tasted of the sea but had a slight vinegary sweet tang to the rice topped off with a crisp and fresh piece of nori. Perfection. I cannot wait to go back. Does sushi get better than this? I think not.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had a wonderful dinner there with friends and family. The restaurant had a small door opening, but it's pretty deep inside. Starting with the ambience of the restaurant, we went at 8 pm, and the entire restaurant was candle lite. We were a seated immediately in the back. The restaurant has a sky glass opening in the back that gave a pretty good view of the night sky. The restaurant had a formal feel, most people I saw were going in suits. Plating was very gorgeous and the arrive was very professional. Our waitress was very helpful in introducing the menu. My group was pretty biased though, having been at the restaurant a few times now and even at chain locations in Vegas. We ordered the sea bass, duck breast and the famous spaghetti. I have to say, the duck breast was my favorite, at medium, it was cooked to perfect tenderness, layover squash sauce with radish on the side. The portion size of all the dishes looked small, but it was surprising very filling. Somehow we were able to stomach in dessert, but had to split between 4 people. For dessert, we had the raspberry Napoleon cake, it was delicious. The cake had a lemony, sorbet taste to it that was light and refreshing. It was paired with wafer and cheese cake ice cream. Very much enjoyed my time there, but definitely go back again. Note however, the menu was kinda pricy; By this in referring to the fact that basil and tomato spaghetti was $24. This is probably the norm in the neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"
i have been eating here for a few years now. this place is delicious at 3-4am after a long night out with friends. the lamb and chicken combo is what i usually get. not really sure how to describe how good it is but the place is delicious. the only reason i am leaving 4 stars is the wait. they need to find a more efficient way to serve the mobs that show up at 3am.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"First of all - they should be commended for their success in removing that god awful stench in the weird faux health food place that was there prior.  I really thought it was there for good.  Kudos.   This place is okay.  It really is the only restaurant like it over there so it does well.  I like the cocktails and the bartenders.  There are too many kids here during the day but that just comes with the neighborhood.   Ironically enough, while most of the food is on the blander side, the Squid was insanely salty.  I'm talking, my blood pressure went through the roof as I was eating it.  Tender though. The farro salad should be called arugula salad with farro because well, farro isn't the main ingredient.  It's good though, for lunch.   I noticed one of the guys from Chinos works there now.  He's THE BEST.  I appreciated that his boss wasn't up his butt when he came out to say hi and chat for a lil :) Oh!  I left my phone there once and they took care of it for me until I picked it up.  Friendly neighborhoody staff.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Little Italy at its best.  I had very high expectations for this place based on the Zagat reviews combined with over 1000 Yelp reviews. I visited Lombardi's on a Saturday evening, it was very easy to find by taking the 6 train to Spring Street. The wait was about 45 minutes for a table for 2 but the place has a high turnover so people are continuously coming and going. As for the pizza, it was out of this world. I ordered the classic small pie (perfect for 2 people) with extra mozzarella. It came out hot and fresh from the oven in less than 20 mins. The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars was because I told the waitress to make the crust medium so it wouldn't be too tough. It came out well done but it didn't really affect the taste. Two other things to mention, 1- no free refills on fountain drinks which I think is ridiculous.  2- You can only pay with cash.   One other thing, I went to Italy last summer and the pizza there was not nearly as good Lombardi's..no joke!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The collard green were not cooked to death.  The sweet tea is super sweet but it was a nice contrast to all the savory flavors.  I have a piece of the red velvet cake in the fridge for breakfast.  Hungry yet?  Well then check out Amy Ruth's the hours are good so they're probably open.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great little eatery in Williamsburg (and by little, I mean little). Had to wait for 1 hour or so to get seated, but it was entirely worth it: they have a full bar with good bartenders (my Manhattans were fab) and the food is delish. Went for mussels as an app and got the amount you'd usually get as an entree (and that saffron-something broth is to die for), and the fish I got as an entree was every bit as good. The bar steak is pretty solid - not a filet mignon, but that's not what you're paying for - and the dressing on the side salad and the fries are perfect. Very pleasantly surprised by their wine offering too: not enormous but very reasonably priced and good quality. In the summer they kick out the sidewalk tables so you get to wait only 45 mins for a seat...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Decided to try Riverpark for Restaurant Week Summer 2012 because unlike many other restaurants, Riverpark makes their entire menu available (some items have a supplemental price).  I love that they do this because it really highlights what Restaurant Week is about-- to offer diners the opportunity to try a new restaurant at an affordable price.  What is the point of trying out a new restaurant if all you get is a watered-down menu?   Despite the complaints about Riverpark being hard to get to, it wasn't too hard to find parking nearby.. so maybe think about driving? The Riverpark farm at Alexandria Center provides fresh, seasonal produce to Riverpark Restaurant. It is right next to the restaurant and we took the opportunity to walk around a bit and check out the crops. It was neat to see the garden amidst all the buildings and is definitely an interesting concept. The farm is rather small though so it looks like they stick to smaller produce like peppers and greens. Before we ordered, we were each given a mini French baguette.. so cute! But don't be fooled if you get a hard, cold piece of bread.. they have warmed ones too!  Ask for the warm bread.. it tastes so much better. To start we had the avocado & hamachi salad w/ pickled red onions and charred chiles ($5 supplement). The salad consists of an entire avocado thinly sliced with 2 sashimi-style slices of hamachi over it with a bit of pickled red onion and frisee on top. The charred chiles is of a dressing consistency and is mildly spicy and despite the pitch-black color, has no burnt taste. The flavor of the charred chiles dressing went well with the salad but there was too much of it! I had to scoop a large portion of the sauce to the side in order to finish the salad. We opted to try a smaller portion of the Squid Ink Chitarra w/ calamari, octopus, lemon, Fresno chiles as an appetizer. Chitarra means guitar in Italian and also refers to the pasta-making tool that resembles a stringed instrument. Spaghetti alla chitarra is made by pressing a thin sheet of dough onto the metal strings, thus creating thin noodles. The end result is a pasta that is slightly squarish, rather than round like spaghetti, and has a coarser texture. The rough edges help lighter sauces adhere better to the pasta.   I really enjoyed this dish. I could taste the brininess of the squid ink pasta and it was further highlighted by the lemon flavor in the dish. The calamari rings were a bit rubbery but the octopus was tender and tasty. The thin slices of fresno chili, a chili similar to the jalapeno but with thinner walls, added a bit of a kick to the light dish. Ever since the awesome grilled duck I had at Brooklyn Fare, I've been craving some delicious duck so of course I asked the server how their duck dish was. The server said it would make me a happy girl and when he confirmed that the skin would be crispy, I went for it. The duck breast was served atop a duck confit cassoulet and summer pole beans. The duck was perfectly cooked (medium-rare as I requested) but the skin was not as crisy as I would have liked and the fat between the skin and meat was not rendered properly. It was disappointing, because it marred an otherwise delicious dish. The Berkshire pork chop w/ collards, grilled peaches, and cippolini onions came highly recommended and it was also perfectly cooked. The salty, bacony flavor of the pork chop went well with the bitterness of the collard greens and the sweetness of the peaches and cippolini onions. It could have used a bit more sauce though. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate-caramel tart w/ roasted peanuts, caramel corn, caramel ice cream.  Overall, this was an extremely sweet dessert. There was a layer of caramel at the bottom of the chocolate tart which overpowered the bitterness of the dark chocolate. The salted roasted peanuts in the tart only served to make the caramel that much sweeter.  The caramel corn tasted like fresh Cracker Jack! The caramel ice cream was the best part of the dish. This might be a dessert for you if you love caramel or if you have an extreme sweet tooth, neither of which my bf or I can claim. We also ordered the beignets w/ berry sauce. The beignets were disappointing; not only were they rather dense, but the berry sauce tasted like cough syrup.   We also had a scoop of hazelnut ice cream which tasted just like a Ferrero Rocher chocolate!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Food 3/5, ambience&location 4/5. Do you want to enjoy Saturday morning sunshine in a peaceful place with decent quality of brunch? Then you should head to west village and have a seat at an outdoor table of Tartine. Located amid a very calm, not heavy-traffic area in the west village. The food is not that impressive compared to other comparable brunch places, but you can enjoy brunch entre menu with free coffee or orange juice at a reasonable price of ~$16. This is definatley a great deal in NYC. (We had salmon egg benedict and grilled chicken sandwich, and both were in line with average quality.) They don't take reservation. When I came by on Sunday morning with my friend, there was a long waiting line outside the restaurant. If you are a party of 2, you might be quickly seated as we were, but if not, you should probably expect a long waiting line. Good place for brunch, but not sure whether I'm willing to wait on the line again next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"When I lived in the neighborhood I would come here at least twice a month and LOVED it.  Now it's a bit of a trek, but me and my roomies went last Tuesday for half-priced tapas and happy hour.  The drinks were pretty strong, I had a caipirinha and and mojito (great mojito!!).  I usually order the tapas mixtas which ends up being enough for 2 people for dinner, but they don't include that as part of the half priced special :( so we ordered fish tacos (they call them taquitos, meaning little tacos, not actual taquitos), shrimp tacos, daily special shredded bbq pork arepa, quacasalsa, and the vegetarian arepa.  Everything was awesome!!!  The have a great selection of vegetarian tapas along with lots of fish and meat options, so it can work for everyone!  The food is always flavorful and fresh without ever feeling heavy.  I've taken all of my out-of-town visitors here and they've been very impressed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been to this gem of a restaurant twice. Last time was Saturday night, place was packed and even though I had a reservation, took 15 extra minutes to seat us. The owner/manager, Joe, is always attentive and sent us down to the local bar until our table was ready and then fetched us. The burrata and lasagna were out of this world, and so was the rabbit. The desserts, including the extra slice of cake and biscotti we got for free (I've gotten unrequested freebies both times here), were out of this world. The ambiance was perfect for St. George, food wonderful and the nonna (not momma) always a hoot as she cooked for us. During my second trip I took out two friends from Miami. It was quite a schlep for them, taking the ferry and then going up steep Hyatt Street, but they loved it. I'm tempted to give it the extra the star but for two reasons. The music is just too loud, all the time. It was impossible to have a reasonable conversation. It has been mentioned here and it's just unacceptable. I understand it gets boring running the restaurant without it, guys, but come one, tone it down. The other reason is the prices, almost every entree is  20 dollars or more. I'm just nitpicking, I know, but otherwise it has been one of the most special dining experiences I've had in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Oh Barrio... The food is great. I do find the chicken in the enchiladas to be a bit dry but whatever, i can live with that. the guac is awesome, the drinks are great, ive had a few soups that are just ""eh"" and i love this dish that has talapia and shrimp in a spicy red sauce served with bread....Its a bit pricey for mexican food but we can look past that as long as its worth it. BUT..(there is always a BUT) I felt compelled to write this review based on my last experience because aside from the great good, its no excuse for poor form on the staffs behalf. I arrived with a friend on a saturday evening (we're no rookies, we knew there would be a wait) we were told 45-60 mins. OK- we can deal with that. Gave the host our name and phone number where he scribbled it on a note pad (i honestly worried that i wouldn't get a call for the pure face that this method was so unorganized and messy). we took a walk around the block, sat at a nearby bench, all of the usual things to kill time. I noticed that a lot of new people were attempting to put their names in but decided not to when the wait time had approached 2 hours. at the 45 min mark i decided to just go take a look and see if we could get an update (since almost the entire restaurant had turned over at once) a few tables were sat and i was told that there was 1 ""2-top"" ahead of me and he was calling them and if they didnt answer we would be sat right away...otherwise maybe 20 more mins. the 2-top sat empty for 20 mins before FRIENDS of the host were seated there... so that was frustrating. i bit my tongue and continued to wait...all the while wondering why we couldnt be sat at the large (empty) friendship table. when another 2 top opened up (they had converted to a poor excuse for a 3 top) i approached, assuming we were up. instead, a group of 3 that had walked up MOMENTS earlier were being sat there instead. I asked the host why we would not have been sat there, he explained that table was not for us and that we had more of a wait (were at over an hour at this point). sensing my frustration he explained that the wait time he gave me is just an estimate and not a guarantee (obviously...) We continued to wait...but patience was wearing thin as even his ""20 more mins"" estimate had expired. At an hour and a half (almost double the orig wait time he gave us) we decided to get sushi at Zest next door instead. I was called at about the time i was finishing my sushi next door. I answered the call (as to not screw over the 2 girls that were waiting for a table behind us, also frustrated) and when i explained that wed decided to go somewhere else his response was ""figured as much"" and then he hung up on me... That left me in complete shock... completely separate from this occasion... long story short they lost mine and my friends debit cards, searched the floors and desks for about 30 mins...coming over to us repeatedly asking if we are sure that they didnt already give them back to us. when we repeatedly explained that we didnt even have the sign receipts that come back with our cards. just before giving up, they found them slid down along side of the computer...what a nightmare... good food, but bring your patience..or a snack","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Been coming here pretty regularly as it's a pretty perfect spot for job-hunting, and keep planning to write a review. Had just decided NOT to write one because of the spottiness of their music selection (my friend in LA and have been exchanging emails with the subject: oh, this coffee shop's music...) -- didn't want to say anything negative in this review because they deserve the best. But this morning, outta nowhere, they play three winners in a row (Wilco, Manu Chao, and Chet Baker)! The Mad Men theme song that came on the other day has been officially stricken from the record, as has that entire day of 'indie hits of 2004.' Major, eclectic strides have been made. No no, but for serious though: gorgeous and airy space (any reviewers mention the huge garden thing hanging off the wall yet??) and really attentive, sweet counter-staff. Someone here has figured out both the perfect A/C setting (not as easy as it sounds) and just the right number of Febreeze puffs to make the HUGE bathroom smell pleasantly flowery. The espresso and tea drinks (hot and cold alike) are fantastic - huge selection of unsweetened iced teas - and all the food coming out looks divine (shhh, I snagged a piece of toast abandoned by a tablemate. crusty & chewy). Have had my eye on one of those flatbreads, maybe when I emerge from unemployment I'll treat myself. Is that Yves Montand's version of ""Somewhere Across the Sea"" I hear? Or Charles Trenet's?

"I must have pretty good luck, considering my first trip to Di Fara was an easy wait and so was my first visit to Lucali's. Best advice, go on a weekday, preferably early in the week. As for the pizza, it isn't the best in New York City. No, it's a close contender to Di Fara and yes, it is a a fine quality Brooklyn pie. Yet, it was missing something, of what, I do not know. I asked for basil on the standard pie but was unhappily presented with springy stems of it which didn't provide any pleasant crunch. Yet the dough is fresh and provides a scrumptious plate for the delicious sauce and cheeses. The place in essence is a nice little Carroll Garden landmark and a worthy pizzeria to boot. Somehow the hype about it went over the top and it's labeled as the end-all be all pizzeria. Not so but it's a solid pizza, if not a little overpriced. Not to mention the waitstaff is populated by some of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen in a pizzeria. Ah, that's amore.

Hide the taste of elderly fish) and the waitress told me that it was not available as a side. Two of us had spent $300 on food & sake at this point, and I was less than impressed. So she got a lousy tip. Mean? Perhaps. But it seemed like such a small request.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Filipino cuisine - a unique mix of Spanish, Chinese, and Malaysian flavors - doesn't seem as accessible to mainstream American palette as other Asian cuisines. The food here feels home-cooked but is beautifully presented and the ambiance is cozy and colorful. The menu is extensive for a small restaurant and frequent trips to this place by an adventurous eater will certainly make Filipino cuisine more familiar! My favorite is the halo-halo, which is a Filipino shaved ice dessert, topped with ube (purple yam) ice cream laced with sweet caramel and savory kernels of roasted rice. It's the best halo-halo in the city! A must try.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The food and service were absolutely incredible... My wife and I had the cod fish fritters, chicharron de pollo, plantains, ropa vieja and arroz con pollo. Everything was flavorful and delicious! The entree portions were very large. The prices were reasonable. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Cuban food. In fact, I'll be returning with a larger group on Friday! The only drawback is that they don't have a full bar (beer and wine only). Fortunately, the sangria was delicious as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Two friends, my husband and i enjoyed a delicious brunch today at Crescent Grill. the Bloody Mary that I had was the best I've ever tasted. Generously garnished (the celery stalk resembled a small tree!), it was perfectly spiced. And it had a slice of smoked bacon, which complemented the spicy tomato juice-vodka drink.  Brilliant! One of our friends and I ordered the lobster eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was perfectly prepared and worked beautifully with the subtle flavors of the egg and lobster. My husband and our other friend enjoyed the country breakfast, noting that the sausage and potatoes were spot onin their preparation. And the jalapeno cheddar cheese grits were to-die-for! Everything about them, from the sublime marriage of flavors to their consistency, was perfect. We finished off our meal with the truffles and apple dumplings. The truffles were akin to a thick pudding encased in chocolate shells; they were served with blackberries and a dollop of custard. The apple dumpling was served with ice cream and was more than enough for two people. I loved how the apples were baked until they caramelized and absorbed their own natural sugar. It was the quintessential autumn dessert. One final note: our server was gracious and attentive without being a ""helicopter"" waiter. The timing was perfect: we didn't feel rushed, nor did we wait a long time for our courses to be served. Bravo, Crescent Grill! A.D. and friends","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great canteen style barbecue in the heart of the East Village. All our food was delicious, especially the wings which were done in a Mono+Mono style (crispy but not overcooked with an Asian sweet chilly sauce, sesame seeds and fresh chopped coriander) plus the service was excellent. The pork spare ribs and brisket also deserve a mention - both had a fantastic spiced/smoked 'bark' and had been perfectly cooked. The sprinkling of sea salt on top at the last minute as they serve it is a lovely move. Will definitely be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The meals were so well balanced and seasoned to perfection!  Lastly, at our server's suggestion, who was so friendly and attentive, we tried the Raspberry Tart and were so glad we did- passing on that dessert would have been a serious mistake.

"I was verging on 4 stars JUST because they pack you in like sardines, but this place is worth the 5. Not crazy expensive, which is amazing because the food is so, so good. We had a deviled egg to start, which may sound basic ($4) but they dressed it with chives and vinegar. Yum!  I had the Duck, which was on special, but if it's your first time here go for the Burger. Not only is it the most affordable thing on the menu ($17), but they sure make sure you get your moneys worth. The burger is perfect, and the Roquefort cheese makes it so...and the overloaded frites tossed with rosemary are unforgettable. My favorite fries in the city so far. Great selection of beers, wine and specialty cocktails. I love how they serve SF 21st Amendment beer, so cool. The menu is as eclectic as the decor, which I feel ties into the theme of everything nicely. The decor feels very hipster yet old New York. A huge amount of taxidermy, dark prohibition feel to the entire place. Loved it. I think this place is owned by the same people who opened Breslin? Not sure. OH and GREAT date place, super romantic and intimate. They do NOT accept reservations so arrive before 7pm.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Welcome to paleo (or primal) heaven!  I heard about this place in the paleo blog world, so had to check it out when I headed to the city this past weekend.  It was everything I dreamed of and more.  These guys created a pretty freakin cool place for anyone who wants to find real clean food on the go (even if you don't follow a paleo diet). There are about 4 different counters to order from including a coffee bar, mash bar, hot counter, and prepared foods section. The coffee bar had all different organic coffee offerings.  On their milk bar they even have homemade almond milk and coconut sugar.   Next you have what they call their ""Mash Bar"" which I didn't spend too much time at.  It looked like they had some pretty awesome fresh juices, smoothies, and different types of concoctions with ingredients like grain-free granola, chia pudding, almond butters, etc. We headed to the back where the hot breakfast section was.  I ordered a bowl where you can choose quinoa or root vegetable mash as the base.  I got the vegetable mash topped with veggie medley and an over easy egg.  My boyfriend got the primal french toast that was drizzled with cashew cream and syrup with blueberries.  It was ah-mazing!  We also got some of their grass-fed bacon on the side. On top of all of this there is a prepared foods section.  From there we got some grass fed meatballs to take home.  I also bought some grain free raw granola that has made for a yummy breakfast this week.  AND to top it off we had to try a paleo treat.  We chose almond butter truffles...oh my god...just take my word for it and buy these. Okay, I swear I'm not being paid to write this review.  I just loved it that much!","[1.0, 0.0]"

There is a great selection of beer and although we did not have time to experience the food, we spent an hour talking to the owner Darren about business and family.

We were happy to have an opportunity to experience this well reviewed restaurant. It was so disappointing. The service was amazingly indifferent. We waited 10 minutes for a menu. The place was almost empty for brunch. What was worse was the food. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. It was completely tasteless. Just because there were a few pine nuts in the dish doesn't  make it a meal. The waiter did not come once to our table to see how we were doing. The couple next to us could not believe they were being charged $3.00 for two slices of bread that was burnt. It left me and my wife with a sour feeling- and it was only brunch.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Guys, I'm kinda torn on this one.   The ambiance - its very spacious which is a real treat for New York.  You aren't bumping into anyone else (after coming off a dinner at Grafitti I am noticing the importance of personal space more and more), and it makes conversation very easy.  The space is loud but because of the sheer size its not hard to hear your company.   The service - it was excellent!  Our waitress was an adorable, crimson-lipped goddess who answered each of our obnoxious questions with gusto (""How about your eggs, do they have Salmonella?"" ""No, of course not, we source all of our eggs from a local farm and they are all organic."").  I also enjoyed the pacing of the meal.  It was leisurely but without taking all night. As far as dishes were concerned they looked beautiful and fresh and we tried a lot of them including: the heirloom tomato salad, tuna sashimi, diver scallopsi, cured meat and cheese, portabello mushrooms, calamari, goat cheese and spinach pizza, mushroom and egg pizza, and the halibut.  Everything tasted simple and clean and delicious but I just wasn't completely blown away like I expected to be.  I give the tomato salad extra points because of the addition of sliced hot peppers which made it more special than your average caprese. Oh and the desserts were a little over-hyped.  Tried the salted caramel sundae and the donuts.  Meh. Would I go back?  Absolutely.  Are there other NY restaurants I'd want to try first?  Also absolutely.","[1.0, 0.0]"

To Whom it May Concern, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of an unpleasant experience I had at your restaurant on Saturday evening.  My husband and I live close by and had been hearing rave reviews about Peaches for the last few months and decided to give a try. We arrived at Peaches around 7:15-730 and could tell this must be the place to be because of the crowd waiting and a full dining room. We immediately were greeted in a somewhat pleasant way by your hostess. We were given a 45 minute wait time and then were asked by your hostess the time. We informed her it was 715 and she replied OK then it will be 30-45 minutes. We waited patiently in your comfortable area to the front because there was no room at the bar.  About ten minutes into our wait the same hostess came into the crowded waiting area to make an announce  She simply stated"" There is a bar next door that also serves food if anyone who didn't feel like waiting wanted to go there.""  A gentleman also waiting asked if the bar next door was a part of Peaches Corp, she then replied No!I have been working in the hospitality industry for 10 plus years. This is the first time I have ever written an email about such an unpleasant experience.  I would of rather your staff member told us you were booked solid for the night upon arrival , rather then telling us to go eat elsewhere in such a passive aggressive way.

"I was meeting a friend here for brunch last weekend. We both live less then a block away so when I arrived first I asked for a table (the place was half empty) since I knew my brunch-mate would be there any second and I wanted an extra moment to look over the menu. I was brought to a table right away, but before I even took my coat off the waitress asked, in a very critical tone, ""oh, you're friend isn't here yet?"" I said no, but she should be here any second now - I wouldn't have asked for a table if they were hoppin'. So I sit and they won't bring me water or a menu until she's seated. . . ok. So she arrives one minute later, and we're finally granted menus. Though annoyed, I try to choose a tasty panini and enjoy my friend's company. When we were pretty much done our waitress comes over and asks if I'd like my panini wrapped up (exactly half of the sandwich), and I said yes, that'd be great. At this point the place is packed so we wait, then we get the check and pay since we feel a little rushed, and as I'm walking down the block I realize she never gave me my leftovers... my $5 worth of leftovers. I had such a terrible experience with the service that I didn't even want to go back and deal with them. So will I be back? No, probably not. I expected more since I've had really great visits here but it seems something is lacking that I'm not willing to pay for again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Alright people...I admit it...I don't like burgers.  (Don't hate!)  So...unfortunately I cannot say I can back up any of these incredible reviews for Bonnie's meat.  I can say, though, that my Veggie Burger Crumble Salad was really good.  And the beer selection definitely impressed me.   My salad consisted of grilled portobella mushrooms, a bit of crumbled veggie burger, grilled peppers, a few slices of cheese (provolone?), sundried tomatoes, and thai peanut dressing on the side.  Interesting salad/dressing combo but it worked.  And the salad was the perfect size for dinner.   My one itty-bitty beef with this place is that I smelled like food when I left.  I can't stand that!  I know it's a weird hang up but I don't like my hair and clothes smelling like what I ate an hour ago.  It makes me need a shower.  So be forewarned that if you're a bit wacky about that like me, make it your last stop for the evening.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I don't usually enjoy waiting in line for hours to eat something, but do agree that some things are worth the wait. This one, I'm not quite sure. My husband and I learned about this place through a friend and as we knew how busy this place could get we left a bit early to avoid dinner rush hours. But there were already a pretty long line formed outside, approximately 25-30 people. We decided to wait, hoping the line would move fast as it's ramen and people would get served quick, eat quick and leave. We were wrong. I think it took about 45 minutes to an hour to finally get in. I guess the place simply too small to expect faster rotation. The place is small, packed with people, so you'll need to be ready for sitting close to some random stranger while inhaling those noodles. We both love spicy food so we ordered extra spicy ramen. The food came out fairly quick, but the portion was a bit small and most of all, it wasn't spicy at all. I mean, it didn't even have a kick. But other than that the ramen noodle was good, not too soft, not too chewy and the broth was thick. Chashu was just okay. Overall, this place serves okay ramen, nothing special about it. I would enjoy it once in a while if there were no line, but don't think it's special enough to wait more than 30 minutes in line.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The place is mad noisy, which I didnt care about, just don't go there if you want to have a romantic dinner. It was pretty hot inside, so that made my experience kind of unpleasant. Service was just the way I like it: they tell you the specials, come take your order, check on you once! Also, the place was packed but the food came out pretty quickly.

"I'm so happy I found this place!

I had dinner by myself at a bar table watching the Devils game.... the level of the music was perfect too btw...The beer selection was intimidating.. I didn't even know where to begin.. I ended up choosing a Scottish beer called Belhaven Lager, it was delicious! Initially I was going to order the fish & chips since that's what I came there for, but immediately upon looking at the menu I saw a fried fish sandwich in some kind of buttery roll or something I forget exactly, but I went with it--- I was sooo glad I did! You guys this sandwich was incredible! I was going to stay and have another beer and was sooo tempted to try the deviled eggs I had seen on the menu... the table next to me ordered them and they looked so good.

"BarBacon; just a restaurant/bar riding the coattails of the bacon bandwagon.   What this place is GOOD for: come here if you want to meet up with friends for a quick drink in Hell's kitchen.

I got to try the bacon burger, cobb salad, and the bacon mac & cheese. All three failed to deliver. The burger was dry and the bun was stale. And how do you mess up a cobb salad?

"We had an outstanding meal here this week after a long gap between visits. The place has been done up since we were last here and, as we had booked well in advance, [ easy by e mail via their website] we had a really lovely table with a terrific view of the beach. The crab gratin was outstanding, as was my partner's soupe de poisson. We followed this with an assiette of fruits de mer. Just a few too many whelks for my taste but a generous serving of other seafood including two oysters. I'd have liked a few mussels but we did not choose the most expensive platter so not their fault. The view on a beautifully sunny day was truly stunning and we really enjoyed our lunch here.

"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday lunch and it couldn't have went more smoothly. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Numerous people came by to wish my boyfriend a happy birthday which I thought was sweet of them. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu and explained everything very thoroughly. The impeccable service really made dining here an occasion to remember! For appetizers we had the corn chowder and hamachi tartare. I'm not one to order soup at a restaurant but this was such a hearty and delicious soup. It was not overly salty nor creamy and there was an abundance of veggies and seafood. Both appetizers were much larger than anticipated. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp burger which he polished off in a few quick minutes, not because it was minuscule in size (because it was not!) but because it was so good. I decided to order the lobster and uni egg custard as an entree although the waiter warned me it's more of an appetizer sized portion. But I already had an appetizer and dessert coming so the egg custard with a few slices of bread was more than enough for someone with a smaller appetite. The custard was sooo silky, smooth, and rich - chock full of seafood essence yumm. I suggest you ask for a few extra slices of bread and smother a spoon full on top. By far the best part of our meal - dessert! We ordered the peach and raspberry sundae which had a touching story behind it and the lemon meringue. The lemon meringue was out of this world amazing! The fluffy meringue was piled nice and high and stood higher than a Samsung Galaxy SII! MUST ORDER!!!! I had high expectations for this Danny Meyer establishment and he did not disappoint.

"One of my first experiences in finer dining was here at Perilla. Back when I still believed $40 / person was way too much to spend (I know, I know..) on a meal, Perilla helped open my eyes to the joys of good food. Even though the last time I ate here was a few years back (apologies for the late review..), I still remember the duck meatballs and tagliatelle starters, which were both absolutely delicious. The flavors were something I had never experienced before, and with the wonders of any first time and our adaptive memories, something I will probably not experience again ;) The seating area was small but energetic and warm, and the service was fantastic.

"SOO disppointed with the service. We had 6:30 reservations on Monday night for a party of 2. We were seated immediately, the back dining room was empty except for two other tables when we were seated. it still took 20 minutes to get cocktails from the bar. Maybe I could understand if they were packed, but that should have taken no time at all in a small empty restaurant.  We ordered the monkey bread at the same time and that took almost an hour! Even while we watched other tables that sat down after us get the bread before us! Egg was very good, but VERY rich. pasta with dungess crab so so salty we couldn't eat it. Almost $400 later, we walked the block and a half home with upset stomachs. The runners looked very confused and kept coming out of the kitchen, standing in the hallway with hot food, and then going back into the kitchen. They have GOT to step up service. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK, which is such a shame as it a beautiful space and we were really hopeful for getting a more upscale restaurant in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is the highlight and only good thing I can say.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We found this place by chance on our way to see a show Off Broadway and called in for cocktails - a $5 each, we ended up having a couple! The place is small but exceptional in the decor, service and friendliness. We couldn't help but check out the food as it was served around us and were gutted we had already eaten. Sooo ... we went back the following night for dinner and were very impressed. We regularly dine out at Thai restaurants near home in the UK and would love this little place to be on our doorstep! The food was amazing!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Would give 10 stars for service if Yelp went that high. We never had to wait or ask for assistance. We had three servers. The experience was just *that* much more luxurious because we all felt pampered. Highly recommended for date night. On to the food...overall this place has strongly flavored or aromatic dishes with fresh or whole foods. Italian, experimental ingredients with what seemed an American New/ French influence. 7 out of 10 for the portions. The portions are smaller, share a few extra plates. Each plate runs about $17-$20, so expect a heftier bill. Bottles of wine start at around $50. More costly than I'd like, but...the service and food combined equal a splurge-worthy dinner. We had the: Housemade riccotta with jam on crackers -- the cheese had a balanced flavor, slightly sweet and excellent texture. Paired with a tangy jam and crackers. Snap peas -- tangy with lemon, probably blanched, retained light crunch and deep color. Mushrooms -- I hate mushrooms so I didn't eat any, but my BF loves em and he went crazy for this. They're cooked with bacon and there's a soft fried egg on top. Butter lettuce salad -- layers of lettuce arranged in a stack, reminded me of a wedge. the cheese in the dressing is strong, tangy/peppery flavor. I love strong cheese (ok ok...ALL cheese), so I went bananas for this. Chicory salad -- kind of like a ceasar. Light flavors, fresh lettuces, aromatic with an anchovy presence. Gnocchi -- soft puffy clouds of heaven. The tomato sauce was spicy like an arrabiata sauce, but thicker. If you love gnocchi and you love fresh tomato sauces, you'll love this. The special -- a filled pasta with chicken and sauce with mushrooms and peas. Can't remember what it was called but it was delish. Heavier flavors but not heavy on the pallette, if that makes sense. Olive oil cake -- subtle but present olive oil flavor. It's dense but not overpoweringly heavy (I'm not a fan of desserts that are so heavy, they come with their own defibrillator paddles --- seven layer cakes I'm looking at YOU). They accompanying cream and raisins took it from ""good"" to TDF.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Ordered six appetizers they were all excellent. Wondered if the main courses would be able to match up in taste and quality. We were pleasantly surprised when we tried the fried chicken and roasted pig these dishes were done incredibly well and lived up to all the hype. The only disappointment was the pasta dish. It wasn't bad it just didn't measure up to the rest of the meal. Desserts were good and the coffees that we tried were OK. The service was effective and pleasant.

"What a great find!  Here's why: FOOD: I enjoyed the tomato soup, which was really hearty and filling.  It was so thick and delicious.  I wish I had had the room to try the gouda grilled cheese, because all of the sandwiches looked/smelled amazing. DRINKS: I enjoyed their Rasputin and Snake River stouts, and both did not disappoint!  This is a girl who loves her stouts room temperature (as they are supposed to be served).  I think at points the waiter forgot to serve us, and once served my friend a lukewarm beer that ought to have been cold.  However, the staff made sure to be courteous and got us our food quickly, just slow on the drinks end. VIBE: I love their dishware!  Now to relevant things...  The seating is accommodating, as they have large tables, bar stools, small tables, etc.  The bathroom is teeny-tiny, but clean.  The people and staff are super friendly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A great place to order lunch on Seamless Web!  Too bad their $20 minimum for delivery means I will not likely be a regular though.  Oh well. I went with a small ""hot and soup soup"" (their spelling) ($1.75) and the shrimp with Szechuan chili sauce ($14.95).  The hot and sour soup as it were was just functional and did not stand out with its flavors in any way.  I would have preferred more piquancy at the least.  The shrimp entree was considerably better though.  I was surprised to see jumbo shrimp and so many of them at that.  Better yet, they were perfectly prepared making them tender to the bite and full of flavor.  Flavor really abounded here as the shrimp were literally engulfed in a more than generous serving of the sauce.  All around it was a solid dish that my rice sopped up wonderfully.  The clear slight here was that sauce was not really spicy in any way, a typically lament for Seamless Web orders.  A great value, and I would be sure to order this dish again and try a few others.  The high minimum order price tag will prevent me from doing that when I have to order for one though.  However, I will check them out in person.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They have a really cool bar and sharply dressed bartenders to go along with it.  They keep it old-school by serving hard boiled eggs for a bar snack.  Since it is a popular spot it gets crowded quickly, so plan on making it a longer trip than you planned.  You can tell this place is always busy, because the service is on the ball at all times.  The servers are able to handle the crowds while making it seem effortless, I was quite impressed.  It's also nice to buy some fresh baked goods from their satellite bakery and take them home to savor the next day.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"*DINNER REVIEW* I came here with my boyfriend last night on a Saturday at 7:30pm, got a seat right away and started to look through their menu. Not a huge selection but all of their choices sounded delicious. We ordered a charcuterie and cheese platter consisting soppressata and danish blue cheese, the plate itself included apple slices, warm olives,grapes, pearl onions, bread, and a little thing of heaven (strawberry-fig jam). It seemed it was a small amount of meat and cheese but after we finished it was actually quite sufficient. BUT SERIOUSLY THAT JAM WAS DIVINE. For a small plate we shared the roasted garlic and artichoke dip with toasted crostinis, and holy crap did it change our worlds. IT was creamy and flavorful and they give you just the right amount of crostinis to go with it. My boyfriend and I were swimming in the dip. For the larger plate we shared the prosciutto and brie sandwich with caramelized onions, it was pretty good, but I think my boyfriend and I had overdone it with the cheese choices because we didn't love it. I don't want to give the sandwich a bad rep based on my previous choices. It was tasty but I feel that it would have been better with blue cheese and not brie but I'm not going to hold that against them. I felt the sandwich might have been too salty and the brie left a lingering taste but again, my previous food choices most likely affected my palette. When the bill came is was ONLY 30 dollars. For once you actually see a place whose quality is better than their price. The place had a romantic dim lighting, rows of tables, and a nice bar. The decor was impeccable but I would totally change the music they play (Rap music in the ambiance they were trying to portray doesn't match). Overall, my new go to place for food in Forest Hills. Cheaper and tastier than any other restaurant in the area!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The best I've had in the city. There's a Chipotle around the corner from this place and every time I walk by it I just want to shout at the people inside because Dos Toros is the much better AND cheaper option. The taste is great and they use all organic ingredients. I live on the upper west side but that doesn't stop me from going to this place at least several times a week! Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because, well, it's a burrito place but for what it is, it's as good as it gets.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"There's a man sitting at the corner table by the window rolling cigars.   Cuba is about as Cuban as a Cuban restaurant should be outside of Cuba or Miami, and about as Cuban as a Cuban restaurant should be in the village.  The space has its charm, dim, small and narrow with downstairs seating.  It is loud, especially when the band starts to play and the conversations pick up. They have a nice selection of drinks, and their food is good.  Enjoyed their empanadas and chorizo appetizers (different presentation), and excellent preparation of tilapia with corn, scallions in a buttery almond sauce.  Perhaps one too many artichokes on the plate for me, but one of the better and clean fish dishes I've had...and not sure how Cuban it really is. Worthwhile visit, and hope to visit again.  Gracias por los recuerdos, cuba y nyc.","[1.0, 0.0]"

A-maaaaaaazing! Came her for dinner with a friend. This is a really small place so it wouldn't be good for a large group. The restaurant is really cute and the waitresses were nice. My friend got dinner set A and I got dinner set B. B is definitely better than A. A is more like a breakfast meal and the side dishes were okay. Both sets of dinner were okay...I'd give it maybe 3 stars for food. Each set comes with tea and a dessert picked by chef. Tonight the chef picked red bean mochi and green tea pound cake with sake ice cream on top. HOOOOOWEVEr....we ordered more desserts cuz we actually realllly wanted the chocolate mochi (3 of them - which the chocolate fudge/ganache on the inside was quite heavy....i didn't think it was super special) AND the black sesame creme brulee with a scoop of sesame ice cream on top. The creme brulee was HEAVENLY....ORGASMIC!!!!!! I'd go back there any day just to eat it!!!! This dessert was definitely asian fusion DONE RIGHT! I'm in love! ::sigh:: =),"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was there at the end of their lunch time and my God they didn't really want me there. Wish they had just told me they were closing, but they didn't so I ended up with a pretty rushed, lackluster experience. The waitress sucked and was fighting with the other one, which gave me some entertainment, I just hope they tone it down when there are more people in the place! The fish was yummy though and the environment, other than the fight club waitress scene, was really pretty nice. Overall I think Brooklyn (and in many ways NYC in general) miss the boat a bit sushi-wise, but I'd come back here to try again based on the fish alone!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friends and I arrived at ilili with no reservation.  All 3 of us had been there for our first time, so we were all pretty excited.   The decor is AMAZING.  I loved how they used the mirrors to create a bit of illusion.  That's the same with the dining room as well.  I personally had a lot of fun looking up at the ceilings to admire the panels.   Our server was GREAT.  Super informative, engaging and friendly. He also paced our food well enough that we had enough breaks between appetizers and mains and desserts - but the breaks were never too long. Be careful - the 'small plates' aka appetizers are NOT small at all.  Portions are generous so please order with caution. I think we definitely ordered too much food.  Luckily, we all enjoyed our dishes so that was a plus.  Well seasoned, well prepared... and if it's your first time with Lebanese Mediterranean food, the servers are all prepared to answer your questions and help you order. The location of the restaurant is a little iffy - not many other places to go to unless 250 3rd is the next stop of the night.  Also, it's a great place for big groups of people to share the entire experience together.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"With all of the secrecy, being tucked behind a butcher shop and without a listed phone number, I had no idea what to expect. When we walked in though, and I saw the small and sparsely populated dining room, I liked the vibe already.  And the meal that followed was pretty wow. The tasting menu seems like a good deal, but we opted not to, and I'm very happy with that decision. We three asian females ended up spending less than $55 each, and had actually MORE than enough food and sadly some even went to waste, we were so, so full. The food is pretty rich and therefore deceptively filling. Yes, the foie gras soba was flat-out yummy- it is melt in your mouth, ahmazing.

"Absolutely one of my favorite places to get lunch in Midtown.  I've tried almost all of the rolls here, and while all are pretty awesome, the standard aloo masala and shami kabab both stand out.  The line can get pretty crazy during lunch hours, but it always seems to move at a reasonable pace.  Staff is also very courteous and polite.  Two rolls will set you back about 10 bucks, but they will also get you very full.  Overall, one of the standouts in the midtown lunch scene, in my opinion.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place was soooo good!!! Our waiter knew the menu inside and out and gave us some great recommendations. We started off with the oxtail empanada, which was delicious. There were four of us at the table, so we got two and cut them in half. The night we were there, they had a ceviche special that was excellent. I don't even love ceviche, but I loved that one. For our mains, two of us ordered the churrasco, medium rare, and were not disappointed. The steak was tender and flavorful, and although I don't believe there was mention of rice and beans on the menu, the steak was served with rice and beans with what I think were small bacon pieces (like pancetta). I love sweet plantains and brussel sprouts, both of which came with the churrasco. The other two in our party had the guacamole starter and the lomo saltado, respectively. The lomo saltado does not sound particularly impressive on the menu but was hands-down the best thing we had there. I'm going back just for that.

When I told the waiter this is not pellegrino water, he said it must have gone flat and swiftly took it away and had another waiter bring an open a real bottle. It was clear that this is a scam they regularly pull.  The bottle that they first served was already open when the brought it to the table, and the label was worn (as if it had been used many times before). I will never go to this restaurant again. If they pull this with water, what do they try and pull with the quality of their food? Oh yea, the food was sub-par anyways. I won't miss this place.

"I loved my dinner at Maysville. A Southern getaway in the middle of NYC. I loved Southern food and Maysville hit the spot big time. The place was packed on a Thursday night, but luckily I had a reservation. They start you off with delicious and warm mini corn bread muffins that are awesome. I love cornbread and prefer this to a traditional piece of bread. Props for the extra thought on the bread offering. I could have had 10 more. Lobster spaghetti with chili and lime was superb. I was impressed that a Southern restaurant could make pasta that would make any Italian proud. Al dente, acidic, nice amount of lobster, and the perfect portion for an appetizer where you enoy every bit but don't feel too full for what is coming next. The duck breast with cabbage, crispy pierogies, foie gras yogurt was incredible. Duck is one of my favorites so I order it frequently and this did not disappoint. I really loved the presentation- rather than thin slices, the duck was cut into 4 extra thick ""steaks"" if you will. Crispy skin and perfectly rare duck is a beautiful thing. The baby pierogies were fried little dumplings of love filled with duck confit. Only critique is I didn't care for the cabbage. It could have been cooked down a little more. Along with the duck I got a side of their famous crispy grits with ham. Just about every table orders these and it is a must. Definitely their signature and well worth it. They are the Southern equivalent of potato croquettes. Five chunks of fried, creamy polenta with smoky salty ham. Perfect combination. None of the dessert options appealed to me, which kind of bummed me out, but overall Maysville is a terrific place serving great food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Fantastic place. A friend and I were headed to a birthday party at Anchor Bar, but when we got there we weren't quite ready for the darkness, loud music, and crazy dancing that is the Anchor Bar experience. My friend said she'd heard of an historic beer bar just down the street, so we decided to stop into the Ear Inn for a couple of drinks before going back to Anchor Bar. Ear Inn was FANTASTIC. It's incredibly old and has a small, quaint atmosphere. It's crowded with lots of small tables and wooden chairs and the bar had more than several aged regulars that looked permanently parked at their stools. The two people behind the bar had authentic Irish accents and were incredibly friendly. The service was so-so, but the drinks were good and the crowd was fun. Not great for large crowds and there's obviously no dancing, but perfect if you and a couple of friends are looking for a casual place with an old-school neighborhood dive bar feel to it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went back for round two because I just can't get enough.This time i came on a Thursday so I was mentally prepared to wait. I got there 45 min than our planned dinner date and put down my name. By the time my friends arrived 45 min later... Viola! our table was ready. There are plenty of places nearby to have a drink while you wait and yes this place is worth the wait. Again we had the red, white and blue deal because a glass of wine alone is $8 w/o the special so why not get a dozen oysters?!? Had the scallop ceviche again which is light and refreshing and marinaded with tons of fresh cilantro and lime. Had the tuna and salmon tartar which was also good but not as good as the scallop ceviche. I'm not a fan of the potato chips they serve with it but I guess that's just my own preference. I feel the greasy chips kill the raw/refreshing vibe.  The table next to us got the fried oysters (with seaweed salad and ginger soy) which looked delish. I've also heard great things about the angels on horseback (oysters wrapped in bacon and horseradish). My predicament is that after the red, white and blue special I'm all oystered out... What is a girl to do? I guess come back for all you can eat blue crab! Another successful, highly satisfying night at Fish!","[1.0, 0.0]"
This is one of the best ramen restaurants I have been to.  Thanks so much Chef Teppei! This was the perfect place to warm up on a freezing cold night. I had the miso ramen which was excellent with freshly blow torch grilled pieces of pork. The broth was also very authentic according to my Japanese dining partner.  The extra spicy ramen is also good for those who like a little kick.  I also think it's a great place for those with shellfish allergies because the broth is made with chicken.  For those who commented that the broth is too mild I suggest you add all the deep fried garlic flakes or try the spicy ramen.  Totto is definitely a ramen place to check out!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with my girlfriend. Great atmosphere to be in for a summer nyc brunch. This is a very small restaurant open to the sidewalk with outdoor dining. Even though the place was packed, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. Our waitress was very nice and frequently checked on us until one hour later she realized we still never got our food. The waitress and manager (I'm assuming) came to apologize to us. Our food came finally (I forgot what I got, some sort of steak sandwich) , and it was ALRIGHT.  I would not come back here because of the ridiculously long wait we had for our food & the food was not mind blowing. Maybe it was just a bad experience with the wait, but if service was fast here, I wouldn't mind coming for a quick bite","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Make sure Marcelo is your server and get a pabellon patacones. That's pretty much all you need to know. I've been here a few times and always stuck with the arepas... because I thought that's just what you did.  Experimenting with the patacones was a VERY good thing. They are a bit bigger, easier to share, and structured with the deliciousness of plaintains.  One patacones (or is it patacone?) would definitely be enough for a meal for me, while one arepa would not do the job. (Of course when I go I end up eating way more than I need, but, so it goes with delicious options.) Some of the chicken and pork options have been uneven in my experience... sometimes dry, etc.. but the pabellon is always spot on.

"Sexy, candlelit, and under-designed (a good thing, here), Grape & Grain is fantastic for sampling wine. The food is decent, but I prefer sitting at the bar and having a few small plates along with my vino. The wine list and service is five stars, the food is three, so average it out and you get four stars. The decor is simple and somewhat rustic: dark wood, simple tables, votive lights, stone towards the back, unfinished wood at the bar and the pillars. This creates a warm and sexy ambiance. The lights are kept low, the noise in the room is a warm buzz, and the service is excellent--not pushy or harried but not slouchy either. There are numerous wines by the glass, which are served by the quarter liter, which amounts to about a glass and two-thirds. This is a very civilized alternative to ""by the glass"" service. Many have mentioned the music: yes, there was an iPod docked, but the selection wasn't bad. It ran the gamut from downtempo to indie rock to something housier. A live band was setting up in the back towards 10:30/11pm. I would return again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Since we were quite hungry, my wife started with a capuccino while I had a cafe au lait and we shared a Pain au Chocolat. It was good we had our starter since it took a while for the main meal to get served. My wife had the Brioche French Toast with fresh fruit and I had the Cocotte. Apparently the French Toast took a while to finish since it had to bake. It came out perfectly - not too sweet and had just the right ""crunchiness"". I had not had anything like the Cocotte before and am glad I tried it! The walls had TinTin posters and had just the right ambiance for a lazy Sunday morning.

They are wicked good, especially with that special dill sauce.  Love the fresh-cut fries and the variety of burgers they offer. I dare you to try the Alamo!

"Raised in LA, so I know my Mexican food. Fish tacos are solid. Love the blue corn tortillas (which I think they make in-house). Underwhelmed by the tamales (both pork and shrimp). They were moist but didn't wow me in terms of flavor. The beef tacos were good in terms of flavor and quality, but they came out at room temperature. They were also way too small (you get 3 for about $9)...like c'mon, it doesn't cost THAT much more to make them a regular taco size. The tables are also way too close together, and we had to do that move-the-table-so-we-can-sit-and-leave thing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Facts: #1 Mexico is a huge place with over a dozen regional cuisines #2 the term ""mexican restaurant"" should be abolished and/or banned, it is misleading and outdated #3 I'm from LA #4 Taqueria Lower East Side is better than half the taquerias I've eaten at in LA (sorry East LA, it's true) Review: Taqueria Lower East Side is a slice of heaven... (pause) I don't want to pretend that LA is heaven, I don't want to get into the debate of what is better NY or LA, but a thought occurred to me while I was eating my sopes and drinking a Bohemia. NY is renowned for it's haute cuisine, five star restaurants, celebrity chefs, the whole deal. LA has it's own version of all that, but the best food in el Pueblo is always served at a tiny hole in the wall (or truck) and is dirt cheap. But I digress... This place is super affordable, nothing on the menu over $11, most things under $8. They have a wide selection of mexican beers, salsas that have BOTH flavor and spiciness, and crema fresca not sour cream (as they are proud to announce). The staff were personable in the best ways, and the entire environment was nothing like I've ever experienced in NY. To Summarize: Best taqueria outside of LA county.

"This was my first dinner at the Farm, and it blew me away. The servers and bus boys were attentive and informative, and very upbeat. Music was a little loud, but they lowered the volume for us with no fuss. It was a busy night, yet our service was great. Everyone at our table was happy with their meals, and our server explained the best wine paring with our dinners. French fries, crisp, fresh and abundant. The rib eye was good-not the best-but very good. The broccoli rabe was sauteed in garlic perfectly. My bluefish was cooked as requested-medium rare and vegies were tasty and well seasoned. I loved the shredded brussels sprouts with  grated parmesan. As for a good date locale: I would recommend the Farm for a date, groups, children, and anyone who wants to show off Cortelyou's up and coming night life. There's a beautiful bar, with locales hanging out-and a really good vibe. This is a good place for children who can sit and enjoy a grown up style meal. The atmosphere was friendly, warm, romantically lit.(low lighting and candles-very urban-country style interior)   The prices are on the high end-so be prepared to pay for this very special restaurant-from my own experience and my peeps who are regulars-you will not be dispappointed.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Where do I begin to describe how awesome Traif is?  Let's start with the reservations.  After weeks of reservation making and changing, I finally got a date that worked.  The girl on the phone was really patient with me and even called me the day of to make sure I was still set for dinner that day.  Seriously though, folks, make a reservation! And if possible, ask if you can get a seat in the glass canopy area in the back.  It looked so nice in the early evening and it's probably better lighting in that area for picture taking! By 7:00pm, the small space filled up quickly.   The dishes are tapas style and go from small to large down the menu list.  My friend and I ordered 4 small to medium dishes and it was enough food to be quite full! Salt & pepper shrimp: DELICIOUS! There were sweet potato chunks in this dish that I absolutely LOVED and I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet potatoes.  The shrimp was breaded in a nice batter and super juicy and crunchy.  The dish was not too flavorful or salty and the portion was satiating. Icy blue mussels: The mussels were soaked in a pesto pea soup.  Don't neglect the delicious fluffy buttered toast wedges on the side.  They were soooo delicious!  The mussels were served in a generous portion.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the peas as my friend was. Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs: AMAZING.  My favorite dish of the night! The meat fell right off the bone.  The tenderness of the meat was paired with a nice BBQ sauce made of cinnamon and strawberry reduction.  The cinnamon aspect was really unique, but not too overwhelmingly pungent. BBQ, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli: The sliders are about 3-4 bites so don't expect anything extravagantly large.  The short ribs resembled something similar to pulled pork - shredded and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were fried lightly so they had the perfect texture.  The smoked paprika aioli was great, but moderate - it's a bit salty! Unfortunately, we so full that we didn't have any room for the infamous bacon doughnuts, but I'll definitely be back for more!  The menu changes month to month so I'm looking forward to trying something new.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Had the family style with 8 people, we got the poutine, extra brisket, mac and cheese, wings and some other items that I cannot recall at this point because I was so stuffed with food I'm trying to forget.

The poutine was good, but didn't have that much meat on top. The ribs were fine, but not a must for me. I also thought the mac and cheese had a weird flavor, but liked the mashed potatoes and gravy.

The moment you walk in you are greeted by a lovely hostess and great music. As we had arrived a few minutes early, we decided to have a drink at the bar.  The bartender was prompt in attending to us and got us some delicious drinks off their delicious house cocktail list.  Our table wasn't ready at the exact time of our reservation but the hostess informed us and the vibe of the place actually made it an enjoyable wait. We proceeded to our table in the back, almost like a secret candle light dinning room, where we were quickly greeted by our server. He was charming, engaging and quick to answer any questions we had. We started off with the riceballs which were delicious and quite a good portion! I was impressed with the great music, food and service. Hip hop and pasta? Nice. The servers are dressed casual and very friendly, very attentive without stalking our table. The decor is simple and fun, I strongly suggest sitting in the back room!

It's worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was walking around Union Square looking for a place to get take-out dinner for some friends and I stumbled upon this place. ======== The Venue ======== The venue itself is adorable - walking inside you see something very simple and elegant. The seating space is perfect for something like a first date; there's bar-like seating on extra cute wooden tables, and if you happen to have a small group of friends, there's some window-side seating. ======== The Food ======== This place is a straight up vegetarian sushi venue. Sounds different, but it's totally bombin'. I LOVE sushi, and admittedly was pretty suspicious (as I don't usually hit up vegetarian spots) - but my friends and I shared each others rolls and we're nothing but elated. We tried The Haricat, the Spicy Mang, The Sweet Tree, and the Mighty Mushroom. The group favorite seems to be the Spicy Mang, but all four were extra yummy. But more than just the rolls themselves, our favorite part about the rolls were what they come with. Each roll comes with this tube of sauce tailored to that particular roll. It's just a really clever idea that I wouldn't expect from any sushi restaurant. It offered a nice (optional) flavor profile that you could have fun with. I'll say this too - I never thought I'd finish a meal from a vegetarian restaurant and say I was full. Beyond Sushi proved me wrong :) The prices are pretty reasonable too. Four rolls came out to be $26 ($6.5 a roll). Considering that each roll was crafted fresh upon order - that's a slayin' price. ===== Overall ===== I'll most definitely be coming back, and I'll be sure to bring friends with me. PS - they don't get as much picture-time as the main rolls, but don't forget to try the rice-rolls or the fresh juices!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had a wonderful brunch here for my friend's engagement. We made a reservation for 6 and brought our own cake. Not only was the food delicious, it comes with coffee and a mimosa for a very really reasonable price. We stayed 2 two hours with no problems. I will definitely return!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Holy deliciousness!! This place was worth the wait- line formed even before they opened at 5! We listened to our trusty Yelpers and had the chicken biscuit (seriously filling for $6 meal) which was sweet and tangy all in one. Amazeballs!! We also shared the chicken and waffles and loved the cinnamon butter atop the crispy square waffles with some sweet strawberries.  The chicken was perfection. Not overcooked and just enough flavor. Did I already say Amazeballs? The mac and cheese was good, very creamy though and we usually prefer baked. Lastly, you must get that banana cream pie because it is so perfect. The crust is a bit salty and it is balance out perfectly by the sweet bananas. When we left there was a line waiting yet again and I can totally see why! Though most of the servers lack personality, everything comes out fast and warm! There's always some one around if you need some more cinnamon butter ;-)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I recently had a party in the Barrel Room downstairs in Park Avenue Tavern.  What a success!!  Every time I turned around I saw smiling faces and my family/friends having a great time!   The mimosas (and other drinks)  along with the appetizers we ordered were delicious!!  The televisions were perfect for the basketball games followed by a yankee game. Eugene and Matt were wonderful to work with.  They were always making sure the party was running smoothly!   It was a huge success and took a lot of weight off of my shoulders knowing that they were taking care of everything. The event coordinator was a pleasure to work with on email throughout the planning process.  She was always ready to help and answer questions.   The bartender was great and kept the party going throughout the time there! Thank you so much!  We look forward to having more events and attending parties at Park Avenue Tavern in the future!  If you haven't been there yet, definitely check it out.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This review is for the rude lack of compassion towards vegetarians.

"West 38th.  street is really something; on one end is Ben's deli, on the other is go go curry  and between them is a croatian place we havent tried.   we ate at go go curry because it was cold outside, we were half hungry, and it was late.  ggc is perfect fast food.  all five dishes tasted just like you would think if you like Japanese curry, brown, spicy but not hot, poured on top of a katsu of pork or chicken.  we had both and they were both find.  next time we go we'll order the curry on the side, and you can then pick the amount you want to use on the meat, the rice, the cabbage.  we ordered the red colored pickle, ok, but unnecessary, for me.   the crust was particularly good on the katsu.  t didn't really look like they cooked it to order, but it was fine anyway, greaseless, crispy, all together.  the street is a little dark at night when we went, but it's only a 100 feet from a really busy main street (8th?).   all in all, i think places like these really define the fasthion district, as a place where people can afford t eat lots of different, and well cooked meals.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"They said they are famous for great pizza, well I tried one. I couldnt concentrate on the taste, since I was suprised how small the pizza was for almost $20+tip. Didnt expect that in Brooklyn. After all, I was still hungry. I had two beers ($12+) just to wash it off and that's it. We went to another bar cause this place is very overpriced.

"This is my review for eating in at Empanada Mama's. I still hold it to 4 stars for delivery. Going to eat in there .... not quite as happy. The place is super small, super cramped. and the service was definitely lacking. They have all of 5 tables, but it took forever for us to get orders taken, drinks, place settings, ect ect.   This saturday afternoon, we opted in for a pitcher of sangria ... by that i mean pitcher of diced apples and ice. We also got the plantain chips with the different dipping sauces. I wont lie, those were pretty good. The empanadas were as per usual pretty damn yummy - we got 2 pizza ones, 1 shredded beef and 1 ground beef. If the beef ones came in wrappers that didnt just say ""beef"" on them, that would have been cool - but it felt kinda like going through a box of chocolates, guessing what was what. I love your empanadas, so im still giving 3 stars, but i'll stick to delivery. I swear it would have been faster and less claustrophobic.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Another Resturant Week review: I brought some of my coworkers here after work one day and we all agree that the food and service was amazing! I must admit I am a big sucker for Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food so I am not hard to please, and lately I have been stumbling into a quite a few Lebanese places, but ilili has by far given me the best food experience.   The restaurant itself is big, and it seems to be great place for bigger groups because of the round tables in the front of the restaurant where you can easily fit a nice size group around. I love round tables because it makes it a lot easier for the whole group to speak with each other, and even if not everyone is speaking, at least everyone can see each other, so big plus for round tables. The ambiance is pretty relaxed as well, and the service we had was great. Our waiter was very attentive, and he spent a lot of time guiding us through the menu, helped us order to get the most out of our meal and even helped us with which small dishes work well mixed together to small bites of deliciousness. My personal favorite was actually the chicken liver, it is A MUST TRY, and I promise it is not as scary as it sound. Everything comes out ""family style"" and is meant for sharing, so please please please so yourself a favor and DON'T order two of the same dish. Either way, this place is delicious, my mouth water just thinking about it, so if you are in the mood for a great food experience I would definitely check out ilili!! I know I will be back for more.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went to NYC for GF birthday,(sidenote, GREAT idea guys!!) She is celiac, wanted to try this place, good idea! Got there just at noon, opening time, on Sunday, got seated immediately, of course, good. It is a little cramped, but we were early, so not a problem, but I can definitely see it being a problem. *** BREADSTICKS ARE THE GREATEST THINGS YOU WILL EVER EAT** I am not celiac, eat anything, but those breadsticks....wow. I got a meatball appetizer, GFree, very nice, my girl liked it too. She got the shrimp pizza, LOVED it, i got a panini, it was good. We got a lemon cheese cake for dessert, it was very good. Cons: Seriously?? $ 4.50 for a cup of coffee??? I didnt happen to look at menu when I ordered one, then got another at end of meal. BIll came out, i was like what is 2 Americano for $9.00..... oh my god, THIS coffee is that much!?!??, and not even a little refill for it. Not worth it. It is pretty standard coffee, just saying. The whole meal was pretty damn expensive, $ 62.00 for lunch ?!?!?

The guy that helped me was wonderful; charming and French. Is there a better combination? I told him to give me 10 of his favorites, and that's exactly what he did. Every macaron he gave me was phenomenal. Sweet, chewy, but crunchy exterior. Macarons are better than I expected.

"Underwhelming given the hype. Or maybe I mean ""overwhelming"", because it is not a comfortable place to spend your time.

"Wanting to go out for dinner nearby my apartment on a recent Saturday night, Catfish was right up my alley--especially given that I hadn't had Cajun food in forever.  Now I'm not incredibly well versed in Cajun food, but I've had enough to recognize when something tastes good or not.  Thus, I cannot comment on authenticity and only on how everything tasted.  For some reason they had a bouncer, even though the place is style more to be a restaurant rather than a bar.  I wanted to eat at the bar itself, and apparently that isn't the norm here because the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars.  The backyard area would've been a better option but it was raining.  Bartender did a decent enough job of serving after being a bit slow at the start.  I got the Sazerac (rye whiskey, Peychoud's bitters, absinthe rinse, sugar twist) on the bartender's recommendation between the 2 whiskey based cocktails.  It was a very good, well balanced drink, much better than I was expecting. The crawfish mac and cheese I got to start was decent, but definitely could've used more crawfish.  Still it was enjoyable with the potato chips adding a nice textural/flavor contrast.  I got the jambalaya for my main and it was everything a good jambalaya should be.  They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients and it was packed with flavor and the right amount of spice.  Not a small portion either for $15; easily enough for two meals, actually.  I took my time with it and grabbed the rest for home.  After a very reasonably priced Macallan 12 as an after dinner drink, I was happy. Good to see that the Franklin Ave food scene is developing nicely with great restaurants like this.  Especially ones that cater to everyone in the neighborhood, not just exclusively hipsters and yuppies.  Between the quality of the food/drinks and the fair pricing I will definitely be back here at some point.","[1.0, 0.0]"

In NY we are fortunate to have many great pizzerias, especially now that the real deal Italian movement has arrived and I'd rather spend my time eating and drinking with friends at equally good places than waiting... and waiting... and ...

She welcomed me and I had only been sat for a few seconds before the manager came over and welcomed me as well. Very cool. The decor was open, inviting and peppered with Banksy prints. I started with one of their signature syrup drinks with fresh cucumber and vodka. I watched the bartender shake it to a frothy perfection while she also explained the food. Her partner also came over to say hello and recommend a starter as well as an entree. The music was awesome, not too loud, but enough to feel open and lively. I had the Cheese curds and the Salmon. Both were particularly yummy + my compliments to the chef (I work in a Restaurant so I am pretty picky) .. I ended with another drink that had a jalpeno agave syrup .. Stupendous.

Their complimentary bread basket with strawberry butter is amazing, especially the cheesy biscuit. I always ask for seconds, thirds, and sometimes fourths. Of course, the best part of Calle Ocho is the unlimited sangria-- and it is truly unlimited. They don't limit you to 2 hours and then kick you out like many other all you can drink brunch places. They were setting up for dinner service as we finished, so they asked us politely to sit at the bar, where we could continue imbibing more sangria! The service is great too.

"I'm back !! Hello Yelpers, today's late night review is going to be a short one because so much has already been said about this place. I have just gone to this place today at around 3pm, (today is Friday) and there were 2 of us, my mother and I. We went in and gave our names, the lady told us it wold be a 35 minute wait, which was rather surprising considering the things I have heard about the wait of this place. There were a couple of other parties waiting outside but once we were called in we were seated in the window table and right away we ordered our coffees w steamed milk and whipped out our own stevia in the raw(LOL).The coffee was solid nice and strong, but definitely not bitter. I needed no menu as I never go to a place without being prepared and before the lady began writing I knew what I wanted. I ordered the Southern Breakfast with a side biscuit and my mother ordered the Country Breakfast. I didn't come here to try pancakes, I mean of course they would get that right no biggie, so I had to really test their skills and see what else they could throw down. Our food came out rather quickly and immediately I reached for the sugar coated bacon (which sounds like a sin in a third world country) and after two bites I was rather bored with it simply because I am not a sweet eater at all. Nonetheless it was a great compliment to the grits which were thick and cheesy, they got my eggs just right which I ordered scrambled, and the biscuit was AMAZING. There is NOTHING like a good old flaky southern biscuit. You think the Pillsbury Dough Boy has flakes? HA! However this biscuit is nothing without the jam they give you which takes so great its sweet and savory which is right up my alley. Our waitress kept bringing us more coffee which just got  us high of the bean. I must say that I did love the ham in the Country Breakfast, I wasn't a big fan of the fried tomatoes a little too much batter for me, but everything else was seemingly ....solid. Now I know I said I did not come here for pancakes but what the heck? I had to throw it in, my mom and I shared a stack with the maple butter which you just want to bathe in, it was so good. And blueberries like you've never seen before. They were extremely good. BOTTOM LINE: This place is great if you know what time to come. They give enough food, it is solid and quality, and not overpriced. And if you aren't a New Yorker get directions this place is deep in LES (Lower East Side) so please save your self the torture. Next time I go I will definitely be trying something new, did I hear someone say Huevos Rancheros?? Anyway that's all folks !","[1.0, 0.0]"

The portions are pretty big too so it's a good value.  The service has also been good whenever I dine in. I highly recommend this place to everyone I know!

"Enjoyed a dinner for 2 for a special occasion...7pm res on a Monday and we sat in the back area which was already bustling (in a good way) considering 7pm is a bit early for a dinner in NYC's west village. I'm not one for long reviews, but this was good enough to provide some light: Service was very personable though it was a bit strange to have not one but three servers throughout our meal. Maybe it's an efficiency technique or just the way they do it but I prefer to get to know & trust one server (they should know, it can also make for better tips!) However, all were so friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Sommelier recommended a fantastic wine called the ""Agricola Punica Montessu Isola dei Nuraghi IGT"" I know, a mouthful (no pun intended) and I've already tracked it down with the ""Hello Vino"" iphone app to buy a couple bottles. On to the meal: we split the monkey bread, bbq octopus, and tortellini before ordering our entrees. Everyone raves about the bread and rightfully so...that rosemary lardo is ridic. Octopus was tasty and the tortellini was mouthwatering...buttery sauce which I have to admit I'm a fan of. I ordered the duck and she ordered the halibut. Duck was perfect, but lots of sauce so make sure you can handle rich tastes. I would definitely order it again. She loved the halibut, but I found it a bit fishy (I would have ordered the sea trout). We probably ordered the wrong desert (white chocolate crumble...), which was a bit dry...but our expectations were towering by that point. All in all a 5 star experience and would go back often if it weren't for the steep pricing. With a cocktail each & a bottle of wine we were over $150pp after tax & tip. WORTH IT.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cheryl's is an enigma. I live the the neighborhood, and whenever I walk by it's crowded with 30 somethings seemingly enjoying their meals. But every time I've eaten there I've been disappointed --  the food just isn't very good. Granted, I only ever eat the meat options, maybe the vegetarian food is great - but If you want a place that can capably cook bacon, steak, or a burger, this isn't it.  (Maybe the shrimp is to die for?) Not-very remarkable food wouldn't be a problem if the menu wasn't ambitious and overpriced , but it is. And yet, all evidence seems to suggest that people like the place. It's like there's a collective illusion -  with such a cool interior, and hip crowds, and high priced menus,  the food must be  good, even if it doesn't, you know, taste good. Of course that doesn't stop me from going back every now and then to see if I've missed something. But so far I've only ever been. disappointed. Am I the only one?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Just had dinner here and was blown away. The exterior looks a little questionable but the interior is gorgeous. My friend and I started with the fried green tomatoes and chilled bay scallop and watermelon salad with champagne-honey vinaigrette & cilantro. The watermelon salad was light and refreshing. I'm seriously going to try to replicate it some time soon. For entree's we had a special short ribs (pork) dish and chile marinated shrimp with sweet corn-hominy grits & scallions. Everything was seasoned properly and plated beautifully. Our waiter was cute, tanned, and awesome. The restrooms were single rooms and tight (small) as hell but whateves. My only negative was the drink. I had the ""Louisville"" something or other and it was a bit watered down. I'll def be back :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The place was very crowded when I came for a Sunday brunch. Then this place must be good, right? Well, the food was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just typical American style brunch -- eggs benedict, steak with eggs, etc. The service wasn't that great, probably because of the amount of customers, but if they want my 15% tip, they need to do better than that. We were seated in the center of the room and waiters/waitresses kept passing by without even bothering to avoid my chair -- so I've been sitting there experiencing around 3 kicks of my chair every 10 minutes. They also don't seat you until your entire party has arrived, which seriously annoys me. All in all, a 2 star experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"While roaming the streets looking for a place with decent cocktails and friendly vibe, we stumbled across Lillie's by accident. The cute Victorian decor drew us in, and we sat down at the bar (pretty crowded for a Monday night, even past midnight!) There were only two bartenders working the extremely long bar, and they were tending to a private party going on at the back as well. We definitely could have used some faster service. However, I ordered a glass of bubbly and he filled it to the tip-top, which we appreciated!  My friend ordered the Jersey Isle (Beefeater Gin, Framboise Liqueur, pineapple juice) and it was delicious. Not cheap and it did feel a bit touristy, $13 cocktails and $11 for the bubbly. But I mean. Theatre district. Nice chill place with good buzzing ambiance, TVs to watch your sports, cute booths if you're with a group.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Oh man. This place. Excellent. It has such an earthy, laid back atmosphere. I got here with my mom around 11, when the store was opening. The waitress was extremely nice, took our order of beef burger on brioche bread, with ""the Classic"" style. The burger came just in time and oh boy. It was so juicy and flavorful. I got the burger well-done, but next time I'd like to try it medium. The bread was excellent- crunchy a tiny bit, but very soft and delicious. If you get the beef in The Classic, you can't go wrong! The place and burger here reminded me vaguely of Umami Burger back home in LA, so I was a very happy girl today. Definitely coming back here. It is slightly pricey, but it is definitely better (in my opinion) than the overrated Shake Shack...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I know, I know.  How can I give the Grammery Tavern 2 stars?  Well, reservations were easy.  Got there a few minutes early. Front desk was a tad snooty and aloof, but coat check was efficient.  The bartenders seemed harried and were a tad curt with us as the result. G_d forbid we move to the two available stools, they are being held for others who I guess have been waiting. They didn't however show for 10 more minutes at which point we politely moved away.  We had our mediocre California cabs and the bill was efficiently transferred to our waiting table which was nice.  We forgot about th table and nobody from the hostess station bothered to alert us so we were seated about a half hour late and were hastily scolded for our tardiness! Ice water is served.  Beverage order is requested almost immediately, and since we wanted wine, the waiter made a couple selections. The first couple suggestions were both over $300 per bottle, and we finally settled on a bottle that was $85, good for those on a budget according to Marcello (our waiter).   Appetizers were squid ink spaghetti and smoked trout, both of which were ""meh"".  The bread was either sourdough or a roll. Cold, but OK.  Butter was the exact perfect temperature which is always a plus. Wine service was attentive.  Glasses always filled evenly and timely so they def had enough staff on the floor to not miss a beat, but then again, the restaurant was only half full this early in the evening. It did fill up later. No steak on the menu. Boo. Real disappointment not being able to get a steak at a tavern.  They seemed to lean heavily toward fish and vegetarian items, and neither of us wanted those. So, there was a poached chicken dish and a lamb.  Neither of these dishes was bad; they were, rather, boring. Uninspired. The wine wasn't great. I've purchased bottles at the store for $8 that were as good or better. I think they could tell we were a little disappointed, or they knew that the food has fallen on tough times since Shake Shack has become the obsession of their famous owner, so they overcompensated with desserts.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate and passion-fruit trifle were amazing. I rarely go for dessert, and I rarely eat a lot when I do, but these were fantastic and  I ate everything in sight! So, why only 2 stars?  For Almost $400, the ambiance is OK, but not exciting in any way, and the food just isn't all that great. For the money, I recommend you look elsewhere and the restaurant should stop resting on it's laurels.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This spot won't stay secret for long! If you're a fan of places like Huckleberry Bar, or just enjoy a damn well mixed cocktail, go down to the counting room. They offer refreshing takes on classic drinks. For me, the real treat is discovering this place's bar food! And trust me, you'll need it because you won't want to stop the flow of delicious cocktails. I recommend the baked herbed crouton, pork sandwich or grilled cheese with truffle oil. If you're not such a drinker, step upstairs for a light brunch, benedict salad or french toast on a stick. Enjoy the large selection of wines, also reasonably priced.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been here over a dozen times now and I live in Queens. Yes, it's a trek but it's worth it. I'll start with appetizers. The ricotta flat bread is divine. It's savory and rich but still delicate. The pickles are TASTY TASTY goodness if you're all for super sour, crunchy, salty pickles. The hush puppies, which we got for free (waiter mistake), were delicious but overshadowed by the pickles and flat bread. The bacon strips are also delicious. Topped with a sweet glaze and a side of sharp greens. They have some good beer choices and some nice wines as well. The star of this restaurant is the chicken and waffles. The chicken is always juicy and perfectly seasoned with skin that has the perfect crunch. The cheddar waffles are warm, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, with a surprise savory flavor from the cheddar. All of this topped with the sweet, tangy balsamic syrup... I DIE. Its really just a flavor adventure with multiple layers of flavors all combined into one orgasmic orgy. The pecan pie sundae is delicious if you're a nut lover although it's overwhelming size requires about 4 people to finish it, especially after all that fried chicken and waffle. Overall, Buttermilk Channel is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went for an 11AM Sunday breakfast with my 3-year old,my husband and our friend. We ordered at the counter and our food was brought out to us. I got the lyonnaise breakfast: 2 fried eggs (sunny-side up, in my case) on a beautiful piece of hearty toast with 2 huge pieces of thick-cut bacon and a well-dressed side salad. Smash the yolks, toss the greens on top and eat with bites of the bacon. Delicious! My daughter was more into the chips served with her grilled cheese, but the sandwich was made with good cheese and seemed to be grilled on a panini press. Stumptown coffee, which was great as usual. The ingredients were of good quality and worth the money. I plan on heading back soon for another go-round with the lyonnaise!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We recently had an event for 25 at the Market Table. It was a dinner in their private room downstairs. The room was lovely, compact, easy to converse between the two large tables, but we were not impressed with the meals. A noodle based appetizer was given high marks, the mixed salad was average. There were mixed reviews on the chicken entree, and most indicated that the monkfish medallions were a bit overcooked and salty. The flourless chocolate cake and berry french toast were both enjoyed by everyone. The service was impeccable. I am willing to go back and eat upstairs in the restaurant, because it can often be difficult to get twenty five entrees cooked and served all at once.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Forget about the old business adage where ""the customer always comes first"" when you dine in Ippudo West. Dining in this place will probably give you a sampling of how rude, and controlling, their staff can be (especially the hostess/manager - Cory). We were a party of seven on a Friday birthday celebration of one our colleagues. We got there and the place was packed. They offered us two options, 1) separate the party into two tables being that one table is already available, or 2) wait a half-hour for a table for seven. Due to time constraints, we opted for option one. The celebrant took the first table and sat with three people from our party. Minutes later, the other half of our party were sat at a distant table. We noticed that the first table was a corner section of the room where seven people can actually fit together. We asked the waitress, but she asked us to talk to Cory. Cory denied our request due to fire regulations in which we complied. However, when the table next to the first group vacated, we asked Cory again if she can move us next to the other half of our party. She repeatedly denied us, and told us at the end that she will talk to her manager about it. The other people in our party also begged to move us, but they gave us a lame excuse that since we are already eating our ramen noodles we cannot be moved. Now I heard of them being protective of their recipe, but to restrict their precious noodles to move to another table is simply RIDICULOUS! A few minutes passed and we noticed that she sat another group of customers at the open table. Clearly, our request was not addressed to the manager as Cory did not even have the courtesy to inform us of its outcome. Staff from this location should be trained on how to treat customers better. It is very insulting for a customer to be told lies. I told the manager Cory that she should not tell customers BS excuses on my way out, but she just laughed it off. She is a pseudo-manager who is a poor excuse for a NY hostess! This place has good food, but all of that is overshadowed by the staff's rudeness and inconsideration of simple customer requests. I don't care how good your food is Ippudo! At the end of the day, everything boils down to good customer service, of which you don't have any. Shame on you, your owner, and especially your staff, for falsely believing that there is a compromise in good customer service.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've only gotten the burritos here, so allow me tell you why you should favor this place with your burrito hankerings over Chipotles: the queso, the crema, their rice, and seasonings. I've tried my fair share of places that claim to do Mexican, but their rice has always been disappointingly flavorless. Considering what a huge component rice is in a burrito, it can break a burrito when the rice is bland. This is not the case at Taqueria Diana, the rice has kick. A burrito here can cost as little as $6.75 (for the vegetarian), but I would recommend you splurge the extra $2 and get the fixings: queso, crema, and guacamole. These additions simply elevate the dish, taming the spiciness with creaminess and adding a bit of brighness with the guac, then you add some meat- I highly recommend the steak- and yum. It's flavorful enough to eat cold- which I've done. I can usually only eat 3/4 of a burrito at a time. I've tried the Al Pastor and was not so impressed, perhaps they could have given me more meat, I could barely taste the pork underneath everything, but their steak is cooked just right, with the middle still pink, and the seasoning spot on and pleasingly assertive. All these reasons are why I keep coming back for the burritos here, even though Chipotles is cheaper and closer.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The $25 bottles of wine are a great deal. I've discovered some great wines that I otherwise wouldn't have ordered. The all you can eat pasta is a real crowd-pleaser. They always have three different types of pasta and the servers come around with pans of each one every few minutes offering you more.

"Multiple times. Thursday Night (11pm dinner), Friday Night (6pm dinner reservation) Food: 85% ---- Charcuterie board - that chicken liver pate was really good, surprisingly. Bone Marrow Poppers - I really wanted to like this dish. It had the elements of a would-be awesome plate, but the bone marrow was masked texturally and flavor-wise by the puff pastry and the garnish on top. I really could not taste the bone marrow that much. Burger with Shoestring fries - basic, good greasy food. Lamb Chops - gamey, meaty, cooked perfectly. Steak Tartare - this is prepped tableside. Again, I wanted to like this dish but I've had better steak tartares where the actual flavor of the meat just exudes from the dish. I think EO's interpretation is still good but depending on what type of spices you're in to, this dish may be playing with a little bit too much aromatics. There's spice, tanginess, slight bitterness, and then gaminess from the meat. Drinks: ---- Mata Hari - really good cocktail. Ambre Cognac. Tangy, slightly sweet, with striking aromatics. Ready Fire Aim - Mezcal. Smoky, pineapple flavor cocktail with a kick of habanero bitters. This drink is amazing. (not so for non-mezcal drinkers who feel like drinking mezcal is like eating a cigar). Service: 90% ---- The front doorman is definitely a lot friendlier and less obnoxious than most doormen at other speakeasy-type places (i.e. Death and Co, Pouring Ribbons). Even if EO has its own following and is quite known, it does not exude elitism. The servers were very friendly and very accommodating. Ambience: 100% ---- Dark, animated, high noise level but still comfortable, casual to classy. Value: 90% ---- I haven't tried the all food items, but the steak tartare has definitely garnered some praise so it is a very subjective dish. Reservations I think are only for dinner goers so if you simply want a cocktail, you might have to wait a bit. I would recommend at least trying out their food once, and if you don't fancy the flavor profile, then for sure come back for the cocktails.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hands down, my fave dinner spot. I typically don't like tapas style meals - especially Japanese tapas, but if they didn't have this kind of set up, I'd be sad I'd have to pass up on all the delicious menu items I wouldn't be able to try. (DAT UNI CROQUETTE, YO) The ambiance is super chill. I love feeling like I'm eating at a friend's apartment instead of a stuffy, pretentious little restaurant. The whiskey based cocktails are delicious. I can't speak for the others because I've never tried. That matcha whiskey cocktail reminds me of a signature drink at a nearby bar. Their tasting menu is a great deal, but I also recommend venturing off and trying other things not included on it. I'm also not into branzino, since many other restaurants have ruined the fish for me, but their branzino's quite well done. The washyu steak is super moist despite the names of the cut so splurge a little and treat yourself. In terms of food, most of the items on the menu are quite heavy, so you get full easily but the flavors are well balanced. My fave items aside from the ones already listed are the short rib sashimi, foie gras sushi, and mac & cheese.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love Mamoun's.  I discovered it in the 80s when I was out at the music venues around Bleecker Street six nights a week.  It ain't fancy; it ain't big; it ain't well lit, and none of that matters once you bite into one of their verdant, crunchy falafel balls. I can't even count how many falafel and shawarma sandwiches I've had from there.  I eat a lot so my standard order is one of each.   I love their sharp tahini sauce as a contrast to the savory falafel, but the hot sauce is where it's at for me.  If you are constantly disappointed by allegedly hot sauces, try Mamoun's.  It is legitimately hot sauce, and this is coming from someone who has yet to find something that it too hot. I love Mamoun's and I will be eating there for as long as they keep serving.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The food was pretty good but the good service earned it the 3rd star. My water glass was always full which is a big perk of mine. It means that they're attentive. The thai iced tea was delicious and came in a much bigger cup than I've seen other places serve. It lasted our entire meal which really helped with the spicy stuff we ordered. Hot pot dumplings were interesting but not too impressive. It was a bit dry and a bit sweet and had too much crushed nuts. A bit sweeter and it would have made a decent desert. We also ordered the Beef Pad Kee Mow and Wasabi Tuna. The Pad had a perfect spiciness for me and I really enjoyed it. The Tuna was perfectly done and a really big piece. Totally looking forward to coming back to try out the other stuff on the menu in the future.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went with two of my girlfriends for one of the girl's birthday.  We didn't make reservations but was told to just come by and shouldn't be a problem. Not full so we were able to get seats easily. So my girlfriends do not over-eat/order like I do so I got a teaser of a meal, therefore, I must come back! We ordered the much recommended FIRE-ROASTED GARLIC CHICKEN and I must say that I never order chicken at restaurants but made an exception here. Unbelievable! Mouth-watering as I'm recalling the flavors. Yummy crispy garlic skin. Juicy chicken pieces whether white or dark meat. Sauce or juice drippings were a must to dip for each bite. Delicious!   We also ordered the SCALLOPS. Made perfectly and the condiments on top were just a perfect compliment.  I'm sorry, I should have wrote this review immediately afterdinner - I don't remember the topping?!  But ironically, I also don't order scallops often as i find it can be bland but this was not the case.  So tasty, so good! Finally, we had to try the GRANDMOTHER'S RAVIOLI.  It was very good but I think Babbo's was better.  The filling was just not that memorable. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Service was good, decor is ""handsome"" and food was very good!  I have to go back to try the other dishes including a salad of some sort.  Hmmmm.

"My wife and I had dinner here on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is located on the 6th floor of Macy's Department store and overlooks Herald Square. There are many tables which afford a view of Herald Square which is formed by the intersection of Broadway and 6th Avenue. We had a great view of the Empire State Building and as night fell the upper floors of Empire were bathed in light. The setting certainly contributed to our dining experience. The dining area is is modern, chic and very comfortable. The atmosphere is casual and welcomes both diners who make the restaurant their destination and those who have spent time shopping at the department store. We found the service to be attentive yet not intrusive. Our server was wonderful. She was able to answer our questions concerning menu items and kept our table well attended. The other staff members too were friendly and helpful. My wife had a Napoli Salad which consisted of many ingredients. As she said there was ""a lot going on"" in the salad. She enjoyed it and would order it again. I had Arancini which is fried risotto balls, sausage and mozzarella. It was ok. Found it a bit dry. Would try something else as an appetizer next visit. Also had their Pappa Al Pomodoro soup which is tomato based. If you enjoy soup...order it. As a main course my wife had Tortino Di Melanzane which is made with eggplant, mozzarella, tomato, and parmigiano-reggiano. It was excellent. My wife's only criticism was the portion was small and she wished that it was served with a side of pasta. I too felt the main course portion was small. I had their lasagna which is not the usual dish served in 'red sauce' restaurants. Bechamel, black kale, fontina and sausage made up this dish which was excellent. For dessert my wife had a ricotta based cheesecake which was quite good and it was served with a small scoop of gelato. I had their Tiramisu which was a unique presentation of this dessert favorite. Certainly I would have it again. Overall this was a fine dining experience and we would return to this restaurant without hesitation.","[0.0, 1.0]"

And yet, Yerba Buena changed all that and made it more than worthwhile to get out this evening! We were greeted at the door by Giovanni, who ushered my party through the bar area to a table in the restaurant.  Our server made sure I was comfortable, adjusting the tables to work perfectly for our 4 top.  That's just the beginning, drinks were excellent (Azteca & Pico Sour), and food was delicious (ceviche, black cod, and ribeye)!  Everything tasted so FRESH!  Servers and Giovanni were VERY attentive to our needs and accommodated us throughout the evening with bright warm smiles and laughter.  They certainly made us feel like special guests!  All around amazing dining experience, a gem in the LES!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Molly's cozy atmosphere really invites you in during the winter months, and the Irish staff make a visit friendly and fun. The food wasn't the best, though. Tried the much-lauded chicken pot pie and burger, and neither was a hit (the former was on the bland side with too-large chunks of chicken, and the latter was too charred and dry to warrant a recommendation). Perhaps it was a case of over-hyped bar food failing to be of restaurant quality, but it was a bit of a disappointment. The atmosphere is still good--I'm looking forward to going back for drinks and possibly trying other dishes to give Molly's a chance to up its star value.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The meal was fine--nothing special AT ALL. So you can imagine my disappointment when this restaurant--one of the ""hot places"" in New York right now--overcharged me by $30 (after I signed my receipt for the correct amount). $30 is basically just enough to make it annoying. I have since called THREE times to be told each time that it was the restaurant's ""rush"" hour, but I would receive a return phone call first thing the next day. I have still not received a return call. I think this behavior--basically credit card fraud--is extremely unprofessional for a restaurant of this caliber.

Went there with a friend.  Both of us pigged out and got a little bit of everything.  Everything was fantastic.  Burnt ends are out of this world and the sweet potatoes are cooked just the way I like.  Love that I can buy their meat and cook it at home.  It's great to have a place in the neighborhood that really supports local farms and sustainable agriculture.  Which they had a real bar - a glass of bourbon would have been the perfect companion to my meal.  The ONLY downside to the meal was the door opening and closing was letting in a LOT of freezing cold air.  Hopefully next winter they can take care of that.  Service was awesome.  Will definitely be going back again and again.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

My favorites include the fried sushi, summer lamb with pecan and bacon topped frise salad, and fried cheesecake with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

"I love Ippudo. And Im pretty sure Ippudo loves me back. because every single time I've been there, its been just as incredible as the first. Not many restaurants can do that. Anyway, the pork buns. ALMOST make the ramen forgettable. ALMOST. the pork buns are two per order and come steaming hot with white fluffy buns stuffed with a slice of perfectly tender pork belly. If I haven't made it very clear, GET THE PORK BUNS. (Oh, and as a side note, some people think that the pork buns at Momofuku are better. uhm. no. The only thing that Momofuku makes that is better than Ippudo is the Compost cookie. And that's only because Ippudo doesn't make cookies. I'm convinced that if they did, they'd be better at Ippudo.) Anyway, as far as the ramen..I always get the Akamaru Modern. The broth is really thick and smoky and I absolutely love it. For you guys who aren't satisfied with just one bowl, if you ration your broth you can order the kae-dama which is another serving of noodles. Not bad for just two more bucks. (another side note, if you're in NJ, check out Mitsuwa Marketplace in Edgewater...they have a ramen section there that makes comparable ramen.

"For a place that serves organic meat, they're sure not concerned about the environment. I went in for take out and asked for it to go.

And the potato salad (I had ordered broccoli salad and didn't realize it was potato until I got it home) got it's own separate bag, too. All 3 of these went into 1 large paper bag. When I asked if I could just leave the paper bag there - the response was ""it would really be easier if you took it."" I get that. But what ever happened to using less in the first place?

Kefi is the best greek restaurant on the Upper Westside.  Very big.  Two floors.  I think it must hold over 200 people and is packed for dinner almost every night.  It is a good idea to get there a little early.  You will be amazed at how fast it fills up as people swarm in and fill every table.  They seem to basically do two huge seatings a night and closes early with registers full.  A very efficient operation and I love the food!  It is worthy of five stars for what it is.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Welcome to Brooklandia, a not very funny parody of an uptight locavorian nightmare. Arrived on a recent Saturday evening to find the place empty, despite the Saturday Night ribs special. Problem was you had to order a full rack, enough to feed a family of four, for $50. Apparently the kitchen lacks knives sharp enough to cut the ribs into human-sized portions. So much for the special. So I ordered a burger and shortly received a glistening slab of ground beef with melted cheese, a bun, and some pickles. No lettuce or tomato. I asked the waitress whether they might happen to have a tomato in the kitchen, whereupon she flushed and said, No, we have no tomatoes in the kitchen. That's a shame, I said. Might they have a bit of lettuce to liven up the extra boring burger? No, no lettuce. But wait, I countered, you serve salads don't you? And didn't you just describe the beautiful local bib lettuce purchased from the farmers market that very morning? Would you mind asking the chef if he could spare a single piece of lettuce, pretty please? She flushed a bit more and said she would ask, but she wasn't promising success. A short time later she returned and said that the chef would consent to give me some lettuce, but that he was going to have to cut it for me. Hurray, he does have a knife after all! Seconds later, a plate appeared bearing four stately leaves. Joy! After we had finished eating, a fellow at the next table asked if he might also have some lettuce on his burger. No, the waitress said, we don't put lettuce on our burgers. But _they_ got lettuce, he pointed out, as she tried to justify the refusal of basic burger garnish. Eager to help, we passed the remaining two leaves across the table. Don't worry dude, we've got you covered. Nothing worse than a badly dressed burger.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"took the SO here this past monday for his birthday.  as other people have written, their drinks are just ok.  the true gem is the food. our server was incredibly nice, and made very good recommendations. we started off with the bibb lettuce salad (her rec over the caesar) with toasted hazel nuts, fried onions and bacon bits, with a creamy cheddar dressing. the dressing wasn't heavy at all, and the salad was the perfect blend of different textures (crunchy nuts, chewy bacon, crisp lettuce).  we also had the mushroom flatbread, which was a nice starter to share.  even though we got it with the duck prosciutto, i think next time we will forego that option.  it was cut into 8 pieces and each piece had the smallest 1/2 inch by 1/2 piece of duck prosciutto. i couldn't even really taste it. for our entrees everything looked so good we had a hard time deciding. in the end we chose a half portion of the gumbo (great, but quite meaty, with almost too much pulled duck overwhelming it), the famous fried chicken and the shrimp and grits.  i liked their version of shrimp and grits, and their chicken doesn't need more praise.  although, i should mention it came out cold, so we sent it back. i think they ended up refrying the same pieces (i could see where i took a bite) but it came out hot and juicy!  now that's impressive (overnight?) buttermilk marination.  the accompanying cornbread and salad were awesome, as everyone else has mentioned previously. for dessert we had the coconut chiffon cake and the hot chocolate dessert.  both were great. we got to the redhead at about 6:50 on a monday night.  the tables were half empty, but by 7:10 they were all full. on one of the slowest nights, and with this economy? that's how good the food is.  can't wait to go back and try the burger and cod.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"An awful food experience. Where shall I begin. Well, let me start off by saying that I had ordered a lamb gyro platter. Gave the guy on the till the ten dollars. Ten minutes had passed, I was stunned when the waitress had brought me a chicken gyro platter. I told her that I ordered lamb and this was the wrong order, the guy on the till ( a guy with a goatee, if ever you have the misfortune of being there) got angry. He packed the lamb gyro in a take away box and 'threw' a piece of bread in the paper bag. He was boiling with rage. How can you treat customers in such a way. Presuming that the customers should accept what they get even though its not what they wanted is rather strange. After such a horrid experience, allow me to describe the meat. In one word 'oily'. The bag that contained the 'oily beast meat' was     full of oily splodges! The meat was lying on the top of a salad, which may I add became drenched in a sea of oil. In short, if you want to experience true Turkish cuisine, do yourself a favour and steer away from this dreadful excuse for a restaraunt!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is my favorite restaurant I have tried on the UWS so far. Have been there twice and each time the food was delicious. For appetizers got a bit adventurous and had the grilled octopus, which was crispy and flavorful. The warm feta was also great. For main courses the pasta with greek sausage was cooked well and had wonderful unique flavors. The hanger steak was garlicky and delicious. Have a nice selection of greek wine and beer. We waited two minutes for our table to be ready and the bartender let us sample some of the beers on tap for free when we couldn't decide what to get. Only downside here is the noise level and that once seated the service is a bit lacking.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pizza Nirvana. My ex girlfriend was born and raised in Marine Park. She used to hang out at Spumoni Garden's throughout high school. She took me up to L&B and I was instantly hooked! She knows that I'm a pizza snob and no matter how much we argued we both agreed NYC pizza is better than any pizza in my hometown of Philly. L&B is Pizza Nirvana. To boot, they make incredibly delicious and simple artichokes and shrimp parm in the restaurant! I've heard the cheesesteak there is the best outside Philly, but all of the times there I never ventured to have one, it was either pizza or shrimp parm for me. Now, I grew up on water ice. I don't ""get"" spumoni, but the Italian ice @ L&B is quintessential NYC style. Just perfect. I'm getting hungry just writing this!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Returned to Joe's after an 8-month hiatus and my love for this restaurant remains unwavering. Our wait for 9 people wasn't too bad for a Sunday evening (approximately 30 minutes). We had a really funny waiter who helped us pick entrees (as I'm always at somewhat at a loss for what to order other than the soup dumplings and green beans Szechaun-style, especially when I'm put on the spot to order for the table by my darling father). The pork soup dumplings were delicious as always. Other dishes we had that were really good - scallion pancakes, sliced beef with jalapeno, pork fried rice, prawns in chili sauce (though it's not really a chili sauce and more of a sweet sauce), kung pao chicken, and water spinach. Not a fan of the curry noodles so I wouldn't recommend that. Oh and good to know: it's cash only.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"How did I not write a review about this place immediately upon my return home?!?! Sadly, I somehow did not give them the 5 stars that were well deserved when Jim G. and I went in Fall of 2011. I am very remiss in my duties.  Better late than never! Our trip to NYC really needs to be renamed ""Michelin Star Tours.""  We enjoyed three 3-star Michelin dinners and one 1-star Michelin lunch (and really, Bouley needs to be bumped up!).  La Sirene, we thought, was a break from the rich, belly-busting, flavor-overload meals.  While La Sirene certainly was a break in the amount our credit card was being abused, La Sirene delivered on flavor and enjoyment!! Get a reservation now!! Seriously, go make your reservation and then come back to read the rest of the review. When we went to this place, it was cash only and BYOB.  While cash-only can be problematic, BYOB totally makes up for it! =)  (Perhaps it's just the lush in me, but seriously!)  Even though I am fully into the low-carb eating, I would 100% order the Goat Cheese Tart right now; weight be damned! It's amazingly good. And, while it's totally for sharing in brisk weather, order the Cassoulet.  Between that and the Goat Cheese Tart, be sure to bring a nice Bordeaux or Meritage to stand up to these dishes. I will visit this place again when I'm back in NYC. Did you get a reservation yet???","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had the reina and bomba (same as the reina but with avocado i think) and it was one of the best foods I have EVER had! My boyfriend had the Pabellon and couldn't get enough of it.

And there's just something about sweet onions and mushrooms cooked in an iron pan, no matter the cuisine, that I love.

"This is a very nice, high end restaurant Inside the restaurant is very modern, and is very big, they separated out a small area which people can go sit down and have a drink close to the bar area, and also a huge dinning area, and upstairs as well Upstairs you can use it for private event, like Christmas, New Year or Birthday parties, of course is all depending how many people you have in mind Location is great, on 5th Ave, many people go there for dinner and after that heading to 230 Fifth Ave roof top bar lounge, which is on the next block Close to Madison Square Park, just incase you eaten too much, you need to walk it off. lol Now to the food I ordered the Lamb Chop, is a good size portion, is very tasty, medium like I ordered, however it got burned a little bit, I have to cut them off My friend ordered the Duck Shawarma, she said is really good, and she won't let me try it, so I guess is really good. lol Overall, 4 stars, almost 5, but they burned my lamb chop, gotta be more careful guys, that is costing you 1 star :-) I will go back for sure, this place is good for lunch or dinner business meeting or just friends getting together for a nice dinner If you're in the area, you don't have to look anymore, is not much there, at least you walk a few more blocks more to Madison Ave","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pretty much everyone I know has been to this Halal truck and gosh it has over 2000+ reviews. Unreal. So with all the hype, you are bound to be letdown. We were headed to MoMA and figured this would be a good stop off for a quick lunch before tackling the Diego Rivera murals. The line is always insane. We waited over 20 minutes for food. Unheard of for a cart. I ordered the falafel and since they didn't have any on hand, we waited some more for a mysterious bag of falafels to show up. My friend got the combo rice dish. We both got red sauce and white sauce squirted all over our food. And for $6, it really isn't a bad deal, but it isn't what it's all cracked up to be. I found the rice to be flat and the white sauce was just too creamy for me. I didn't finish everything, and had enough leftover for another meal. Overall, a decent find, but nothing to really rave about. I have no idea why people love this truck so much. I am not a conformer and I wasn't sold on this place.

"A LUNCHING LEBANESE HOAX? This place is modern and fabulous looking but really overpriced with small portions. 25 for a prix fix lunch of lebneh 3 table spoons in a bowl and a wrap that i could get for 5 bucks from the arab guy on a side cart of fifth ave.  The sandwhich was mediocre. Maybe I should have ordered something more elaborate. Ilili/the emporers new clothes! I got the wrap and when they told me it came with fried potatoes I asked for them on the side. The waitress contested saying it was only two thin slices. I said, ""i would like them on the side."" She fought with me and now there are a whole bunch of potatoes in the wrap not 2  like 6. I had expressed I wanted something light and not heavy. You are not suppossed to fight with your customers about the food they are paying for and ordering. The managers name is EVA TORRES. I feel sick now from the potatoes. What about i want the potatoes on the side was not understood? I was trying to be nice asking twice but she kept insisting. The only consolation was the yummy ginger-cucumber-mint lemonade and my waiter who later came to attend me, Rolando, he made things better and was super nice.   I would only give this place another try if the chef personally invited me in. I heard from so many people that it was great here. All i can say is the lebneh was great. Ps I know what I am talking about I have a father that makes the best lebanese food on the planet and a step father who is James Beard nominated, the founder of modern spa cuisine who the NY Times calls a ""Kitchen Genius.""

"Extremely expensive for what you get. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, but the portions are obscenely small for the price. You'll most likely leave wanting to find something more to eat, which is crazy for nearly $100/pp. The raw Tuna appetizer was good, and the Lobster Tagliolini with black squid ink pasta was delicious. The special was a (Australian) truffle risotto. No meat, and the secret price of the rissoto came to $50 when the bill appeared. Even worse, the portion was about 3/4 of a cup. Crazy! Apparently, their specialty is a simple spagetti with red sauce. Adding meat is not an option. Scarpetta is not necessarily a restaurant for meat lovers.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"a friend was in town who was staying with his wife's friend in LIC.  i don't recall if i have an opinion of LIC.  anyhow, my friend's wife's friends were adamant about 'robin des bois', which i'm going to call RotW here on out.  while i've never been to RotW , i was able to deduce the gist.  i should mention that i don't like english beer or english-style beer.  nothing against branding of generalizing, strictly taste.   so, in order to satisfy my own palette, i went to rye prior to meeting up with said friend and co for (unofficial) brunch at RotW. timewise it worked out well.  rye is one of those places unlike diner (85 bway) that allows people inside prior to officially opening, which for diner, i feel compelled to add, is generally late. whenever that time is. i say this to say this: it was a very good thing i went to rye.  sat at the bar.  too early for the crowd.  ny times paper.  didn't (doesn't?) have a burger, so audibled with meatloaf with sunny side style on top.  started with the scotch egg.  it was all about the scotch egg.  simply fantastic.   then i drove to RotW to watch people eat as i had a mediocre glass of orange juice and a forgettable squash soup.   also, the hostess or overseer of the hostess at rye was pleasant and patient with questions about what to get and eat.  also curious to know my story, so i was frank about it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ive become very interested in New York's Spanish food recently...I lived in Spain for a few years, and now that I am back, I miss the traditional Spanish food that I enjoyed there. That said, I cannot give Boqueria more than 3 stars because it doesnt really hit me as authentic. Its more of a hip place than a true tapas restuarant. I hope thats clear, and its not meant as a bad thing to Boqueria whose food is really good.

"My boyfriend and I had dinner here for the first time last Friday night, around 9pm. First impression - loved the adorable outdoor seating. The bistro is housed in a beautiful brownstone on the corner of Lenox and 122, and the seating area is quiet, unobtrusive and lovely. Second impression - as the outdoor seating area was full by the time we arrived, we were seated inside. While the indoor space has a lot of potential, it's clear that they are still working on the overall look and feel. It's warmly lit and has a lot of potential, but the tables are slightly too large for the space, and there are too few small details - the table are bare (no flowers, candles, etc), minimal artwork on the walls, etc. However, whatever was lacking in atmosphere was made up for with the food - AMAZING! My boyfriend ordered one of the nightly specials (roasted chicken) and I chose the salmon. Both were excellent. So good that we are still talking about it. We'll definitely be back, and we're looking forward to seeing how the inside decor comes into it's own.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's good, yes. But probably not worth all the hype. Worth most of it? Sure. Interesting beer selection. Lots of imports and some regionals. Though I must say that the Saison DuPont tasted like it had been in storage too long. Sad since that's probably my favorite beer ever. The Millennium Falco pizza with pork sausage was pretty damn tasty. Visited perfectly with a thin crust. The bowl of mussels is also good, but the sausage in the broth didn't really add much. Reasonably priced as well. The special of the day when we went was a seared sea bass, which was just okay. Not worth the $26 price tag for a tiny filet. I do have to note that the men's bathroom is one if the strangest I've ever seen. It's one of the only ones where if you were to sit on the toilet, the door would be behind you. Also, there's a double sink but it's a single occupancy bathroom. Lots of questions about that... But anyway, come early on a weeknight to beat the crowds!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Took me a really long time to get here. Just glad that through the years Tarif remains just as terrific ad consistent. Did an impromptu drop by hoping to anchor a table on saturday night with no reservation.  Wasn't sure how long the wait would be  but we decided to try our luck. Just in our favor we were able to squeeze at the end of the bar. So one of my ""things"" is that I normally avoid open kitchen restaurants. I hate leaving restaurants smelling like the entire meal for hours after. But really this place, fabulous ventilation! Even though we were up against the bar with the passing service, it never felt truly stuffy. The bars a great spot to dine, watch the cooks at their game. The bartenders are extremely chill which makes dining here feel hip. Their recommendations are the best for both food and drinks. Wine list is fabulous and the selections are great.

We did the usual wait for a table for Sunday brunch routine except the hostess started seating people who came in 15 minutes after us so that was a bit annoying.

Well, forget your cholesterol and go for it here... the only issue which is thus my rating is all our food arrived cold.

This review is however for one single waitress that works there. She's notoriously incompetent and indifferent. The only instances I've had that were poor were when she was waiting my table. Girl, you should not be working in the service industry. You clearly don't give a fuck about the people the serving and you perpetually look like you're annoyed by the work you're paid to do. You're lazy and shitty.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We stumbled upon this place without knowing all of the glowing write-ups etc, etc.  Ordered the grilled salmon steak which arrived apparently still squirming on the plate.  Each bite contained more bones than one could possibly spit out.  When we informed that this dish was not quite what was expected, we were offered a substitute. But we were told that we would still be charged for the original dish..because it was ""prepared perfectly""!  Excuse me? What did you just say?...Check please!  There are far too many restaurants out there to be treated like we don't know what we like.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Any Friends fans out there?  How many of you recognize this street corner? A few weekends ago, I visited this cute little red and blue restaurant for brunch.  Known as the little owl, this quaint joint offers classic dishes in an intimate, cozy setting.  While there was a bit of a wait, it wasn't outrageous.  When I finally sat down, I perused the menu and started with the whole wheat pancakes with seasonal berries and maple syrup. I admit that I ordered the whole wheat pancakes on a healthy kick - I wasn't too sure how they would taste.  I was pleasantly surprised  - they were hearty, fluffy and with a bit of a nutty kick; I didn't miss my white flour pancakes at all. I'd recommend these guys (I'm sure the syrup helped a bit too). Me eating buddy ordered the poached eggs with the fontina sausage biscuits, greens and hollandaise.  Wahhh, egg overboard!  Despite the capsized demise of one of the poached eggs, the dish was still pretty good. I'd say the eggs, hollandaise and spinach were as expected, but what set the dish apart was the fontina sausage biscuit.  Salty, savory and chewy, the biscuits provided a solid backdrop for the rich hollandaise and creamy eggs. If you find yourself in the West Village, the little owl is a a great little spot to pop into for brunch (and I assume for dinner as well, though I haven't tried it yet).   Quaint little brunch spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Really good and inexpensive Italian place in the East Village.  The name might cause you to think you are eating at a Hungarian restaurant, but that's not the case.  I ordered off of the fixed price menu which was $15.00 for a starter and main course and both the minestrone soup and salmon were excellent.  The server also gave us each an extra glass of wine on the house.  Very quiet, friendly place with good food.  I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"4.5 stars! My mind has been blown.  As I write this review, I am slowly salivating as I recall each dish from my memory of just two nights ago. 'Twas the night before Independence day and the restaurant was empty at around 7pm.  I am guessing all the classy folks who frequent this restaurant are all rich enough to be sailing on their fancy yachts for their July 4th getaway.  Not complaining, I felt like we had the restaurant to ourselves!  However, overhearing other people talk, this seems rare.  Still do make reservations. The restaurant is not huge, and neither is it overally decorated.  It seems very simple. If sensitive to the cold, avoid the tables in the back because the air conditioning vents will blow right at your face.  I requested for a seat change and glad I did so. In our new seat, we had a view of the bar menu on a chalkboard as well.  Those items are also available to us. Our waitress and staff was very attentive (almost a bit too attentive), stopping by every few minutes. Bread is of course offered, with olive oil.  But let's hurry and move on to the food: Excitedly, I ordered for the two of us to share: Spicy Duck Meatballs: yea yea, they were good.  I don't know if it justifies ALL the hype in the reviews. Definitely does melt in your mouth.  The meatball breaks apart pretty easily, comes with 4. This dish was not the star of my dinner though.  As apparent through the menu, duck is the meat of the chef's choice. Deviled Eggs (from the bar menu): Oh my god, these are AMAZING! I loved the added sweetness in the yolk, it was a great sensation in my mouth (TWSS). Fried Oysters: Hands down the best dish here. The flavors were amazing and it was fried to perfection! Please do yourself a favor and get this. Total of 4 oysters and they were nice enough to split it into two plates for us.  So thoughtful. Risotto: I think this is the first time I had risotto at a restaurant, I have usually had it home cooked so that is my only comparison.  Flavors are huge in this dish.  My boyfriend loved it.  For me, I couldn't handle how much flavor it had (mainly from the cheese), it was a bit overwhelming after the 5th bite.  However, a great dish to share!  We also felt like it was a bit undercooked, but I think I need order another risotto from another restaurant to really compare. Pork Loin: At first, we thought they made the mistake of giving us two orders.  But before we could ask, they let us know it has been halved (two thin slices).  Please DO NOT order this for one person.  Even halved and split between two people it was an enormous amount of meat in one sitting (TWSS).  First bite into my pork loin: absolute heaven.  Perfectly crisp and tender.  However, 4 bites into it, I realized there was much too much fat on my piece.  I had to actually spit some back out because it was too fatty.  My boyfriend on the other hand, his piece was very dry.  Between the two of us, I wish it was more evened out. Total cost of dinner: $98 (includes tax, not tip) this also includes a dessert. Despite the pork loin disappointment, this was still one of the best meals I have had at a restaurant.  I will definitely come back!  Really want to try their scallops and other duck dishes.  Unfortuantely, they did not have the pork belly anymore...womp womp. Can't wait until next time!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So very bad.  Eataly is Italian cuisine vomited up by good taste.  The idea is interesting enough to bite, but the execution pains the soul.  This place is an offense to all senses.  It is logistically confusing, the food is sub-par for cuisine that should have been created by some of the industry's most recognizable chefs, and the vision is too scattered.  To read the poster that explains Eataly prior to entering is to be perplexed; to try to navigate the strange design of space, crowds and stressed out employees is to be gravely annoyed; to taste foods that are not worth the time spent on long lines and expensive prices is to be utterly disappointed. For the prime real estate that Eataly has, New York deserves better representation of Italian cuisine.  Mario and Lidia, my heart has sunk and my respect for you, deteriorated.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went there today on whim. I had been craving some BBQ these last couple days and decided to give this place a try. Normally I go to Dinosaur (Harlem) or Hill Country (Flat Iron) for BBQ. I am so glad I tried a new place the staff was very pleasant and patient at my request to sample items before I made my selection (sample before purchase is always a plus in my book). Pro- Brisket was AMAZINGLY FLAVORFUL, TENDER and MOIST (exactly what the carver had promised it would :-) ). Brisket had GREAT texture (was not overly chewy). This is a FAVORITE. It outshines everything. Ribs- I enjoyed the ribs that are prepared at Mighty Quinn's. Ribs have a nice crust, GREAT texture, not chewy or rubbery at all. The ribs are not drenched in sauce (I hate when ribs are served in bathed in sauce, especially a sweet sauce). I want to be able to taste my BBQ Rib and control the amount of sauce I put on it (if I need the sauce). Move over Dinosaur,  I found a new BBQ home in Mighty Quinn's. Hill Country, Its the end of the road for us. Take Out- I live in Queens and ordered my brisket, spare ribs and sides to go. I was extremely happy to see the food MAINTAIN its INTEGRITY as I traveled with it via MTA and had to reheat it in my oven 2 hours later (another plus in imho). Cons- Vinegar Coleslaw/Sweet Potato Casserole - It was not bad, but it wasn't memorable. But I prefer the coleslaw to the sweet potato casserole. Really folks it's the brisket that is the star of the show. I am glad this place doesn't offer mac and cheese I feel that has become to predictable as a side.","[0.0, 1.0]"

As for the meal itself, the artichoke cheese dip was splendid. Well made.  I dined on Romaine Salad and the 5 cheese macaroni. And for dessert: Cheesecake.

"This place already has so many reviews... will another one help/hurt? Simply put, their Maine Wildberry pancakes are to die for... delicious and fluffy!

The wait is worth it and their new notification system of when your table is ready via text is amazing so you can go about doing your thing before being seated. This place even has a recipe book so you can try (TRY!) to make it like they do. Mixed berry scone was pretty delicious too but not something I'll be getting each time I visit... unlike the pancakes. Must go to when you visit NY for pancakes! Especially if you've never really been into pancakes - taste it the right way!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've eaten here twice with high hopes. The first time I was put off based on the service. The manager or owner was sitting at the bar on his laptop during service and chastising the staff. The second time, tonight, the food was cold. We ordered the feast for 3 yet we were served a meager amount of the authentic lentil or bean-based dishes (miser wot, etc) and overloaded with beets, raw kale, a cat food looking dish that we could not identify (eggplant?) and other atypical dishes. The injera on the plate was tough and unenjoyable. It was about 45 minutes before close, and I honestly think they just gave us the leftovers from the day, but damn! We paid $40 for that ""feast"" and as an avid lover of Ethiopian cuisine, I was truly disappointed and left hungry.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went to Plyos on a Saturday night and had a 9:45pm reservation. We got there and were asked to wait as our table wasn't ready yet. Unfortunately we weren't seated until 10:45pm, but fortunately because of good company and a bottle of wine while we waited, we weren't phased by this delay. The restaurant staff was very apologetic while we waited, which was nice to see. Once we were seated the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and again very apologetic for the wait.  The timing of our food was perfect. We ordered the meatballs, octopus and mousakka as appetizers, all of which were great. The Mousakka being our favorite. For dinner, our entrees included the stripe bass (average), lamb chops (delicious), and the shrimp and scallop pasta (good).  The lamb chops were definitely the favorite item of the night! It happened to be my birthday so I was surprised with a round of dessert options and dessert wine compliments of the restaurant! DELICIOUS!! The service was top notch and the atmosphere is perfect.

"I love this place. The food, the atmosphere, the wine list, the service... It's all really good! It's in the coziest little space and the decor makes it extra inviting. I've been there twice. Let's get down to it: The first visit I only meant to go for a glass of wine and an app... So we ordered the Cauliflower toast and two glasses of rose. Who knew something with ""toast"" in it's name could be so freakin' delicious? Since that was good and we were a glass of wine in, we ordered the Kale Panzanella. What a nice new way to have Kale in light salad with generous sized croutons and thinly sliced mild cheese. We decided we were on a roll and went for a double: the hamachi (the couple next to us ordered it so we had to upon seeing it!) and the lobster toast. These two were even more delicious then the first two. The second visit I dragged one of my UES friends there knowing she'd be impressed. Our food selections weren't quite as good as my first visit, but everything was still delicious none the less.  We did the Cauliflower toast again (a must!) as well as the Kale Panzanella. She too loved the toast - and the salad was a nice add on, though not a must have in her opinion. Next we ordered the Hen of the Woods - in my friends exact words it ""wasn't amazing, but it was good"". The hamachi was once again a huge win and my friend loved it. My ideal menu would go back to my first visit (Cauliflower Toast, Lobster Toast, Kale Salad and Hamachi), but I'd still be open to trying some new things. The people next to us on the last visit had the Octopus and it looked amazing - but we were two full to order it. I'm also eager to try the black bass. We'll be going back for a third visit soon:-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had dinner Friday night at Maialino for the first time. I loved the look of the restaurant. It reminded me of an upscale country kitchen. I liked the openness of the restaurant including the bread station and the salumeria station. My companion and I were greeted by the host from the moment we walked through the doors till we left. Service was very attentive, and our water glasses were always full. We started with the chef's selection of salumeria. The prosciutto was delicious. The soppresata was good, but we both preferred Espositio's from Court Street in Brooklyn. The tonnarelli pasta made with pecorino and black pepper was creamy with a bite from the pepper,albeit a little heavy on the salt. Delicious. We had the   roast suckling pig. I've read some of the other reviews, and I have to say the pig was devine. The skin was very crisp as it should be, and the meat was succulent and juicy. It is definitely for 3 people, so if you are a duo, you will have leftovers. The dining room was a bit noisy. but  I would go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If you're in the mood for no fun, this is the place for you! I love spending time with people who have sticks shoved up their ass as much as the next person, but this place really takes the cake. I was reprimanded at this bar for clapping along with live music. Perhaps I danced a little jig, too. Sometimes I can't contain myself, what with being human and enjoying lively tunes. Why would a place have live music if they didn't want people to dance? Dancing and listening to music are age-old customs, dating back before the iphone 5 and snobbery based on looking like an asshole with clothes that look like shit but cost a lot. The owner of this bar, sitting in the back, smelling her own farts, told us that this place was not for fun, but for being 'mellow'. If I wanted a place to be mellow, I'd play some light jazz and not provide a dance floor. Or a stage. This bar is everything that is wrong with the Brooklyn culture these days.

"I don't typically give out 5 stars, and truth be told, I hesitated to do so here - but when I started to remember the food, I realized I could not be stingy. The negative first: Why did I hover over 4 stars?  The decor is just fine, but I typically feel a five-star restaurant will have something special about the interior.  Here, I felt nothing.  Perhaps I'd have had a different experience if we were able to get in on the actual dining room, but when we called for a reservation at about 5pm that Sat, every table was booked and we were left to chance as to whether we'd find a spot at the bar.  Rather than have to sit at the bar, there are two small tables that you can snag across from the bar, and we were just lucky enough to get one of them. I guess that makes it a 5-star situation, since you can still hope to steal a chance to dine at Hearth in spite of its extreme popularity any given night! The other minor thing that made me want to almost give Hearth a 4 - the music situation was odd.  I noticed a random variety of pop going on in the background at any given time - especially when a song came on after what was perfectly fine music-less silence (and the gentle hum of diners talking). But onto the good -- THE FOOD!!! I went with, yes, FD, and we both got the seasonal tasting ($76 for 5 courses, subject to change each day).  The house was kind enough to offer a warm turnip soup to warm us up, and it was rich and somewhat sweet.  The tasting began with a fabulous poached lobster with lobster tortellini - this was by far my favorite dish - what a way to start.  The lobster was tender and cooked to perfection, while the tortellini was like nothing I've ever put in my mouth!! The pasta was thin and delicate, not unlike a wonton skin, and the filling was heavenly. Next was a pork sausage with another pasta I cannot recall the name of (long and flat).  Again, the pasta was very delicate, obviously made fresh daily, and allowed you to really enjoy the sauteed sausage and broccoli rabe. No heavy creams or sauces, just a purity of flavor. We followed with the main course - ribeye of beef with short ribs, beets and marrow.  The pieces of ribeye were absolutely perfect, and the minced beets a great companion (although perhaps would have been better in bigger slices).  Of course, who can say anything bad about marrow... but the short ribs seemed a bit much. I'd honestly have left this off the dish, as it was just seriously overloading it. Finally - two, yes TWO desserts! First an orange parfait with candied pistachios.  Great texture and tartness, a nice way to cleanse the palate and ready you for the passionfruit souffle with chocolate sauce.  I loved the lightness of this souffle - as they tend to be overly chocolate and heavy, and that the flavor was passionfruit was definitely rather unique.  FD believed he had never had such a wondrous dessert in all his life (and he's lived much of it in France). We paired this meal with a fabulous bottle of I don't know what (FD picked it out with the help of a very knowledgeable sommelier), and it was served at the perfect temperature.  I have to say, I always love a good sommelier. Service was really good -- each dish was introduced, plates cleared timely, wine and water refilled aptly.  We never felt rushed, and was permitted to enjoy our food and have a serious conversation (I felt a bit sorry for the staff, as I could tell they were trying to not interrupt our talk, while providing excellent service). So yeah - a rare five-star review from Joan H! The food simply communicated dedication and love, and the staff was more than happy to share that with you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The cuisine at Bouley is an interesting cross between old-school french cuisine with rich creamy sauces / purees and modern techniques of making different foams and clouds.  Dinner was wonderful and the wine pairings were very nice: 1.  Starting with a roasted chestnut soup amuse, topped with a ricotta cheese ""cloud"". 2.  Uni terrine with ossetra caviar 3.  Chattham oyster with a lemon cloud 4.  Porcini flan with dungeness crab and black truffles (wow!) 5.  Chatham Lobster with mushrooms and fresh fruit 6.  Farm egg with artichoke polenta and comte foam 7.  Scallops tandoori 8.  Boneless rack of lamb with zucchini-mint, onion, olive, and potato purees.  Easily one of the best lamb dishes I've ever had in my life, and I'd go so far as to say even better than the French Laundry. 9.  Duck breast with almond foam and truffle honey 10.  Chilled coconut soup with pineapple sorbet 11. Chocolate souffle, chocolate ice cream, white chocolate foam (double wow!) We came late (drinks at Weather up next door first) and service was still very good.  Restaurant wasn't full so there wasn't a lot of waiting in between courses, which personally I find to be nice on a weeknight. Bouley is in that middle ground, a solid 1-Michelin star but still trying to figure out how to get over the hump to 2 stars.  I think if they continue to innovate and refine their style to be more modern and less old-school they can get there in the next few years.  I look forward to seeing what they do next year.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My kind of outdoor bar/restaurant. It is a simple place, with basic food like tacos, corn on the cob, burritos and chips. Beers and a couple alcoholic drinks like frozen margaritas. The drinks and food are not that special (Food 3.5 stars- drinks 2 stars), but what makes Habana Outpost great is the laid-back outdoor vibe. There are picnic tables and umbrellas, a nice fountain and it is super chill. You can tell all your friends to meet you there and they won't have a problem getting in, or looking for seating (most of the time).  I have had a birthday party or 2 here and we were able to get in 20-25 people with ease as long as we held down the tables for a bit. There are some weekend nights when it can get a bit busy, but mostly it is not too busy to have a drink and a seat. Tuesday mornings there is a toddler ""party"" with arts and crafts and water toys. They are kid friendly at all times. There is something for everyone at Habana.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a gluten-free paradise!  But even those of us who enjoy the pleasures of gluten can appreciate the splendor of Risotteria.   We started with an order of the gluten-free meatballs, which turned out to be both sizeable and delicious.  I then ordered the thin-crust pizza, which was also very yummy, while my wife went for the daily special seafood risotto and loved it.  Even the seasonal Steadfast GF pale ale was OK (that's high praise from a real beer drinker by the way). The only downside here is that the place is so small.  Getting in and out requires a lot of moving of the tables, and this is definitely not the place for a private conversation.  The staff were friendly, and the cooks do an amazing job in that tiny kitchen.  Check out the GF baked goods at the bar too.  Jolly good!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Though the items on the menu seem sort of generic and unexciting, everything we've eaten is made with wonderful ingredients and with great love and care.

Favorites include the tuna tacos, asparagus tacos, grilled chicken and mozzarella panini, hazelnut iced coffee, cookies, sweet potato fries...and the list goes on!

"What an apt name! Did it taste good? YES! Was it Malaysian cuisine? YES! The fried tofu was excellent, some of the best I've had-- crispy on the outside, extremely moist and melty on the inside.

"So, I was brought here by a friend when we needed a place to sit, talk and eat some good food and I've been back every two weeks. The grilled cheese is bomb (you definitely should add bacon) , tater tots to die for and you must get tomato soup to dunk everything in. The atmosphere is very chill. They usually have sports on and change it to the game of your choice if you ask so I was able to watch the Knicks lose again. The staff is extremely friendly and fun to talk to. I like how they change the name of those tip jar. Basically if you are looking to eat good food, chill environment and a couple of laughs, you should check this place out.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It was pretty mediocre. I am a big fan of Japanese food heck I'm Asian! This place is just another hipster joint for the non Asian community. I mean come on tuna guacamole roll? Sushi tacos??? Bleh. I wanted to celebrate my birthday with delicious udon and sushi so I typed in best udon in Brooklyn and this came up. Sigh.... The udon was a tad of a disappointment. Very limp and lack in udon taste..  I've had better udon in packages than this and better sushi at Toyama sushi buffet than this ... Oh well! Now I know!  If you want true authentic Japanese food please do research carefully. This was more of a touristy joint than an all authentic Japanese cuisine.

"I haven't stopped thinking about The Meatball Shop since I recently visited NYC.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not like Houdini's going to show up to do some magic tricks and out comes a midget from a hat.  There's just a sweet simplicity about this place that I love.  You sort of just have to close your eyes and forget that you're paying $15 for something that could conceivably be made at home for $5.00.  Not to mention, the portions are small. That aside, go with the basics: Beef Meatball Spicy Meatsauce Spaghetti Spinach Pass on the ice cream cookie sandwich if you belong in an area where there's a BJ's, and you have access to a pizookie. There are times where I just want the simple comfort foods, without being at home, but rather out and about.  Entering left stage is The Meatball Shop.  I do love the atmosphere of this restaurant, from the lighting to the service.  No one's rushing you to leave (good if you're seated, bad if you're not).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you want to be treated like crap go to Casa Mono.  I went last Friday night at 6:00 pm (in the summer!).  There were very few tables taken and the bar was completely empty.  I was told by the rude hostess that you had to eat a full dinner in order to sit at the bar.  I was intending to eat dinner so that was not a problem.  I went to sit down and she informed me that I could only sit if my full party was here.  I was waiting for one friend that would be there in 10 minutes.  I was not allowed to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine until she arrived.  The bar was completely empty!  As I was walking out I heard the hostess telling another party of 2 that they would have to leave their table by 7:30 because they had another reservation.  Appalling service.  No food is worth being treated like this.  I had similar treatment at babbo so sadly, I guest this is how Mario runs his restaurants.  Fortunately the night was saved...I walked just a few yards down Irving to The House and met my friend for a lovely dinning experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Yum yum yum! First tried Joe's Shanghai (Midtown) about five or six years ago and I had been thinking about them ever since. I've since tried a couple of places including DTF, but love the thicker chewier wrapper of Joe's Shanghai, just a personal preference. Finally got a chance to go to NYC again and decided to try the Chinatown location because of the lower prices and we were going to be at the 9/11 memorial anyway. We got there a little after 5 and snagged the last small table. Got three orders of dumplings to share. We got pork as well as pork and crab. Once we got to the last steamer, we realized that we couldn't tell which ones had the crab in it. So my advice would be to skip the crab and save a couple of bucks since you can't taste it anyway. We were more than satisfied with the dumplings and didn't order any other food. Once we left, the restaurant was packed and there were a bunch of people waiting outside. Highly recommend the Chinatown location if you don't care about ambiance.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Peaches has been recommended to me a few times, and though it's not strictly a BBQ joint (it's mostly known for it's Nashville style friend chicken) it's owned by the same guys at  the Smoke Joint, and it's a ten minute walk from my apartment, so I figured it was worth a shot. I went for the hand pulled pork sandwich to get the most unhindered flavor of the meat, but other options like the Smoke Pork Hash (pulled pork, red potatoes, sweet onions, sunny side eggs) and North Carolina Egg Scramble (with pulled pork, pickled onions, and scallions) are sure to appeal to the Brooklynite who loves BBQ and Brunch alike. The pork had a good flavor, and texture, and a good deal of smokiness. There was already sauce on the sandwich but it wasn't drenched and the flavor shined through. I ended up adding a heavy splashing of their homemade hot sauce, which proved to be pretty addictive. The fries that came with it were light and crispy. I think there was also an option of sweet potato fries, but sadly I didn't hear the bartender if he mentioned that to me. The roasted marinated tomato on the side was a welcomed change from the usual cole slaw. The bun was big but light and crispy, so it didn't seem too ""bread-y"" Will definitely be back next time I'm craving pulled pork and don't want to leave my 'hood.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Lunched here since we were in the neighborhood to hit the Brazilian supermarket nearby and would definitely agree with the positive Yelp ratings. Service wasn't particularly fast, but neither was it inattentive. Mini arepas con nata - pillowy soft on the inside with a pleasantly crispy shell. Could have used a bit more nata perhaps. We didn't finish these right away, but the textures held up surprisingly well when we polished off the last one at the end of the meal. Arepa Pabellon - tried this one on multiple Yelp recommendations and yes, it's solid. The sweet plantain adds a nice contrast, but because of the filling distribution, it's easy to get a bite with a little too much and just overpower the other ingredients. Otherwise, a really solid choice. Arepa Guayanesa Tropical - we got this because our Venezuelan friend told us guayanesa is not so easy to find. Perhaps a bit on the more muted side, but the green cilantro sauce really helped bring this one together. Jugo de papelon - the brown sugar lemonade is actually more citrus than it is pure sweet despite the name interpretation. We found this to be a perfect drink to accompany the meal. Cafe con leche - A very milky coffee and advertised as ""the best"". Ordered one of these after seeing a tray of these headed for another table as we were seated. I am not even close to being a black coffee drinker, so when I encounter a coffee that requires just a smidgen of sugar to bring it home, it's usually a good sign for me. Overall, a solid spot. Would definitely come back when in the neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We came here just as they opened on a Saturday morning.  There was already a line down the block, but luckily the business had someone with an ipad taking names and phone numbers.  Their system text messages you when your table is ready - how convenient!  (we waited in a coffee shop down the street) The restaurant itself is much smaller than I thought it would be.  Perhaps that's why the wait?  They have tables with chairs, and half chair/booth combos.  There were some groups of 6 or so, but I would not rec this for anymore than that without reservations well beforehand. I ordered a buttered apple cider to start - which was warm amazing and delicious.  For my main I ordered a waffle with red wine poached pear, vanilla whipped cream & pistachios.  Oh my gosh it was delightful!!!  I was full after eating it but I almost was tempted to order another one to go!   My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, of which he let me reluctantly let me have a bite.  It was amazing!!!

"Located in Hell's Kitchen, we stopped into BarBacon to enjoy some after work drinks and basketball, but what we got was an amazing dinner complete with a special tasting from the chef. The inside of the bar/ restaurant was inviting, with decor that made you feel at home right down to the cute details such as the bottle capped mirrors and chalkboards in the bathrooms. The bar staff was friendly and the wait staff even friendlier as they fed off of the positive energy of the kitchen, which faces out towards the restaurant. Overheard from the kitchen: a group of girls covelling over the specials of the night. Chef Shawn Hewitt couldn't help but ask if we wanted a taste of the bacon wrapped monkfish...and it didn't stop there. He kept bringing out taste after delicious taste, everything from savory flat breads to Brussels sprouts. We ended up ordering dinner and could not have been more satisfied (the cocktails didn't hurt either). The token pescatarian of the group even found her favorites (hint: crab gazpacho). This spot will meet everything you're looking for, whether its a group brunch, a dinner date, or a random Thursday. A MUST TRY!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Lombardi's!  It's Lombardi's!!  With its red and white checkered table cloths, old tile walls and floors and the sounds of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and other Italian crooners the mood is set.  Realistically is looks more than like a hollywood set than the sites and sounds that I remember.  The Four Seasons, Dion and the Belmonts, and other popular songs of the immediate era. Well, let me tell you. If you are not from New York City, then Lombardi's is okay.  It's better then the cheaper versions of $2.00 a slice.  But really, how good is Lombardi's?   I've have had better.  I, a novice, have made better.  Yes, the cheese is fresh, the extras regardless of the toppings are fresh.  The taste of fresh mozzarella is really special when it is fresh. Mouthwater and smooth as silk.  It is a place more for tourists and teenagers who have not savored a true New York pizza. When the Feast of San Gennaro highlighted other Italian restaurants and pizzeria in this SOHO formerly Little Italy neighborhood, that is when Lombardi's was worth the cost of it's pizzas.  The real New York Pizzeria like the real New York Deli are a thing of the past.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My wife and I went here for my birthday a couple weeks ago and I was surprised to see that it was PACKED, even on a random (random to most people anyways) Monday night. Despite this and the fact that we didn't have a reservation, they accommodated us right away and got us a table. The service was above average and the food was great. We ordered a bottle of wine, a bruschetta appetizer, split a pizza, and got two deserts. The appetizer and the pizza were good, but the deserts were by  far the best. My wife got the Chocolate Mudd Cake and I got the apple pie with ice cream on the side. Both were absolutely amazing. The ambiance was very romantic and had an upscale feeling, but at the same time was not ""fancy"" or pretentious. It was exactly what we were looking for. The reasons I am not giving it 5 stars are: 1) the lighting in the restaurant was very very dim and the candles they had on the table were not strong enough to help us read the menu. I had to get out my phone and use the screen light to look over the menu. I understand that the atmosphere and ambiance is important, but it would help if the candles either gave off more light or they provided a small pen light to help you look through the menu. 2) The small candle on the table kept going out. When it did, I could almost not see my food. To their credit, the staff did relight the candle, but I'm sure it is annoying for them and for diners to have to have them do this multiple times during dinner (3 relights for us). 3) They didn't have the first bottle of wine that I picked out and so I had to go with a backup. These things happen of course, but they still impact your experience. Overall though, I would definitely recommend and definitely go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love the food at Dudleys (chicken burger and fries + mayo are delicious), but was very disappointed by the service my boyfriend and I received today. The cook dinged a bell TWICE to let the waiters know that our food was ready (which my boyfriend and I heard both times it was rung on the other side of the restaurant) and neither one of the two waiters presents took any notice at all that our food had been sitting ready for us for over 5 minutes. It look one of the waiters heading towards the kitchen to do something else for him to finally pick up our food. Also, the portion size seems to be shrinking since the last time I was here. My chicken burger was very tasty, but compared to the last time I got it in April, it was well under half the size.

They play really fun (if not a little questionable) music and the servers are so friendly and helpful. We had heard a lot about the Bee Sting, but we couldn't find it on the menu. DON'T WORRY -- they always offer it, even if it's not on the menu. Our first trip there, we had a great time and experience food-wise.

Aside from the pizza, I'd have to say that the ambiance was interesting and oddly rustic. There are 2 large TVs in the restaurant that are playing Italian music videos and random decorations from the walls to the ceiling. The coal oven resides in the back behind a glass wall where a couple guys are pounding, twirling, tossing and slicing pies. Overall, the staff was pretty friendly, attentive and fast.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Our meal was delicious! Highly recommend the lamb sausage pizza - delicious! For main course we had the Fettuccini with squid ink and mushroom/kale paella.

With the complementary sherry and biscotti to top it all off, it was essentially a perfect meal! I should also point out how pleased I was with the prices. Entrees cost about $30, so you're really getting a great value for the money. I know I've certainly paid much more for lower quality food.

In my early years in New York,  I would buy 6 burritos in the Mission and put them in my freezer when I got back here and had them to eat when I wanted a burrito.   Well, finally there is a burrito I don't have to bring back on the plane!  My only complaint is that the ""basic bean and rice""  burrito comes with cheese and sour cream automatically.  At a San Francisco taqueria, you select each ingredient and pay for only what you want.    But since I live in NYC now and have for 12 years, I understand.  You always pay for stuff you don't want here...that is how they pay the rent.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place was only 2 stars, even though we thought the food was delicious, ambiance great, and beer selection fun. The service was BAD. I came for my friend's birthday dinner with a group of 9. We were seated at a nice long table, and things started out well. However, they quickly went downhill. The waiter forgot pretty much everything everyone said. He SHOULD HAVE JUST WRITTEN OUR ORDERS DOWN. I asked for shaved parmesan on my pizza- he did not bring this. My friend asked him not to clear her full plate of salad, as she was still working on it and next thing she knew, it was gone. The birthday girl didn't get her entree til everyone else was completely done, and this was only after another friend reminded the waiter that we were still waiting on two pizzas (he had completely forgotten). Though he gave the birthday girl one free drink, I felt they should have given the entire table a round of drinks for the number of mess ups. He needs a pad and paper to remember our orders, and that would have been much better than just forgetting half of it. I would love to go back but I really encourage them to get their act together.

Found this place on Yelp. Was looking for some Asian food near where i work in the Fashion District. Honestly I was craving something along the lines of noodles.... The reviews seemed decent enough to try. So my girlfriend and I ventured here for lunch. It was around 2 in the afternoon and the place had about four patrons all together at that time. We were welcomed and seated quickly. The waitstaff was pleasant and quick which was great given I had an hour for lunch. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao which I loved. I am not big on spicy food but this had just enough of a kick that it didn't ruin it for me. I accompanied it with a papaya salad which was just as tasty. My friend ordered the GuayThiew Nam Tok which she enjoyed very much. Overall good service and great food. Definitely a go to for Thai.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came here on a romantic date and we were less than impressed. Lupa was highly recommended and did not live up to its reputation.  For one, the seating is very cramped in the restaurant which leads to an unrelaxed atmosphere. The lighting is subdued and pleasant, however our candle went out and no one fixed it. Mostly the food was delicious, especially the swordfish. There was nothing sensational about the flavor palettes of the antipastei course (esp. Hot Coppa, Ricotta & Roasted Squash), and the primi course (Ricotta Gnocchi and Bavette). The Fall greens salad was too rich and made me vomit, which basically ruined the entire meal. The maitre d' did very little to make me feel better, and I left dispappointed in a good meal gone sour.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I ate at Salinas on a Friday night and it was packed (in a good way)! Everyone enjoying tapas and wine. The staff was really friendly and seated us right away. I had looked at the menu before going and was set on getting Shishito Peppers w/salt,  but our waiter said it was out of season...not to worry because we ended up picking some other delicious tapas! The colorado lamb meatballs were DELICIOUS! They came on top of cucumbers and were perfect, we wish we ordered more. I also ordered the pumpkin/chicken soup which was yummy, just wish i could taste the pumpkin a little more. The Rossejat Rapida was very tasty and flavorful. I had never had Fideo pasta before and i really enjoyed it.. I didn't even need the saffron aioli sauce that came with it.  The codfish was also delicious. The staff was great, and always coming to check on us. The ambiance was lovely and perfect for a nice cozy date. I would definitely come back to Salinas for Wine and Tapas.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Broadway Bites is awesome! I have gone twice this summer and prefer it over Madison Square Eats. The food vendors they have are great.

"gosh, i feel like such an ass for giving this place only two stars.   the ambiance is indeed cozy, everything you've read about exposed brick and candle lit tables is true.  the waitstaff is very personable and mostly attentive--all good things. i'm not sure why the food was so pimped though.  their wine selection WAS great--lots of them offered by the glass and my syrah, while not my favorite, did the trick of erasing every bad memory of work that day.  and we ordered all these things that everyone mentioned here on yelp--the short ribs and polenta, the mushroom tart, in addition we also got the beer sausage but i was entirely unimpressed.   the short ribs were okay but the polenta was clumpy and parts of it unflavored (impressive given the amount of sauce that was in there), the mushroom tart was tiny atop a mound of average arugula, and the beer sausage appeared to be sliced up jumbo hot dogs with not even a vague taste of beer.  and i LOVE sausage. altogether the bill for each person was $44 and it was one of those meals that makes a strong case for ""i should have stayed home, cooked dinner and drank wine by myself.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Butcher Bar, a step below Dinosaur and definitely superior to anything else I've had.  The meat is all organic, local, blah, blah, blah, rainbows, blah, blah who cares.  I care about good food and if you have to cook the kid in it's mother's milk to make it one hell of a tasty meal then I am in!  Ordered the butcher's platter, ribs, corn cakes, mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, and green beans.  This was actually enough food for the two of us and for me to have dinner the next night with the leftovers. Service was fast and boy was the food good.  The mac n cheese was fantastic, super rich but not overly indulgent.  Everything in the butcher's platter was cooked to perfection.  I do wish however they had more BBQ sauces for everything as I felt like their food needed a little more zip. On the downside, their green beans stunk since they were way overcooked in the British tradition.  The ribs were not fall off the bone (my first judgment about good ribs) and the rub was not particularly flavorful (Famous Daves definitely has a better rib rub).  The sweet potato fries were not fries.  More like baked sweet potato wedges which was a major let down. So while there was some highs, I think they definitely need to work on their BBQ still.  I want my BBQ bursting with flavor, cooked to perfection where the meat just falls apart.  Prices were pretty steep but hey it's all organic, local, and meat sure isn't getting any cheaper.  I'll definitely come back to Butcher Bar however.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had a bad experience at Casa Mona. I went there with a friend, no reservation and as the restaurant was almost empty, we sat. It took at least 20 minutes for the waiter to give us some attention. We then order - one dish for each of us- and the waiter asked to wait a minute. Then comes the manager saying that  one must order two dishes at least! Can you believe it? I explained calmly that I don;t each much- nor does my friend - and on dish was enough. He insist we could not do that. saying is their policy. I argued that it is not written anywhere that they have such policy and that they made us waste a lot of time and they should accept our order. Then another guy came and said they were going to  accept the order. We didn't stay as I was afraid they would spit on my food. I think they can have whatever policy they think is appropriate but they have to display that so you can make your decision. I've been in restaurant that say""no salad as dinner"", so I don't go there as my dinner is normally a salad.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I love Mexican food. I lived in Mexico for some time and honestly could eat it all day, every day. Yes, I like Chipotle, but I think Dos Toros is much better.

It also doesn't make you feel as full and gross as Chipotle seems to do.  The tomatillo salsa is amazing. The chips are less than $1 and a great addition (but split them with a friend, too much for 1 person with a meal.) My friend raves about the tacos, which are huge and have the cheese melted right onto the tortilla. My friend and I go to Dos Toros at least once a week, but every day when deciding where to get lunch, it is always an option. There have been days where my friend has gone for lunch and dinner. Or weeks where we have gone more than once. You just can't help it. It tastes so fresh and awesome and the prices are great. So glad this place popped up!","[1.0, 0.0]"

We wanted to see what the hype was with the halal guys so we got the mixed plate of chicken and lamb (gyro) It comes with rice and lettuce and some white and red sauce. Also some pita. The chicken was just ok for me but the lamb was awesome. The rice was great and the lettuce gave a needed crunch and freshness. My very very picky 5 year old stole my fork and devoured the rice and lamb. He also loved the pita. The red sauce is the hottest hot sauce I've eaten. A little drop heated things up nicely.  The white sauce is just a mayo type sauce and I didn't care for it. Wish there was some yogurt sauce instead. Overall good eats!

"I was in New York City with my boyfriend whom never had experienced a real New York pizza.  My brother who is a New Yorker reccommended we try Lombardi's.  It was really good pizza.  I am writing this review because yes it was a good pizza, however before we had our pizza we ordered a house salad to share (I know lame), but the salad was with mesclun greens which was a nice touch, and their house made dressing OMG when I say how delicious the dressing was.  As we were getting ready to leave I asked our server Jesus (who was great) if they actually sold the salad dressing for retail sale, he came back and said no they only sold the San Marzano pizza sauce and the caeser dressing I was totally bummed out. When he came to deliver our bill (which wasn't too bad at all given NYC) I was joking with Jesus telling hin if they bottled up that dressing they could make a fortune (it's that good).  He told me to wait a minute and he went somewhere in the back, came back to our table and told me that they would sell me a jar of it for blank dollars.  I immediately said of cousre I'd love a jar of the dressing.  As he had already dropped off the check he hadn't added to the price to the check, so he entrusted me that I was going to pay it. When he came back to the table with the mason jar filled with the dressing, he told me it would be good for about 2 weeks and to shake and it check it.  Right then and there I knew this was a house made dressing from scratch.

"Bar Tano stands out in an otherwise dreary industrial neighborhood; it's an elegant and charming space with a comfortable bar and impressive decor. It offers a good range of drinks and friendly service, and if it were to stand alone simply as a neighborhood bar, it would have merited a far better rating than two stars. Unfortunately, the food, at least when I went there with my fiancee, was extremely mediocre. Mixed fried seafood as an appetizer was OK, though the white fish was a little soggy and did not taste fresh; the pizza with ricotta was completely bland, the dough seemingly made with neither salt nor oil. The papardelle with short rib ragu was equally unimpressive; though the pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was watery and, again, bland in the extreme. Good short rib ragu should be beefy and robust; this was not. In fact, it was difficult to tell whether meat had indeed been used in the sauce or not. It's a shame, because it's a great space and has a lot of potential. We went just before New Year, so it's possible the kitchen was short-handed (the staff certainly appeared to be having trouble keeping up on a busy night). Judging by the other reviews there appear to be some winners on the food menu, so maybe given time they'll be able to bring the food up to the level the interior would seem to demand.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Piora is not the type of place I typically find myself in. I first visited this restaurant only several weeks after opening, when they started offering a cuisine best described as New American, with Italian and Korean influences. Despite my best attempts, I found myself scanning through their menu multiple times prior to our reservation and after a glowing review from Jess C., finally gave in and made my way over after work on a Thursday evening. The entrance to Piora is difficult to pinpoint as there's no evident signage, but after realizing what the logo, a P and R reflected off each other, stood for, I immediately stepped inside and made my way over to the bar. When the rest of our party arrived, our hostess seated us in the slightly separated area between the bar and the main dining room, which had a perfect view of the entire restaurant. While it's by no means large, the team has done amazing things with the space that they have. The window that spans across the entire back of the room lets in a fair amount of sunlight in the early evening and offers a view bordered with plenty of foliage, a rarity in downtown Manhattan. Lining the walls of Piora is a simple, modern weave of lines that only accentuates the elegance and simplicity of the dining room. Owner Steve Kim greeted us personally and as the venue had yet to fill up, invited us to walk around as he delineated the meaning behind the restaurant's name, which is Korean for ""blossom"". As for the menu, Piora's offerings are fairly compact, covering the basic appetizer, pasta, entrees, and sides. Compact doesn't mean that it's any less difficult to make a final decision, and I wavered a great deal between the proteins and pastas, as each dish sounds just as delicious as the others. We tried our best to get a good variety of dishes and opted to start the meal off with a tray of Monkey Bread. It's served piping hot out of oven in an iron tray, given a light sprinkling of sea salt on top, and paired with a seaweed butter and whipped lardo. The bread is flaky and buttery and a solid introduction for the courses that would follow. I had opted for the Scallops with Sweet Corn, Chanterelles, and Crispy Chicken Skin and it wound up being my favorite dish of the night. The two scallops, the star of the dish, were seared perfectly and smartly paired with the creamy corn-based sauce that accompanied the plate. These kernels of corn were some of the sweetest I have yet to taste, the chanterelle mushrooms contributed just a hint of earthiness to the dish, and the addition of the chicken skin was a delightful surprise, adding both texture and richness to round out each bite. The Agnolotti followed, and while I was slightly disappointed with the rather small portion size, I soon learned not to make judgments based only on appearances. The agnolotti were neatly folded and each contained a delicious filling of pecorino cheese, and with the addition of aromatic preserved truffles and English peas, it made for a fairly satisfying main course. The flavors are perfectly balanced, allowing you to taste and appreciate each of the ingredients and elements of the dish. My only criticism of this dish is that the chef was perhaps a little too heavy-handed with the salt, as I had to reach for my glass of water several times between bites. Piora isn't perfect. As with any new restaurant, it's still in the process of settling in and figuring out a rhythm of its own. It's evident in the slight awkwardness as a server tries to find space to place down a new dish, in the lapse of time between courses. What it lacks in familiarity, however, Piora makes up for with the genuine welcome given to each guest, in the enthusiasm of the servers as they go through the menu options, and the artistry that's presented on each plate. I would love to return and give my palate a chance to explore the rest of their creations; from what I've experienced so far, Piora has truly blossomed. -- [1] Congrats to Piora for securing one star in the 2015 Michelin List!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First things first, if you can't wait in a line, then don't.  Or, simply, go when there is no line.  This happens almost everyday except for the weekends at Clinton Street Bakery.   I'm not going to write about the pancakes because they are amply covered here in the reviews - they are divine.  I'm simply here to write about one thing that has been overlook for some reason (by Zeus' beard)!  The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Milkshake.   Holy crap.   Run.  Do not walk.  If you are a choco/pb connoisseur like myself this is Nirvana.  They use salted peanuts in the shake as well - Eureka.  It strikes that perfect balance between sweet and savory that so many other milkshakes can not even approach.  At $8 a shake, the cost is appropriately prohibitive because if it were let's say, $4 I would be here every day.   See the picture attached for visual reference of the perfection.  Note the rippled whipped cream, sprinkles of chocolate on top, and the thickness.  Rejoice evermore.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you believe the other reviews then you probably think McDonalds is a gourmet restaurant. Here our experience today. We walked in and it took them so long to acknowledge us that I had to sit at an empty table waiting for attention.. Then they sat us at a table for two that was so small my wallet is larger than the table.  The chair was so uncomfortable my bum still hurts. The food was terrible and was pricey for what it was. No one ever came over and asked how our meal was, as I said it sucked. If I ever go here again I want anyone that reads this to hit me over the head with a baseball bat.. That is the truth, every word. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else, go anywhere else, just don't go here. Unless of course you are lacking intelligence.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Wonderful dining experience...Took advice of Yelp reviewers & ordered the Curry Puffs - Yummy.  Also Pla Muk Tord - fancy for the best Calamari I've eaten in a very long time.  Wonderfully crispy without being chewy.  Main entrees were Gaeng Kiew Warn w/ chicken. ( Semi spicy green curry) Delicious.  Nuea Yaan, grilled beef w/ Thai sauce - very tender & flavorful.  and Fried rice w/ crab meat.  Nice to see fried rice made the way it should - with egg. The crab made it special.  Portions were large. Presentation was excellent. Place BYOB, so i brought 2 Heinekens from corner store for $3.50. Restaurant put 2nd in fridge until ready to drink. Prices very reasonable.  Workers very helpful & attentive.  I will be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the uniqueness of the dining experience. If you take each individual plate by itself, I've had better dishes and it's probably a 4 star, but when you take into account the collection of Japanese dishes it makes for great dining experience. This is a place to go if you like different experiences and distinctive dining.  If you're looking for a sushi joint with rolls named after local landmarks this isn't the place for you. I think a good metric to determine whether you'll really like this place or not is: Do you think Uni is an exotic dish? If yes you might not like this place, if no then you'll really like this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with a couple of friends on a Sunday night.  The place was pretty crowded given that it was a Sunday night, but that was expected at a David Chang's restaurant and we got a table right away (although we had to share...). The four of us had to share a table with a couple of other diners, which made me feel like I was eating in Chinatown.  However, the food was awesome!  We got quite a few dishes to share for the party since they were all pretty small, but the highlight gotta be the steamed buns.  The bread was so soft, and the pork belly simply melted in my mouth.  Other dishes that we loved were the Santa Barbara uni (came in a roll and loved the herb), the spicy honeycomb tripe, and the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes. Make sure you order at least 3 dishes per person. The service was great.  Our waiter was very helpful making suggestions.  We would definitely come back to this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"OOTW W Ran into my doppleganger here, sat very close to him even.  We both had the same dark brown to black colored hair parted on our person's right side over to the left, scruffy/cool style beards, blue cotton/denim blend button down shirts, jeans, and desert boots - I think he was older which was one of the only differences; I couldn't figure out if he looked young for his age or I was looking older that night.  Later on we crossed paths heading up and downstairs to the bathroom (i was walking up while he was coming down) we made eye contact but said nothing.  We were sitting almost back to back at two tables near the door, I can't be sure but i'd imagine we were having pretty similar conversations with our fellow diners. I'm not sure if I'll go back here.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Here's the deal. From a local who has been coming for years. The pizza is pretty fantastic. The experience, so so. No slices and take out orders have to stand in line with people who are waiting to sit. They don't answer the phone. These guys could really improve the experience but they choose not to because life is easy for them. The tourists line up just about every day. Endless supply of first time customers. They could not care less about regulars or locals or really anybody. Stand in line is the response you get to every question. Years ago, one of my favorite things to do was to walk the Brooklyn Bridge and go to Grimaldi's for pizza. The trick was, call for a pick up once you were a little more than half way over the bridge. When you arrive, skip the huge line of tourists, walk in and pick up your pie. Now that they have moved down the block, they don't even answer their phone. If you do call and actually don't get a busy signal, the line rings until a machine picks up with no recording. You have a bunch of New York Italians in dirty t shirts standing around with attitude, while some Mexicans work hard and make pies. They must be rich from pizza yet the building they recently moved into looks like it could fall down. No love, No paint even. They don't even step out the door to reassure their customers who are all wondering how long this line can actually last. The answer. Longer than you think. I thought we had about a half hour. It was really over an hour. The product they make is very good, which is why they have big lines, but I am sure that I will never go there again. I don't like feeling like an idiot and that is how I feel standing in their line. They should be giving free drinks to people, smiling, chatting with customers. What you have a is a bunch of lucky family members who were born into a family business that is a gold mine. They have it easy. Rather than honoring their family and trying to improve the business, they just leach off of it. Sad. BUT, it is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow (Brooklyn Bridge). Tip from a local... walk the bridge there, take a ferry back. I have to give them 4 stars (even though 3 stars is what I want to give them) because the pizza is great, but this place should be 5 stars. I hate seeing people that don't respect their own business or customers. I left feeling like a sucker. A little about the pizza. It is easily one of my favorites. The crust is perfect. Mostly crispy, a little doughy. The tomatoes must be San Marzano. Excellent. The cheese I am guessing is a local, fresh mozzarella. The topping are quite good and fresh. I like pepperoni and it is great! Thick cut yet small in diameter. If you get your to go, they put it in a brown paper bag on a piece of cardboard. Not great for traveling. We brought one back home in Manhattan and the grease was coming through the bag, making it tear. GET SOME BOXES! Again, I felt like a sucker. Wait in line for 1.5 hours to order a take out at the door. Then wait 20 minutes for the pie which they throw in a brown paper bag. I had to go back in for the sodas they forgot and to ask for napkins which they don't give you because they are too busy standing around while the Mexicans work hard.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Root beer on tap- yes please! Came here with a few friends of mine from out of town.  I got there early and ordered the speakeasy ale, it's one of my favorite beers out there.   One of my friends had been here before and suggested that we try one of their southern biscuit sandwiches.  He was totally right and his personal recommendation was the honey chicken and pickles.   I'm a big fan of all things sweet and sour.  Sweet chicken and sour pickles, bring it on.  Yeah I'm not going to lie, it was super tasty.  The cheese grits were super good too.  My friend did comment that the grits did look like baby food but that didn't stop her from chowing down on it.   The only negative to the evening was the strange service that we received.  While what seemed to be attentive owners, checking on everyone's table, our waiter went MIA at certain points.  He just seemed to be absolutely clueless and the place wasn't that packed when we first arrived.  Gradually it got more packed but nothing overwhelming for our waiter.  We had to wave him down for our check.  Sometimes I'm annoyed by over bearing waiters but in our case our waiter turned into a ghost.   Overall this place is fantastic.  I'd come back here in a heartbeat just for the pickles and beer.  Oh and kudos to having growlers.  Big fan of those too. :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with two friends and the bf for my 21st birthday and it was absolutely great.  It was definitely more lively than I thought because when we walked into the dining area, the hostess yelled something in japanese and everyone else responded.  When I asked what she said, she replied ""I said I was bringing in a table of four.""  Very anticlimactic.  Bf and I shared the pork buns which were absolutely worth it.  Being asian, I don't really expect much in terms of pork buns anymore, but the sauce was amazing. I had the akamaru modern which was a little less spectacular than what I was expecting, but the broth was tasty all the same.

"Completely blown away by their brunch menu! Everything is so well-portioned and flavorful and the list goes on ad infinitum.  Someone ordered the Sicilian baked eggs over at the next table and that's definitely going to be my choice the next time I come here.   My tastes were veering towards hearty that morning so I opted for the steak and eggs which they serve sunny side up with herbed potatoes.  I'm not really someone who has a natural inclination towards steak but trust me when I say they do theirs well here.  I was licking the knife clean, reminiscent of the opening credits scene to Dexter.  Not to mention the little wooden marker stating how well your steak was cooked was an adorable and classy touch. They do their ginger ales in house too, which is always a plus in my book.  The one I got had tons of fresh cucumber muddled within the ginger ale, so you get a dry yet refreshing touch. I didn't get to check out the photobooth that everyone's been talking about, but really, when the food is so good here, that should be the last thing on your mind.  Save the picture taking for those drunken, wasted nights at a bar where you're able to break out your best poses in a conveniently placed booth.  You come here solely for the food. Oh, and definitely make a reservation.  It was a madhouse on Sunday morning, but you can see why.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went to this place ages ago, got their UNBELIEBABLY reasonable prix fix menu ($26!), which at the time I thought was just a restaurant week special, but they still have it, six years later. My recollection is that you absolutely HAVE to stick to the prix fix menu, or it gets very expensive, very fast. No sake. They introduced me to salmon skin. I've had it elsewhere, but nobody does it like them. Everything is done for you - they even put just the right amount of wasabi and/or soy sauce in the rolls, so you won't screw it up yourself. That's the level of attention to detail that gives a place a reputation as the best sushi restaurant in New York (I've never been to Masa, but I know people who have, and they say it isn't as good). I aspire to someday be able to afford their omakase. Someday soon...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Waited over 40 minutes for our table, which is normally fine as long as you have good food and service after the wait. Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Once we were seated, we waited 10 minutes for our service who literally rushed us through our drink and food orders. We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and when we inquired with a different server, we were given a rude answer of ""they'll be coming"".  5 minutes later all but one of our drinks came. We patiently waited and then had to ask again to see where it was and were again given a rude response. In the meantime, we 1 of our 2 appetizers before the drinks  and when the calamari came, part of it was cold and it literally had no flavoring whatsoever. Fortunately, the side of chili sauce masked the incredibly bland appetizer.  Our main course was delivered at separate times as well, 10 minutes from the first entree to the last. 3 of my friends asked for sides of peanut sauce when they ordered their meals and had to ask twice after they received their food until they got it.  I ordered the spicy noodles and it was less spicy than their pad Thai which was extremely mild and  had no flavoring or spice whatsoever.  The only thing our server was quick at was dropping off our check (which unfortunately had a 20% gratuity already built in bc we had 5 people) and to take our money.   Also it is extremely loud and if you're a large table, you cannot hear each other speak. Truly disappointing meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've only had brunch here, but the food I've tried is excellent. The Benedict has real Hollandaise-- not that packaged glop lots of places love to use. Their potatoes are crispy with the taste of fresh Rosemary, and the apple omelet is a great mix of apples and thick bacon. I can understand how people can say the service is a bit inattentive, but if you've been to any good brunch place in the area on a nice day, good luck getting waited on hand and foot. The servers here are at least nice to you, unlike some places in the East Village I've been.  Just chill out, have a couple of drinks and you'll be even more stoked when you get your food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Filipino food is surprisingly difficult to describe; as my friend eloquently explained, ""it's like the bastard child of Southeast Asia"". With influences from Chinese, Malaysian, and Spanish cooking, it has, surprisingly, become one of my new favorite cuisines. Enter Grill 21 - a tiny, unassuming enclave hidden on East 21st street in Gramercy. It's more family kitchen than restaurant, with its limited seating, the semi-discombobulated decor, and hand-painted walls. But the food that is served in this little abode is some of the best that NYC has to offer. My friend and I found our way here on a Friday evening, both of us hoping for a dose of authentic Filipino food. After being seated and handed menus, we went a bit overboard and ordered an appetizer and three entrees to share. (Note: Yes, we were hungry and yes, we can eat.) The plates do come out rather haphazardly from the kitchen, especially as there was only one server working that night, but it's worth bearing with. Starting off, the Chicharon Bulaklak: deep-fried pig intestine. Traditionally served as more of a snack or bar food item, it's a deceptively delicious plate that tastes like heaven for the first few bites, though it might sit quite heavily in the stomach afterwards. While I wouldn't recommend it to start off a large dinner, it's the perfect late night bite - crispy, greasy, and savory all rolled into one. From our following plates, my favorite was the Sizzling Sisig. Crisp chunks of pork cheek are mixed in a with a variety of spices and topped off with a raw egg; it's served in a hot plate so that, upon delivery, everything is still sizzling and popping away and needs to be covered with a sheet of aluminum foil. Upon opening, the egg gets stirred in and cooked, and paired with a mound of garlic rice, makes for a satisfying mouthful. The pork belly is both crispy and fatty, and while the sauce could be a little (okay, a lot) spicier, it's something that you'll want to continue eating nonstop. The Chicken Adobo is also worth a mention. Braised for hours, the meat is further marinated in vinegar and soy sauce. The resulting concoction is a plate of tender chicken in a complex savory and sour sauce, which immediately called out its Spanish roots. It was overly salted, even paired with rice, but is certainly an adventure to eat, since the chicken leg bones are still included. And the famous Crispy Pata: fried pork knuckles. Though I could only try a few bites at this point, it's similar to the Chicharon Bulaklak in the way each piece melds chewy, crispy, and fatty textures. Don't be deterred by the sheer size of the leg, though - most of it is bone. Of course, we also got an order of the Special Halo Halo, which is a very traditional Filipino dessert. It is a semi-bizarre combination of ingredients; the base consists crushed ice and milk mixed with chunks of jackfruit and jelly, and is topped with several scoops of taro ice cream drizzled with honey. I found it better after the ice had been given some time to melt; it's a contrast of textures, flavors, and even temperature and perfect for a summer day. For the most authentic Filipino food you can find outside of the actual country, Gril 21 is definitely a strong contender.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The ramen is very good and the add-ons are delicious, I highly recommend the pork bellies! Whenever I would go to ippudo, the food is always great and I like the fact that you can get more at a discounted price so that you don't have to waste your broth! The only down side is the prices are a bit high for ramen but I guess they've got to pay the rent somehow. The lines are also ridiculous, I've shown up and have been told the wait was 2 hours in the past so I left to go elsewhere. The staff is so-so, sometimes you get a really good server and other times you get servers who look like they don't want to be there. The hostesses are also a no-go, with the crowded entry, a lot of people flock to stand outside. Don't rely on the hostesses to come get you if you stand outside. They never leave their podium and speak softly so you can barely hear them when you're standing by them. Ippudo should really get the hostesses to speak up and to also go outside and call out names as well. For the amount of money you pay, you want every staff member to treat you well. I'm hesitant to give them 4 stars but if the food wasn't so good and SOME of the staff were so good, I'd drop it down to 3 stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love love love carmines!!!   Despite yesterday's experience.   I was very excited to be seated upon walk in on a Sunday, but once food was served I understood why.  First cold, ice cold bread,  so I asked for ""olive oil to go with this cold bread"" placed my order and at the end said ""please don't forget the Oliver oil to go with this cold cold bread"" .....waiter didn't apologize or acknowledge I said anything about the cold bread. -1.....I order my usual fried calamari to start off. Also ordered pasta sampler,  I told the waiter we might order more depending on the sampler since we had never had any of the items before.   He suggested AGAINST ordering more food.  Wow kick us out so soon huh? .. Calamari was usually greasy, flavorless,  and soggy NOT crispy. -2 ....my lemonade Palmer I believe it was, was excellent and so was my daughters first blue eyes drink.  Then came our entree   which was decent but we only liked 2 of the items.  In between all this I find time guys wallet and give it to him and get a round of applause.  Just wanted to throw that in there since the guy barely said thank you.  But back to the service n food.   We order another drink for my daughter n continue to eat.  Waiter comes back n ask if we were still working on our food,  we say we are still waiting for her drink.  He brings it back promptly and immediately my daughter n I look at it.  I tell here blue eyes is blind,  she counts her blueberries, we laugh.  We both taste n leave the drink alone,  it's not the same as the first.  Oh well time to get out of here.  We ask to wrap our food up and to throw a few roll of tomato and onion bread in.  We get our check which I might add I was overcharged for her drinks.  Pay and leave.  Do some walking and I see my daughter is struggling with the doggy bag.  I tell her to take the small bag out and I carry the big bag.  She does so and says they put the bread straight in the bag.  I really didn't understand until I looked today.  The bread is inside a plastic bag!!!  I love love love carmines but will NOT return on a Sunday!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My bff Amy and I scheduled a long overdue dinner for 7 PM on a Wed night, and I wanted to find a place near to where she works.  So Yelp led me to this place.  It's a charming, well-decorated place that feels manages to feel cozy without being too cramped (though I'm sure the dinner crowd is nowhere near the size of the brunch crowd).  We managed to score a table by the windows, which probably helped. The menu isn't sprawling, but I think almost everyone can find something to like here.  Food was tasty, though portions were perhaps a little smaller than I was expecting for the price.  We split the ricotta fritters appetizer, which were not very impressive.  However, our seared ahi tuna and roasted cod entrees were much better.  While small, they had enough flavor and variety of textures to compensate.  Dessert didn't disappoint either.  Bff was pleased with her passionfruit, raspberry and grapefruit sorbets.  I went for the profiteroles, which are two petite balls of deliciousness.  Espresso gelato + pastry + chocolate = to quote Rachel Ray, yum-o. Our waitress was friendly and helpful throughout.  Water was refilled frequently, dishes were cleared quickly and the check came in a reasonable amount of time.  Bathrooms were clean and spacious (yay!).  Good conversation was had and our stomachs were pleasantly filled in the end.  All in all, an experience worth repeating sometime.  Thank Yelp!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Brunch is $15 for an entree, a drink and coffee or tea. The portions are gi-normous! I love their mixed greens - their dressing is just perfect. The drink portion is good as well. My mimosa was in a wine glass instead of the standard champagne flute, which is a better bang for your buck. I had the short ribs w/ scrambled eggs and I have to say it is top notch. The short ribs were so tender and flavorful and the eggs were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Only downside of the dish was the under cooked potatoes, otherwise good flavor. I've also had the Three Your Way dish and the eggs are just killer. I never thought of throwing chives in my scrambled eggs. I only wish they had maybe 2-3 more options on the brunch menu - maybe their mac n' cheese, which I heard is great. They also have a lot of open space which can hold a good 2-3 more 2 person tables. This will alleviate the brunch wait time. Think about it Eastwick! However, I've never waited more than 20 mins - which is good? *shrugs* Love this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Why would people sit at the sushi bar here and NOT order omakase? So stupid. I sneered at several parties ordering sliced sashimi sets for dinner. Yeah, I'm a bitch. Of course, I had the omakase, which is the best (and right) way to experience the supremely fresh quality of the fish selections. The uni and otoro were undeniably top-notch, and I loved how the chef presented the same fish from different geographical regions in duos and trios for side-by-side comparisons of flavor and texture differences between the variations. The squid was unbelievable! I watched the chef painstakingly score the small white flesh in all different directions for several minutes to produce an extremely tender and texturally-impressive bite. I even tried the tamago, which I typically abstain from since few sushi restaurants can make it correctly, and it was amazing - like sweet flan. I can unequivocally say this was the best sushi I've ever had.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is a gem in the neighborhood.  I'm a huge foodie and very picky about food in NYC - I've been to them all, Per Se, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Sushi Yasuda, The Modern, Bouley, Daniel, etc.   This cozy spot is just good, old-fashioned home cooking with a great menu, ambience and great people.  Tomas is very fun and inviting and can cook up a mean dish, and is also quite the pastry chef (delicious almond croissants on the weekends!). I always start out with the curried shrimp - it's the perfect starter, and I love the smell of the curry emanating from the kitchen.  My favorite main dish is the roasted chicken - it is incredibly flavorful, moist and just hits the spot.  I pair everything with German Riesling from Mosel. Saturday nights are a blast.  The very talented Rachel brings her Ukelele Saturday nights at 8pm to perform Island music that is soothing and relaxing with dinner.  The staff is attentive and uber-friendly, and the food always hits the spot with generous portions.   Lovely people and a real gem in a neighborhood packed with Dim Sum and Chinese restaurants.  A welcome break from the usual Chinese places.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's French Bistro cuisine served up in a lively steakhouse ambience. I really enjoyed the food and the service, and would not hesitate recommending this to anyone looking for good French Bistro classics. The steak frites were really good. The fries were crispy and the steak was grilled to my desired temp (A+ for the criss-cross grill markings!). Plus, the mayo that I asked for on the side (to dip my fries) had a nice surprise hint of truffle in there. They also had an excellent fresh oyster selection, with 6 different kinds representing both the East and West Coasts. (I ordered West Coast kumamotos, which were really good). Certainly a place that I would come back to for well prepared French food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Last night we ventured into Da Marcella after being told Rosemary's had a two hour wait. We were so happy to stumble upon a neighborhood italian restaurant with great ambiance, service, quality food, and rave reviews. We walked in without a reservation and were treated like royalty, the bartender kept topping off our glasses of red wine. We were seated after waiting for about fifteen minutes which we did not mind since we were walk ins. We took the lovely waitresses recommendation and ordered the burrata appetizer, the wild boar parpadelle and the cacio e pepe. We were utterly impressed with the burrata and melt in your mouth prosciutto and truffle order. The pastas were extremely fresh and had amazing homemade flavor. To top off our night we ordered the delicious tiramisu and received complimentary champaign. With that being said, we most definitely will be returning to this neighborhood gem!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am born and raised in Latin america and I have to say that their vaca frita is as great as the one my dad makes (even better.) Their patacones (tostones, green plantains) were crunchy and perfect. My fiancee got the green sauce burrito and he was very impressed. I think they have the right amount of creativity in their dishes but they keep them very traditional. Their pandebonos (cheese bread) and dulce de leche bread were a very good surprise for me, and they were cooked to perfection. It is nicely located..very upscale and well decorated for the average latin restaurant. My complaints would be the sangria: EXTREMELY SWEET! we tried the havana, the strawberry one, the roja, and finally the acai one was the only one that wouldn't cause a diabetic comma. Our waiter was rude. He got our order wrong and didn't apologize (just at the end of our meal) . He seems to hate his job. And he was rushing us the whole time. Not even one smile during our meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Love the burgers here. But here is my complaint. I have been here several times since it opened since I live in the neighborhood. Out of multiple visits I have noticed upper management in the restaurant talking about ""how to redesign the condiment counter"". Being in the restaurant industry I understand their thoughts on this, but not once have I seen them point out the fact that people are sitting around way too long waiting for their food? And if that isn't bad enough, they stand around the counter, discussing it, and blocking the guests who are trying to use it. As I sat eating my burger I watched as several guests have to go around them or find a way to maneuver through them to get to the counter. If anything I applaud the busser guy who actually would get out of people's way when they approached, unlike the managers. To end, I applaud your consistent and delicious product that you put out everyday! But the awareness by upper management when discussing internal matters and speed of service needs to improve.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Believe it or not, good pizza is hard to come by in NYC.(The best pizza often comes from Brooklyn, Staten Island and some parts of Queens).  Thank God for Lombardi's  Pizza, PIzza 33 (the owner is from Staten Island) and Harry's Italian Bar (Financial District).  You can get outer borough NY style pizza at these places. Lombardi's is in a prime location and you will like the Italian pizza parlor feel of this establishment, especially if visiting NYC from another town. I have never eaten a bad slice of pizza from here - the food is consistently consistent unlike many other NYC pizzerias.   I highly recommend visiting - you won't be disappointed.  I just don't frequent this place as much as I used to because there's a long wait and you can't make a reservation ahead of time.  If you've never been here, you have to at least try it once.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Unfortunately, i had quite a disheartening and insulting experience at Roberta's tonight. I have been going there for years, since they opened, and have had some really good food times there. I arrived around 7 to join a few friends, and they were finishing, but I was hankering for a quick pie.The waitress treated me as a nuisance for asking if I could order some food, and said that their policy forbids walk-in additions to a seated party. I politely said "" I just want to order a pizza, I'm a paying customer"". By then 2 of our party were being served their pie. She called a manager over who said that if I didn't want it to go, she could relocate us to a counter because ""people were waiting for tables"". The place was not that crowded and there were empty seats around us, our friends were just served, what's the big deal with me having a pizza here at this table? Another 15 minutes? Doesn't that meet their bottom line? The attitude of the staff really sucks, unless you are of the party at the table adjacent, who were apparently VIP and were being treated as such.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I do enjoy thin pizza,  however all I experienced while in NYC was one undercooked pie after another.  Now I know why New Yorkers fold their slices in half while eating them!  The sauce was bland and the slices needed additional seasoning.

You get an incredible amount of food here so consider splitting entrees and ordering just a few appetizers to taste more items. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender. Sauces worked well together and I loved the cold pickled salad which was a nice contrast. The rice and beans were serviceable. Fried egg was a nice touch, but wish there was a bigger yolk. Overall not a bad option. I see myself stopping in for wine and ceviche on the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to over 2000 restaurants around the world and now I am going to officially start weighing in because I love good food, good service, fantastic atmospheres and the intangibles. When I say PA I mean Pink Approved this indicates a 4-STAR or better rating and is my way of saying thank you. Minetta Tavern is one of m favorite restaurants in the world and is definitely PA. The highlights for me include the dry aged cote de boeuf, the black label burger, the french dip (one of the top 2-3 french dips in NY) and the frites. The Cote de Boeuf -- cooked to exactly the right level of pink inside with a crispy outside, the meat (which I last had on New Year's Eve in 2010) was juicy, tender and easy to cut. The outside was just the right level of brown and the bone marrows were decadent. I would give this 4 STARS and recommend it for any special occasion (it comes in at $124 in and of itself) BlacK Label Burger -- Last had this for brunch last weekend. It is quite simply my current favorite burger. it is made with several types of meat, is cooked exactly as requested (for me medium rare) and sits on the bun with a controlled volume of delicious juices. I am a big fan and would recommend this to any burger fan or even for those that would not normally try a burger because this is outstanding. 4.5 STARS. French Dip -- the bun is amazing in combination with the juicy roast beef and the au jus is an amazing balance of salt and juice and combines well with the bun and roast beef. 4.5 STARS Service -- service is generally fantastic and they treat me like royalty (I assume this is true of most people) so it is difficult to find fault. I would say that it is not perfet but anytime I go they give me a warm welcome, consistent service at my table and answer questions promptly and with consistency and depth. Minetta Tavern a PA gem in the Village. Thank you Keith! Pink","[0.0, 1.0]"

Menu Choice: - Meatball Sliders - Little Neck Clams - Spring Onion Soup - Lobster Risotto - Pork Tacos - Peach Bellini Everything was super fresh and the service was casual and on point, but the food lacked that something special.  The clams were super yummy and the dash of spicy was a nice addition, but it was a bit too salty otherwise I could drink a gallon of the briney soup.  The spring onion soup was a nice lighter version of the french onion soup, leaning towards more the sweet side.  The sliders were ok, nothing amazing.  Lobster risotto lacked lobster and the portion was disappointing, this was the 2nd time that week I ordered risotto from a restaurant and twice I was sad.  The tacos were simple but the meat was not particularly flavorful.  Overall a really cool and chill place but I expected a little more ""umpf!""  If the menu only has a few items I expect them to nearly perfecting it.  I would give the little owl a solid 3.5 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Absolutely an A+ experience, from beginning to end,  for our daughters wedding reception on Saturday evening April 05, 2014.    The dinner was for 20 people and was held in the private downstairs room at Runner & Stone. All guests were able to choose an appetizer and an entree off of the regular restaurant menu.   (though the menu was thoughtfully printed with the names of the bride & groom on the front:)   Every single appetizer and entree were spectacularly delicious and gratifying.   A special thank you to our masterful waiter - who amazingly served us all simultaneously and with appropriate temperature food.   All of our guests were so pleased with their dinner.  Not thinking it could get any better - we were, once again,  blown away by the elegant & delectable ""baked on the premises"" wedding cake.    Truly, what a treat for everyone  - that cake was one-in-a-million scrumptious.   The above is no exaggeration and I haven't even mentioned how affordable it was. We would especially like to thank Alexandra, the assistant manager.  From our initial inquiry about having the wedding reception at Runner & Stone, through the planning stage, and finally being on-site to ensure the events success -- Alexandra was phenomenal.   She is a confident skilled professional who masterfully gave our family one of the best nights of our lives.   She is also a super pleasant charming host.   Yes, a gushing review and well deserved -- thank you Runner & Stone.   Sincerely, Patrick and Bill","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My friend asked me to go to Momofuku as a part of her ""must eat"" list in NYC before she went abroad for a year. Frankly I wish we had celebrated her last day at a different restaurant. My experience was practically the opposite of everyone else's review. The wait-staff was very nice and accommodating - getting us drinks at Milk before our entire party had arrived, and then promptly seating us. Beyond the waitstaff though, the food doesn't didn't live up to the hype - end of story. The portion size was completely unbalanced - and made it impossibly to really sample the food unless you ordered 4-5 dishes per person. The sardines were uninventive and entirely under-proportioned, the blue fish sandwich had so much spices on it I had to actually open the sandwich to see if there was actually any blue fish in it - give that blue fish is a pretty oily fish - that is a first for me. the quail eggs and mushrooms were overseasoned, and then the pork....everyone raved about the pork....was just mediocre. May I remind everyone that pork has such a high fat content that it is in its very nature absolutely delicious. Somehow, they managed to make it worse. The pig head turrine consisted of a micron-thin spread of salty gelatinous mess...devoid of any real flavor. The pork shoulder, apart from appearing undercooked, was as salty and flavorless as the other dishes. The pork buns...everyone raved about the pork buns...I don't get it. The 3 people at my table ordered 8 dishes, and at the end we were still hungry but too discouraged to even venture at another dish.

"Xixa is pronounced Shiksa. Like the word for a non-jewish temptress who steals away a mensch. That's because one of the owners is technically a Xixa. (or Shiksa) This husband and wife team have quite possibly the best restaurant in Williamsburg. The food here is creative, original and borderlines on fancy. But the prices are reasonable. A dinner for 2 would run at most $80 and for that money you will taste things like bone marrow steak tacos (amazingly fatteningly delicious) or the best piece of braised short rib that you can recall eating. The menu can be as adventurous as you want... but none of it is weird exactly. It's hard to explain but you'll see when you get here. This place just has the right mix of food executed at a very high level with a lot of creativity paired at average prices. The Elm might be fancier, Amacen might have more bang for the buck, but if you had to eat only one meal in Williamsburg... nothing beats Xixa for it's creativity and value.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The worst part?  They reheated it in the MICROWAVE- right in front of me. There was a toaster oven right next to it too! I could not believe what I saw.  I can't believe I almost finished it. Any true catalan should steer clear of migas at Despana.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"What is left to be said about Difara? You've got your Grimaldis, Totonnos, Lombardis, Patsys, all of which are worthwhile in their own right, but for NYC's number one pizza joint, you've got to head over to Difara. I live in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and Difara is a short train ride from me. In fact, I went to High School not too far from the place. Too bad I only began to appreciate it after the fact. For the best Difara experience, you have to avoid the busy hours, mainly any time after 5 o'clock. If you show up at the right time , you can be sitting down and enjoying your pizza surprisingly fast. Also, don't come on Mondays! Dom now takes a day off during the week. Good for him. But it would be rather disappointingly to make the trek from Manhattan only to find the place closed. Absolutely nothing else to do around there, trust me.  If you do make it all the way to Difara, make sure to try both the regular and the square slice. Any toppings you make ask for will take longer. Any non-pizza dish you may order will also take longer.   Until you have tried Difara, you don't know what you are missing. Enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love this place, their mango sangria was a refreshing kick to the summer heat. The dishes are usually pretty tasty, the shrimp with garlic was my favorite.

"I brought a friend here for his birthday, he's into this whole deep fried, gravy smothered thing. Gotta say this place is pretty awesome.   to start, the cocktails are pretty amazing. I had a honey julep, which was sweet and very refreshing. I followed it up with the lavender gin fiz, which was among the best cocktails I've had in a while. My friend got the pink picket fence and loved it, but it wasn't for me. The food was really good. We pretty much got all the pickled starters, which was a bit much for 2 people. But they were awesome. For smaller parties I'd recommend asparagus, tomato, candied red beets, and jalapeno. The pickled eggs were interesting. The deep fried pickles were quite awesome. If you really don't wanna go overboard on pickles just get the deep fried ones. Also, of note is that they pickle things in some complex vinegars, so some really interesting flavors come through. I had biscuits & gravy 2 ways, and loved them. The mushroom gravy is spectacular. My friend got the chicken and gravy sandwich and it kinda sounded like that scene from When Harry Met Sally while he was eating it. We both loved the grits and were very sad that we couldn't just keep eating them, we were both so stuffed by this point. We managed to squeeze in some fried oreos....like whens the next time I'm gonna come to a restaurant that serves deep fried foods as a prime attraction? I have to say, some of the comments have suggested that the service is bad at this place. But, either the place has stepped up its game, or those reviews were written by Simply Oliver, because our waitress was very attentive and checked on us frequently. The food also came pretty quickly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Get ready to be converted.  After eating here, you will judge all tacos against the tacos you have here. Eating here was serendipity.  Wandering the Chelsea Market, I was trying to figure out what and where to eat.  I did not think a taco joint in this place could be such a standout.  Usually high traffic places have average food joints. I am a taco junkie.  And while I will eat an average taco when there aren't any excellent options for food, I do recognize a good or great taco when I have one. This is the most interesting taco place I have found yet.  Had the carne, chicken and pork (adobado).  Each one was excellent and well assembled.  When I started eating the adobado taco, lighting struck me, and I realized I found my new best taco joint. The carne was good meat quality, grilled well, and was very delicious.  Chicken was just as excellent.  It was juicy and flavorful - not the standard dry and cardboard like ""chicken"" that most places serve.  The adobado was astounding - SO much flavor.  This was a really beautiful taco and my favorite. The taco tortillas here are made fresh - you see them getting pressed and then grilled.  Flour tortillas are made with lard.  It was the best flour tortilla I've had and will be hard to top this in any other restaurant.  I also tried the corn tortilla and was very impressed with that as well.  I like both. Eating here is very casual and mostly standing at a counter.  Not really a date place, but perfect if you're in the area and need a satisfying meal. If you can tell what a good taco tastes like, then you need to get your butt to this place right now.  I can't wait to come back here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"How to make Totto Ramen a decent shack: 1. If you're going to serve pork with my ramen, put more in there than two wafer-thin silver-dollar-sized cuts of super-fatty pork. 2. Increase the noodle-to-broth ratio. I ran out of noodles about halfway down my bowl's broth. 3. Make it veggie-friendly. My sister's vegetarian bowl's vegetables looked very, very, very old. Like they'd ran out of ingredients and had some poor schlub run back to the walk-in and scrounge up anything that looked like a vegetable. Inexcusable, to me, when your restaurant is about a week old. The veggies couldn't be that gross already unless you tried! 4. For chrissakes, don't add a dollar on for an egg for a vegetarian bowl. You're already raping us with the $11 pricetag for broth with crappy vegetables. Man up and give up the egg. Overall, pretty darn disappointing, especially since I live literally 20 yards away. I'll give it another try in a couple of months, but for now - I'll stick with prepackaged Ichiban ramen for $.75 (and no 40 minute wait).","[0.0, 1.0]"

Is it so hard to be cordial when taking someone's order? And those prices. My simple, tiny crispy chicken sandwich (which was more burger like) came with few dressings was almost 10 bucks - no fries or side salad. I've had way more from better sandwich shops for that price and I was hungry afterwards. I got a small $2.12 bag of chips to make up for the lack of food. I get that they're on a main, up and coming street rent might be high - but they are gonna need to mellow out the hipster bad attitudes and offer big kid food if they're going to compete on Vanderbilt Ave.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Check this place out if you're looking for a twist in the usual thai fried rice/ noodle/soup dishes you usually see.  Hells Kitchen is loaded with thai restaurants, and I found this tiny quaint place to be refreshingly distinct in their menu options.  They offer the typical pad thai, but the majority of their menu branches out from the common items we see in a lot of thai restaurants. I had the Kea Mao (thin rice noodles, ground shrimp and chicken, egg, chili, bell pepper, and basil leaves.)  The proportion was satisfying, although I wish I had left overs because it was so good!  The dish was very flavorful, a bit spicy, and not at all greasy.

"Featured in the Wall Street Journal ""Lunchbox"" series, the Bakehouse Café and Bistro had me from hello--or at least first bite. The seared sea scallops were sweet, plump and sealed with a kiss from their brush with a hot pan. They arrived with a drizzle of celery root puree as a cool, almost sweet, contrast to the punch of the basil ginger oil. I had the grilled octopus salad as the entrée. Crisp baby spinach leaves were brightened with strips of jicama and finished with a deft touch of sesame dressing. The chewy bland octopus in the mix, however, dragged down the entrée. I washed back this mistake with a pint of the draft Racer 5 IPA, a Healdsberg, California craft ale. Served with cloud-like head of foam, the Racer 5 IPA was a brilliant amber sunset in a glass. The caramel malt emerged from an earthy foundation, followed by a citrusy floral, honey, and grassy hop. The malt sweetness engaged as the hop bitterness slid to the back of the tongue. The abrupt bitterness was tempered by a soothing, silky malt finish. The waitstaff was relaxed, yet knowledgeable and attentive. I look forward to the next bite.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is amazing beyond words. Top 5 meals of my entire life. This is where my fiancé brought his sister for her birthday, so I got to tag along and I'm glad I did. We had a reservation, but were seated immediately and the place was at a lull. It's quickly filled up, and after the meal, I understood why. The service was incredible. No more than 2 plates on the table at a time, water glasses always full, and never more than 5 minutes in between dishes being brought to the table. The three of us decided to pick 9 different dishes. They were all amazing, but there were obvious stand-outs. 1. Spicy big-eye tuna tartar over tempura Japanese eggplant. Delicious and well thought out. A little too spicy for my taste, but the eggplant was great. 2. Salt and pepper shrimp. Delectable! Shrimp were perfectly cooked and the accompaniments were tasty. 3. Pork belly. Yummy! Some of the best pork belly I've ever had. 4. Baked muenster cheese. Addicting. Velvety, melty, gooey cheese. How could you go wrong? 5. Short rib slider. So good! A little spicy, but the Gouda cheese paired well with it. The sweet potato fries were incredible as was the aioli paired with the dish. 6. Scallops. The scallops were perfectly cooked, but I wasn't crazy about the items it was paired with. 7. Sweetbreads. Oh my god. They were amazing. Best I have ever had and it's made me want to try them at different places to see how they'll measure up. 8. Foie gras. Holy living God. Best dish of the night. The maple and hot sauce went together perfectly. Egg cooked perfectly and the potatoes were delicious. 9. Bacon donuts. They're as good as they sound. I, personally, think the coffee ice cream was a little overpowering, but it was still good. Food was great, service was great, and prices were great. What more do you want? If you're looking for a serious meal for the right price, this is it. I encourage bringing more people with you, so you can try more things!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of the most exquisite, quaint,  beautiful dining experiences I have ever had was at this hidden little french gem.

I make it a point to visit as often as I can. You cannot pass up the appetizers they are heavenly, always a wonderful risotto, oysters are so fresh and sexy( you cant stop eating them), tuna is so decadent, the lamb sausage and corn polenta will knock your socks off. Entrees I try something new most nights but have to say I'm partial to the duck.  The skate is unbelievable. Dessert ........WOW!!! From beginning to end this meal is an unforgettable experience.

They're great)), the extra sweet cornbread, andouille sausage in the shrimp and grits- the very fact that they actually HAVE shrimp an grits on the menu (!),  blueberry fried pies with lemon ice cream- fabulous; the tendency to fry things (shallots, lemon peel) for garnish and LOTS of bacon (vegetarians beware!) as well as sweet tea with mint.   Any complaints?  Yea- Lead Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love"" as background doesn't help me enjoy my food- I mean- jimmy page getting off while he's singing is supposed to help my appetite?

"A $25 pri fixe menu with an appetizer, entree and dessert sounded like a steal until I actually sat down and came to this place. My meal consisted of the Phoenician Fries, ever-popular lamb burger, and labne cheesecake. The fries were served with a garlic whip and were average. The lamb burger was cooked very well and served with argula and cheese on an english muffin. It was decent but it needed something else (possibly Tobasco and ketchup). Dessert was average and tasted like key lime pie according to my fellow food connoisseurs. Overall, it was a sub-par meal that I would have rather spent on a liquid lunch. The hummus was definitely unique and well-made but I gave this place 2 stars because of it's service. I'm not going to go into much detail about my experience there because I don't like to complain but at one point my colleagues and I sat there with no service for 20 minutes while dining on our entree. No water, no attentive waiters, nothing. I for one found that completely disrespectful, which is probably why I never got my hot sauce and ketchup for my lamb burger. It could be that the water main break completely brought service to a grinding and embarrassing standstill but if that''s the case, don't take money I could have spent on perfectly, good and appetizing Jack Daniels and give me an excuse to boot.   Does the hummus and lamb remind you of eating in the streets of Abu Dhabi with your  mouth salivating while your hookah is slowly burning on the side?

"Tried coming here one Thursday evening by myself and it was packed.  I couldn't even hear myself think, so I left.  Came here at around 7 on a Saturday night and there were two tables available.  Yay for me and my best friend!  We started with the tuna tartar and the stuffed mushrooms.  We enjoyed the mushrooms.  Unfortunately the tuna tasted fishy to us so after a couple bites and a short discussion we sent it back.  They were nice enough to take it off the bill.  We each had at least three glasses of wine along with our margarita pizza and an order of the meatballs.  The pizza and the meatballs were really good.  The wine is slightly pricey...definitely go with a bottle.  Glad we came.  We liked our server a lot.  Good food, good wine, good neighborhood spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"When going to a restaurant named Extra Virgin where they offer you the choice of ""Fruity"" or ""Organic"" olive oil for the bread, you should probably order something with oilve oil or something related in it, right? Well I'm not very good at following common sense when it comes to ordering food, so I got the Papardelle, where the noodles were a little hard for my taste and the sauce didn't have much more flavor other than sweet, but the brussel sprouts and the warm mushroom salad were really good. 4 stars for some pretty good food Revisit? Ya, to try something different","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am a huge crepe addict and I've eaten crepes all around the world. THIS little spot in Woodside, Queens is the best crepe I've ever had, and ever will have. I'm serious about crepe batter and hers is so on point. The owner/founder/chef's name is Patty - a delightful cheerful woman who takes her craft seriously.

"I've been to the Williamsburg location more times than I can count since it opened and I love the spot; great hearty food with a variety of selections.  I happened to be in the city and thought I would try out the LES location.   I never write yelp reviews but I felt so inclined after last night's dining ""experience."" My friend and I were sitting outside enjoying our food and the nice weather until it became obvious that there was some sort of issue being sorted out on the sidewalk between a customer and the female manager.  It was literally seconds before the manger was yelling at this woman, making a spectacle on the street and ruining our course.  She was so heated and so unprofessional that another manager had to come out to send her inside to calm her down.  Anyone in any sort of service industry would be so embarrassed by the way she acted.  She had no regard for the people on the patio.  It was very obvious she was blowing off steam and made for a very uncomfortable experience.   I love the food here.  If you are looking for something quick and different I would absolutely recommend this place, only I would send you to the other location.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"pros: Incredibly delicious. The seafood pasta was by far the best choice our party made. cons: The rest of us ordered less impressive dishes. I got lamb, which, considering that it's now summer, was not well thought out on my part. I sincerely regret not ordering a pasta dish. overall: There is nothing to fault about the food, but the only reason I wouldn't want to come out to Bianca is the space. It is so cramped that I heard about 2 or 3 different conversations in the restaurant and still couldn't hear what was being said at my own table. If you're a delicate and graceful person, this perhaps may not matter to you. If you tend to move your hands and arms while talking, it is not acceptable here. I find it hard to negotiate the delicious food and the discomfort of the space.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went to Balthazar for the first time recently for Sunday brunch. It was packed, I got shoved around a few times because it was so crowded inside. The bright side is the food was absolutely amazing, I had the eggs benedict and I also tried a few other dishes my friends had gotten, all great! The reason for the 4 stars is the service, it was extremely poor. My waitress was awful, she was rude, and pushy. My friend asked for toast on the side and she almost bit his head off saying we don't serve toast on the side. Nevertheless I can judge too poorly on Balthazar for one waitress. I shall return again soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've accepted the fact that it's hard to stay ""authentic"" to your regional cuisine when the restaurant has become so incredibly popular and widespread. The food has definitely been adjusted to suit American tastes and I can taste hints of Cantonese cooking in it as well. Not that it's still not delicious but it's lost the authenticity of that region's cooking. It also doesn't help the beginners to this cuisine that come here b/c most of the waitstaff are not knowledgeable about the menu so you won't get much help, just trust the description on the menu or look around at the delectible tasty items being brought out...buut Joe's is still far superior than its other xiaolongbao making counterparts in Chinatown. Just went yesterday for an early dinner and the place was packed, tables being shared, orders being taken at the speed of light, delicious saucy plates of food being brought to the tables. Had the usual bamboo steamer of pork soup dumplings (no crab for me, thanks), was good but not great, the meat honestly tasted like it was frozen for at least a few days and then steamed..you can also tell because it was not that soupy. then came the scallion pancakes which I normally hate ordering, but they were suprisingly delicious and fresh, with just the right amoutn of crispy flakiness but also doughy on the inside..we also had Shanghai thick noodles which were veryyy savory but also greasy and full of MSG-ness but that's what makes it SOO DAMN GOOD. It his the spot for me, but my Shanghainese mom and her friend were unsatisfied, understandably so. Would I come back here again and bring friends? Of course..just not any time soon, especially since I can get something better from my Grandma's kitchen, but Joe's is still one of the handful of Chinatown places I would still recommend for a hearty lunch or dinner. If you must get authentic Shanghainese food, I don't think theres hardly any left in Chinatown so you should just cross the bridge into Flushing and eat at the little food stalls or minimalistic dumpling joints there.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here for an after-work dinner with a friend on a Monday night. The first thing to note with particular distinction is the quality service that the staff at Obao provides. Waiting on my friend at the entrance, the hostess was quick to offer up a glass of water. This personalized attention to the diner would be carried throughout the course of our meal whether it was asking for food recommendations or reservoir worthy refills of water. The interior of Obao is something to behold; one feels transfixed at the sensation that you are within a wooden shack somewhere deep within a Thai jungle, replete with a sea of beautiful metal orange lamps illuminating the ground below and a few meditative buddhas watching as you consume another bite of your appetizer. To state it simply, the inside is exotic and inviting. For our wine, we went with a Pinot Grigio from Sicily (the name escapes me); for a person who usually detests white wine, I will admit that this was a delicious choice. We chose the crispy pork belly, spare ribs, and sambal spiced calamari for our appetizers. The pork belly was unremarkable, devoid of any distinctive flavor, and the calamari, while tasty, was dripping in oil. The spare ribs on sugar cane skewers, however, were quite interesting with the blend of the well-marinated meat dancing smoothly along with the rush of saccharine from the bite of the ""skewer."" The only trouble with the dish was the small amount of meat on the actual sugar cane and the fact that someone like me, who admittedly was not raised with sugar cane all his life, was not well-versed at one point to stop consuming the cane (this led to unseemly mouth to napkin scenarios). Entree wise, my friend ordered the ""nam prik ong"" vegetable wrap (which was quite spicy) while I decided to go with the Singapore laksa. On its own, the laksa was a bit bland, but once I added in all the additional fix-ins (cilantro, jalapeno peppers, and a substantial helping of chili paste) it turned out to be a flavorful and savory choice. The real winner of the night, to my surprise (as I am quite the opposite of a ""sweet tooth"") was the dessert: crispy banana lumpia with coconut ice cream. Holy heaven: imagine a perfectly fried banana drizzled with a delicate honey and mixed with an incredibly creamy coconut. Suffice it to say that the infamous sandwich scene from ""When Harry Met Sally"" was capable of being repeated by a performance from my friend...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went here for my birthday with a bunch of friends. They took reservations and even though some of us were a little late, they allowed those who arrived on time to sit down. I really liked the design of the place: reminded me of an underground mine with its exposed brick, aged wood beams, rusty light fixtures, and picnic-like tables. We had the bacon wrapped scallions (I highly rec), some cheese, a bunch of white wine, some of the sandwiches (my friends ordered as main courses), the mac and cheese (I really liked), along with some venison and foie gras (sp??). There was some other stuff, too, but clearly nothing memorable. With the exception of the bacon wrapped scallions, I would say just do wine, cheese, and some meats... Save full meals for later. The waitress was really helpful with picking wines as well as making sure we were never in need of water or anything. We were a relatively large group (like 10-14 people), so to cater to us while the restaurant was relatively full was really nice. I would want to come here again and see what the experience is like with a smaller group of people. Overall, I think the place was OK: it didn't blow me away and there are other wine and cheese spots that are more memorable (and worth the price) than here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with 5 other people, all wanting to try the live octopus. Ordered the $99 fresh octopus hot pot.  Since we got there a bit later in the night, there was only 1 octopus left (usually it comes with 2), so we just got one plate of wriggling octopus legs and were able to get 2 large lobsters in the hot pot (as opposed to 1 large lobster and 2 octopus, we got 2 lobster and 1 octopus). Oh my...the suction cups on the tentacles were very strong and the pieces stuck to the plate, making it hard to pick up with chopsticks.  I wonder if this is more of a special occasion/spectacle kind of thing as opposed to a typical dish (I'm assuming it's the former), because I can't quite see this as something that people would order regularly.  The raw, still moving chunks of tentacles were delightful to look at, but not too palatable to me...it was a texture thing.  It was definitely fresh, and didn't taste fishy or briny, but the fact that I had to keep chewing and chewing to break down the meat was hard to do.  It was akin to trying to chomp on a wad of rubber bands.  Not my thing. The bubbling vat of seafood though was a whole 'nother story.  When the waiter brought it to the table, the legs on the lobster tail (tail being separated from the body) were writhing with such force, that the tail fell off the pot and onto the floor!  The pot was filled with lots of amazing things: razor clams, mussels, abalone, whelk, shrimp, noodles, cabbage, crabs, octopus, giant clams (think Hawaiian shell bikini top), scallop, etc.  Basically the whole ocean (minus fish and marine mammals) was represented in this dish.  It was delicious, and a great deal for under $20 per person (it fed all 6 of us easily).  The only downside was seeing the lobster heads, antennas and claws freaking out; I did feel sorry for them and cannot imagine how terrible it would feel to be boiled alive... I'd come back with adventurous friends who like seafood, but would not make the trek back otherwise.  It was definitely an experience!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Extensive menu, delicious food, BOMB ASS GUACAMOLE, and tasty sangria, all priced to please. This is one of my go-to places when I have friends in town, and everyone I've introduced this place to has fallen in love.

"I have tried all the best Neapolitan pizza in the NY (Franny's, Roberta's, Keste etc..) Unfortunately, there is no real alternative to having that quality pizza lunchtime, without getting an entire pie. Enter Rubirosa. They offer about 3 of their varieties, by the slice, until 5pm. I had a slice of the classic, very reasonably priced at $2.50. The slice was excellent with a very crisp wafer crust and a proper blend of marinara sauce and cheese. A lot of the other spots tend to overwhelm the amazing sauce they have with a heavy does of cheese. While the pizza was delicious, it is not what earned a five star rating by this poster. I can unequivocally state that they have the best cheese calzone in NYC.  Stuffed to the brim inside a crispy delicious dough, is a melody of cheese that deserves to make it onto my last meal menu.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I wavering on my rating for this place, as I thought it was a cool experience.  The food I ate was certainly unique and the pig's head brought me back to my pig roast days.  That said, the whole experience is over-priced.  Here is why it is a three: Beer list:  Five star selection Price: One-star They like pricing people out of even trying half of their beers.  I wanted a porter or stout and there were only like two or three that were less than $10 a bottle.  Also if you go online and look at the beer list, half of the beers aren't actually available at the restaurant (false advertising fellas). Average: Three Food Uniqueness: Five-star Food Taste: Three-star Food Price: One-star When you charge $17 for mediocre bone marrow that yields three bites then you are going to offend your customer (me).  The pig's head and lamb belly were certainly interesting, but at $120 combined, the actual meat yield after fat and bone is pretty thin (hard to call anything about this meal thin, but I just did).  We also had the lamb tartare (delicious), thai sausage (also good), and some smaller sides that were all pretty solid.  So not all of it is over-priced, just a bunch of it. In the end, I will probably continue coming to this place to drink a beer and have some cured meats...but I would appreciate them pricing their beers better (and I am an f-ing beer snob and half) so that the common man can try some of their unique selection.   P.S. I am currently experiencing meat sweats from last nights meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This review is for the Luzzo's in Gansevoort Market. Pizza is great, however, they jacked up the prices without even telling customers. This used to be great pizza at a good price. They offered 1 margarita slice (which was actually 2 small slices, because the slices here are smaller than any normal pizza place) for $4. If you think about it, $4 for a slice of pizza is a bit extra, but since it's a slightly larger portion (the 2 little slices combined) and quality pie, it was worth it. Though the other day I went in and ordered a slice and I noticed they gave me 1 small slice, so I asked for another. I get to the counter to pay and it's $10... $10 for 2 small slices of pizza, that equal the size of 1 slice of pizza anywhere else... $5 for an irregularly small slice of pizza? Are you kidding??

"I came here for dinner for the first time and it was pretty freaking great. I like the atmosphere a lot. It's nothing really special or fancy, but it has just that right balance between being nice, clean, comfy, but not pretentious in any way. It's sort of dark and candle-y in a cozy way, and we sat around eating and drinking for almost 4 hours. I had the Belgian Spare Ribs and it was the best ribs I've ever had. I mean, really. I just ate my heart out in Kansas City, and I'm here saying that BXL has the best spare ribs. The meat is so tender that you literally can't pick up the rack - the bone just slips right out and the meat melts into pieces. The marinade is amazing, extremely flavorful but not in that gross, overly-sweet, sticky way that a lot of ribs are. Just right. The portion is ginormous, 2 racks. Plus a heap of fries AND a mixed green salad, so I can trick myself into thinking I'm being healthy before I find myself sopping up the meat juice with every last fry. Sad, but true. For dessert I had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream. It has a fancier name but I can't even pronounce it, much less spell it. It's not the best I've had, but it's very good. The chocolate is dark, rich, and very creamy, melts right in your mouth. Ice cream never hurt anybody. It may kill you eventually, but god what a way to die. Sadly, I didn't get to try the mussels this time, but will come back for that on an all-you-can-eat Monday night.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Such a unique restaurant. I had never really had German food before this so it really was an experience. The bartender was so nice and accommodating. Apparently, before I arrived, my friend had somehow become ""BFFs"" with her because when I came in she told Ben that she wanted us to sit at the bar so she could serve us. They were all familiar on a first name basis. I was only 5 minutes late! But, that's just Ben for ya. Anyway, she offered to make me a drink that wasn't on the menu so of course I said yes. It was an elderflower vodka. So good. I would definitely recommend it for people who aren't fans of sipping on straight booze. It's light, crisp, and refreshing. So, then she gave us her recommendations from the menu and we just went along with what she said. We had: Liverwurst: Surprisingly good. I was expecting something way nasty with the name and reputation, but I actually enjoyed it. Probably wouldn't order it again since it's pretty pricey and I'm cheap, but whatever. Pretzel w/ spreads: So, this they brought out to us courtesy of the house since the bartender liked Ben so much which was awesome for me! It was so good. Oh my god seriously. I should have just ordered this from the get-go for my dinner. It was that good. Seriously, order it. It's not an ordinary pretzel, I swear. Emmentaler Sausage w/ quark dumplings: My two friends ordered this because the bartender recommended it, but I'm cheap so this was way too expensive for me. I just ordered the Bratwurst and I am SO GLAD I did because it was literally the exact same thing as this except half the price. Don't bother with this one because, yeah, sure, it tastes good, but you get the exact same size meal if you just order the regular bratwurst. Bratwurst: Huge! This thing was massive and definitely tasty. Plus, I discovered I actually like sauerkraut after trying theirs. Who knew? My only complaint with this place was that it started to get real crowded real quick and the second the crowds came in, we lost all staff attention. Literally. It was impossible to pay our check. It was like we were invisible. Every single staff member was preoccupied literally the entire time. Go early so you avoid the crowds or else you'll just end up annoyed and ignored.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"On my way to Paris, to avoid doing two red eye flights, I broke the trip in NYC and spent two days there.  My friend I was travelling with took me out to dinner at this quaint Japanese restaurant called Katsu-Hama.  It was heaven on earth. My first taste of Japanese food ever, eons and eons ago was Tonkatsu and ever since then, I would always order tonkatsu when I don't feel like being adventurous.  I have had tonkatsu from Japanese restaurants all over the world but I have to say that the Katsu set at Katsu-Hama was the best I've ever had. The pork was really yummy and tender, the shrimp was nice and the crab croquette was creamy and delicious it was to die for.  I ordered an apple shochu and also tried the peach one...both were very nice...party in my mouth!   I'm sure to go back to this place next time I am in NYC.  Simply the best!","[1.0, 0.0]"
I live around the corner so I'll chime in and say how amazing it is to have a place near my house. I like the decor and the drinks. But I too am conflicted. Is it a bar or a restaurant? There is a difference between the two. My main comment is the food. The catfish has too much mayo and too much bread. Also the plate for it is too small. It can barely hold the sandwich and the lettuce. It is pricey but they're going to be able to get people to pay those prices so no need to quibble on that. The full menu is coming next week so I'm curious to see that. I think it will just be a drink place for me though.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"My first trip to the well-known Mario Batali restaurant had me with high expectations. I mean, I was a bit disappointed with Iron Chef Morimoto's flagship restaurant in NYC, so I was hoping not to get disappointed here. Turns out that although the prices made the dinner worth every bite, Lupa is a good restaurant that never really hits the ""wow"" level on the taste meter. The food: Table bread = Surprisingly cold foccacia. I mean, it wasn't bad; it was just a little disappointing, because it appeared to be warm and it would've been so damn good if it was warm. Squash = Also surprisingly cold, but it's very flavorful. Tonnarelli special pasta with pork ragu = Had a very unique, cheesy flavor. The Tonnarelli was cooked to a perfect al-dente. Bucatini with Cured Pork = The cured pork was phenomenal here, but the sauce lacked a memorable flavor. Hanger Steak w/ Polenta & Mushrooms = Well-cooked steak at more of a medium (than the requested medium-rare). The polenta had a strong butter flavor that made it taste more like movie theater popcorn than real polenta (albeit still very delicious) Tartufo (Hazelnut gelato covered in chocolate) = This dessert (supposedly the most popular dessert according to our waiter) tasted like the top part of a Nestle Drumstick ice-cream cone. I wasn't too thrilled with this one. All in all, Lupa is a very good Italian restaurant that dares to be a little different, while still maintaining a lot of the Italian authenticity that Batali is known for. It's definitely a nice place for a date, due to its romantic, dim-lit atmosphere and Italian charm. The food, however, just didn't wow me to the level that I thought Batali would.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went here for my girlfriends birthday on a Thursday night.  They say it is tough to get a reservation at this place so we called a week or so in advance and we got a 9:30 reservation.  We showed up 20 minutes late.  The host did not have a problem with that, he knew who we were as soon as we walked in the door, I thought that was cool. We were seated at a decent table, they took our drink order and told us to just hang out until we were ready to order, no rush.  Our waitress came and we ordered, she was very nice as was the hostess.  We had some calamari for starters, she had the sea bass special and i had the haibut, both were equally really good.  We had a dessert, i forget what it was but it was good, some kind of tart.  Not sure you can go wrong with the food, everything seemed to be done perfect and you can see they took time in preparing it.   I thought the place was going to be pricey but it was not so bad.  They serve only beer and wine and I don't think they hammered us too bad on either, which was nice of them. The music is good, lighting good, the people who work there definitely made the place very real.  I would go back for sure, great for special occasions and I am sure if you took a date there you would do well post date.  :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"4/brunch saturday 2/dinnner monday 8/dinner sunday Benedict, steak frites, fried chicken, seared tuna salad, brick chicken, burger Jane has a great and rare balance between table spacing, pricepoint, and quality of food. The menu is not daring or cheeky, but consistent and durable.  The prices are fair and the portions generous.  Someone in the back cares about the food.  Petty, but the fries illustrate this well.  They're delicious and piled high, vision and palate satisfied.  Fries, as a cheap, often throwaway item, get proper attention and deliver outsized rewards.  Jane gets many details right, especially the easy, inexcusable, frustrating ones that other places trip over. Steak's cooked properly, hollandaise balanced and flavorful, all the rest was as it should be, appropriately crisp, juicy, hot, cold, etc. A couple cracks might show through at brunch, it's constantly slammed and it's a comparatively large restaurant. Dinner, especially on quiet nights is wonderful.  The food and table are well tended, you can spread out a little and feel like a grown-up with space to match.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I normally don't write reviews on Yelp... but my experience here last night coupled with all the fake review I found for this place compelled me to say my piece. I'll keep it short and brief. Came here for dinner last night. While the food has potential, nothing can excuse the horrible service and pathetic execution. Food comes out cold. Some people have eaten while others are still waiting for entrees. Everything is either over seasoned or under seasoned. Prices are on the high side for small portions. To the chef: This is not Spice Market, but a tiny LES restaurant. If you want to charge Spice Market prices, please make sure you can provide the same level of quality and service!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been coming here since I was in high school. I'm not even THAT into Italian food, but this place is pretty special. It's rare that you can find such delicious and affordable food that is also worthy of being a great date spot, or even a great spot to take friends who are looking for a nice dinner out. Their pasta is homemade and fresh, their portions aren't overwhelming (but not skimpy either), and they always have a really reasonably priced wine selection. The BEST part--you can easily come here on a Saturday night and find a table without having to wait. Their pasta selection is HUGE and the menu can be a tad overwhelming so I'd recommend checking it out online before going and having a few options in mind ahead of time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
This is A-OK pizza. I have lived in this area since 1977 and Dom has always been around. I see a lot of hipsters coming here now paying five bucks a slice. Ha ha the joke is on you. Those who grew up in the neighborhood call it a dirty slice. It's a quick eat when you come off the the train. Back to the dirty slice thing. It has to do with Dom's oven. We use to have a better pizza spot on J and 13 called Jerry's. Dom and Jerry were rivals then Jerry sold out for the quick dollar he would have got later on. So now we have DiFara's and the way too funny lines outside going to the 99 cent store. Jerry Jerry.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is one of the few restaurants in NYC where I am willing to wait 2 hours on a saturday night for a table.  The service is always great and the food comes out pretty quickly once you get to sit down at your table.   As for the ramen...it is definitely my favorite in the city (sorry momofuku) and the same goes for the pork buns.  I find myself dreaming about those pork buns for a solid week after I eat at ippudo.  Pork bun addiction.  The noodles in the ramen are always cooked to perfection and the broth is always seasoned to perfection. I like how theres always a special ramen, not sure if its weekly or daily, but its always phenomenal!   No doubt that I'll be back, over and over.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If time is indeed money than this place owes us money. Waiting 10 mins for the waiter and another 15 mins to get our breakfast/brunch is totally not acceptable. And hearing a bunch of waiter keep apologizing to every customer for the long wait doesn't make it better... even worse, because instead of going back to work they are standing there and apologizing which makes us wait even longer. I'm not saying it was bad, because the service was still friendly. The brunch is $12 for simply eggs and bread and that kind of things. And if you add a little you can get the $20 menu including a drink. I think both is not cheap and will still make you leaving this place with an empty stomach. Overall it's a nice, cozy place with friendly service and decent food. But the long wait and high price won't get me back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If there was ever a way to give a sixth star.... Diner would be amongst the first places to pop into my head... At Diner, you never know what to expect... but in an awesome way. That's because they make the menu fresh every day based on what's seasonal and what strikes their creative fancy. Which earns them huge stars for originality, creativity, and work ethic. Well, come on.. get at it, what did you have??? Being summer, the lady and I started with the peach and cucumber soup... A beautifully chilled and pureed soup tricked out with some super quality yogurt, scallions, and radishes. Absolutely one of the best treats of the summer. Super tasty and refreshing. Next.... the house made fettuccine with eggplant, squash, onions, and garlic. Light and tender, the pasta was amazing and the quality was so fresh you could taste the egg in the pasta. Vegetables were tender and savory. Garlic was wonderfully roasted. Top it off with shaved reggiano... A wonderful summer dish that made me remember my pastafarian roots. The piece du resistance of the day = green bean salad with bacon slab. Being a baconsaurus, this immediately struck my fancy as a must have dish. Beans were lightly roasted and tossed with breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and shallots, beans, basil, eggplant and cherry tomatoes. Light salt. Throw on two of the most amazingly smoked hunks of bacon ever that were, so tender they fell apart just by staring at them, and you have one of the best dishes consumed. The beef heart carpaccio and bone marrow was the reserve dish that I never got around to that day, but I'm hoping it will happen another time to try. A bit out of my adventure comfort that day. But I'll be back for sure for something out of the ordinary here! They also seem to have a standard burger on their menu that I'm sure is out of this world. Dessert.... O yeah Dessert. Peach and blueberry pie!!! And I mean a personal little pie with fresh whipped cream. Incredibly flaky buttery crust hit the spot soooooooo nicely. Raspberry and plum crumb!!! Represented the pinnacle of freshness and summer fruits and berries. Served with a nice sour yogurt... Orgasmically fresh, and the crumbs were nicely spiced with nutmeg and Cinnamon. All this talk about food is making me thirsty.... Well they have some nice seasonal beers on bottle and tap to quench that thirst. They also do up some very nice sounding cocktails that are guaranteed to pack a punch! O yeah, I forgot that there are servers and ambiance here. Well, being in an old diner, and not doing much to the decor really sets the feel of this place. Counter (pretty much a bar now) and booths appear to have never been touched by the hand of time (though they do have a more modern seating area in the back). Nice and dim lighting sets the mood to the oldies and alternative over the PA. Outdoor is available on the nice days, but I dig the vibe here. The service is equally wonderful as the setting. Uber friendly staff sits next to you and goes over the menu for the day and writes it down on the table setting. Additionally, they give you ample time to mill over the options before returning to take care of your order. Bottles of tap on the table take care of not having to ask over and over for palate cleanser. The staff genuinely seems as excited for the food as you are. Lovely experience indeed. Diner is definitely the place to go for a true treat!!! And if any place deserves an above the top rating... This is It... EAT UPS!!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'd been recommended this place for ages so I finally decided to make the trip to Totto. I signed my name on the list and was seated in about 1 hour. This place is quite small and the lines are insane. I ordered the pork buns which was so disappointing. The meat was dry and the sauce looked and tasted like mayonnaise which was horrible. Momofuku has much better pork buns. I ordered the spicy ramen which really wasn't that spicy but I was struck with horror when I saw that the spicy sauce was the same one that came in a packet of ramen I used to eat. The sauce is a Chinese spicy sauce that is very black-peppery and not so much spicy and flavorful. The sauce is not bad but it doesn't appeal to me at all. I will not be returning to Totto.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ill give ngam 5 stars for their top tier ambience, presentation, and service. Their food, however, didn't really live up to my expectations and I can give no higher than maybe a 2.5 from a value perspective. I had the green curry and my fiance the pad thai. Considering how cheap it is to make thai food and the relatively high price we were paying, I thought the portion sizes were too small. (Then again, I'm from houston, and I'm used to Texas sized portions when it comes to Houston healthy variety of Thai restaurants) I also felt like the curry was a little watered down which dampened the flavor. There wasn't that balance between spiciness and flavor and overall was really disappointing. Pad thai was really plain as well... it's hard for me to get into the details of why, but it just didn't have that punch I'm normally used to. I would recommend thai terminal if you're looking for higher quality thai food with greater portion size.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Welcome back. We just returned from France and what a welcome surprise to find Le Jardin Bistro back in business! Of course the garden is missed but replaced by two wonderful levels of eating  with outdoor spaces on both levels and still those wonderful doors in the front opening into bustling Avenue C. We arrived pre-reservation early to take in the Happy Hour with its generous offerings of 1 buck oysters and 6 buck cocktails, 4 and 5 dollar wine and beer. The oysters are delivered in true bistro style iced and elevated with beautifully crowned lemon halves and sauces. They don't even do that at the Grand Central Oyster Bar! Really if you can't afford a trip to Paris come here. This place also offers house wine carafes with your meal. It's our first visit back. The staff is professional and welcoming (if Yelp would allow me to underline welcoming here I would) as they were before telling us the same people responsible for their Bouillabaisse and Cassoulet have returned. I had a 56 oz Porterhouse last month in another restaurant which I finished. I could not finish the Cassoulet here. And thankfully I was in New York and not Paris where they frown on 'doggie bags'. No doggie was getting this bag. I've had Cassoulet every place I could. Twice in Paris on a recent trip. This one is the best. And at 20 dollars its an unspeakable bargain. My wife had the Bouillabaisse. Saying it did not disappoint is an understatement. Many layered and a true bargain at 22 dollars. Save yourself a trip to Marseille where they invented it (and its 70 bucks a person- I'm not kidding) and have it here savoring every spoonful. We also had a side of Frites which were great. Can't leave Jardin without those. Goodnight to all who served us. I'll end as I began: Welcome back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Holy Crepe --I am dying from happiness after meeting my new sweet and savory friends near Wall Street.

"The 5 stars is for innovative food that is wonderfully cooked!  Want a restaurant that is NOT like everywhere else in town?  Try The Marshal.  We were in NYC for a vacation and checked Yelp for restaurants near the hotel we always stay at which boasts CA VA, a Todd English restaurant that is a thoroughly overpriced bag of air.  We went to The Marshal for dinner on Monday (Labor Day) as walk-ins and were able to get a table immediately because this is traditionally a slower week for the good restaurants.  We then went Tuesday after the theater and had an equally excellent lighter meal and service.  Wednesday night my mom, brothers and sisters flew in and we just had to take them there.  They all agreed with us....this place is not run-of-the-mill, unusual and worth repeated trips to try more of the offerings. The service was above par which is the first sign an owner cares about his establishment.  Friendly and competent service is appreciated, but then you learn everything is brick-oven cooked in various sized iron skillets.  One of the few places in NYC to exclusively use this technique.  Next you read all of the ingredients come from local farms in the tri-state area.  The menu tells us the source of each of the main ingredients and you can taste it..Fresh and bursting with flavors.  The food ultimately stands out above the crowd because of what is combined with what! I would advise you to try anything on the menu that fits your tastes and that would be unusual because most establishments have a few items they are known for and the rest are just OK.   On the third night, we had a chance to chat with the owner and learned some of our favorite items were from family recipes and he grew up on a farm in the northwest.  Due to the local farm fresh purchases, items change based on availability.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really wanted to like you. I did. The high praise from yelp and the success on Top Chef seemed like wise reasons to choose you to be the place to celebrate my 6 year anniversary with the bf. But alas. Another restaurant where the hype precedes the actual meal. The cons: the duck breast! Served in two huge thick pieces, my medium rare breast was just too chewy and had sinew running through it. Even the other two parts of the dish were disappointing. The duck leg confit wrapped in crepe was boring.  Although the flavor was good, the seared foie gras needed something other than the accompanying nuts to provide contrasting texture.  The bf ordered the hanger steak.  The creamed spinach was delicious, but the steak itself was also chewy. Is medium rare actually rare in Perilla's dictionary? So what made me almost give Perilla 3 stars? Well, the signature spicy duck meatballs were good and comforting. Tasted even better after I ate a piece with the delicious table bread.  Also great was the gingerbread cake with all of its components from the salty caramel to the roasted pear.  Another great thing - Perilla's service. After noticing that I barely touched my dish, the busboy asked me if something was wrong with the duck.  Upon hearing that I thought it was too chewy, the busboy informed our waiter who later kindly told us that my entree was comped courtesy of the chef.  So the night didn't end badly from that perspective.

"tl;dr The noodles, not the broth, are the true standouts here. They have likely the best ramen noodles texture-wise in NYC. --- (minca anagrams to ""manic."" hehe. okay. enough.) Oh Minca. You're supposed to be the sister restaurant to Kambi, so why are you so much better than Kambi? I thought I knew you from Kambi, but apparently not. You sneaky ramen shop, you...! Anyways, what makes Minca stand out is their noodles. They truly have some of the best ramen noodles here - their straight cut thin ramen noodles are EXCELLENT, and even the thicker kind is chewy with the right kind of bounciness. Yumminess all around. (What I don't quite get is that Minca advertises itself as ""Ramen Factory,"" but their noodles distinctly come from Sun Noodle based on visual evidence from my eyes seeing them take the noodles out of Sun boxes, so are they the ""factory"" sense in that they manufacture BOWLS of noodles and not noodles themselves, or that they give directions to Sun Noodle to make their noodles, or...? ANYWAYS) So what to eat? I like the normal Minca shoyu and the Minca Shio. Their shio is garlicky which really brightens a typical shio broth. After several visits, I do agree to an extent that the pork/chicken mix broth is getting to be a bit tiring to me and it lacks both the brightness of a white tori soup and the silkiness of a true tonkotsu broth. The next time I return I will be sure to try out some of their all-pork or all-chicken broths to see if they are any better. I did have the Toriniku ramen, which seems to be one of the standouts at the restaurant. Basically, this is just an amped up version of their standard ramen (similar to the extra chashu ramens at normal ramen places), but this one has pork belly with it. It's not true pork belly in the sense that it's not super fatty, and some of the chunks honestly are generally more lean meat than the pork belly variety - but they do advertise it as ""slow cooked pork"" so it's fine. My quibble with it is generally that the pork just seemed to be a chunky chashu, and it does not fall apart when prodded as true slow-cooked pork does (just think of a well braised brisket). To me, I felt like I was just chomping down on giant chunks of pork on top of a full bowl of ramen - it got fairly unappetizing quickly. The chunks of raw cabbage that grace the top of the ramen were a great touch - it was a much needed counterbalance to the overwhelming amount of meat you get with the Toriniku. Quantity, yes. Quality? Not so much. Try Santouka's toriniku at Mitsuwa :) They do have good gyoza though. Mmm fried to a crisp and super delicious. Bottom line - I enjoy Minca because of the noodles. They're satisfying, always cooked to perfection, and full of flavor. The broth could use some work, but I wouldn't complain too much about it as it's still honestly 3.5/5 in my opinion. Combined, that's a 4/5 and I only wish they were closer to UES! (they should somehow buy up the Japanese restaurant next to them - which has double the amount of space and half the amount of people - and make more ramen yumminess)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food was horrible and the service was even worse.  I came with my company for lunch that was reserved for 12:45.  After being sat 20 min. late, we still did not receive our food until 2:40.  The waitress barely tried to remedy the situation -- not asking to refill drinks or replenish bread (which should have been on the house).  She even tried her very best to avoid eye contact and walked past us while her eyes skimmed the tops of our heads.   I wish I could give her name, but she failed to deliver that.  For a historical establishment, this place really was not a great choice.  Caution: do not eat here during lunch if you have to get back to work!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Their appetizers are good, their pastas are fresh and flavorful, and the halibut I had was light, well textured, and interesting. Although it sometimes has its ups and downs (my friend's steak was overcooked and slightly tough) they do a good job of infusing their dishes with interesting salsas and sauces. The lemon and almond cake is good if you're a lemon fan - but don't miss the smooth, rich and thick chocolate pudding! A friend of mine dreams of the pudding here...","[1.0, 0.0]"

It's also a great escape from the disorienting midnight madness outside on the weekends.

The sriracha blended well and created a very savory noodle broth. Three cheers! I think I had my first Vietnamese coffee ever.

"Lulu and Me has only been in operation since November, but they're already doing a fine job at being a great pub in a weird neighborhood! This area of Midtown is a weird mix of check cashing places, crappy t-shirt stores, and fancy 200-seat restaurants. Luckily, Lulu fills the gap for cute little bars with great food and a thorough drink menu. I came in on Friday night for a quiet dinner alone and enjoyed a Jefferson Bourbon cocktail and the eggplant rollatini. The food was delicious, but something to remember is that they do small and medium plates - order 2 or 3 things if you're really hungry, because 1 medium plate won't cut it. I shot the shit with the very friendly bartender and was overall pretty pleased with my service. The one thing I'll say is this - I think Lulu has a bit of an identity crisis that needs addressing. At first glance, it's a cheeky little candlelit gastropub with subway tiled walls and dark wood - a little French and moody, which I quite love.  But then you've got a huge TV playing some sporting event, and several people, including staff, screaming at said TV and bickering about some 'roid chomping athlete's current stats.  I'm not saying that you're not allowed to talk about sports in a cute little gastropub, I'm not! It just seemed like such a weird dichotomy. I am sure that once they've been on the block long enough, their personality and clientele will even out and we'll know exactly what kind of place this is.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"From the moment you enter the door at Ippudo, you are amongst friends. As soon as I entered the dining room, the waiters shouted a welcome and we were seated at a table that wraps around a lovely centerpiece, accompanied by other diners. As one who typically likes to dine with my party and my party only, I actually found it refreshing to be surrounded by others who were raving about every dish. To begin, my party ordered the veggie bao buns, shishito peppers and short ribs. The short ribs were highly recommended by the guests dining next to us. The peppers were lightly fried and served with a lime salt for dipping. They were almost like an edamame substitute, although I believe edamame was actually on the menu as well. The bao buns were so scrumptious that I ordered a second helping! Hands down the best bao buns in the city. The bun was so light and the crispy eggplant and mushroom inside really hit the spot. I didn't try the ribs, as I'm a veg-head, or vegetarian for long, but was told that they didn't quite live up to the hype. To each his/her own. For our entrees, we ordered the ramen, which is what they're known for. I was honestly a little full from the second order of bao buns, so I only are about half of the ramen, but I was pleased. I got the wasabi ramen, skeptically, because many Asian eateries tend to go overboard with wasabi and my nose hairs get singed, but the wasabi to soup ratio was just right. We shared the crepe cake and the green tea/mascarpone ice cream for dessert. There was nothing particularly mind-blowing about either dessert, but they were tasty. Would I endure the 2.5 hour wait again for the ramen and dessert? Probably not, but I would pitch a tent and camp out overnight for those bao buns!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"When I walked into Sticky's Finger Joint last night, I was hoping for some good chicken fingers, but I never expected it to be as good as it was. I have pretty high expectations for fast food, and chicken fingers are no exception. Sticky's is a small little eatery and I found it to be quite quaint and cozy on the inside. After the nice Australian (not New Zealand, and she made sure I knew the difference haha) girl at the counter took several minutes to help myself and my friends learn about each of the menu items, we sat down at an empty table. I ordered the general tso's chicken fingers with a side sauce of wasabi mayo. Well, I will just say that the chicken fingers may have been the best that I've ever tasted in my 22 years. The chicken was moist, juicy, and flavorful. It was spicy and had a kick, but at the same time, there was a sweetness to it that just blended everything extremely well. I also got to know one of the owners, John, and he was a very friendly guy who seemed to really care about his restaurant (and it showed). I had a fantastic time at Sticky's and I plan on being back for some more chicken fingers next time I visit the village!

"Saddest Cobb Salad in Manhattan. I wanted to think differently because the ambience, decor, and service was great. It's true what others say: this place is really cute! But I was so disappointed with the food. I ordered the $14 Cobb Salad. For $14, you expect a little more than what I got: handful of romaine lettuce pieces, three cherry tomatoes, a tbsp of bacon bits, hardboiled egg white. No dressing. But there was a piece of bread on the side. I was looking forward to trying that. Didn't get to eat it though....Because the menu said the salad comes with chicken and blue cheese dressing, two very key components of the salad, I asked the waiter if I could have the chicken and blue cheese dressing. So he took away my plate and a few minutes later brought back the salad. This time, that piece of cornbread/bread thing wasn't there. They took away the piece of bread. Sacrilegious. How could you. And the salad was not any better. A few pieces of bland chicken. Some salt and pepper wouldn't hurt. Blue cheese dressing was difficult to come by, it appeared to be at the very bottom of the salad just hanging out beneath all the lettuce. The lettuce pieces were way too big to eat comfortably. Do I need to take a knife and fork to this salad?  And seriously!! Why did you take away that piece of bread when you brought back my salad! I was really disappointed. $14 plate for glorified romaine lettuce. And I'm a huge fan of cobb salads. This one was really sad. I might give this place another try one day. But if you can't get a cobb salad right, I can't trust you. Sorry grey dog :(","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have to say that this is my favorite Italian restaurant on Staten Island.  The daily limited menu is a neat concept and the appetizers are awesome.  They add a nice touch by giving you a sample dish from the cook and their wine selection is what I look for when wanting a variety of wines.  The owner tries hard to accommodate you if you don't have reservations and the wait staff is extremely friendly.  You really need reservations if you want to be seated at a reasonable time.   My only issues are that the place is on the small side putting the tables very close to each other.  As mentioned in another post, the music is way too loud.  I know the owner responded saying the only song that is played loud is the ""Beatles birthday song"", but that's not true.  Almost every song is on blast and I'll be honest, he's having drinks during the evening so his perception of the volume may be skewed from what the patrons hear. In summary, this place is excellent and I would highly recommend it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's a small space so the wait to get in might not be pleasant for you. I'll admit, the presentation is all really great. Especially the diy ice tea! Which is 5 dollars, so I guess it's fine if you're a spender, but I'm on a student budget! Pretty mediocre tho, didn't really meet up to my expectations. The food is as basic as can be and not as flavor filled as other Thai places I've been. Still never bad to try new places though! A one time visit definitely. 3 stars for the cool presentation.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place's concept is fairly straight forward. Meatballs nuff said. I've eaten here twice and have had pork, beef and chicken. They're all good and the sauces are too. I prefer to go for the straight up balls to the smashes. I'm from western New York where everything is available Buffalo chicken style from Canada to Syracuse or in Rochester with meat based hot sauce (which would probably be overkill here). I wish Buffalo chicken style was a regular menu item. My only major complaint is that the pesto is served cold. I'm not sure if this is by design. The place has been too busy for me to really engage the server in conversation. Because of this, though it pains me not to give them a five, they are a high four.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went back for lunch today. Calamari appetizer:  As big as an entree.  Not fried (good for them being original!), and served in a nice sharp sauce with a chunk of bread and tomatoes/olives.  Outstanding, and an excellent value for $10. Brussels sprouts side-dish:  For $5, it definitely met my brussels sprouts fix, but there was a bit too much butter for my liking.  It's rare that I don't finish a brussels sprout dish (and then go eat something immediately after, which I did).  I'd opt for the rosemary french fries instead.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Even given the legacy of the Blue Ribbon establishments and many positives, four stars would be the max for this place. We came in a few minutes after opening and were warmly greeted and comfortably seated. Kids were given crayons. Our waiter was nice, but scarce  (also his white shirt was rather dirty even though his shift has just began). The only opportunity we had to order more drinks was when a manager (?) came to ask how we liked everything. The food was good, but it, as well as the bread at the beginning of the meal, and drinks took very long to arrive. I asked for an extra pickle as it was pretty good. It came about 10 min later and we were charged $2.50 for it.  It's only about $1 good. I expected a lot more form $15 French onion soup; unfortunately it was no better than what I've had before for half the price. Kids' menu is $14.50, but portions are tiny.  We did not get desert as the kids were getting restless and another 40 min of wait time would be deadly. I was unimpressed overall. Maybe due to hyped up expectations or maybe because the food was not exactly worth the wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"OMG, 6 stars. ""I"" am reviewing this place, trust me its the real deal. Quirky and very hard to love but OG 6 stars NY pizza. I'm gonna explain this place to you so you'll get a better understanding of Di Fara Pizza. So sit back, and get ready. First - Its a hole in the wall place, Its not charming. The tables are folding card tables and cheap plastic chairs. Old skool paneling on the walls as well as pictures of Dom making his pizza. Second - Don't think your gonna run in, grab a pie and bolt. You order a pizza and wait. For almost one hour. You may order a $5 slice (if they have it available) Third - location. How the hell do you get here? The friggin Q train? Fourth - Price. Where are you from, Long Island? I'd say a whole pie cost in Lake Ronkonkoma $16 bucks. Not here, its $30 bucks with no toppings. Don't like it? Take the Q outta here baby I ordered a $30 pie with pancetta topping. If your a first timer, don't get too loopy with the toppings! Start out slow. Trust me, the plain pizza by itself is worth it. I see Dom taking a sicilian pizza out of the oven and its sizzling. Friggin sizzling!! I have never seen a pizza sizzle before and trust me its a good thing. I see him making my pizza. It seems so simple, lay on the sauce, thick graded mozzarella cheese and cut up pancetta. He makes these pizzas one at a time. There is no rapid fire 5 pizzas in the oven. Just a few at a time, its a one man operation. When my pizza is finished? HE TAKES THE PIZZA OUT OF THE OVEN WITH HIS HANDS! What. The. Eff!!! He's my hero at the this point. Finally, he takes a handful of fresh basil and cuts a bunch over the pizza. Then drizzles more olive oil on top. So me and my boys fight for a seat on a folding table. We sit down and each take a slice. Holy Moley, THIS was the best pizza I ever had in NY, the best I ever had. Ever. What's probably funny and true? For $30 pizzas, Dom probably owns a small house and lives a simple life. I looked in his old eyes yesterday, he's tired but he loves what he does. And that my friends is the secret of life. Aspire to be more, not to have more.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Public is hands down the best brunch in the area. It is also easily the hardest reservation to come by. Luckily for M and I, we managed to land a table without one, as we came early one morning after a relative snowpocalypse the night before. Traversing Elizabeth street already requires enough attention as it is; asking one to find the entrance to Public as you proceed along it is an even taller order. You will see it marked by a few strips of metal, an industrial beacon amongst the rows of brick Nolita has come to be synonymous with, and you will know you have arrived. Once you do make it inside, the hostess will swiftly, graciously show you to your seat, and a server will arrive eerily quickly. It is clear that Public is hellbent on retaining its Michelin star, and at the very least, will not lose it due to its service. But in the brief moment between your seating and the appearance of your server, you should take in your surroundings. High rafters trace the ceilings, tastefully archaic academia ephemera dot the walls, and barren tables are contrasted with the stunningly wide windows. Windows, which if you are lucky enough to be seated near, will gorgeously light yourself, your partner(unless you're flying solo, in which case...ogle yourself in your phone reflection or something), and your food. Of course, the food doesn't need theatrics in order to be appetizing. The visual and aromatic assaults are still no match for the one waged on your sense of taste. Chef Brad Farmerie has a certain panache for rendering the ordinary into the exotic. The pedestrian brunch standby, eggs hollandaise, make an appearance, but come topping a layer of tea-smoked salmon over toasted sourdough, the hollandaise made with a hint of yuzu. The yuzu could have been more pronounced, and the eggs a bit less firm, but the dish as a whole was still a success. The requisite burger option is a beautiful hunk of venison, grilled perfectly, sandwiched in a bun flavored by miso, topped with a hearty jam of tomato and chilies, paired with cassava fries that will make you wonder where this root has been all your life, and why you have not eaten more of it. But perhaps most preposterously of all, an entree, a cocktail(cocktails which are nearly as good as the food), and your choice of coffee or tea will set you back a scant twenty-two dollars. This does not include the amuse you will most likely be given (M and I had the benefit of receiving freshly baked sour cherry scones) and does not seem to take into account that the portions are surprisingly generous. If Public cuts any corners, they are entirely unbeknownst to its patrons. Service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere and space are immanently enjoyable. Some restaurants are popular with little merit for being so. Public, popular though it is, deserves to be even more in vogue.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I immensely enjoyed our visit here. It's just so quirky and cute inside!!! The food was different and nicely prepared. The menu looked and tasted like a Japanese/French fusion. We tried their croissant, sashimi don, and another dish that had tomato flavored beef with an egg on top, all there were tasty. My fave from the meal was the soy pickled apple drink though, tasted creamy with just the right amount of sour and sweetness. Beware that its very tiny inside and probably only holds 20 people at a time. Not sure if they even take reservation. Pricing wise a little expensive for a cafe type of place, but not over the top.

"Went recently to try their new weekday breakfast menu since we needed a place to meet out-of-town friends for breakfast in Park Slope South. I had read and heard great things about Adderley's brunch so I thought we couldn't go wrong with their new weekday breakfast version. I want to premise this review with the fact that I'm the hugest fan of brunch (weekends, weekdays, morning, afternoon and nights) so I have pretty high standards for anything with the words ""toast"" or ""egg"" in the name. I decided on the croque madame and mint tea which was served in a very timely manner. My friends ordered omelets, egg whites, oatmeal with peaches and coffees . The egg dishes came with a side salad and my croque madame was served open-faced on a thick slice of nicely toasted bread but the egg on top was definitely not the over medium consistency I had requested. The mint tea was delicious and I loved the eclectic, funky, ""vintage-williamsburg-feel"" to this cozy hotspot. Oddly they were playing talk radio in the background instead of music for the first hour we were there and my husband was not a fan of their coffee or overly salted omelet and side salad. I would go again and give their brunch or dinner a shot. The decor, vibe and staff were great and hopefully this was just one salty, undercooked fluke of an experience. Note: Despite the cozy six-seated bar in front, there were several people there with younger kids in the back room so my feeling is this is a very kid-friendly resto either in the AM or PM due to the separation of space.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And tomato and/or bacon, if you want, for $1. Pretty great overall prices, too, esp for Manhattan. AND a decently sized portion of their satisfyingly hearty house tomato soup. Oh, and another thing: I was unwrapping the small bit of toast to dip in my soup when I realized it wasn't toast, but A SURPRISE COOKIE. I usually decline cookies, but I'm just feeling pretty great about this whole order.

"I really wanted to love Odeon.  My friend really likes this place and so we went for dinner this past weekend.  Maybe my expectations were a little high coming in, but I felt like I had just a middle of the road experience (based more on food than service).  The service was good, with the only complaint being they were slow on refilling your drinks.  And most of the food was good.  We started with the beet salad which was good (i love beets) but not incredible.  For my entree, I had the tuna burger.  I generally love tuna burgers and made sure to ask how it was prepared in advance.  It was supposed to be sushi grade tuna cooked on the medium rare side.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't good.  The wasabe mayo was a good touch but it was honestly just very ""fishy"".  Considering a number of other people have liked their tuna burger, I'm willing to consider that this might have just been a bad experience.  But, it was bad enough, I would never order it there again if I go back.  I will say that their gelato was excellent (homemade) and helped get the taste of the burger out of my mouth.   Overall, I wouldn't necessarily tell people to stay away - it is fine and there are many things on the menu that are probably very good.  I would just stay away from the tuna burger, and considering how many excellent restaurants there are in the city, I won't likely be back soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I don't usually eat pork. But I figured, here, I am, why not. I mean, I eat pork that does not resemble animal flesh, like bacon or sausage. But pork in a bun was a totally new experience for me. Pork buns nearly made me a convert. It is almost 1am and I am thinking greedily of them right now. I feel that if you are going to eat pork, and you do not normally do such things, this is the occasion. We had raw scallops with pickled cherries and lemon puree. It was a bit small of a dish to share, as I would have been happy to have wolfed it down and kicked my cousin under the table, but he generally pays, so I've got to keep him around. For the entree, we shared the fried lamb belly with violet mustard and cippolini onions. Heaven, delectable and a fabulous combination. We also had the pistachio croustillant with pineapple coulis, which was a good combination of light croustillantness and the solid crunch of pistachios. It wasn't too sweet, which I really appreciated. The plates are on the small side, so if you're a big eater, then be prepared. I prefer smaller amounts of amazing food, so such things don't upset me. The ambiance of sitting at the bar was ok. Definitely not a romantic date kind of place (but again, was with my cousin, so it seemed fine), though the music is definitely a bit loud, given that it's a small space and they pack a lot of people in. The service was fair, but I suppose we also didn't seem super-engaged with the food (the way we ought to have, but again, my cousin is not the ""food experience"" type). More. I will go back. I can't wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"

And well worth the trek.  Ardesia has a very good domestic and international wine selection -- by the bottle, and ample by the glass options.  Champagne and cider also were featured during our visit. The space is intimate and candle lit, with a good buzz from the crowd.  A bar area with front tables and a side dining area create this wine resturant.  In season, outdoor seating is available in a spacious front patio area. Small tapas dishes complement the wine options.  The spicy duck pate sandwich is incredible;  really tasty artichoke and cheese dip (with Amy's Bread);  lamb skewers and arugula salad also are good choices.  Cheese and cured meat boards round out the food menu.  All food options were well prepared and a winning complement to the wine. The wait staff is pleasant, and well-informed about the wine as well as the food selections. Ardesia is fun and well worth the visit.  I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Truth be told, there isn't a huge difference between the quality of food here, and say, the quality of food you might experience at Applebee's. But what makes this spot more appealing than a casual dining chain is the novelty of its Thai menu, the accessible hipster vibe, and an East Village destination. Service is knowledgable, fast and friendly, and the restaurant's community of patrons seems dominated by a set of unassuming, 20-something, middle-class diners eager to spend their paychecks on a dinner at sit-down restaurant. All the entrees seemed a bit disappointing, from the chicken pad thai to the sweat potato lamb dish topped with nan. They were of average quality, and seemed to lack the care of a talented chef. Maybe it was just line cooks, and the sous or executive chef were on vacation. Our dessert,  a goat cheese and coconut cheesecake, was a bummer too. It seemed more like whip cream in a cup than the description our server gave us. Ngam is best for small plates and the cheaper cocktails (as low as $8), but not worth the splurge if you're planning a full multi-course dinner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The wine is what you come here for...having the house Cab and my date had the house Pinot Noir. Both very fruitful and dry. We both liked our drinks and had two each.

Maybe next time I go, I'll grab some food. Service was excellent, waiter was very attentive. It is a small place so you might feel cramped. I got there early and picked out the table.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. We know. We know. New York City is the center of the universe. We get it. And with probably a million restaurants - from the mundane to the insane -  where does one really begin? Enter Artichoke. Last week, walking down 14th street on my way to meet friends in the East Village for dinner (which was mediocre at best), I stumbled upon this joint, a long cue spilling out the sidewalk, people sitting on benches or standing by a counter out on the sidewalk, shoving - from what I could tell - enormous slices of pizza, and washing them down with draft beer in plastic cups on an unseasonably warm spring evening. I had to come back, I told myself, and find out what the deal is all about. I called a friend the next day, who was also visiting, and told him to meet me there a little before rush hour so we can avoid the line. There we were, sitting on that bench, with three big slices of pizza - 2 artichokes and a margherita -  and two semi-cold cans of Diet Coke to keep us from choking. All for about $20.00 including tip. You see there's a reason why I don't live in NYC. If I ended up here, I would have frequented places like this and have ballooned myself to obesity of bad carbs so good I wouldn't care if I become eligible to be on The Biggest Loser. Either to-go, pick-up or delivery, this kind of pizza would have been my one-way ticket to heaven. Am I saying that this is the best pizza in NYC? Definitely not. Am I disappointed? Not really. Was it the most uncomforable way of having your pizza - served on two flimsy paper plates sitting on what cound have been the hardest bench next to a garbage can? Absofuckinglutely. As we're about to finish our pizza, we heard the server next door who was handing out free dessert samples on the sidewalk  shouting at one sweaty and panting jogger who must have just done 5miles ""Hey there, have some free samples! You deserve it!"" A two-for-one New York City classic. And just like that, I'm in love with this city all over again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I started off with the Mushroom Cigars, and it comes with 2 cigars and some greens on top. It was good, though it had an interesting taste that I'm not familiar with. My appetizer was the Tuscan Chicken (chicken stuffed with spinach&ricotta with a sauce on top), which came with chive mashed potatoes and mixed greens. It was very good, and I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for chicken. My boyfriend got the Steak Frites, which come with Rosemary Fries and mixed greens. Steak came out as it should have been cooked. What I must absolutely recommend is the Rosemary Fries, and it is definitely something everyone should get when eating there. They're cooked to a delicious crisp, and you do get the hint of rosemary. The mixed greens are good as well because they come with this house balsamic vinaigrette that I loved (if only I knew the recipe to it!). Some warnings: This restaurant is very small, so don't go with a party of more than 6... Even 6 sounds like too much. It is cozy, but it's not a place to eat with a large group of people. Also, they only accept cash.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"if you like fatty meats, you will LOVE this place. had heard so much about it, and was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype. but it was worth the 30 min subway ride (has anybody told new yorkers that NYC is a logistical nightmare?? BECAUSE IT IS) and braving the cold windy rain storm.  i started with the pork buns. tons of fat on that meat. just the right amount of hoisin sauce. i should have asked for some sirracha though. that would have topped it off.  then i had the braised brisket with thai noodles. i dont know how they get (again fatty) meat to be both tender and crispy while in this yummy vinegar-y soup broth but they did. my only complaint/plea is that the bowls were poorly suited for the noodle soup. the way it was shaped made it very difficult to get my soup spoon in there to scoop out the super tasty broth to slurp. momo - please consider a wider-mouthed bowl.  yes, it is totally overpriced but also totally delicious.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The reason why (I gather) the manager stayed near to the restaurant while talking to the dismissed employee, was so that witnesses were present if the disgruntled former employee did something stupid, which would have led to the cops being called.

"I've been here 4 times with different people for dinner and everyone I've taken there has thoroughly enjoyed it. Pretty good quality food, though a touch over-priced. I am a little concerned with a few of their dishes. I don't trust non-Korean places to make a good bibimbap and I'm suspicious of any place that randomly places it on a mostly American menu. But so far, I've had great experiences. Just stick to the American fare. -Crawfish Hush Puppies-delicious, though a little salty -Broiled Chicken-amazingly moist! -Roasted Cod-perfectly cooked -Roasted Chicken Salad-chicken is a little bland but a very simple salad...just not really worth $17 -French fries-nice and thin and generous portion -Goat Cheese Ravioli-disappointing. Tasted more like cheese ravioli with goat cheese crumbled on top -Baked whole wheat penne- full of flavor and hard to tell it's whole wheat pasta! I've had the bread pudding w/ caramel ice cream. We demolished it. Ice cream was so good! On a previous visit I had the dessert with the red velvet cake based on the waitresses recommendation. It was worst red velvet cake I've ever eaten. So I don't recommend that. The mixed drinks are so-so. I like the ambiance but it's a tad bit loud. It gets crowded during the weekend. Yes, the bathrooms are great but who comes to eat at a restaurant for the nice bathrooms...?

This place is pretty cozy and cute.  Not much of a wait for dinner and definitely a 15 min wait after 12:30 pm on weekends.   The staff has been friendly and attentive.  Personally I think you pay too much money for the waffles and they sort of look thin and hard (never ordered them).  But what is to die for is the Brioche french toast.  Fresh fruit comes on the side and ask them to hold the strawberry sauce.  Replace this with maple syrup (they charge you extra) and you have a tastiest french toast ever.   They have an extensive Belgian beer list and their half price beer nights are awesome.  I have yet to go during their mussels night.  Hamburger I had for dinner was quite tasty and perfectly cooked.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Would prefer to give this 4.5 stars! I came here last saturday night and had a great experience. Waited at the bar (a small, crowded area) for our table and was able to choose from so many different 1/2 bottles of sparkling wine and regular wine... all very affordable. The wait for 2 people on a saturday night (they don't take reservations for small parties) wasn't long, just long enough to enjoy the prosecco though. We were seated at a table, basically next to another couple at a table for 4. It was the only negative of the evening, but the couple was friendly so it wasn't too awkward! My bf and i shared the pasta of the night, spaghetti bolognese, for a starter. It was delish! I was expecting standard meat sauce, but it was more like pulled beef which was a nice suprise. He got the lamb shank for main course and it was as big as my head. I had the strip steak (comes w/ fries and salad on the plate). It was good, but next time i'll go w/ the hangar steak, which the waiter recommended.  We didn't have dessert but they look amazing (we almost reached across the table to get someone else's leftover!) Also, want to note that I have a food allergy and the waiter was very reassuring that he would check everything that was put on my plate for me. I usually don't encournter this level of service, so I highly recommend this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I guess the owner does not care about his business or the customers that make his business succeed.  This sounds like another greedy owner who just forgot about customer service that is why the restaurant received a C rating.

"I don't even know where to begin. Lets start with the decor which is the first thing you see when you enter. Stunning. Exquisite in every sense of the word. The service was spot on, we had a VERY nice waitress, who was happy to help offer suggestions based on what my boyfriend and i were considering ordering. So then the food came. We started with the spinach artichoke dip that blew our minds. The Pita was warm and perfect. Not too thick, not too thin, not too doughy, not too crisp. Small issue was our burgers were fired a -little- bit too soon, as they came out juuust before we were officially done with our app, but not enough of a bother to deter a star from me. The burgers. I had the Jean something burger with the pears on it? Yes. That's right. A burger with PEAR. AAAAMAAAAZIIIIINGG!!!!!!!! My mouth exploded. My brain melted. (Note: I love nothing more than trying new food combinations. for example, i tried a sesame chicken salad the other day with BLUEBERRIES in it and fell in love) The pear was -ever- so slightly detectable. The french fries (all made fresh there, i am told) were PHENOMENAL. My favorite kind-- the super thin ones. (My boyfriend also enjoyed his burger very very much) Then we decided we had to try the dessert. He got the apple pie; again, small complaint: we both wished the waitress had told us it's a serving for two people. I've been able to finish a ""huge"" dessert. But this went above and beyond. (at least it was scrumptious!) And III had the cheesecake. This cheesecake. My dear god. It was just spectacular. It was so good because it tasted like no other cheesecake I've ever had. This is what cheesecake is supposed to taste like. I was seconds away from running into the kitchen and hugging the chefs. No, I'm not kidding. I had to show some restraint. So yeah.

It was 4:30pm and everyone here was trying hard to think over the ridiculous mix. I suggested politely to the bartender if she could ""please turn down the music or switch to something a bit milder? I love your coffee and want to come back again"" but the bartender just gave me a ""I'll try (not too hard) because we don't have any other music"" look. 20 minutes later, she must have turned the music up because I swear I already had already adjusted my tolerance level (since she never turned the music down). ANNOYED. My friend and I up and left... ended up at the sweet Ange Noir Cafe instead. YAY! I CAN THINK AGAIN. Did someone say this place had good ass vibes? Yes. Good ""ass vibes"" indeed.

Whence you have people visiting, you must brunch and thus...you invite your friends that are vegan and vegetarian (this helps to narrow down who to invite). Even then, we had a group of six with a wait of 1 hour at 1030am. We walked down the street for some coffee and checked in around the 40-45 min mark. Their wait time estimations are pretty on the mark. The place is small and makes you think 80's vinyl diner with a counter and vinyl booths.

"I have been to this restaurant several times now and have spent a good deal of $ here. Food is good but what really distinguishes them is their bread. This last time we went here with another couple.  The waiter brought over one loaf of bread, which if you have never been here, its about 8"" round and needs to be torn with your hands.  Touching other peoples food, or having them touch yours can be a bit uncomfortable and down right gross for most people, so we asked for another loaf.  The waiter did bring out another loaf, but this one was not warm and was clearly not fresh.  Really, we dropped $60 per couple and they couldn't even give us an extra loaf of fresh bread? With all the great restaurants in this city they can keep their bread, we won't be returning back anytime soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The restaurant is tiny and they don't take reservations, but the place is surprisingly not well-known, so be prepared to wait only 15-30 mins for a table on a busy night. Luckily there is usually space around the bar where you can drink before getting seated. The decor is delightfully bizarre: lots of weird knickknacks hanging from the ceiling and posters cover the walls. And the best part- they play 80s music and show the music videos on the TVs on the wall. As for the fare, the tacos are unbelievably good and use authentic ingredients, and the margaritas are fantastic. On top of that the service is very fast and the prices are cheap.

"As a connoisseur of all things comfort food, and their ilk, I say this place stands up to the most comforting of foods. First, I it starts with 3 stars for the fact they serve breakfast all day. A lot of places need to jump on this bandwagon, because sometimes the breaksfasts/brunch menus are still what the crowds want at the end of the day. The food is superb. We had a variety: Shrimp and Grits, Breakfast bowl, the fried chicken with brown gravy, chicken tenders. Also the deepfried devil eggs. We tried to cover the entire menu. They do give to you ton of food. Some of the best creamed spinach I've ever had. The place is tiny, so expect a wait. But there are lulls where you can zip in and get a table. We were told 20 minutes, but were seated in the next 10. Also the have Mixed Drink Milkshakes- this deserves a second visit.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Best Mexican food in NYC. Yes, I mean it! Extremely authentic cuisine from Puebla. Not your typical boring Rosa Mexicana menu. This is the REAL DEAL.

"BEST CHICKEN FINGERS IVE EVER HAD!  My sister and I were walking by and saw sticky fingers and decided to check it out.  The place is super clean and the staff is really nice and will explain the menu to you.  The owner happened to be there and was so friendly and introduced himself.  We told him his concept was GENIUS.  We ordered regular chicken fingers and an order of the naked vampire killer(not fried but equally delish) with a side salad.  The fried chicken batter is the best ever, not too thick not too flaky, moist perfectly crunchy and just right.  The aioli and ranch dipping sauce was amaze.  The naked vampire killer was grilled chicken with garlic super flavorful moist and perfect for my low carb kick mixed all up with my side salad.  I cannot wait to come back and try the whole menu, especially the bada bing(chicken parm fingers) and the salted caramel pretzel OMG.  If you are in the mood for chicken, this is the joint.  Best for pick up, delivery or a super casual quick bite.  Totally recommend this to EVERYONE","[1.0, 0.0]"

Pegai fresh pasta ""filled"" with chestnut: it was not filled at all...misleading. I guess there was chestnut in the pasta dough, but we never tasted it; also: small portion. Polenta con mascarpone n sausage: delicious (huge portion). Duck: tender, good portion, medium rare but not bloody, side went well with it; the sweetness of the cherries n sauce complemented well the saltiness of the meat crust. Lamb: OMG. A huge portion: 3 thick pieces w spicy bell pepper slices on top. Never seen anything this big. Tender and flavorful. Delicious. Dessert: chocolate hazelnut cake, delicious n not too heavy tasting. Wine: rosso di Montefalco... which was truly great. Michael White wasn't cooking, but his chef di cucina must be good, bc Michael was eating beside us with some friends of his. He is the owner and executive chef, but somebody else cooks on a regular basis. I can't wait to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"OMG yuummmmmm! Recently I feel like chicken and rice has become a huge thing. When I finally tried chicken and rice at this 53rd and 6th halal cart I understood why. For $6 you get a heaping plate of food that includes rice, chicken or lamb, pita bread and lettuce. What really makes the dish is the sauce! Sauce sauce sauce! Make sure you are generous with the white sauce. If you like some spice add the red sauce, but be very careful because a little goes a long way. I don't live in NY so when I get chicken and rice cravings I go crazy... There's usually always a long line no matter what time of day you go, but it moves pretty fast so just be patient and wait.

"4.5 Stars There's no other restaurants that's like this in NYC.  Pure unadulterated seafood (crawfish, clams, crabs, shrimp, mussels) simply boiled, and with your choice of sauce.  If you like spicy, I'd recommend getting spicy (rather than fire) because it is already pretty hot, and you should save your taste buds so that you can enjoy your meal.  Brown paper on the tabletops reminds me of summers of  blue crabs, steamers, and lobsters. We tried the soft shell crab appetizer, followed by crab, shrimp, clams, and crawfish with spicy house sauce (a combination of old bay, lemon pepper, and garlic butter).  I enjoyed the fries that came with the appetizer, it's a welcomed variety (texture) in an evening filled with spicy, buttery seafood.  My favorites were the large, juicy shrimps, and the fresh, meaty dungeness crab.  It's great they give you plastic gloves to eat with so that you are not stuck with seafood bits under your nails days after the meal.  The sauce is finger lickin' good, maybe it's not such a bad thing to still have remnants of crawfish lingering on your hands... The staff was nice and attentive without being overbearing -- I used many pairs of gloves throughout the night - my fingernails keep going through them.  They also tie the bib on for you to prepare you for the food to come.  Bonus points for serving Abita beer.  I'll be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

This is their ""original tonkotsu soup noodle with their special sauce, pork belly chashu, cabbage, kikurage, scallions, miso paste & fragrant garlic oil."" The broth was wonderful - smooth and savory. A well balanced broth, with the miso and the garlic oil working in harmony. And how can you go wrong with pork belly. I'm mean come on...It's perfect. Their Shoyu ramen was also well done. Other ramen, however, such as the Karaka Miso Ramen (spicy ramen) missed the mark. So was it worth the wait? Yes, for one time only, and the wait was only made bearable by a pre-dinner snack. Cool place, but a bit over-rated. 3.5 stars","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ordered the chefs special pre fixed meal which consisted of 10 tapa dishes and 2 deserts for $50 pp before tip and tax . The dishes are all for sharing. Only 2-3 bites per person per dish. So the dishes were quite small. Since it was a holiday they had the special holiday menu which had a Chinese twist. And I think that's where it threw me off. Yes the food was amazing .. But it really wasn't worth that price .  Bill came out to be about $70 pp after tip and tax .. And yes it was good... But with Chinese food , you can get amazingggggg Chinese food for a fraction of the price. For example.. One of the dishes were gyozas, walnut chicken, sweet and sour soup . So... Those dishes didn't wow us. But their other dishes were really good.. Like their pork belly, short rib, sashimi over peanut soba noodle. As for their drink menu, the cocktails and beers are not your typical drinks. They are very different. We got the 'rude pig' cocktail and 'pumpkin maitai' but they tasted kinda weird. The rude pig was very smoky with salt and bacon bits on the rim. The pumpkin maitai had a gingery taste.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Even though I live like 10 minutes away from the Arepa Lady in Jackson Heights, and my former co-worker was raving about her for a week, I had never made my way there for an arepa. Didn't even know what arepas were until I did a Google search. But I finally had my first arepa at El Cocotero and it was awesome. My friend had suggested that I get two arepas because I would be hungry after one. I went against conventional wisdom and ordered an empanada and the pernil arepa. The empanada was good. Who doesn't like fried dough stuffed with pork and fried bananas?  Now for the arepa. Mmm... it was delicious. The exterior of the arepa was nice and crispy. I wish I had gotten another arepa. As for the other fun stuff, we ordered a pitcher of their house drink (of the night?). It was made from rum, mango and papaya juice, and probably something else. I wasn't a big fan of it. I don't like mango and papaya, though. And since I was still hungry after the empanada and arepa, I ordered the flan. If you've read my previous reviews, you know I'm not big on sweets. But the flan here was pretty good. I ended up eating most of it because I made the mistake of not ordering that second arepa. I gotta go to the Arepa Lady and get my arepa fix now.","[1.0, 0.0]"

First thought - this is just like Buca Di Beppo!  I was immediately ready to be disappointed. To my surprise, I really enjoyed the dinner.  The Veal Parmigiana was surprisingly succulent and not overcooked.  I even ordered something I never do; spaghetti with meatballs.  Damn Carmine's... even the world's most basic pasta dish was spot on.  We started with the mixed green salad which had a nice vinaigrette dressing.   If you come here in a small group or just want to try one more pasta, you can order half orders, but just on the pastas.  One appetizer, one full size entree and one half order of pasta will easily feed 4 adults. Drinks are overpriced, but it's Manhattan.  Service was very good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My girlfriend took me here one evening when I was in a terrible mood from work. The waitress was relatively accommodating and nice given that I was on the phone the whole time stressed out and did her best to serve us given we were probably one of the last tables for the evening and the kitchen was closing. The food was great but I don't think it was necessarily worth all of the hype. Atmosphere is perfect for a romantic evening and service was decent. I think they also have a pretty extensive drink selection that can make for nice get together with friends. Food: 1. First, the complimentary bread was amazing. There were different kinds of breads in the basket and even one that had bacon(?) embedded within the roll. In addition, they provide three kinds of condiments with the bread: butter, olive oil, and a type of tomato and meat sauce in the middle. The bread and condiments both taste extremely fresh. 2. For a starter, we ordered the Stracciatella which is roasted autumn root vegetables with truffle vinaigrette. It was something both of us had never tasted before, but was quite pleasant with a rich creamy flavor. 3. My girlfriend ordered the Spaghetti which comes with tomato and basil. Many have proclaimed this the best Spaghetti in Manhattan? I wasn't that impressed to be honest; it was balanced, but the noodles in my opinion were a little bit too thick, didn't have an al dente feel, and also the dish was somewhat lukewarm by the time it reached our table. Perhaps it was a bad run, and I'll have to get a second take, but I don't know what the hype is about their spaghetti. 4. I ordered the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. The mixing of both crispy texture on the top and thick, rich flavors within the agnolotti was quite interesting. I definitely enjoyed this dish. Similarly though, the dish came across a little lukewarm when I started on it, and I wonder if it might have been because we were one of the last tables of the evening. Regardless though, I still enjoyed the rich smokey flavors of the meat inside coupled with the al dente agnolotti exterior and the touch of crisp garlic chips on top. Unique dish that I would recommend! All in all, a great dining experience, but perhaps not lived up to the hype as proclaimed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"For all its hype and fame, Gramercy Tavern is like someone with Old Money - -classy, relaxed, gracious with a ""been-there, done-that"" attitude in a very self-effacing, secure way.  Not snobby or pretentious, with a warm, friendly staff, easy-going bartenders and some really great chow and shockingly reasonable prices, I see Gramercy Tavern as a place where you could comfortably come alone and feel right at home.   Later in the evening, there was a ""wait"" for a seat at the bar, but that's only because our group was hogging up like 1/2 the place (sorry, people waiting).  One guy seemed to be visibly annoyed that one of us was in what he considered ""his"" seat.  Clearly, a regular who sees Gramercy Tavern as an extention of his own home, and I can see from being there just one night how you could easily get that feeling. My husband and I had an assorted cheees plate, which had a very thoughtful and interesting cheese selection and a pork shoulder soup/stew something-er-other which had a mega-tender pork shoulder bathing in a fragrant and fantastic broth, happily cavorting with a some of the most unsung heros of the winter vegetable world (sweet potato, brussel spouts, leeks).

"upstate bar is famous bar which is placed near new york. We can't say enough good things about this place. upstate bar is mostly run by the owner at night. upstate has made its level better due to serving the people in better way. their staff is co_operating. the environment was neat and clean.oyster bar in the worst way, and Upstate throws down like Amar'e with two hands. This one hits me right in the heart too. I went to college upstate (Ithaca), and to find a bar that proudly serves Ithaca Caskzilla and Saranac on tap is a beautiful, beautiful thing. Everything served and sourced by Upstate is locally produced: cheese from Valley Shepard Creamery in New Jersey, meat and (incredible) pasta from Russo's Mozzarella and Pasta on 11th street,Southhampton Beer, Wölffer wines - as long as it's independent, small, and locally crafted, they can get on board with it. There's no big name restaurateur at Upstate (it's actually the same guys who used to run Shaffer City), nor will you find gimmicks, a press release, or even a freezer for that matter. The simple menu is small and ever-changing, depending on what's fresh and available. There are always oysters - usually over a dozen options from both the East and West coasts. Other staples include beer steamed mussels, scallops, and a ridiculous fettuccine with clams. Every menu item costs less than twenty bucks, and literally every single thing we've tried has been delicious. For a true seafood lover, this is heaven.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm sorry, but I really don't get what the big deal is with this place. A couple of my friends love it, plus there's always a line out the door. I try not to review any place until I've tried it at least twice. Well I have, and I'm not impressed. The first time I came here, I had the Yasai Soba (mixed veggies and mushrooms) and shared some veggie appetizers. It was ok, not a bad meal, but not worth waiting in line for in the cramped waiting space. The second time, I had one of their specials that day, which was a soba with ""grilled"" mushrooms in a dashi broth. What I got was just a bowl of noodles in soup with some mushrooms thrown on top, clearly not grilled as far as I could tell. And the broth was not particularly special. The various veggie appetizers while fresh, were not worth the price for their small portions. Maybe it's just a cultural thing, since I've got a big fat American appetite. Or perhaps it's because I haven't tried any of their meat items, but a vegetarian friend swears by this place. So I guess it's just me. I guess I just don't get it. I'm just not willing to spend $15 on an unremarkable bowl of noodles.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Why is this place sooo overrated?  It definitely does not deserve five stars.  All these yelpers giving the restaurant five stars apparently works for the restaurant or has some connections.  (Please take a look at Warren F. pictures, they look like they were taken by a professional).  I've ordered the wonton noodles, their wonton was firm and packed with pork instead of shrimp.  Their beef tripes were FATTY and you were definitely get a heart attack from eating too much of these.  If not a heart attack, it will clog you arteries.  $6.75 for beef tripes, you might as well get your beef tripes from a dim sum restaurant with a larger portion.  One star goes to good customer service other than that, I will never go back to this place again even with a 50% discount.  The only place that I wanted to try was their fried fish skin and they don't even have that at 12:30pm (lunch).  Please don't put items on the menu if they are not available.  Try Noodletown instead for their awesome wonton mein.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Long long ago I realized Subways was not the sandwich shop for me and I began my quest for the ultimate sub. I finally found it in this tiny hole in the wall place that shares its space with a ghetto jewelry store. Vietnamese sandwiches are unique because they blend European bread with Asian flavors to create a perfect harmony. Each sandwich is made to order and you can request that certain ingredients be left out. Personally I can't stand the taste of cilantro so I make sure to annunciate it very well in Chinese but you can also ask exceptions in English.

I provided the delivery address and name of the person who ordered, but they were unable to find the order. They asked me to find the order number and call them back. How nice. 1:54 I called them back to give the order number, was put on hold for several minutes, and then told that the delivery guy just went out with our food. This was TWO HOURS AFTER WE ORDERED THE FOOD. The woman on the phone said that he had a few other stops to make first, so it would still be a while until we got our food. Something is wrong with this picture. Maybe treat your customers a little nicer next time and send the delivery guy straight to the place that has been waiting over 2 hours to eat lunch. DO NOT ORDER from Mooncake in Soho unless you're okay with a 2-3 hour wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hands down the best sushi that I have ever had.  Fish was incredibly fresh and sushi was perfectly seasoned.   Tried a variety of salmons,  tunas and whitefish which were all subtlety amazing.   By far favorite was sea urchin which had incredibly complex flavors.  Just don't dip you sushi in soy sauce unless instructed or pickup sushi improperly (chopsticks should be parallel to sushi) otherwise you will be corrected.  Very ""no soup for you""!  Highly recommend!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Where to begin... The service was on point! She was so sweet and explained the menu and mentioned the $45 chefs choice which we chose to do and it did not disappoint. We got to try so many wonderful dishes and each thing was better than the next. One of our friends is a pescatarian and they accommodated her along with our dishes which was great because she didn't feel left out and we didn't feel like we missed anything. The bone marrow and short rib tacos were so good! Make sure you try one of their housemade agua frescas.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wife & I were in NYC for a couple of days and were lucky enough to be taken here by some friends who are regulars.  We easily understand why.  Smallish menu (7 apps, 7 entrees, a couple of sides), but everything our table for 6 ordered, and I mean everything, thrilled the recipient (except the chocolate cake, which some didn't love).  I had an heirloom tomato salad and a steak.  Wife had the tomato salad too and swordfish.  She's still raving about the flavors 24 hours later.   Definitely go - it's not the fanciest, and certainly you can have prettier food, but flavorwise, it's a damn fine restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Lombardi's is advertised as ""America's First Pizzeria."" Some people say it's ""NY's First Pizzeria."" I personally don't know if either of those are true, but it doesn't matter. Because the pizza here is delicious. The Brick oven pizza at Lombardi's is crispy, cheesy, and just plain awesome. This restaurant's existence is the ONLY reason why I ever go down to NoLita. Lombardi's is pretty big, they even have space in the basement to seat people. The only bad thing about sitting in the basement is that it gets ridiculously hot down there. They also have good wines, and beer on tap. Overall, this place is cool, and wouldn't you like to tell people that you've been to ""America's First Pizzeria""? You can decide for yourself whether that is actually true, or whether you care. =)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a review of Carlo's tasting menu - full thoughts in my blog with highlights below. Starting with a bit of back story, I'll admit I would be lying if I claimed to have discovered Roberta's on my own - the blog whispers had become a hum even prior to my February visit to the Big Apple and the moment I heard I would be returning to New York in March I made contact about the restaurant-within-a-restaurant experience from Chef Carlo Mirarchi.  Pleasant and prompt my first e-mail was handled by Cherie Burnett and the ""rules"" were explained - 3-4 people, arrive by 5:30, and $140-$160 per person - simple enough, I'd say.  With a date agreed upon I'd never hear from Cherie again - from this point forth it would instead be a back and forth string of e-mails between myself, my co-diners, and Chef Mirarchi himself discussing likes, dislikes, and so forth - an impressive display of customer service on par with past experiences with restaurants garnering three stars from Michelin. Course 3:  The first of many breathtaking courses of the evening - on the surface somewhat surf n' turf, but far more subtle and complex.  Centered by a perfectly seared (IE caramelized outside, raw within) Diver Scallop caught and shucked that very day, the sweet bivalve was balanced with a shaving of headcheese - gamey, unctuous, and fatty.  With the duo tasty on its own, the true beauty of the dish was in the details - specifically a slice of red onion and fresh squeezed tangerine juice that lent an acidic and sweet levity to the whole plate and acted to meld the two proteins into a stellar bite. Course 4:  presented by Carlo as his favorite of the night - he even took time to show us a picture of the fish pre-filet on his Iphone.  Presented as Sea Perch with Ramps, Yuzu, and Firefly Squid the fish itself was mild and buttery with intensely crispy scales that particularly thrilled my co-diner who'd noted just the night before that he loved crispy skin on his fishes.  Paired with beautiful early season ramps, tiny squid with plenty of bounce, and sweet lemon tones the dish was fish done right - the sort of thing you'd expect to emerge from the kitchen of Le Bernardin, or given the crisp skin perhaps Guy Savoy. Course 5:  Still wobbly and extremely creamy, Poached Duck Egg with Morels, Dill, and Bread Crumbs was all one could desire from an egg dish and given the accoutrements a perfect entry to spring.  Served with the whites barely set and creamy yolk pouring forth with minimal pressure from the fork I loved earthy fiber of the morels, the crunch of the bread crumbs, and the faint accent of the dill - again, no special tricks, just an exemplary preparation of quality ingredients. Our tenth course of the evening was an encore to the seventh - the rest of the Squab, feet and all - served with Mascarpone, Gooseberry and Sorrel.  Crispy skin, rosy flesh, a thin ribbon of fat - the squab breast was perfect and the legs surprisingly meaty.  To be fair I honestly don't remember the rest of the dish all that well - probably because I was too busy eating the leg by hand, something I'm rather certain I've never done during a ""tasting menu"" before but felt entirely justified (and comfortable) doing at Roberta's. Course 12:  Presented first in its raw state at the beginning of the meal, then whole-cooked, and finally plated, the 80-Day Dry Aged Wagyu with Fingerling Potatoes, Sweetbreads, and Ramps was nothing short of a revelation.  Ignoring the potatoes, sweetbreads, and ramps - all things I love and all prepared exquisitely - the Wagyu itself was hardly ""beefy,"" the flavor instead somewhere between butter, mushrooms, and nuts while the texture was literally melt-in-the-mouth - the sort of meat that could be cut as easily with the edge of a fork as with a knife, and a portion so generous that my dining partners took a good 6 ounces home.  In a word, it was perfect - the sort of dish I will remember for a long time to come not only because it was delicious, but because it challenged and changed a long held belief.   Sitting and sipping our coffee while chatting with our server and later with Carlo I was perhaps at my happiest - full of great food and drinking coffee with friends while listening to Led Zeppelin in the presence of a gracious host - a moment, much like the meal, that I won't soon forget.  With the bill settled - a veritable bargain at $160 per person - and Carlo walking us to the door it was a quick trip via Subway back to Manhattan with much chatter about the wonderful experience just passed - an experience I can't wait to revisit on my next trip to New York and an experience I would suggest anyone who values great food and great people check out for themselves before the ""secret"" that is Carlo Mirarchi and Roberta's is out and reservations become unattainable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had dinner last night with a few foodie friends and we shared several dishes which were all absolutely beautifully prepared, (ART on a plate) and mouthwatering!   1.  BBQ Pork Buns:  They were extremely tender and juicy, with just enough sauce. 2.  Salmon Belly Tartare:  The combination of ingredients made us curious and we loved this so much, we ordered another one.  It was creative and just divine. 3.  Seafood & Chips:  This actually had chunks of lobster and while I was with a refined group, we all kept using our fingers because it was just that good! 4.  Crispy Chicken & Waffles:  Incredibly scrumptious combination of food.  The Waffles were so fresh and moist, while the chicken was perfectly seasoned and crispy.  We didn't even use much syrup because we did not want to cover the flavor of the chicken (another dish we are having at brunch tomorrow). 5.  Shrimp & Grits:  My Southern friend said between the Chicken & Waffles and this dish, someone must have a Southern Momma because these were both the best he had ever had.  I had never tried grits before but loved this dish so much, we are going back for brunch tomorrow!   Overall, extensive and creative menu.  Beautifully prepared and plated.  Will try to save room for desert next time. We went back for Brunch and had the Shrimp & Grits, Chicken & Waffles and added the Bleecker Omelet.   Everything was just as good as we remember and the Omelet was so fluffy without a trace of color except the yellow of the eggs.  Impressive!   The bartender was just adorable and very attentive without being intrusive.  Brunch drinks were fantastic.  All too often, bartenders add too much juice/mixer or too much alcohol.

"Nine years ago, I was brought here by a friend at about 2 AM.  As we all know, decisions can be a struggle past a certain time of night, or in life all together.  With the chalkboard menu, there's no wasting time. Depending on my hunger rumbles, I could go a few different ways.  For first timers, it's either the Works Burger, or the feeling of pathetic burger hating shame. Guys, remember in high school when you turned down a girl, then the girl returns after summer break all sexy hot?  I will be that girl, or instead I will be a guy eating a burger with crunchy, mouth watering bacon, smiling right at you with disgust.  What I'm pleading is; don't pass on this piece of meat. The marinated chicken sandwich always satisfies, but the worry remains - do I want chicken burps for the next three hours?  Definitely not, if this is the first stop of the night. Last sandwich choice is the comforting grilled cheese and bacon.  The sandwich your mom never told you about as a kid.  To this day, my girlfriend and my mom always try to slip in the tomato.  No thank you, just cheese, grease, and a Mt. Everest pile of bacon. Don't' forget about the paper plate of fries.  I get it, they suck.  People write, ""they're not as good as McDonald's.""  Who cares?  All I'm concerned about is not sharing.  Get your own two dollar plate of fries.  Rarely is it acceptable to eat fries with a fork.  Don't mess with me when I'm in the zone. They have a full bar, but the only choices I know are light and dark.   McSorley's that is.  For $2.50 a mug. Why do I come back?  In nine years nothing has changed a bit.  There's always a line, but it moves fast.  Same bussers, same bartenders.  Tourists are occasionally present, but not noticeably present.  I love sitting in every spot.  I like going alone, with my date, or in a small group.  I love kicking a couple back, while watching the cook, flip 20 burgers at a time.  It's dark and even if it's the 30th visit and Miles Davis ""Kind of Blue"" comes on the jukebox one more time, it never gets old and I always feel like a part of New York City.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Go to Pinto. Now. And get the Pad Thai. Seriously, it's reason enough to check out this cool little spot. But there are other reasons too. On a Thursday night, we had no trouble getting seated at a table for four. I loved the interior - it was dark, modern, and very cozy. The servers weren't rude, but they weren't exactly friendly either. To be honest, they barely ever said a word to us. Either they were super snobby or super shy - I have trouble distinguishing between the two because I'm neither. But who really cares about the service anyway when you've got amazing Pad Thai? Of the four of us, two ordered the Pad Thai, and they were definitely the favorite dishes of the night. But everything we ordered really was delicious. Oh, and did I mention my dish was $10? $10!!! If I were to give any constructive feedback to Pinto, it would be to pay better attention to their serving times. The Mister and I just ordered entrees, but our dining partners (Rachel P & Jon R) ordered an appetizer plus entrees. They brought out our two entrees at the same time as our friends' appetizer. Then, our friends had to wait at least 20 more minutes for their entrees as the Mister and I just sat there twiddling our thumbs.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Definitely sit at the bar facing the kitchen if you can, as you can watch EVERYTHING, it's pretty awesome.

Also, at night time, the lights are so bright inside that it's difficult to see the outside. Note: BYOB! No cork fee!

"I've really enjoyed Kefi before.  So, it was an option I offered my visiting cousin and his girlfriend for a dinner gathering on their trip to NYC.  And they chose it.  I made a reservation for a Wednesday night at 6:15 pm, the closest that I could get to 7:00 pm on Thanksgiving Eve, mere blocks away from the balloon inflation site a couple of blocks down.  I requested a quiet spot out or something that was hopefully not the most traffic-laden area, since I know it can get crowded. I'm certainly glad that I arrived early.   I would have hated for my guests to have had to experience the rude service I found upon arrival.  They offered to seat me as I waited for my party and I accepted.  So, I followed the hostess downstairs and through the first room on the lower level just inside the door to the second, tremendously loud (filled with screaming children) room, to a table in the middle of the floor, only inches past the doorway.  I pointed to a corner table back in the other room and asked if we might sit there since it wasn't right in the middle and much calmer.  She said ""sure,"" but our path was intercepted by a rude, male employee who was otherwise standing around doing nothing, interjecting that it was for a reservation.  He pointed to another table right next to another party whose child was crawling all over the booth (where I would sit) and said that those were my only two options, despite my polite reminder that I too had a reservation.  He also openly argued with me about the noise level of the back room (It is much, much louder).  I tired of his tremendous rudeness and the waitress who erroneously agreed to the more inviting table and finally just sat next to the climbing toddler (at which point, the guy went back to doing nothing). The others in my party arrived and we had a lovely time.  The service wasn't awful, but it was either pushed (coming too soon before we'd had a chance to peruse the menu) or evasive, with us trying desperately to catch the waiter's eye to order dessert or get our check. My Branzino was good, but not as spectacular as I'd remembered (and with fewer potatoes and olives).  Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs (grilled sea bass for one and the sheep's milk dumplings with spicy sausage for the other...though I've had that dish in the past before too and something was lacking this time).  They enjoyed their mixed drinks and I had a predictable wine.  Dessert (the mouse with halva) was OK (though I would have picked the walnut cake which has been amazing in the past), as was my cappuccino. The meal was good...not amazing.  And the rudeness I experienced at the beginning just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Perhaps it was a bad night.  I hope that such isn't the new Kefi experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Gluten has gotten quite a bad rap in this day and age, at what may be the apex of ingredient scrutiny and hysteria, so I appreciate the bold gesture involved in naming a business located in this particular enclave of BoBo Brooklyn after a much-maligned but Great Grain. Since's the name's the grain, I'll start by reviewing the sourdough base of the gourmet pizza served at this spare neighborhood gem. While others have compared all elements of Wheated's 'za to Paulie Gee's, I would argue that the sourdough gives Wheated's equally fresh crust an extra kick: ""It seems like we are always looking for something more flavorful in pizza crusts and breadsticks. One answer to this search is sourdough. Sourdough has been in use much longer than yeast as we know it today. We know that some type of sourdough was used by ancient Egyptians to produce a type of flat bread more than 3,000 years ago, when sours were the only known means to leaven breads before yeast was propagated. When we think of a sourdough, we normally think of the flavor of a San Francisco sourdough bread, but the truth is, all sourdoughs do not produce a sour or tangy flavor. Some sourdoughs are more bland; in fact, the Italian bread, pannetone, has been made from a type of sourdough."" --Lehman, Pizza Today pizzatoday.com/departmen… The ingredients that top this unique crust are fresh, as products of both the market and of the mind. Some, such as the Sunset Park, topped with a subtle tomato sauce, hot sopressata, fresh and aged mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano and the accompaniment of Mike's Hot Honey™, bear resemblance to and find their equivalent in certain of Paulie Gee's pies (in this case Gee's Dellboy/Hellboy). Others, however, especially the Vinegar Hill, a sauceless white pie with fresh and aged mozzarella, pungent gorgonzola, white potato, thyme, and the unique topping of grape must syrup are ingenious. This particular pizza was both a revelation and a game-changer. The cocktails here are on par with some of the best in more popular Brooklyn neighborhoods as well as Manhattan, but at more affordable price points, especially with the late-running happy hour, and the bar is proving  to be a destination in itself. Also not to be overlooked are the homemade sodas, particularly the white cola and fresh ginger and lime soda. Service is very friendly and personalized, and the space is sleek. I hope that Wheated becomes part of a revival of this stretch of Church Avenue.","[1.0, 0.0]"

MENU: $6 Chicken over rice, Gyro over rice, Combo over rice $6 Falafel over rice $4 Sandwich Each time I ordered the chicken and gyro (lamb) over rice.  The dish is amazingly delicious!!  A generous amount of tender chicken and lamb is placed over rice with pita bread and lettuce.  It's a large portion and unless you eat a lot, one order is good enough to split.  Make sure to pour on tons on white sauce but use the red sauce sparingly (a dollop is good enough for most people).  The red sauce is extremely spicy and it's a spice that lingers.

"Went on a weekday at about 1pm and only had to wait about 30 minutes. Loved everything about this place. Atmosphere is no frills, and yet very charming. The place was packed but our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Their fresh squeezed juices (orange and grapefruit) were just what the doctor ordered after a late night. I had the pancakes and my husband had the eggs benny. Both were scrumptious.... but the real star of the meal was the sugar cured bacon. We spent a significant amount of time discussing ways to recreate it. At one point I actually contemplated another order to go (with a side of the maple butter for dipping?) but decided that was crossing the line. I would love to visit this place again next time I am in NYC and check out their lunch and dinner offerings. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and the cocktails looked good too. I just noticed that they have a burger with the sugar cured bacon ON it. Whoa. Bottom line is, this sort of quality is hard to find. I would say this place lives up to the hype.

The decor is also very nice, with a nice bar. Check out the bird cage lamps!  A welcome addition to the Brooklyn -- and New York -- dining scene.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Finally I made it to the famous Frankie's, after talking about it for about two years!  Did it live up to the rep?  Maybe--the experience was great, from waiting for our table in the leafy side garden to getting a stellar table right by a window, with a great view of both the backyard and the kitchen action.  The service was fantastic--although they seemed really busy, our waitress was very committed to making sure we had a great experience.  We ordered Frankie's Greens, which is a simple salad with roasted vegetables and was fantastic.  I'd definitely get that again.  We also got Frankie's antipasto which was maybe a mistake; not because it wasn't delicious, but because it was an enormous amount of meats and cheese for two people to finish, even if we weren't also getting pasta (which we were).  I regret not getting the sausage polenta, but went with the sausage cavetelli with browned butter.  I was torn between that and the braised lamb papperdelle and about two second after starting my cavetelli i had major order regret, since i found it to be pretty dry and bland other than the sausage.  Luckily my boyfriend knows me well and had ordered the papardelle so I could taste it too.  He was okay with swapping, so I ended up finishing his dinner.  Needless to say I ate enough meat at Frankie's to last a month, but I would definitely return--just maybe skip the pasta for the other things they have.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We actually stumbled on this gem by looking on yelp.  I can not say enough positive things about this place.  Had we discovered it at the beginning of our trip we may have eaten all of our meals there.   The staff was on top of everything.  I had read a few reviews saying that you will never run out of water and it's true.  It was almost like the guy that was refilling the water glasses was on a mission that he could not fail.  Every time I took a sip he topped me off. I had also read another review that said to try the olives.  I didn't see olives on the menu and didn't order anything with olives so I almost didn't ask for any.  If you are a fan of olives, ask for a side of them.  They are some of the best olives I have ever had. I ate everything on my plate and then some.  I had the meal with mozzarella and egg plant and my boyfriend ate the chicken and sausage meal.  If we weren't adults (and it was socially acceptable) we totally would have picked up our plates and licked them... and even so I am amazed that we didn't actually do that. If you are in the area and looking for an inexpensive, delicious meal (that will change the way you look at Olive Garden forever), this place is mandatory.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Trust me, I wanted to love you Grimaldi's. I read all the reviews, people recommended me to you, but you disappointed me. The first day that we came, my gf's and I didn't know that there was a 30 person wait- we left The next day, we waited in the scorching hot sun for 45 mins and I would say that it was not worth the wait. Cons of our visit: -It must have been a fire regulation to cram 5 girls into a small table. there was hardly any elbow room. -Waiter was not too attentive. His dry personality seemed like he was doing us a favor by waiting on us. -Avoid the sun dried tomatoes and olives- they are too salty! -CASH ONLY. Boo.. please join the rest of us in the 21st century and accept plastic! -Warm beer- disgusting! Hopefully next time that I will be in NY, I'll be visiting the famous DiFara's.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Came here on a Saturday and again on a Wednesday.  On Sat it was buzzing with full house of ppl and some standing. But staff was friendly and we only waited for 10 min.  (No problem on Tues) Beats appetizer was very good and plenty to share. Sausage sampler was good but pork belly was mostly fat. Wiener schnitzel was large and light but not the best in town (sorry!).  Service could be spotty - slow on a busy night or too fast that main course comes together with appetizer. But quality of food and friendliness are consistent. And I liked that the ambiance and ppl who eat there seem civilized even on a very busy night.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"To be honest, I was quite disappointed. Maybe because of all the good reviews, I anticipated a lot, only to be disappointed. I made reservations for 2 on a Sunday night, and they were really nice calling me twice to confirm and everything and even emailed me their current menu. Actually that night was full, but it was not packed. So we had the strawberry glazed ribs, nothing to awe about, the meat inside had no taste at all and it was a bit dry. Then we had the pork belly, which was nothing spectacular either, it only taste good because it was pork belly but without the fat, it tasted like dry meat once again. The lobster risotto was the only thing I believed that was on point, but I believe the cheese did its job. Then the shrimp... honestly it taste a bit like sweet and sour shrimp from a Chinese restaurant to me. I brought my friend there thinking to show her my good taste, I only did the opposite, I really do not understand the hype over this restaurant. For the price I pay is ok, but to go all the way to Williamsburg just for this, never again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Stopped in on a Thursday, the wife was boycotting so I was solo with the 2 kids, host was nice and friendly from the start. I asked if there was a spot to watch the game, they had a table near a large party in the back which would have been fine had I gotten there first but I figured the group was hanging out after work and I didn't want to keep saying ""earmuffs"" so we just sat in the dining room. There was a group opn the patio, another group next to us, the place was busy enough. Our server, nice guy, can't remember his name, did a good job, didn't wait long for the greet, beer was cold, pizza took about 20 minutes.

"best food ever that chicken and lamb is delicious and also that white sauce is grrrreat sercet to not waiting.(how to make connections with the express taxi cab line; you don't have to be a cab driver to get quick food) the line is really long, but who cares have never have to wait. people if you bring 30-40 people with you at 4 a.m. after partying all night and order food for all the ppl; the ppl running the cart will hook you up and it will bring a ton of benefits in the future. i am not a cab driver and i dont ever wait in the line. the ppl running the cart will never forget your  face. thats the secret so gather 30-40 of your closest friends and bring all their on the same night and order for all of them. they also reduce the price, by charging only $5 dollars for a mix or chicken over rice. and the biggest benefit of all never have to wait in line again","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Bubby's SUCKS! We got there at 11 A.M. on a Sunday. The wait was 45 minutes, which is to be expected at a place where all the hot spotters go. No biggie. But once we were seated and ordered it took another 45 minutes for the food to come out. During this 45 minutes the waitress did not come to our table once. No ""the food will be out shortly"" or ""do you need anything?"" Nothing. We finished our meal, which was okay but nothing special, without sight of the waitress. The staff here is horrible. The food is blah and overpriced. And they try to kill you on the drinks. $8 for a draft beer? Give a break. Of course, once we finally were able to track the waitress down to get the bill she was quick and tried to turn into the sweetest thing in pursuit of her tip. Fail. $0 tip.Terrible service.

"I just joined Yelp becasue a friend of mine read me a great review about this café.  So I went with a friend earlier in the week.  We were both hospitalized with food poisoning.  I couldn't wait to come to this website to see the reviews only to realize that Yelp has censored most of the negative reviews.  So I am here to write a review and I truly hope Yelp will review their policy to censor negative reviews. I was excited to go to a restaurant in the west West Village since there are few in a reasonalbe price range which are good.  The restaurant is beautiful physically as is the entire building.  But the attitude of the manager was incomprehensible--nervous, snappy and even rude to the wait staff.  Then in turn the wait staff was haughty--our server treated us as if we weren't ""good enough"" to be in the bistro.  We  asked for water with no ice and she rolled her eyes and came back pressuring us to order immediately when we had only been there for a few minutes, my friend and I talking, catching up.  So I got the chicken couscous and my friend the cous-cous.  The cous-cous was extremely dry and even hard in places.  My chicken was cold in the middle!  I asked the waitress to take it back to recook... more of the eye-rolling... Long story short, my friend shared his couscous with me and I shared my chicken with him and hours later both of us were in the ER.  We had no other meals before or after together and have reported this incident to 311.  In short, don't go to Cafe Gitane if you appreciate good service, good food, and ... uh, liviing.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went here for my sister's birthday on Saturday night. Place is smallll (used to be a Chinese restaurant) but luckily we snagged the last table. They don't start serving dinner until 5:30 so we snacked on fresh guacamole and handmade chips (they give you free refills on chips- we asked for like 3 more baskets) and drinks. I ordered a grapefruit margarita and my sister had a mojito. Both weren't good- the mojito wasn't made right and my margarita was way too strong for my taste. So minus 1 star for the drinks. The food, however...oh the food, the food, the food. It was delicious! I had enchiladas de mole and I was served 2 big enchiladas stuffed with chicken covered in mole goodness with a side of delicious black beans. I was only able to finish half of my food. A nice plus is they put your leftovers in those expensive plastic containers I love so much- the ones you can re-use over and over. My dad and boyfriend both ordered the steak and for $15 you could not beat the quality or the portion size. They enjoyed theirs- I've never seen BF eat a steak so fast in my life! My mother had the camarones borrachos and loved it. There was a lot of food on her plate for just $10. Sister ordered the tacos appetizer as her main course and didn't have much to say about it- they were just tacos. We didn't order dessert as we had a delicious cake waiting at home ;-)  I'd definitely return here again!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Been there a couple of times since they opened. Ideally more frequently but I do not wait more than 30 min at any restaurants. The best time to get a seat there quickly is 1-2pm on weekdays. If I cannot get a seat  there, I usually satisfy my urge to slurp a ramen at alternatives in the city - Kambi (my favorite), Minca, Setagaya (spicy miso ONLY), Lai lai ken, Naruto, Terakawa, Totto (superb esp aburi pork chushao), Menchanko Tei (spicy chanko ramen), Riki (miso, 45th), Santouka (everything is good here @ NJ Mitsuwa - try miso ramen w/rice topped w/scallion and grilled diced pork), Batten Ramen (NJ - ok level), Asahi (NJ - BIG portion spicy seafood ramen is best) Hide-chan (East Village) etc. Hope Ippudo will eventually open more joints in Gotham and in non-NY States - hear screaming voices from west coasters here Plus pork buns are available at Zaiya in midtown too, All said, Ippudo is THE best so far.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I'm a noodle lover and the udon was lovely to chew on. The one thing I didn't like was that the manager (not the nice waiter) immediately gave us the check after he saw our bowls were empty and asked us to leave right after we paid our check. I'd understand if there was a line out the door, BUT THERE WAS NO LINE OUT THE DOOR. We were NOT even there that long! I'm a fast eater and I would appreciate a few minutes to digest, thank you very much. I don't even know if they serve dessert because the manager never even ASKED us if we wanted any. The restaurant is lucky the food was amazing because I'd come back for the KATSU CURRY UDON W/ PORK again, but that manager better not repeat what he did.

"Cafe Habana was a fun surprise for my trip to NYC.  We were looking for a place to eat near the New Museum of Contemporary Art and my boyfriend suddenly remembered a nice Cuban restaurant he has eaten at four years ago.  There was still a line outside when we arrived around 9 on a Thursday night, but we were giddy to be in the city and felt like we had nothing but time to spare and wait.   Tip: Just because you put your name down on that little pad of paper in the waitress' hand, it doesn't mean she will remember you.  It helps to remind her you are still there.  Be aggressive or you might be completely forgotten. We squeezed in between busy tables and ordered the roasted corn (of course!  Everyone is eating them and I am salivating by now).  Also a shredded pork dish and a jicama and mango salad.  The corn was delicious!  Right amount of creamy, spicy taste.  The pork was good and came in large quantities.  Salad dressing was a bit too creamy and stale for me, but I liked the fresh jicama a lot.  It tasted almost kinda sweet. Price is very reasonable for a NY meal, about $30 for the corn, salad, main dish and two drinks.   And we got to enjoy eavesdropping on fellow diners' juicy conversations: the all girls table discussing who is dating who and who is using who, the double date where the guy couldn't wait until the girl is gone to the bathroom to tell the other couple that he is proposing soon and that NYE will just be a great engagement party, and the hipsters trio bonding over who was a mathlete in high school.  It was great.   Service is fun and attentive.  I kept on wondering if the Israeli girl with thick bangs and 80's heavily shoulder-padded jacket was wearing anything under her jacket.  She had stockings but where was the skirt/pants/shorts/any bottom?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friend had been following TDR's progress over several weeks, and after many a sarcastic remark regarding its actual opening date, I finally spied the soft open on Friday. With Storm Nemo blowing into town, we secured an early release and came to check out this Irish-colored, vintage-minded dispensary of spirits and victuals. At the door we were greeted by a friendly chap who informed us that the cocktail lounge (The Parlor) was upstairs, while the ground level offered a more informal bar stool experience (The Taproom). We parked by the bar, which filled up healthily shortly after 5 pm, when it opened (and will continue to open late till sometime this week). The friendly, opening-mode bartenders took turns offering us samples of grog (nice) and other concoctions, while a beer rep served everyone to a round of Pilsner Urquell. Cheers! More interesting was the Founder Porter, which was on tap; one of about a dozen well-chosen selections. The fact that this place has affiliations with Swift as well as Ulysses came as no surprise. We celebrated with some fine rare-vintage Jamesons, courtesy of my Irish Whiskey-loving friend. Unfortunately the well-appointed pub was not serving food just yet, so we turned the corner to Fraunces Tavern for some overpriced dinner fare. Upon our return we headed upstairs to check out the bar's claim to fame: mixology. Sketches of great Americans and mood lighting painted a pretty nice, cozy scene in the Parlor. But you want to come here for the drinks. My Julep a la Thomas was amazing (Old Forester 100-proof Bourbon, Marie Brizard Parfait Amour, Pernod Absinthe, eau de thé, fresh mint) and the waitress-recommended General Harrison (Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Christian Drouin Cidre Bouché, egg batter, fresh cream, Demerara sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, allspice) was cloying and decadent. It's a thick egg-nog full of tasty booze, so moderate your intake. Toward the end of the night I dozed off watching the snow falling over FiDi outside. This is not out of norm for me, and the bar staff were predictably miffed, my friends reporting that the waitress' charm definitely dwindled from that point on. Oh, well, I am who I am. Just as we headed for a quiet conclusion to the evening, a Danny DeVito sighting at the table by the bathroom quickly lifted our drunken spirits. Of course, one of my buddies couldn't stop himself from offering Danny a drink (which the man politely declined), but he did manage a pic with him downstairs when we ran into him on the way out (photo-bombed by yours truly). Apparently, Brooke Shields was also in the house for the soft open. If it's good enough for DeVito, it's good enough for you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to this restaurant with 5 other people this past Saturday.  When we arrived the hostess took my cell phone number and said the wait would be an hour.  We waited an hour and I went back to the hostess to see how much longer and she responded rudely with ""its only been 8 minutes past an hour."" So my party and I waited some more.  We had multiple drinks, were so hungry that we ordered appetizers from the bar and ate them in our laps while waiting.  When the wait reached two hours we went back to the hostess and her response was ""oh you weren't seated yet?""  This was laughable considering the fact that she had my cell number and I did not receive one call that the table was ready. At this point we decided two hours was way to long to wait and the fact that we STILL didn't have a table was absolutely ridiculous, so we left. What made the situation worse was the fact that the hostess did not seem to care if we were seated or not.  Unfortunately our first time was so bad that we have no interest in going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Kafana may cook the best meat I have ever had. Its a bold statement, but meat as tender and tasty as what they serve here is seriously hard to come by. I made my second trip to Kafana recently due to my fond memories of my first dinner and was equally impressed and happy with the meal. For appetizers we had the spinach pie and the bread with the creamy cheese spread. The spinach pie was good, but the cheese spread thing was amazing. I could eat that every day for the rest of my life. For dinner I had the bean stew with short ribs, and my friends had the lamb chop and the chicken kebabs. The portions were hearty, and each entree was delicious. My short ribs were so good, the meat fell apart easily and the beans were creamy. The lamb chop was the most tender piece of meat I have ever tasted. literally, I didnt even have to chew it. (my friend who ordered the lamb chop is a little snobby when it comes to meat--I have never seen him actually compliment a meat dish at a restaurant--so I was shocked that he said this was also the best lamb he has had!) The chicken kebabs, also great. They come with a cabbage salad with a red wine vinaigrette which is light and goes well with the food. The whole bill came out to about $55. (three entrees and two appetizers) Unless there was some kind of mistake, this is seriously cheap! you could pay $55 alone for a lamb chop somewhere else and it probably wont be as good. Kafana is definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. It feels homey and they give you great Serbian comfort food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with the company and was able to try th pork ribs, brisket, BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, green salad, and seasonal veggies. Quick run down: Seasonal Veggies - just tasted like a usual side BBQ Chicken - tender & juicy on some parts, but after having a few pieces it was alright. Brisket - Felt like there was no more moisture, they weren't chewy but dry. Smothered it in BBQ sauce to make it better. Ribs - Their signature dish? They need to use better quality meat or just cook it better. Dry, so very dry. Sauce has a minimal flavoring it feels, not lending much to its taste. Ribs felt skimpy overall. Having tried their mainstays, I have to say it was pretty average for the overall experience & if I was footing the bill I might have been annoyed at the bang for buck.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Three cheers for Jungsik as it immediately joins the pantheon of NYC's very finest dining establishments! Jungsik is a knock out, home run! My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night and we were blown away. One of the best meals we've ever had. The service, the food, the presentation, the brilliant way the menu has been constructed, the ingenious and endless Amuse Bouches... it was a dining tour de force. We had the five course menu. Everything was delicious. The portion sizes were nice, more than just ""tastes"". The pacing was excellent. I've nearly fallen asleep trying to get through a multi-courser at Bouley or Daniel. But, at Jungsik, the pace moved along just right. Not hurried, but never lagging. (And, yes, Jungsik is in that league.) We had a waiter that deserves his own review, if not his own restaurant. He must have gone to English butler school or something. He was a hoot in a really good way. If you get him, you'll know exactly what and who I mean. We loved him! Only a few things you should know in advance...   - The tastes are very korean. Some times hot and spicy. Sometimes with tastes of sea weed, oysters, etc. Be ready for that. - The atmosphere is beautiful, but in a very understated, minimalist way. Think Perry Street, not Bouley. - The wine list by-the-glass is a bit lacking. We can't wait to go back! Bravo Jungsik!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place was awesome! Went with a friend yesterday for a late lunch, when I was craving a burger. And I loved the burger (dang it was good), loved the music, loved the atmosphere. Will definitely be going back, hopefully next time I'm in New York! I should also note that I'm normally pretty much a wimp when it comes to ""spicy,"" but their burger was just right. It wasn't spicy-hot at all. The fries are awesome too, very crispy.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I found this restaurant by accident on Cinco de Mayo and was so happy I did. Their signature drink - hibiscus margarita - was great. I can definitely see having too many of those! The guacamole was also very good. I was warned that the spicy dishes were very spicy but they were still good - the favors really blended. It was also very reasonable. Definitely worth the trip to Avenue B!,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"If I had it yesterday.... and I'm interested in eating it again right now...does that vouch for it's tastiness? Probably. I've had Vietnamese sandos a couple times before but these were some of the better ones.  Differently, they were on toasted bread rather than on crusty baguette.  Meat selections are pretty typical but include a few more options like white chicken mean or dark chicken meat.   The inside is pretty sparse but whatever it's not Starbucks you're in and out quickly.  Or just grab n go that sucker.  Didn't try the bubble tea but almost everyone was ordering it which must mean something.   The one thing I didn't love was that the vegetables were a bit less pickled than I've had in the past providing that necessary contrast to the salty meat. At 5.75 it's not the least expensive bahn mi I've had but it was filling and tasty so the price is right.  Will definitely re-visit.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Two 8 Two is exactly what this part of Brooklyn needs and deserves. We don't need another boutique or baby shop or pet shop (no thanks, PetsMart, even though I have a dog) or 'artisinal' whatever shop. We need a burger and beer shop! And we have a stellar one now! The burgers are excellent, all of them that I've tried, and all cooked to perfection (you don't have to specify 'medium', 'medium-rare', etc., and there's a beauty to that). So are the hot dogs. So are the nachos, fries (not so much the Greek fries, mind you) and onion rings. Great beer selection and brilliant cocktails/spirits/mixed drinks. I would suggest sitting and ordering at the bar, though, as the table service can be inconsistent (save the most dedicated and conscientious bus service). Also, no pickles, hello? Plus, if you do the maths, you save a few bucks by ordering the basic burger and adding toppings a la carte instead of splashing out on the 'Pub Burger', which is delicious nevertheless. Finally, yes, decor. It feels a bit too much like a place that's just opened after having ordered all its furniture and decor from a restaurant-supply catalogue. I second the other reviewer's note: where's the character and charm? You get it from the staff behind the bar (and the stellar busperson) and the food itself, but it could use some more local, aesthetic flavor. In all, I'm Two Hundred and 82 time sold on Two 8 Two!","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was definitely a case of judging too soon! I'm not big on bar food or whatever and the menu wasn't really anything I was craving, but then the waitress listed off the specials and I fell in love at first word. Sweet Potato and coconut soup with diced almonds! That is like hearing the angels coming down from heaven. (I love anything that has tropical and unique flavors that can't easily be found at other eateries.) And my bf being the ultimate manly man loves his burgers. He ordered the burger simply titled ""Hamburger"" and loved it! He said it was juicy and perfectly cooked to his liking. We also ordered 2 sides of their roasted potatoes.

I only do that because I dont like too much juice/blood and stuff dripping out while I eat. Im sloppy enough as it is. The burger was anything but Junior. Unfortunately it was so juicy that the buns became so saturated that they were gross. I could barely fit the whole thing in my mouth. But it had a great flavor. i decided to lose the bun, and do it protein style. I had been by Juniors so many times and never gone in, so I was glad that I did.

When i got there, the line was really long - extending outside of the restaurant but when I finally got in to place my order, the lady that works there was really nice and quickly took everyone's order. I think it took about 30 mins to get my pizza. Its $5 for a super thin slice of pizza (and its not even the size of a regular ny style pizza, its slightly smaller) and $30 for a pie. I'm not sure if its REALLY worth $5 for a slice but its def really good pizza! I will def go back to try it again. they use fresh basil and the ingredients are just magnificent.

"So this was my first and last time I think I will be patroning this establishment. I attended with friends for a friends birthday dinner, when we walked in the establishment we practically sat ourselves before someone said  welcome. The decor of the establishment looked slightly different based on the ONE website picture posted. However since my friend had been there a number of times and swore by the place had great atmosphere, food  & service since I love food I said I would try it out. For a Saturday evening I thought the place wasn't as crowded as expected. We were then seated and handed menus after some time of looking over the menu we decided what we would have for appetizers which we had the calamari, and the jerk wings. The calamari and dipping sauce was great however the jerk wings were not even close to spicey and slightly burnt. We all ordered the rum punch but when we asked the server what kind of rum was in the drinks they were clueless. The drinks were good A +. I decided to order the Creole B.B.Q Jumbo Shrimp, and my friends had the catfish one blackned the other fried. My shrimp were not jumbo they may have been extra large but definetly not jumbo and I really did not taste the creole spice in the sauce at all. I tasted my friends catfish which actually tasted good however I don't ge the cocktail sauce topping at all. The server came over once to ask us how things were didn't ask if we wanted more drinks once our glasses were empty. Needless to say I was very disappointed. Cheryl needs to come back and pay her establishment some much needed Attention. I could so see this place on Resturant Impossible. Even the restrooms were not up to par for a 4 to 5 star establishment it reminded me of a club restroom.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After my second time eating at this place, I can steadfastly assert that it is (without a doubt), the best tapas in the city. How can I be so sure? My co-founders over at my startup are all Spaniards, from Barcelona, Madrid, and Catalonia, respectively, and all agree. I think that should cover that. The 10-course tasting is independent of the menu, but whatever you order, any human being would be lucky to sit within 2 feet of the grill and plating areas. The combinations have always been creative and surprising, and I more than once unabashedly scraped my plate to get every bit of the deliciousness. While these are billed as ""tapas"", more often than not, the portions were perfect for the 5 or 10 tastings (highly recommended!) and even generous for some plates, like the mouth-watering sweetbreads over chantrelles and a tomatillo corn salsa w/ fried okra. Degustation was upscale in its food and service, while remaining low-pressure in ambience. The best part of the more recent meal was being told that the chef had ""received a giant squid from California [that day]"" and then see Chef Genovart come over with his iPhone and show us a picture of the comically large squid - and then get to taste it in its exquisite glory - okay I didn't, but the braver of us (Cabo...) did. Alex (our hilarious CTO), was lost in texting when the beast arrived, and looked up just in time to see a tentacle whipping towards his face, as we slapped him out of sheer food-happiness and a little bit of drunkeness. No matter! This place is wonderful. In the past, I have called (less expensive) tapas from other restaurants ""overpriced"", however degustation could not be more worth it, despite the somewhat sizable bill that always seems to come back to us.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Omg everyone was right about this place. The prices are very affordable which is surprising considering the quality and quantity of the food. Im new to Indian food, so I wasn't too sure what to order. I went on their site which is very simple and easy to read. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with house salad and garlic naan. It was life-changing. I loved every minute of it. I started eating with a fork but by the end I was using my hands, because the food is that great. The basmati rice was cooked to perfection and fluffy. The sauce was creamy well season and delicately spiced. The chicken was tender and scrumptious. And I ordered delivery!!! I'm so pleasantly surprised. This food will make you savor every moment!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What great Indian food! A doses to me was a little like a crepe filled with spicy potatoes and veggies. But that description doesn't make it sound special, and it is!

All vegan, so splurge on an extra appetizer like the drumstick, because even though it's fried, it's still somewhat healthy and so good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Having heard great stuff about the place, I was definitely eager to join my friends for a Bar-B-Que feast. Now I do not drink alcohol or eat pork, so the place was a bit limiting for me personally.  However, one cannot deny the amount of food for the price is more than generous and from the look on my friends, the alcohol variety here is second to none. The menu has so much to offer that honestly I didn't even realize that there were burgers and sandwiches on the backside of the menu.  For this visit, I couldn't resist the calling of the 3 Jumbo BBQ Chicken Wings (Hottest Devil's Duel).  I was expecting them to be spicy as hell, but they weren't spicy to begin with and felt more like the devilish tease.  Aside from that, the wings were big, juicy and definitely flavorful.  For the entree, I chose the BBQ Catfish that was accompanied by mac and cheese and french fries.  I felt the fish was lost in the bbq sauce and was overwhelmed by it.  The mac and cheese was ok.  My friend were definitely happy with the skirt steak entree, Family Stylin BBQ, and the F.G.T.V. Overall, i feel the place has great customer service and gives a great atmosphere for friends looking for a good hangout and large food portions for a good price.  For me personally, my choices led me to a mediocre experience, which I cannot blame the venue for.  A must-try for the BBQ lovers out there...","[1.0, 0.0]"

Also the goma-tofu is excellent. Took a friend here and she spontaneously made some kind of orgasm noise when she tasted it. My favorite of the moment is the soba salad with crabmeat. It is a mix of buckwheat soba, mesclun greens, etc. that you dip into a wickedly pungent sesame dressing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A spontaneous trip to New York for Presidents' Day weekend + two easygoing girls with no set itinerary = a lot of time spent cooped up indoors. Also, being from California, I definitely could not bear the 18 degree weather and winds. I wanted to go back to the west coast my first night there (yes, I am a pansy, but you know what they say... best coast, west coast)! However, a trip to Ladurée made up for all the wasted time and arctic temperatures. I first heard of the double-decker macaron inventor/maker about four years ago, and knew that I HAD to pay a visit to the NY location, considering that there are no shops back home. Long story short: BEST MACARONS EVER. I have tried a variety of macarons back in CA (i.e. 'Lette, Chantal Guillon, Bottega Louie, Caffé Concerto, Satura Cakes, Cocola, etc.), but none of them compare to the original. I got a box of 18 ($57); one of each of the 12 permanent flavors, and six of the seasonal flavors. They were all wonderful EXCEPT for the morella cherry with almond... for some reason, it was reminiscent of an alcoholic beverage. And not an appetizing one at that. For those who are curious, the permanent flavors are vanilla, coffee, chocolate, pure origin dark chocolate from madagascar, pistachio, lemon, caramel with salted butter, liquorice, rose, orange blossom, raspberry, and violet blackcurrant. Seasonal flavors include red fruit, lemon with lemongrass, chestnut, praline, coconut, mint with anise, gingerbread, fig, green apple, chocolate with blackcurrant, and morello cherry with almond. My favorites were the green apple, rose, pistachio, and caramel with salted butter. All the macarons were superb in texture (crisp exterior, soft/chewy interior), with varying fillings (ganache or jam). Although the price is steep for such little sweets, macaron admirers will surely appreciate the beauty of Ladurée's confections. I mean, at $2.80+ per cookie, only perfection is expected! Since all 18 of my macarons are already gone, I'll be keeping my baby blue box as a souvenir. Until next time... Oh, and by the way, there is a big difference between a ""macaroon"" and a ""macaron."" Just like there is a big difference between ""your"" and ""you're.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
"As a New Yorker and a former waitress for Freeman's, this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to waste time to write a review.  After ordering three appetizers and three cocktails, we found ourselves still waiting for our initial orders after an hour.  When we asked what the status of our food was, we were received with some the most shameful ""customer service"" I have ever witnessed: instead of apologizing for the delay and letting us know our food was on the way and offering us a complimentary drink, the  owner actually screamed at our table in front of other customers, told us we were ""in his world"" and in a derogatory fashion told us he sensed a ""Long Island tension"" (nobody present was from LI, and I was embarrassed to even be told this with the purpose of being offended) .

"Song is the best Thai in the neighborhood, in my humble opinion. It's a total shame that dealing with Song can be such an exercise in frustration. For starters, if you want to order delivery have a back up plan. You'll need it. Why is their phone ALWAYS busy? You would think it was a little counter hole-in-the-wall place with the phone issues they have. You might get through quickly, or you may have to try 10 times. Totally ridiculous. But if you DO get through then settle in for some of the best Thai delivery in the neighborhood. Love their calamari salad, and the pak woon sen is a staple for me. We like the fried calamari, too, and appreciate the fact that when they deliver it they keep the packaging open a bit so your fried treats don't arrive soggy. It's a small thing but it shows they get it. We've also never eaten AT Song because the wait has always been so long, which is forgivable because the food and prices are good. However, not sure I'd want to eat IN the restaurant. Patio, yes, but it's so loud inside and frankly, I don't feel the need to shout across the table over inexpensive Thai food.

This place was also recommended to me by my Serbian coworker so I didn't hesitate to try it out when I found myself looking for a restaurant in the Lower East Side. Got there around 8pm on a wednesday night, it was a beautiful night out so people were sitting outside chatting and enjoying themselves.  We entered and were quickly seated.  We reviewed the menu before arriving so we decided on the Mix Grill for two, along with a Spinach Quiche and the special cream cheese spread.   We thought the mix grill was a good way to sample a bit of everything from the restaurant, but it turns out that some of the individual dishes were really good.  I shall go back next time to try the others, but as for the ones we did try, I though the mixed grill was okay, some of the pieces were a bit dry. The red pepper sauce that came with the bread was delicious, I couldn't get enough of it.  I laced it on all my meat.  The quiche was stuffed full of spinach that I felt like I got my serving of veggies for the day.   Seating was a little tight, but they make sue with what little space they have.  The waiter had a very strong accent, but I was able to make out what he was saying after some struggling over the noise level.  He was good about explaining the dishes so kudos to that.

"I love their pizza, I love it, but why do they play hard to get?   When you are craving a Neapolitan slice of the highest quality, and you know that you have to make a trip over to Artichoke, be prepared for the possibility of disappointment.  The hours are fickle, and when they are open for business, the lines are long and slow.  Of course, if the slices weren't so incredible, would we put up with the hassle involved?   There is something interesting and unusual about how they operate.  Maybe its the total disregard for efficiency and predictability.  For those of you who like predictability, calling ahead of time would take the guess work out of it but being a romantic, I prefer the great disappointment or triumph of an unannounced visit.","[0.0, 1.0]"

They were dry, smoked, very seasoned, with some sauce and pickled things on the side (four pickled veg to choose from). She wanted gooey, sweet sauce - just what I hate - and instead this was food for grown-ups. So good I can't tell you. The fries were fine and root beer(!) was perfect to go with.

Focaccia is usually a soft, pillowy specially seasoned bread that one sinks one's teeth into. Instead we were served a flat, partially burnt slab of thin bread that TASTED like focaccia but was hard and crunchy. Hmmm. 2. As the room filled up, we began to see that tables to both the right and left of us had been served while our order was nowhere in sight. FINALLY, the waiter came over and said something like, ""It will be just a few more minutes""... but didn't seem particularly apologetic about it.  After SEVERAL minutes, my daughter's pizza came but mine did not.  It took several MORE minutes before my order came out. Mind you, we ordered off of the menu, nothing particularly complicated or specially ordered. 3. The pizza had a nice flavor but the top was burnt just like the focaccia was. I ordered a spinach ricotta pizza which was a disaster. They had scattered some raw spinach leaves on the top which obviously got burned under the flames of their oven. All I smelled was burnt spinach when the pizza came and that's exactly what it tasted like. My daughter had a pizza with fresh cherry tomatoes on it; it was tasty but the sauce was drippy and the crust eventually became pretty soggy. 4. Other than a variety of wines, they serve soft drinks (from very SMALL bottles) but no iced tea. Hello?  There are people who don't care for carbonated beverages and it might be a bit early in the day for alcoholic beverages. Please think about adding iced tea or lemonade to the menu. I noticed that the pizza ordered by the woman at the next table was also burnt on top. It seems to me that Sotto's oven is either too hot or they are cooking the pizzas incorrectly. They are obviously way too close to the flame and should be moved downward by at least an inch, I'd say. The atmosphere is fairly cozy (although noisy, lots of hard surfaces) and well decorated but a hipster vibe is not nearly enough to make up for such shoddy service and lousy food. If you're going to charge $15 for a pizza, it ought to be GREAT.  Will not likely visit this restaurant again nor would I recommend it.  This is Brooklyn; there are tons of places in the borough that make better Neapolitan pizza for a lot less money.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My firend and I were walking around looking for a place to eat and decided to try it, looked like a cute interior and menu was good. It got super crowded after we arrived, but the salads were good and had a yummy lobster asparagus crepe. The dessert was also delicious, peanut butter chocoloate pot du creme with rasberries. We had two appetizers, two salads, and dessert and was $70. Not cheap but not super expensive. Good service too. I'd go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"based purely on the taste of their food, i give ruby's a 4. mind you, their burgers are not your ""typical"" burgers ... their burgers have a ""twist"" to it from your normal burgers . . . my bf tried their bronte burger and he thought it was a nice change ... something different and new but still tasty.  when you first bite into you, it has a slight sweet taste to it but some spiciness creeps its way in into your mouth as you continue to chew... i tried their spicy sausage pasta which was ... exquisite.  i loved the spice, the abundant amounts of sauce ... i highly highly recommend it to anyone that goes there.   i personally didnt try but they have various smoothies that looked real fresh and refreshing.  i would definitely want to try the next time i go!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Being from Europe it is difficult to find the food that you are used to. That is why we love eataly. The pasta, the bread, the meat, the cheese, it all tastes like home and somethings even better!

"After waiting a month for our reservation (Called at 9am on the dot a month in advance and the only times available were 5:30 or 9-no joke guys!) my boyfriend and i finally went last night. We had the meatball sliders-TO DIE FOR.  Honestly, they are small but JUICY and fabulous.  A tip-our server suggested we add on a 4th so that we could each have two and i declined it.  I would absolutely take her up on that if I were to go again! Boyfriend had the lamb shank-it was just ok.  The flavor was amazing (not gamey at all) but it was a little dry.  I had THE Pork Chop and it was fabulous, as many people have already said.  Total winner.  It was really big too so we ended up sharing it anyway. We ended up going with biegnets at the end, and they were also great.  Bottom line, this place absolutely lived up to the hype.  Tiny misstep in ordering the lamb but i am sure other menu items are show stoppers.  The ambiance is adorable. If you are lucky or diligent enough to score a reservation, go!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ive been here twice in my life, a couple years apart, and the price for dumplings hasn't changed. Quite impressive. A dollar! The dumplings here are always so fresh and tasty, and the sriracha sauce hits the spot. I like how the dumpling kind of falls apart halfway in your mouth and makes a big mess. Even though this place is grimy, you know if you didn't stumble upon here by accident, you were gonna disregard the filth anyway. Doesn't matter anyway, dumplings are handmade, go in the fryer or boiler and come out sparkly fresh!","[1.0, 0.0]"

There is always a great selection at the buffet, but I always tell people (because I've taken a ton of people to this place, I'm always recommending it!) to take it easy on the meats at the buffet - the back counter is where it's REALLY at! Chicken with bacon, top sirloin, pork sausage, chicken sausage, skirt steak, you really can't go wrong. Top it off with some farofa, guaraná soda and have a brigadeiro for dessert.

"Seriously ?! Ugh ! After reading all the good reviews , I decided to give this place a try. Obviously, Greenwich village hillbillies don't know what a true falafel tastes like !  3 bucks for HALF a falafel sandwich ! That's more evil than paying 20 for a slice of pizza.   The falafel itself was cracked and way tooooo crispy.  I felt as if I was eating chips. Instead of Israeli salad , they put lettuce in their pita bread !  This place is tiny and there is no place for you to turn or move once inside.  I am giving it one star because the pita bread was warm and sort of crispy too.   If you love falafels , go there , you""ll hate it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm not a ramen expert, but the ramen here was pretty darn good (also evident by the sheer amount of glowing reviews this place has gotten). The decor is unique and refreshingly different from other restaurants. Based on other reviews, the place was known to have a wait but we came early so we didn't have to wait long for a table. Some tables are shared communal style but they also have booths that are separated by clear glass which I thought was an interesting touch. We were seated at a communal table which consisted of a huge wooden cross section of a tree trunk which was very creative. Also, I guess it's part of the culture at this restaurant but as a waiter comes out of the kitchen with someone's order they will yell out the name of the ramen and then all the other waiters in the vicinity will repeat after them, pretty amusing. Overall the consistency of the ramen (slightly crunchy) and the broth were excellent. My only gripe was that my bowl of ramen w/pork came with about two pieces of pork.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"read disappointing reviews about this place but just HAD to try it because it's ""America's First Pizzeria"" thus, CAME IN WITH LOW EXPECTATIONS... which was good because Lombardi's is TOTALLY OVER-RATED you pay $3 per topping added & you can add to JUST HALF the pizza for $2! ----Half standard (jus mozarella, tomato sauce, pecorino romano & basil)/ ----Half w/ added pancetta the thin crust pizza is a bit thicker & tougher than i prefer... the ingredients didn't stand out in quality either... my favorite NYC pizza places are still Luzzo's & Pizza Gruppo NOTE: only waited less than 5 minutes for 2 ppl at 7pm on a friday BUT the wait was much longer once we left!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food got off to a good start with the warm rolls. The salad was standard - a good size, good taste, nothing terribly memorable. There was a minor service glitch when the wrong entrée came out, but the right one quickly arrived. The salmon was a little dry. The tables were much too close together - I felt like I knew the life stories of the people sitting next to us. The noise level got louder and louder as the night wore on - if you don't like noise, come here early. They have a lively bar scene, so that accounts for some of the noise spilling into the dining room. The prices are reasonable, so I would come back if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Contemporary NYC restaurant that is supposedly famous for its Mac n Cheese. I came in search of the mac holy grail and got a decent, but in my opinion overpriced (even by NYC standards). I had the bacon and gouda, which was tasty and rich, but for $10, I expected a little something more. I also had the sweet potato fries which turned out to be a revelation. They were surprisingly delicious and you got a healthy portion for the $5 price tag. The garlic aioli that came with it was phenomenal! They have a sadly limited beer selection and I was a little shocked that they don't do samples of their draft beers, so you better know your beer, have UnTappd or place your $8 bets and go in blind. My waiter was grossly unknowledgeable about their beer offerings. They had about 4 seasonals on draught (one of which was a Stella...which y'all, is not a ""seasonal""). When I asked what kind of beer the Bronx was the waiter told me ""that is the beer"", obviously not having any clue as to what the style of beer they were serving from Bronx brewery. I looked up the breweries offering on my beer app and found that I could't go wrong with whatever they might have, so I ordered that and asked if the waiter could ask the bartender what style the beer was ""as in IPA, Belgian, Amber etc"". He brings me out the beer and tells me he was told it was the Black IPA. I am somewhat of a beer geek and just by looking at the beer could tell it was not that. My palate sorted out that it was, in fact, the Bourbon Ale IPA, which was even better since that is one of my fav type of beers. On the plus side, for an $8 pint, it was in a nice, cold tall glass, so at least I got my hops worth. I really wanted to like this place, but there was nothing notable or even semi-memorable that would make me come back or even recommend this place. And, though I was sat promptly, their seating also leaves a lot to be desired. Their half booth set up puts the tables too close together to the point that I was literally trapped and had to disturb the couple next to me to scoot my table over enough to barely squeeze my JLO Badonkabooty through (I did so unsuccessfully as I almost knocked over my water glass) just to leave. You also get complimentary biscuits, but mine was brought as an afterthought halfway into my meal after the two other tables next to me got theirs when they were sat. I was also severely disappointed that their staff had no clue what beer they were serving me. So 3-stars for the Mac n Cheese, 4-stars for the fries and beer quality, 2-stars for seating and service and since comfort/service can make or break a meal, 2-stars overall it is.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After reading all the great reviews I decided to check this place out. What a disappointment. The food is just not that great..its not even good. Yes, the interior is fantastic, it has a great vibe, the service was ok. Visually, the food looks great. it is artistically presented fit for a magazine. But for me it when it came down to taste...it just doesn't cut it. I tried 5 different dishes and each one ranged from mediocre to disappointing. It seems to me the chefs are more concerned on presentation rather than taste. The mix of ingredients do not compliment each other. I found the produce to be lacking and not as fresh as one might expect for the price.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My first experience at Do or Dine was for my birthday, and it was magical. The atmosphere, the food, the service - everything was impeccable and other-worldly, partly due to the spinning disco ball, partly due to the irreverent yet knowledgeable and always friendly wait staff. I couldn't wait to take friends from out of town and to celebrate my anniversary there. Each experience turned out to be unique and memorable. That being said, my experience there last night was unacceptable. We were warned by the hostess to avoid ordering cocktails if we wanted our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. Ok, no problem, wine and beer it is, I understand what it's like to be backed up at a bar. After sitting down, we decided that rather than waiting for a table outside, we'd take advantage of the intimacy of the bar and order our food there. Terrible idea. The bartender, (who turns out, is one of the partners) was very clearly inundated by cocktail orders. Feeling empowered by the presence of a friend at the bar also waiting for a table outside, he was openly spewing vitriol: the kind one always senses occurs behind-the-scenes. Cursing left and right, this grown ass man was throwing a temper tantrum like a child. I understand you're stressed, but this is your job. A bartender's charisma defines the atmosphere of a restaurant. Our meal was ruined by the proximity to this bartender's rage that ran the gamut from the credit card function on iPad not working to heavy taxes on the restaurant. We were terrified of asking for napkins, for more drinks, for our check.  I didn't realize how important the quality of service was to one's dining experience. Living in Brooklyn, I feel like we are highly tolerant of a degree of irreverence and sass from servers -it's built into the nature of our restaurants. However, the level of discomfort I experienced last night was comparable to watching an abusive father berate his child on the subway. Never will I step into Do or Dine again, not even for the (A) Fish and Chips.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Their selection of coffees, teas and hot drinks is great. I love that they offer vegan and vegetarian options, as well as gluten free. Anyone deeming to find a new spot in Queens where you can sit with a great meal, feel cozy in a warm environment surrounded by hand carved wooden tables and decor, as well as bright smiles of owners who take pride in what they do, then definitely check out the Thirty Koala. I also learned their selection of craft beers will also meet the above mentioned standards. There's no place like this in Queens or NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Also, the apple cider with maple butter and rum was really delicious! I'm docking a star for the 1 1/2 hour wait in the freezing winter cold and because they only accept cash for payment. The poor couple on my left hand side had to dash outside to the ATM in the bitter cold because they do not take credit cards. Obviously, they expect you to be psychic because they don't put that they only take cash in any visible part of the Restaurant. Here's a tip: they call people on the waiting list over again so you can do something while you wait and come back. Even if they called you and you weren't present they will call your name again.

"My boyfriend and I have eaten at Sud a number of times and have always loved it. Simple traditional recipes, fresh ingredients and a romantic atmosphere at a great price. But we went back this week and everything was different -- new owner, new cook, new servers. Unfortunately, our meal was disappointing. To start, I like drinking sauvignon blanc in the summertime. There wasn't one on the wine list, so I asked our server for a comparable recommendation. He told me he didn't really drink white wine, so I ended up going with a montepulciano instead, which was fine, but a server should be knowledgeable enough to meet their customer's needs. For my entree, I order rigatoni with ricotta, eggplant and tomatoes upon our servers recommendation and assurance that everything was homemade and fresh. It tasted like box pasta in canned tomato paste, and there was no ricotta in my dish. My boyfriend had the lasagna, which we were told was made with a rich bechamel sauce and was substantial despite the small portion size (I don't know why a server would point out a potential negative while selling an item). It looked and tasted worse than a Stouffer's microwaveable meal. There was no bechamel. We also had the watermelon, feta and basil salad, and three of the crostinis as an appetizer. None were bad, but none were particularly remarkable either. Bottom line -- I could have made the same things at home and better for a fraction of the cost, or ordered chicken parm from a pizza place for $7 and been more satisfied. Sad to see a neighborhood favorite fall by the wayside.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Yes, they make their noodles from scratch and have a real dude pulling and thwacking noodles away in the kitchen. Yes, this is great if you're hungry and on a budget. BUT, if you are looking for a FAST meal or if you come in a large group, I advise you to go elsewhere! I've lived in Chinatown, I'm Chinese, I eat a lot of Chinese food and I've definitely had better hand pulled noodles before. I just went here with a group of friends on a Thursday night and it was really busy and crowded when we got there at around 6:30pm.  There was one poor lady that was servicing all the tables and I know she was stressed and probably running around like a headless chicken taking orders and catering to all the customers. Having been a waitress back in the day, I really do understand. But when most of the dishes are just noodle soups or pan-friend noodles, I don't understand why it took a good 15 minutes (the last of the 8 dishes ordered) for MY noodle soup to get to get me.  It didn't really seem like the dishes were coming out in a orderly fashion since I saw other customers who got seated after me, get their bowls of noodle soups before me! Not to mention, there were good 5-7 minute intervals for every two dishes that came to our table. Wah! Okay, having shared a few plates of their friend dumplings beforehand, I was able to wait it out and they did manage to accommodate our massive party of 8. All in all, it was time spent with friends, got some dinner in my tummy, and spent less than 7 bucks on dinner. Not bad as a recession special.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Quite simply: I love this restaurant. My friends and I frequent The Farm regularly, and we are consistently delighted with the food, atmosphere and service. Some of my favorites are the kale salad, french fries with curry mayo, whatever steak they're serving on any particular day, and the roast chicken. The brussels sprouts are pretty off the hook too. Additionally there are ALWAYS great beers on tap. Just tonight I had a black IPA which was out of this world. An extensive wine list. The servers are always friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and our food comes at a nice pace (note: if you are into super speedy service this place is not for you - I feel The Farm is more for people who want to enjoy the dining experience with good company and don't mind a relaxed pace).

We fell upon Lombardi's and are glad we did. Ricky on the bar made us very welcome and the local lager is worth trying. We returned for a pizza and ordered the large pizza and a salad to share. The pizza is enormous but very light and fresh with just the right amount of topping and sauce. Prices are reasonable and the bar area is exceptionally clean with a great selection of lagers and spirit's.

I'm really fond of this place! They have about 3 different atmospheres in one place (of course I love the outside garden area) it definitely makes you forget you're in a city for a while. The food is really fantastic! And not too pricey. The lasagna is my favorite because no one really makes lasagna like them! Fresh and delicious it is! La Laterna is not just for heavy delicious Italian food either! You can just enjoy the atmosphere with a cup of good coffee too and possibly a book. This is a great place for a relaxing feel! It's a very romantic place as well so bring your dates here because it'll wow them for sure :),"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I stopped in aroun 8:00 to get a glass of wine. Despite the numerous seats at the bar, I was told I could not sit there because I wasn't eating.... okay, but then I had to stand in the cramped aisle (there were seats but then I would be sitting in the aisle and have to get up, move my seat, move mysef, move the seat back and sit back down every time someone walked by). I ordered a glass of merlot and I have to say it was some of the worst tasting merlot I have had- I didn't finish it, mostly because the place was that cramped, I kept getting bumped into and the wine that poor. I think they need to redesign their area to accomodate those who go into a wine bar for wine, I mean really, a wine bar and you can't sit at the bar to have a glass of wine? I must have tipped enough (see other complaints on the rude wait staff) since no one complained to me about that.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I think it is great that a restaurant should emphasize local, regional fare on the menu.  Unfortunately, I also like good service. After a longer-than-expected wait, we were shown toward our table, then we got to stand around for a few more minutes while various staff bussed it in phases.  On a busy day, the staff at the average restaurant shows a bit of hustle, but at Rose Water everything seemed to take place with an ease of emotional detachment that might make the Buddha proud. Eventually we were allowed to sit, and order.  I asked if the eggs came with toast, because while this would seem obvious, I was beginning to have my doubts.  The waitress explained that some of the egg dishes came with toast and the one I was interested in came with some sort of home made bread.  At this point my blood sugar and patience had run low enough that instead of asking if the bread were served in the form of toast, I joined the rest of my party in ordering the pear crepes. Drinks were served, and then we waited, and waited, and after some exhausting amount of time the food was at last brought to our table.  Parts of my crepe were crunchy.  I don't know if that is a question of style or of sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The food was tasty enough but just didn't seem worth the higher-than-average price or the way-higher-than-average wait. This would have been a two-star review if at any point during the interminable wait for our food, and later, the bill, anyone had offered to refill my coffee.","[1.0, 0.0]"

": Awesomely fresh fish and the rice here is amaaazing. I haven't had rice cooked that perfectly in awhile. It's the perfect stickiness and temperature to match the fish. We got 4 rolls (friend oyster, tuna, salmon skin and scallion, and spicy scallop), a Chirashi disk, and the eggplant miso appetizer. The portions are adequate. You never feel full off sushi until you stop eating, but I was very satisfied with the food quality. My favorite was the shrimp and salmon from the chirashi. I am definitely going back to try the fried oyster and one of their hot dishes.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"came here in a group of 8 last week and we all really loved our dishes. we had a meat plate, a cheese plate and bruschetta..all were nothing too fabulous but still alright. My entree was really good, I got the  Strozzapreti Integral and it was caked on with cheese and was great and gooey! It was pretty plain but still good. My boyfriend got the Pappardelle al Ragu Di Vitello (veal in noodles) and he really liked it too, and he is VERY picky...verrrryyyyy picky.   The service was great and everybody was nice, the only down side is how loud it was. There were times that I couldnt hear a word anybody was saying due to how loud it was.  It was pouring rain outside the day we ate there and they sat us on a heated patio where we could hear the rain crash down on the tarp (not too loud) and it sounded wonderful and warm!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It took me forever to get a decent reservation at this restaurant. This place must be phenomenal for it to be that difficult to eat here. The restaurant is a nice, classy establishment. The service is extremely professional, and the food, while not phenomenal, is good. My lamb looked like it was severely undercooked. I usually get my steaks rare, but I didn't know if eating lamb this rare was safe. I ate it anyway, and it was moist, tender, and quite tasty. That was last night and I'm not sick yet, so yay! Overall a good experience, except at the end of our meal we felt really rushed. They wanted to herd us out quickly to make room for the next guests.

PS: When you order a ramen that comes with a heap of minced garlic in the middle (Karaka Miso Ramen for example), the waiters will recommend you to blend it into the soup. DON'T DO IT. Even if you like garlic, the heap is totally overpowering. Just take the whole lump out, otherwise you wouldn't be able to taste the complexity of the soup at all. HEED MY WARNINGS!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Nevertheless, I almost always dine out locally in support of the businesses that seem to be making their best effort.  Enter Walter's... What a breath of fresh air. The night my friend and I went it was totally packed and quite chilly outside. Everyone greeted us warmly--the restaurant owner was there and could not be a more humble and attentive host. We lingered by the bar as we waited for a  table--where I had the most delicious Tom Collins in my life! We opted to sit at the bar when space came up. The Bartenders were incredibly attentive through the whole dining experience. The food was AMAZING. We shared the brussel sprouts, roasted chicken and artichoke dip (and let me not forget to mention the deviled eggs we had as a pre-dinner nibble!). I am going back for more tonight as a matter a fact. SO GOOD. I have to admit. I was there for brunch and was not as floored though the service was just as warm & inviting.

All these happened in 1 hour. Yes I know I am a great lunch planner.(hell ya!) The place was real tiny with so many people inside. wow popular! Empanadas here are cheap. Prices are between $1.10 and $1.75. You have 28 different choices of empanadas. You can choose corn flour, white flour, or whole grain empanadas. I had 4 empanadas for today's lunch: Corn flour with ground beef & cheese, corn flour with shrimp, white flour with ground chicken, and the ""Nutella Chocolate Banana!"" Those were all great except the shrimp one; I expected more shrimp then mashed potato(?).. But they were all great! The nutella chocolate banana empanada is the guerilla; be careful of nutella popping out of empanada! just two complaints: 1. empanadas are small.(hm.. maybe that's why they are cheap.) 2. only one employee taking orders/answering calls/etc? hm. you should have one more employee!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"When you can feed a party of six in Manhattan for under $140 and everyone leaves sated, you have struck gold.   We ordered the Caesar, calamari, chicken scaloppini, and shrimp in red sauce over linguine.   Just a few notes: *The Caesar's greens were crisp and fresh but the dressing  was either (A) watered down due to residual water on the leaves or  (B) just a bland version of the classic.  Given the intense  flavors otherwise available here, I go with explanation A.  Highly recommend requesting additional dressing on the side. *The calamari was outstanding.   Lightly breaded and quickly fried so you never felt that you were eating something unhealthful.   The marinara for dipping was perfect. Rich tomato-y flavor infused with basil.   *The chicken scaloppini included just wilted baby spinach leaves.   It's amazing how a bit of lemon, stock and butter can take a humble, often-maligned  green and make it crave-able by kids.   So divine!  As she ate, my sister was deconstructing the recipe so she could duplicate it at home.   BTW, the chicken paillards were fork tender. The shrimp in red sauce was perfect.   The jumbo shrimp were in a light summery sauce with tomato chunks and copious amounts of garlic.   If you don't like garlic, this is not a dish for you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I like this place. The value is great - good portion size, friendly service, simple yet inexpensive wine list, and homey cooking. (Even waiting for a table at the bar next door was nice!) Throughout dinner, I kept exclaiming that we had to return. The experience was really fun and warm. Everyone looked like they were having a good time, and we felt so well taken care of. I think that at the end of the night, I would've given it four stars. After sobering up, I realized that the food was actually more mediocre than I wanted to admit during dinner. I say this not b/c it was bad or b/c I don't want to recommend it. I just want to temper your expectations a little. Some of these reviews are so glowing - I think going there w/reasonable expectations about the food will ensure a more positive experience. You go for the entire experience - not just for the food. Our two starters - fried artichokes and the grilled radicchio were disappointing: the artichokes were a little acrid, and the radicchio was bland. My pasta w/crumbled sausage was also so-so (but then again, I should've known better - I'm not a sausage fan). My husband had the seafood pasta, which was really very, very good. I'd go back for that! What made all of these dishes still acceptable though were the prices. My so-so pasta was $9.50. For that amount, I don't mind experimenting and (re)discovering that I don't really like sausage. Bianca is a nice little neighborhood spot. It reminds me of places like Supper. I think the latter has better food though. And for just a few dollars more, I'd go to another neighborhood spot - in the UES - to Vespa for much better tasting food if I were more focused on the food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Balaboosta is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've been to in NYC. Simply a delight to find a place that does Mediterranean food well with an atmosphere to match. The Vibe: A candlelight cabin in the wilderness that is Nolita. While it does feel a little cramped and you can listen in on your neighbors, it is still comfortable, relaxing, and intimate. Be sure to come here on a date! The Food: We ordered the Crispy Cauliflower and Hummus Mortar and Pestle as appetizers, followed by the Grilled Lamb Chops and Grilled Whole Dorade. Skipped the alcohol for the evening and had Limonana. I've eaten a lot of hummus in my life and I will remember Balaboosta hummus for a long time to come. This is the stuff of legends. All the other food was really good too, the lamb chops being perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection (I wish I could have picked them up and savored every bite but I felt it was poor date manners).

The ceasar salad with brussel sprouts and the brussel sprouts with  bacon tie for my favorite sides/ starters. The meat is always top notch - I've now tried almost everything and can't pick a favorite, it's like kids. Just go - eat, drink and enjoy!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Uninspiring food, presented by uninspiring people (and as the old yiddish proverb goes, small portions too).  Came here on a recent weekend and were underwhelmed by the overeager freshman ""bouncers"" (basically the cast of Girls) and the aggressively mediocre food, which compensates for its meager flavor with the drizzle foodporn factor.  Avoid this place at all costs!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Woke up early on a Sunday of Valentine weekend. Ended the night before earlier as expected and I was up at 730 am with a growling stomach. Must. Have. Food. NOW. A mad dash from a quick shower to Astoria we made. Goof Ball had a craving for Grilled cheese and Tomato soup and Queens Kickshaw is the place for it according to yelp. I had their Frittata. It came with gruyere, tomato, ricotta, shallots and caramelized onions. it was also supposed to come with red pepper and I asked if I can have it without. The server and kitchen was very accommodating to my request. Tomato soup hit that craving spot together with their gourmet grilled cheese. We polished off our plates/bowl in record time. 12 mins and 20 secs. according to Mr Time Management lol. Definitely a great place to visit.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is so damn cute and charming... it's like going to a garden tea party.  I will easily forego excellent food and service for an out of the ordinary setting.  This place is tops on my list if I just want a coffee and dessert.  The food is also very good - I have only had pasta so I can't really elaborate on the menu or quality, but looking around everyone seemed to be enjoying it and it looked good.  It is also well priced.  The clientele had an air about them... studious, possibly famous, intellectual.  It was nice.    The service is lacking... truly lacking... but I'm usually so enamored by the gardenesque feel to get to perturbed.  I haven't been here for the Jazz, but it is a cute little basement spot that I'm sure is nice for a night of live music.  Very enchanting and would get 5 stars if the service improved!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went here solo for dinner on a Sunday night. It was pretty much empty when I arrived, but more people trickled in throughout my meal. The place is small but welcoming. There are some seats that are cushioned along the window, while others are stools. By the end of my meal, the stool was becoming uncomfortable. I ordered tapas - fried calamari, patatas bravas, empanadas de pollo, and a plate of olivas. The food came out fairly quickly, although not all at the same time. First was the plate of olivas which was small but good. Then came the empanadas de pollo - they are two medium sized empanadas with a dipping sauce. The empanadas were good but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The fried calamari was ok, but a bit stringy for my liking. Finally came the patatas bravas, which is a staple among traditional tapas. I was not a fan of their take on it - I couldn't bare the smell... it was as if something was burned. I think it might have been the sauce drizzled on top. I left the plate mostly untouched. The waitress did not check on me during the meal, and only came a while after to offer me water. I drank the water and waited another 10 minutes (clearly finished with my meal) for the waitress to return. At this point I asked for the check. The check came and I was surprised at the amount. They had charged me for an extra $23 dollar pitcher of Sangria - the only drinks I had were the water and a beer. It was not crowded at all... so I was a little annoyed at that - I only had a few items ordered and they couldn't get it right. I might try this place again down the road, but was not impressed with my first experience here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Love this place. It's expensive, and I admit I would not be eating here without...sponsorship, but the food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere, especially in the back garden, is fantastic. Today I got the mezzelune ravioli with the mushrooms and so on. One should note that the portions of many dishes appear small (and I'm the sort of person who prefers quantity over anything else), but the ingredients are very rich, and it will fill you up. In the ravioli there were maybe six or seven pieces of the pasta, but they were each huge, and served in a rich, creamy, mushroom sauce, so by the end I was well satisfied. My wife ordered the jumbo shrimp, which she enjoyed, noting that most places say jumbo, but that this was indeed JUMBO shrimp. The fish is also great; my grandparents had the salmon I think it was and an eggplant-based dish which they enjoyed. Apparently they now have a ""Meatball Monday"" promotion special, which I think is silly and more suited to a sports bar than a upscale Italian restaurant. It's supposed to be a prix fixe menu wherein the appetizer is meatball, the entree has meatballs, and the dessert implies meatballyness. I'm sure there's a better way of offering a themed menu special. Uva excels at dessert. The chocolate salami/salume/whatever it's called is divine. Disregarding the ridiculousness of Meatball Monday, we also got an order of the Chocolate version, spherical chocolate truffles in cream served with strawberries. Delicious! We always enjoy eating in the back ""garden"" or patio area, an enclosed backyard to the main building. It's beautiful and one can enjoy the best parts of being inside and outside in any weather. This winter it seems that the heating has been improved, or that something has changed as we felt like there had in the past been some draftiness. In the summer it is air conditioned. We would have preferred that the ceiling of the thing were transparent, though, as seeing a bit of evening sky would have completed the feel (it looks like a canvas curtain). Although the restaurant is called ""uva,"" meaning grape, I've never had wine there (but the wine menu certainly looks extensive). Whatever you're drinking or eating, Uva is a great place to do it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here with the bf, we ordered the DIY Thai iced tea, red curry chicken, crab Rangoon, and the crab fried rice. Crab fried rice was nothing special, the coconut was only there for show. The red curry however was delicious and DIY Thai iced tea is a must try. Our waiter was attentive and the food came really quick. Will def go back and try their other stuff.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Having only one kid-free night while we were in the city my husband and I headed to the Village...being from TN we know nothing about the hotspots, so Yelp reviews in hand we set out for the Red Lion...well they had a cover and were packed and we were looking for a place we could have a conversation without shouting, so we found The Malt House next door...and what a pleasant surprise. If you're looking for your dime a dozen piss beer selection this is NOT the place for you. Serving mostly craft beers (draft in mason jars! or straight from the bottle) combined with a friendly bartender, Owen, who took time to talk with us as well as every other patron we saw enter meant a lot on our night out and made for an awesome evening. The total ambience of the place - from music to warm wood tables and very clean bathrooms was great. We wish nothing but the best for the Malt House (which just opened a few weeks ago) and hope to one day return. Cheers to Owen and his staff!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've read about it, seen plenty of reviews about it and seen the long ass lines as I've passed it by. Now I'm wondering, really, why?? I have been to countless pizza shops, with less clout, that blew the doors off this place. If the reviews weren't for the food then I don't know what, there wasn't anything else unique about it. I had gotten a small  regular pie, nothing special, but still... Don't understand why this place is so popular, I certainly wasn't wowwed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My girls and I came here for brunch and now all I can think about is when I can finagle another meal there. We had: The Hangover Pizza- For once in my life I wish I was actually hungover so this could help me. Everything you want the next morning is on this pizza - pancetta, sausage, cheese, potatoes, tomato sauce, and eggs. Eggs on pizza is one of my favorite toppings, ever.  The crust reminded me of being in Rome, thin and crisp. The sauce was just the right amount of sweet. L'Italiano - Eggs Benedict's bolder Italian cousin- the light as air ricotta allowed the soppresata to stick to the hearty country bread, and the eggs were poached perfectly. The soppresata was just spicy enough. Served with awesome home fries, just the way I like them, lots of caramel onions. A Warm Bankie - perfect for the chilly afternoon, super comforting and warm - polenta with fried eggs, asparagus, mushrooms and truffle oil. Although the polenta was looser in consistency then I normally like, I think it worked here. The mushrooms and the asparagus were nicely roasted, and the truffle oil was just a whisper and not intrusive. I would eat this dish if I was sad and it would cheer me up. Buttermilk Pancakes - honey ricotta, toasted walnuts, and whipped cream?! We had to have it. The pancakes were fluffy and light, and the ricotta was whipped to be light as air as well. Speaking of light, shockingly all of these brunch dishes were made with a light hand - not once did I feel like anything was heavy or greasy, and the portions were generous without being overwhelming. The Baby Jesus cake was well worth the splurge in calories. At first when it comes out it looks boring and unassuming, a pale brown square with a deep brown toffee syrup draped over, but looks really can be deceiving. This cake is sexy, moist with deep flavors, without being cloyingly sweet. Just get it. It's very warm and rustic inside, which I love. Service was kind of....absent, but maybe just because there was one waiter/bartender for the entire place and one busboy/runner. Two people to cover brunch seems kind of silly, but they did a pretty good job - the food came out rather quickly. Cocktails were good enough, but not particularly tasty- must go back and get some wine!","[1.0, 0.0]"
