"Delicious food, and efficient restaurant. They put policies into place about seating, and wait times, etc. You will wait a long time, but enjoy yourself and have a nice cucumber gimlet or another great drink at their full service bar. I would advise going in non peak times. The ramen is delicious, the texture of the noodles is much different than other places. I would recommend getting the shishito peppers and the pork buns to share.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went to Trattoria Trecolori before seeing Phantom. Similar to others, we were seated promptly and a waiter came by almost immediately for our drink order. There is not much of a selection in terms of appetizers (if you like to split an appetizer like we do, there are really only two options), but we both enjoyed our entrees. My husband had the veal sorrentino which he said was excellent, and I had the ravioli of the day which happened to be ravioli stuffed with crabmeat and spinach, all topped with a creamy cognac sauce. Not sure if the pasta was homemade, but it was very good. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu which sounded promising, given its appealing name of being homemade. Frankly, however, we both have had much better tiramisu at other italian restaurants in the city and if I come back to Trecolori, I would not bother ordering it again. !!!! On a side note, the parking garage directly across from Trattoria Trecolori was TERRIBLE. Not only did they take forever getting our car when we were ready to leave, but they also oh-so-conveniently rifled through our middle console and pinched the forty bucks we had there. Yes, I totally forgot the money was there and had I remembered, would not have left it, but it left quite a sour note at the end of the evening to know that someone working at that icon parking garage could be so grubby. I would never park there again!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After reading nonstop positive reviews for Queens Kickshaw, me and a group of girlfriends decided to see what all the fuss was about. And, oh my, it was outstanding. What the space lacks in decor, seats with backs, and heat for that matter as it was freezing, they more than make up for in food. We had a range of ciders and wine, which they have more than enough options in both. (They also have tons of tea, coffee, and beer that is sure to please anybody.) As for the grilled cheese (mmmmm) I had the Great Hill Blue that came with pickled blueberries (!?) that were great. Some other sandwiches we tried included the Gruyere and Fontina, as well as the white bean soup. There wasn't a crumb left when we were done. One note of caution: they are (ugh) cash only, so make sure you have a few bucks before you walk in.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of my biggest peeves is the ""no substitutions"" rule that some restaurants such as Num Pang enforce. When it comes to mayo, I'm generally a minimalist gal, and what worried me was that the mayo would be loaded on like suntan lotion on the Jersey Shore in the summer. However, I'd heard enough awesome things about Num Pang to brave my fears and give their banh mi a try. We both opted for the pork belly sandwiches, which come with this delicious pickled asian pear, the carrots cilantro and cucumber trinity, and the aforementioned chili mayo. Thankfully, the mayo wasn't TOO overloaded, though I still would've preferred much less. The pork belly itself was hella tender and flavourful, and it's nice that they kept it thickly cut rather than slicing it into puny bits of meh. For $9 and change, it's a filling sandwich, and I'm hoping they keep it on their regular menu (currently, it's listed as a special).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I just created an account to let y'all know-- delicious ramen, but! don't get the extreme spicy ramen unless you are ready to pay for it later during a painful trip to the w.c. Hot in, hot out.

"amazing fresh and tasty dishes with friendly neighbor-like service... every time!! i frequent this small but cozy eatery once every 10 days or so.  and there are many reasons for this.  not only do fidel and glenn greet me by name, they also ask me how my father is doing (who is also a regular customer, separate from me).. the chicken paillard at buster's is probably my top dish for dining out here in new york city.  whether it's with frika or mashed potatoes on the side, the tenderness of the chicken combined with the added seasonings create such a winning flavor that i hardly ever order anything else.  each day of operation, there is a board outside the restaurant with specials listed.  fidel is always happy and willing to describe them and explain how they are made.  my water glass gets refilled before it's even halfway empty, the place is always clean and has pleasant low-volume music playing from in the kitchen, and i'm always given free cookies at the end of my meal.  in addition, their coffee and dessert options are top notch.  my boyfriend is a little more adventurous with ordering here and he has greeted every bite taken of every dish with a big smile and a ""F#@!, this is so good!"".   i have read most of the reviews for buster's and most people seem to agree with me.  i'm not sure why some folks have felt the need to bash a place for not serving brunch or not having longer hours.  not every restaurant is Denny's or T.G.I.Fridays.  and thank F-ing christ!!  these small shops and restaurants are the salt of the earth here in nyc, if you ask me.. i'd much rather find a restaurant that is locally owned and operated that doesn't use food provision companies (i.e. they don't have 18-wheel trucks delivering supplies to them).  they purchase meat and vegetables from local merchants on a daily basis, guaranteeing a fresh and tasty dish every time.  if you're into an eating experience where there are 400 people in the restaurant with huge lines to get into their filthy piss-soaked bathrooms, then keep going to your Huge F'n Dallas Ruby Tuesday Chili B-B-Q spot in Times Square.  it'll be quieter here for the rest of us who appreciate it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food here is delicious, and you can't really go wrong with anything you choose. We tried an assortment of dishes as it was Restaurant Week and we had six in our party.   The outstanding dishes that stood out were the octopus and quail for appetizer and the pork chop and rabbit as entrees. I would come back for the ""Milk and Cereal"" dessert alone! The White Chocolate Semifreddo was also a very tasty treat. The artisanal cheeses was a miss. The ambience was great and the staff very helpful. The validated parking is a bonus!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was greeted at the entrance of a nondescript building by a lady dressed as a gentleman. I  was then escorted by a gentleman this time up a very unassuming elevator. When i walked in i was transported to the 1920's. the mantra here is ""everything is not as it seems"" i sat by the bar while i waited for my date. One of the patrons who was dressed in 20's garb came and sat next to me and we exchanged some pleasantries. The food was really good. i got the Shepherd pie. In the middle of dinner there was a raffle and as luck would have it, i won a free dessert. There was a live band playing jazz.. It was heavenly. Then out of the blue, I got a note from someone to meet them at some random place. My heart fluttered as i was ushered into a dark room and a girl grabbed my hand and spoke about some place we had been in together (o_O) then she burnt the paper with a lighter, but only the words disappeared. I was led through some dark room, put in a wheel chair - i guess part of the whole sleep no more show. It was quite fascinating and thrilling. Overall it was a great and unique experience. I would recommend this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stopped in here yesterday and really had a great brunch at an even better price. It was quiet and very clean. While it was very fast-foody in the actual space (i.e. there are picnic tables and a lunch counter, no actual formal seating arrangements or table service), I didn't feel rushed and the food was well prepared. I had an Israeli sandwich and a freshly made iced tea. It was delicious -with the steak and egg seasoned to perfection in a nicely warmed pita. The service was fast and incredibly friendly.

"Tonight's dinner at Joe's Shanghai was the worst meal I can recall ever having in a NYC restaurant.  I've eaten there a few times since moving to NY in 1995.  I've never been impressed, but their following has brought me back over the years to give it a second, third, etc try.  Sure enough, on this rainy Wednesday night, there was a line outside for tables, so whatever it has going for it hasn't eased up.  But it sure isn't the food?   No fresh or zingy flavors, just glop covering limp, aging vegetables, phlegmy sauce covering mealy sea food, and a pork dish that tasted like it came out of a tin can years past it's expiration date.  I can honestly say I've had better Chinese food in coach on Cathay Pacific.  And I suspect I would have had a better meal dumpster dodging on Pell Street tonight.  I am sooo disappointed!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Dear Kindly Beautiful Peaches Server, I know that, like so many of your co-workers, it was your first week at your first restaurant gig, so I'll be gentle.  The owners of Peaches have spent a bundle building this joint.  They have seemingly done so without having ever taken the time, themselves, to enjoy the subtleties of one of the many other brunches available in greater Brooklyn.  And that it doesn't seem to have slowed their business is beside my point.  Now this will probably come off as a little fussy, I know.  But when I walked in the door, I was struck by ... well, it was more than the smell.  It was a lover's promise.  And a glance over at the plate in front of the fellow seated next to me confirmed what the aroma had suggested -- big ruddy curlicues of thick meaty bacon.  And then, Yes!  Platefuls appeared, flying arabesques around me.  Ahhh.  I can almost taste it now, with the wide pepper crusted edges, seared around the marbly fat.  The story of this brunch could really write itself.  However, Dear Server, the difference between the dry, reconstituted, turkey-derived wafers I received, and the salt-sheened, applewood smoked slabs I ordered, is the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. I would have mentioned it at the time, had only the moment you so charmingly dropped it in passing under the nose of my vegetarian companion not been our last. I silently promised to write to you one day.  And now I have.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great spin on Vietnamese sandwiches. Tried the Lemon Grass Chicken, BBQ Pork, and the Pork Belly.  My favorite was the Lemon Grass Chicken with a runny egg.  Tender juicy chicken with the mix of the pickled vegetables and runny are AMAZING.  The sandwich is not as great without the egg.  I never eat it fast enough before the egg yolk starts dripping everywhere :(.  The Pork Belly was alright, nice marinated meat.  The BBQ Pork was not doing it for me.  The pork had no flavor to me.  Also tried the Passion Fruit Rose, they add actual flowers in the drink.  I thought it was pretty cool until I drank it.  I'm not sure what they add to it, but when the rose hits your tongue it's like your drinking honey water.  Had to spit it out every time a flower had escaped the drink.   Not sure about the prices, but it's $1.25 extra for egg. Sandwiches are about $4.25-$5.50 (I think) depending on what you get.  Drinks are $3.50 a pop for the large ones.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Service could be better, you always feel kind of urgency while eating, once you you had your last slurp and the bowl is empty, you're instantly being given the check, no questions- like do you need anything else?did you want another drink? So it's a 30 min experience with at least 1 hour wait. But certainly worth it once in a while.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Perilla was a wonderful experience all around. The food was a solid A+.   -we started with the dungeness crab salad with a hint of citrus, lemongrass and beurre blanc. Garnished with tiny crispy roti and red tobiko.  The flavors were balanced and melded together beutifully. - The hanger steak was grilled perfectly with hen of the woods mushrooms, and my server made the perfect wine paring suggestion -- a glass of Montepulciano. Hubby had the wild striped sea bass. It was seared to perfection.  The food was simple and wasn't overpowered by embellishment.   -Dessert: made-to-order chocolate souffle and a coffee-anglaise sauce.  Be sure to place your order 20 minutes in advance.  We didn't place our order til after the main course, but our server was able to accomodate our request (despite the fact that they restaurant was busy and they needed to turn over the tables).   In addition to the food, our server was just delightful.  He was gracious, very knowledgeable about all of the dishes and wines, and knew when to check in with us and when to give us our space.  Dining out is more than the food.  It's about the ""experience"".  That includes the ambience, the food presentation, and the service.  A knowledgeable and gracious server truly adds to the ""experience"". As if the food and experience wasn't enough....the end of the evening was a pleasant surprise when we saw the bill.  Harold Dieterle, thank you so much for being so down-to-earth and reasonable with the prices in your restaurant.  We have been to more restaurants in NYC than we can keep track, and we both agree that Perilla is one of our most memorable in a long while.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here for my bachelorette party. I've heard a lot of good things about this place but I guess that depends. In my case, I had a group of 15 people. This means they price the menu by person rather than what is actually ordered. The price came out to be $90 a person! That is crazy! It would have been cheaper if we came with 14 people. We did not get that much worth of food. And alcohol was not included. So overall, the food was ok and the service was fine.

I ordered a Manhattan Clam Chowder and sole filet as my main course. Both were delish and I managed to get a taste of other dishes from our table.

"Came here for restaurant week dinner, and everything was absolutely phenomenal. Service was so smooth and attentive. What we ordered: Appetizers: Steamed Prince Edward Island Mussels - this one blew me away. The broth was fragrant, the bits of spicy sausage provided a kick, and the portion was pretty large for an appetizer. I ate every last bit. Caesar salad - So glad we ordered this, as the dressing tasted so light and refreshing! The walnuts and fruit also added great texture and flavor to the tender leaves of romaine lettuce. Main: Roast chicken: perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, with an interesting combination of roasted apricot which provided a nice contrast to the chicken. Roasted Hake: Tender, crispy outside, on top of a very interesting sauce that tastes like... summer. Dessert: Nectarine and Blueberry Financier: Yum! Very rich and dense. It was great with the vanilla ice cream that came on the side. White Chocolate Blondie: I didn't try any, but my date said it was too buttery. The scoop of cherry ice cream it came with was delicious, though. I also ordered the watermelon cucumber vodka cooler, which was very light and refreshing - the perfect summer drink. At the end of the meal they also give you complementary salted brownie bites! Thank you Perilla for restoring my faith in restaurant week!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The place was packed when I was there for lunch but service was quick and prompt. Ordered the chicken satay, roti canai, nasi lemak, char kway tiao and ice kacang. The chicken satay was good but the satay sauce was kinda sweet and lacking the peanut taste that supposed to be with it. The char kway tiao seriously taste like what it should be minus the cockles. The roti canai taste like a chewier version of roti prata and the curry sauce that comes with it was good. Nasi lemak was also quite up to standard as the rice was fragrant with the banana leaf aroma and coconut taste. Ice kacang was excellent. Went back there again for dinner the next day and ordered seafood with egg hor fun, Hokkien mee and kangkong belachan. Service kindda slack after the lunchtime rush period and before the dinner crowd came in. The Hokkien mee taste was there but the noodle used was udon instead. They left out my order of the kangkong, so I had to ordered it again (luckily it came fast) and it was good but not spicy enough for me. Overall, I would come again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So disappointing. For the superhigh price tag, it should be phenomenal. But it was far from it. To start, we checked the menu on the website to be sure the famous kale salad was on it. It was. But when we got there, we were handed a menu sans kale salad (except as an accompaniment to an entree). When we voiced our disappointment about the kale salad, the waiter's response was ""Well, you can have it if you order the lamb entree"" (or whatever the entree was...). Not, ""Let me see if the chef can make an appetizer for you."" or ""Sorry, I know it seems like a no brainer, since we serve it with something else, but there just wouldn't be enough for the entree that serves kale on the side if we started serving it as an appetizer tonight."" But our drone of a waiter was completely indifferent to whether or not we would have a memorable experience. Then there was the bit about the bread...We were three people and we received two pieces of their delicious bread. When someone in our party asked for more bread, the waiter (actually, a waitress) replied, ""Well, we make it to order and it takes about 20 minutes. Do you want to wait that long?"" First, we were sitting right by the kitchen and COULD SEE a pile of bread sitting in the window. So, no need to lie...really. But who wouldn't want to wait for delicious bread? Honestly, it seemed like a way to discourage us, which just came off as hostile and  stingy. Finally, there was the chicken incident. I ordered chicken. I start eating it and it looks uncooked to me (you know, dark pink--and not the dark meat kind of pink). I ask the others in my party if they think it looks uncooked--all agree. We call the waiter over and explain the concern. Instead of picking up my plate, bringing it back to the kitchen and either consulting the chef or cooking it more, he replies (without even inspecting the chicken), ""That's the way the chef cooks it."" So I try to eat it, but I just can't stomach it. Call the waiter over again, nearly begging him to take my plate back and cook it more. He picks it up, brings it to the kitchen. When he returns with my more-cooked chicken, I dig in. It now seems cooked. The pompous waiter returns, asking, ""Is everything to your liking now?"" As if I just completely don't get the food and was being a hassle. So incredibly patronizing. I have worked in restaurants for over 15 years, including managing the front of house. If any of my staff treated customers like that, I would have fired them. It was honestly the rudest, most-unwelcoming, unprofessional experience I have had in Brooklyn. And the prices (which I would pay for an excellent meals) are obscene.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Went here on my last trip to Brooklyn. The inside and patio of the place was really well done. Kind of hard to find as there was really no sign outside.

"Having read the positive and negative reviews, we did not know what to expect. Traif was busy so our table was in the noisy area just opposite the bar and it was hard to hear. Our waitress was so friendly and positive that she made up for the noise level. We went with her recommendations and were generally delighted. We had 8 items for a party of three and were happy with all of them except the last. The peach salad was terrific, the brussel sprouts outstanding, scallops, shrimp, foie gras, and tuna were all delicious (the tuna portion was very small but I loved it served on the eggplant tempura). Wish we had tried the missions figs. We ordered the short rib sliders instead of the glazed baby back ribs and that was our only misstep. The sliders were fine - just not nearly as interesting as the rest of the items. Also we had cocktails earlier at another place so were not able to try anything from the intriguing cocktail menu.

I also ordered out a couple of times and the food was just as delicious,  wrapped in aluminum to preserve the warm taste.

Took me a while to write this review but I finally got around to it. This place rocks! My fiancée and I were in town from Los Angeles for 10 days. We ate at 15 different places with our average bill coming to roughly $50 /meal (from $10 sandwiches to $150 tabs at Buddakan). This place was the BEST meal of our ENTIRE trip. We went back twice since we only discovered it 2 days before leaving - wish we found it sooner! We still talk about going back to NYC and running directly to this cart.

"Although the food was decent, the seating was cramped and uncomfortable, the service was poor with a condescending attitude and the intense heat emanating from the unshaded window made this dining experience awful! This restaurant epitomizes the mind-set of certain NY restaurants associated with showbiz personality chefs whereby they treat their clients as objects, rather than valued customers, and no matter how much money is spent on small portions of food, it is unappreciated. This is revealed in their lack of concern for the comfort of their patrons and in the general attitude of their servers and Maitre'D. Personally, if we were in the presence of a brilliant Neurosurgeon or Rocket scientist I may be in awe. However we are talking about a restaurant associated with a highly publicized chef, and in such a context, especially when the ambiance, seating (level of comfort) service and attitude is poor, and the food is merely decent but costly, I am not impressed whatsoever. I would recommend that others seek more pleasant dining experiences in more comfortable and respectful restaurants.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is tiny, so if you are going with a group, you should go probably 30-45 minutes before your original meeting time for a table just so your guests don't get antsy. My parents are Colombian so I was curious to see if this would actually be the time I would possibly find a decent Colombian joint in the city which is rare bc its packed full of mostly Mexican or Cuban spots. So I went with a large appetite and my bf and I were able to grab a couple of stools against the wall. (You will be comfortable there if you don't have too much crap with you) We ordered appetizers. I got the original corn empanadas and he got the wheat. Im not crazy about those ""Americanized"" empanadas (Hawaiian, Pizza, etc...) I like to stay close to the original recipes bc I can get American food any day. And although mine sucked, the wheat ones were actually much better. I of course got the grilled skirt steak  platter and it was pretty good as well, very tasty. And finally I got the flan and the ""colombian"" hot chocolate for dessert. Both dessert items tasted artificial. The flan tasted like the Goya  to go flans they sell at the supermarkets and I could have sworn I could taste Hersheys syrup in that hot choco. I wouldnt mind coming back here for a quick bite but it would not be my top choice either. I think Im better off sticking to the Colombian joints in Jackson Heights Queens......","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After having spent five wonderful days in New-York, before heading to LaGuardia airport to fly back home, my boyfriend and I decided to go eat at Eataly for lunch, as our final meal in the city. But it was not to be unfortunately. My boyfriend and I walked into Eataly and after having walked around the store for a few minutes, amongst all the other customers exploring their surroundings; we decided to sit at the pizza counter to eat. We set our bags under the counter, removed our coats and proceeded to sit down. It was 10:50am. A few seconds later, an employee quickly walked up to me and after looking at me in a condescending way spat out roughly: 'The counter opens at 11am'. I smiled and replied: 'We know, not a problem, we are willing to wait'. He then continued in the same tone: 'You have to leave the counter and cannot wait here'. Utterly surprised and in shock in regards to his attitude and tone of voice I replied: 'Really? We cannot sit here with our belongings and wait a few minutes?'. He rolled his eyes, huffed and puffed and simply said 'No'. WOW! Unfortunately this employee's attitude was incredibly unacceptable and uncalled for as the business was in fact open with employees already behind every counter ready to serve and customers swarming all over the store. He saw we had our carry-on luggage with us so that it would obviously would have been easier for us to wait near the counter we wanted to eat at instead of telling us we had to walk around the store and come back lugging our two small suitcases around. Very unprofessional but especially unconciliating attitude on his part. My boyfriend and I just looked at each other and decided to walk out and eat somewhere else. :(","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been wanting to eat here since March when Yumi and I were talking about original Japanese shelters in New York. Happens to be from the same owners of Decibel and since then my curiosity grew constantly. Long story short, we went there on a Thursday and had the $11.50 soba lunch special (only 50 available) and Oyako Don with an awesome buckwheat beer from Oregon. Simply fantastic and clearly a solid lunch option if you happen to be in NY. Soba is handmade, with a pleasant texture/chewiness and a rich buckwheat finish. Yumi tells me from their own organic farm but I wasn't able to find the info. The place got packed in 20 minutes around noon so be sure to make a reservation if you want to grab your lunch special, a serious deal including soba and a seasonal chirashi (changes everyday). The rice was just perfect and overall you will find yourself here again and again, just for the cozy ambiance. I seriously would have had a hard time finding it considering that it's nested below an office building, somehow the same secluded location of Decibel. An absolute must, straight from Yumi's repertoire.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The food and drink has always been great as well, and the portions are generous. I ordered mussels and a side of frites (who doesn't love moules frites?) and only made it through half the mussels and a quarter of the fries. Turns out I could've just shared with my friend, since his sandwich came with a ton of them as well. Also liked the escargot, but who doesn't love anything drowned in garlic butter? Their sangria is also good; it doesn't have an overpowering wine taste, which I suppose could be dangerous. Thankfully, the train is close so no one has to worry about driving after downing several carafes of it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I usually only come to Williamsburg on Saturday mornings to get stared at angrily by the Chasidim as I train for the marathon on their turf, but occasionally I'll make the trip out to Billyburg for drinks, dinner and music. But they almost always happen on the same night. Cubana is great because it combines two of my favorite things right now -- Cuban food and bourbon -- and does it all next door to the Music Hall of Williamsburg meaning I can have dinner, a good mixed drink and then head to the show, all without having to race through the rain.* The food wasn't fantastic -- though the pork was said to have been marinated for eight hours, it tasted kind of bland and the rice, pork and beans may be traditionally Cuban, but it is not traditionally exciting. I also expected more spice, though it's entirely possible Cuban food isn't spicy by definition and I've transposed my wishes from cool-weather spicy food to what I expect Cuban food to be. That said, I didn't love it. That said, the empanadas were good (if bland) with the egg and cheese being a standout. I loved the drinks, especially the rye with lemon twist that turned out to be a lot better than I expected. And the service was pleasant and attentive, even if it took the kitchen a little while to serve up the food. All in all, this place is pretty good if a little expensive**, but it makes up for the extra price with a cute, date-friendly interior and good service that means it's a good standby any night I'm coming to a show. * - Not that it was raining the night I was there, but it's a good bonus for if it were. ** - $10 for a glass of Buffalo Trace? That's almost half the cost of the bottle!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've tried many pizza places in the NYC area since graduating college and exploring the food scene here. Some serve classic, yet delicious pizzas. Some serve greasy, sub-par pizza by the slice. Others, like Emily, wow you by creating a masterpiece out of their pizza pies. Emily is slightly out of the way, in the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn, but well-worth the traveling time. My friend and I shared: Crispy Sprouts-apples, Worcestershire, chilis, black sesame RM3! Pizza- sauce, fontina, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto Emily Pizza-mozzarella, taleggio, pistachios, truffle spread, honey S'Mores Calzone- marshmallow, chocolate, graham cracker The Crispy Sprouts were too salty, even for me. However, the flavors were great. The RM3! Pizza was meaty and spicy. Great blend for pizza. The namesake, the Emily Pizza, was mind-blowing. Perfect combination of salty, crunchy, savory, and sweet. It sounds like an odd combination of ingredients but they all work together to make a harmonious pizza pie. The s'mores calzone was a perfect ending to our pizza journey.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"In my opinion, Sushi Yasuda is the best place to have sushi in New York (that is still semi-affordable, less $ than Masa). It's definitely more for hardcore sushi lovers though. It's not a ""trendy"" place, the service wasn't amazing, and the non-sushi dishes were good but not great. My 5 stars are purely for the quality of their sushi. The quality of the fish, seaweed, wasabi, and all of the other little details are what makes this place great. I have only been here once, but it was so good that even if I lucked out and came on a really good day, I can't imagine this place being anything but delicious. We sat at the sushi bar, but not in front of Chef Yasuda (he was away in Japan that week). We ordered everything a la carte, and everything was delicious. For anyone interested in uni, it was the best I've ever had. It was so good that we ordered 3 pieces each. It was so delicious and fresh that our eyes lit up with every bite we took.

"Hello all, I've been looking at yelp reviews for a while now, and have found some amazing food based on them. Here is my first review. SriPraPhai is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in NY! They have great food! Some highlights: * Coconut rice (you have to try this; it is soo delicious!) * Soft shell crab (with green curry and pineapple) * Red curry (add pineapple, and eat with coconut rice) * Roasted duck salad (it's very spicy though, even though I asked for mild, but it was delicious) * Sautéed chicken with cashews, pineapple, and roasted chili. Their menu is very long and may have to be studied in advance :) Great to have such a big selection to choose from. The restaurant is usually crowded, but the waiting time hasn't been long when we've been there. However, when I stopped by for take-out one time in the evening, it was very very crowded and it looked like the waiting time was longer. Either way, the food is awesome and worth waiting for.

The place was crowded when we got there...a good sign of a place with good food. The atmophere was very cozy with wood and brick walls. The service was surprisingly good considering how crowded they were... We shared the zuchinni sticks. They were reaaly good! Big sticks in a heavy coating of breading and cooked so perfectly that when you took a bite, there was a burst of juicyness. We both ordered the western burger, which was one of the top five burgers I've ever eaten. The party was perfectly and losely formed to allow perfect cooking in and out. Topped with smoked mozzerella, country bacon, cole slaw and bbq sauce...just rediculously good. It came with a pickle which was battered and cooked the same way the zuchinni sticks were. Add aside of delicious onion rings and a chocolate shake...and it was the better then thanksgiving dinner! Check this place out!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My new favorite place! I've been living in Murray Hill for over two years and although I like the neighborhood, it always bothered me that the area is packed with sports bars and has no real quality bars. I usually had to go to the west village or Chelsea. Whitman and Bloom is a game changer in the neighborhood. Yes, the name is weird, but the place is absolutely gorgeous, very classic design with soft music and comfortable seating, great bar with a wide bar selection. I love Wine so for me its always a treat to find a place with such a quality wine selection which fit a top restaurant. Food was amazing,everything we ordered was great. Not your typical bar food but actually high end gourmet food Check out the lamb ribs, my new favorite dish! Prices are moderate and are definitely reasonable for that kind of quality food.

Have been there before and enjoyed the food and drinks but service has always been a nightmare that detracts from the overall experience. Went in on a Saturday afternoon for brunch.

"came here again over the weekend because i needed to quickly find a relatively inexpensive restaurant catering towards meat-eaters and vegetarians that had decently good food, with good ambiance, and no more than a 10-15 minute wait. so, paprika it was!  plus i was curious to try the non-prix-fixed pasta.   got there @ 8:30 on a saturday and only waited around 10 minutes to be seated (party of 3, no reservations). service was pretty fast and the host and the wait staff were all very nice. it was a bit loud in there though, but that's to be expected of a full restaurant where tables are pretty close together. i got the veal ragu and it was pretty good!  so many times better than the price-fixed gnocchi.  the portion was generous (though i cleaned my plate, haha) and they definately didn't skimp on the meat.  and only $14?  that's a pretty good price for the area, for no wait, and for good pasta. i think i may go again and try more of their pastas! :)  i am now converted.","[1.0, 0.0]"

First off, any place that has shots on their brunch menu (the daily stiffner) and still manages to be perceived as classy gets an A+ from me.  I opted for the blood orange mimosa instead...mostly champagne, which was fine by me.  Our waiter had a fun personality and we really liked him.  He also made some great recs for the table. The 4 of us split 2 orders of monkey bread...delish and had some tasty coffee.  I ordered the cinnamon graham pancakes (no cereal involved).  The pancakes were (excuse my language) super moist!  they were also layered with sliced, cooked apples on top and in between the pancakes.  I'm typically not a pancake person but I would order these again.  However, I did have food envy because others at our table got the baked eggs ranchero....eggs with beans, avocado, and all sorts of toppings, served with tortilla chips.  Really tasty! I would definitely come back here to try the dinner and perhaps brunch again.  My only real complaint was that the menu for brunch wasn't bigger.  Would have been nice to have more options.  Great spot though!  Definitely check out if you're in the hood.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is fan-f**king-tastic. The best:  Broccolini (omg)  Polenta (creamy delicious lick the bowl)  Croquettes (um... what just happened in my mouth)     The good:  Pork belly (good, with a little more of the bean puree could have been a best but still it was right up there)  Fried chicken (great sauce, perfectly cooked, has celery seed which I liked but some may not, throw in a grilled pineapple or something to hit the sweet with the savory and this is up with the bests)  Mussels (coulda used a little less mustard and a fried potato instead of a soft one to add a little crunch but it was still good stuff)  Oyster (good, fresh, and $1 from 6-8 on wednesdays... forgettaboutit)     The meh:  Pate (a little bitter but management showed they are looking to keep clientele happy and took it on the house without us asking... real easy way to increase tip and customer loyalty/satisfaction) I shoulda taken a picture of the menu... womp. Wine:  If you're looking for the best bottle, the $50 red is some barely known/almost extinct grape and it is really awesome (wine markup is around 100%, as in $25 bottle costs $50 and believe me in todays restaurants that is a steal)  The sangria (red) is also real good I am definitely coming back and ordering the croquettes and broccolini and then I will try some new stuff... place is awesome... when is the 1-year anniversary?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mmm..I'm hungry just thinking about a burger from Bonnie's.  Sit at the bar and watch the cooks make your burgers with poise and elegance.  The juicy burgers are seasoned to perfection and come with yummy crispy fries.  The turkey burger is excellent as well.  If your heart can handle it, have the buffalo wings as a starter.  They also have some pretty good healthier fare, hummus and pita, and a great garden salad.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So I will again preface this review and state that I am only writing it as a gluten-free diner.  I went to Becco with a large group pre-show and had called ahead to ask about gluten-free options.  The hostess indicated that I would have to talk to the server about options, which I did upon arrival.   I was disappointed to learn Becco does not offer gluten free pasta (ok, how hard is it to boil another pot of water for gf pasta?!), and when I asked the server if their entrees could be modified, he only gave me 2 options to choose from (they had a huge menu, and only 2 things could be modified!).  He said that almost everything had flour in it and they couldn't change the dishes.   So I went with the chicken option, which came with olives.  I don't like olives, and the server smugly told me ""that's what gives the dish its flavor.""  Um..well..what if I don't like the flavor of olives?!  Once the food arrived (it still had olives in it), it actually wasn't that awful, but I was overall unimpressed with their ability to bring me something I WANTED to eat. I was disappointed in this restaurant's lack of options for gluten-free diners, and their response to my request to modify their menu choices to accommodate my dietary needs.  Eating gluten-free is not that uncommon anymore, and this place needs to catch up with the times.  (Gluten-free issue aside, the place is also tiny and crammed, and the water closets are next to the kitchen, so you have to fight with waiters to get through). There are so many awesome restaurants in NYC that do gluten-free well and will go out of their way to make allergy-prone diners more comfortable. Becco is not one of those places. *EDIT post publication: the restaurant's manager reached out to me after reading my review and apologized for my experience and offered a voucher.  I appreciated the gesture and offered ways to improve the dining experience there for gluten-free diners.  Thus I am updating my review to 2 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I highly recommend this new place. First, the food is very good.  The food was probably 4.5, but they're likely still working out the kinks. Second, the atmosphere is very relaxing, fun and whimsical.   Foodwise - my boyfriend and I tried a few dishes together and loved most of them.  We started with the pickles - a great dish.  I really liked the pickled mushrooms and cauliflowers.  My boyfriend loved the cheery tomatoes.   We both loved the falafel meat balls (I think it needs extra green sauce on the side).  The hummus was also very good, however I think they should serve more pita breads with it (it was too small).   We also tried the shrimps - it was my favorite dish on the menu.  For a main course we shared the steak - it was a very good steak dish; the meat was moist and flavorful; I also liked the sweet potatoes that it came with.  Lastly, we got a free the eggplant burchetta dish - overall it was nice (additional sweetness is needed for this dish).   Atmosphere -- I loved the restrooms; very cool and different from the rest of the restaurant.  I also liked the old world charm with modern spin.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Made a large mistake thinking I could just go in a grab something quick for lunch. The place is sooo overwhelming. There are so many stations with different types of food. I was in a rush to get back to the office, so I didnt have the time to figure out the processes for getting and paying for food. If you have been there a few times, then maybe you can get something quick. The place was just packed with people. I looked like a deer in headlights walking around so I got some stares that clearly said ""really... you have not been to Eataly before? Stupid tourist.""

"This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. I don't care what people say about Joe's Shanghai or Joe's Ginger, Shanghai Manor has the best soup dumplings!!! The skin of the dumplings are simply perfect, not too thin and not too thick, soft with a little chewiness. The pork has the perfect amount of flavor, and they are always cook to perfection. Then there is the best part of the dumpling, the soup, or I like to call it ""meat juice"". The flavor of the soup itself is an art, it's crafted with such simplicity but pack with wonderful flavors. The crab meat and pork combo is delicious as well, it has the right amount of crab meat and pork so one doesn't over-power the other.. I could go on and on about how good Shanghai Manor's soup dumplings are, but it really doesn't help if you don't try them out...

The plate next to mine I might have liked even better, it was a corn ravioli.  Sweet and savory!   The charcuterie seemed to be freshly sliced and very tasty. One problem:  The table was too small.

The menu varies so I'm not sure what to recommend... the last time I was there I had a hake that was excellent, and we also had a duck that we loved.

"Would give this a 3 &1/2. I was very happy that upon arrival we came here as a group of 3 and were seated right away on a Saturday night at almost 10 pm. I had no idea that the back space would be so big, it had a great ambiance, almost outdoor-like and many tables full but not totally over crowded. In terms of space I did not like that the music was very loud and it was hard to talk over. I expect this at a bar but not when I'm having dinner. I had the paella which was very good, not the best I've had but I would definitely order it again if I came here. The only thing I thought i was somewhat strange was there were no tools given for the crab & lobster. I would highly recommend their coffee (Peruvian blend). The dessert I had (domino) was ok but a bit too rich for my taste and the scoop of ice cream that came with it was tiny and melted almost immediately.

"For a few years I've been on a quest for the best pizza in NYC, and I was eager to taste pies from the first pizzeria in America. I even brought some friends who used to live here. Having grown up in Rome, Italy, I appreciate the crust more than the topping, which seems to be the main criterion for American palates. Alas, Lombardi's was a big disappointment. The crust was thinner than the American average, but still not as thin as Roman (Latium) style pizzas'. On the other hand, the dough was not as savory as the best (thicker) doughs that can be found in the Neapolitan pizzerias that sport the brand ""Vera Pizza."" I was surprised to find myself even more let down by the topping. Our second pie was their ""Original Pizza,"" which is pretty much the ""Margherita"" you can have in Naples. The topping was so scarce as though they had run out of ingredients. There were few shreds of basil leaves, little mozzarella, and if there was any grated Romano it must have evaporated. A sprinkle of (hopefully extra virgin) olive oil on the pie right out of the oven, like the do in some Italian pizzerias, or even here (I've seen it done at di Fara's which is a parlor and does not have the benefit of a wood or coal-fired oven), would have rescued the pie by softening the crust, especially the large swaths that had not had the benefit of topping, as well as enriching its flavor. I tried this trick on the slice we brought home, as an experiment. It tasted better out of my humble toaster oven than fresh from Lombardi's oven. I hope our visit was just a bad night for Lombardi's, but they are far from topping my ranking. John's on Bleeker, despite their inconsistencies, is much better in my humble opinion.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been on the lookout for a good tapas place in NYC. So far I've been underwhelmed. Everything has been alright so far. Nai Tapas stepped it up a notch. Could it have been that I was mildly intoxicated with their DELICIOUS blueberry sangria? Probably. You're saying to yourself: ""Blueberry sangria? That can't be! Also, I hate blueberries, so NO!"" All I have to say back is: SHUT UP AND GET IT! My lady-friend doesn't like blueberries either (I know, why am I still with her?) but she was all over their sangria. BLUEberry? More like HAPPYberry (Get it? You do). We had a selection of different tapas to accompany our drinks: patatas bravas, chorizo, meatballs, cheeses and a host of other stuff that I can't remember. The main take away: run, don't walk here. Stop everything that you're currently doing. Facebook can wait. Tell your boss the TPS reports are coming in late (and yes, you will remember the cover page this time). ""But Jaime..."" you say (God, you're whiny today), ""How's the service?"" When I say that I wanted to be best friends with the wait staff, I mean it. They are super friendly and helpful. They also play great music that made me feel as if I was back in Spain. Bottom line? Do I really need to write it? I mean, you're pretty certain this places is like Spain, but in the city. I gave it five stars and spent 4 paragraphs (oh God, this makes 5!) talking about how amazing it is. Do yourself a favor and stop reading. If you're still moving your eyes to follow these words, you're an idiot. STOP! Direct your body towards Nai Tapas. Now. You can thank me later in between swigs of sangria.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I generally go for the special of the day in order to mix things up but you can't go wrong with the everyday meals.  The 1/4 chicken is always good, as is the grandmaster veg smothered with the Hu Joe (I've recently learned this is called ""The Diesel Parker"").  And no trip to Hu Kitchen would be complete without a cup of Crack Coffee and a Crack Bar to go.   My hope is that we see more locations sprouting up around the city!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So disappointing.  After all the glowing reviews I had expected some seriously good BBQ...especially the brisket. Well, after trying this place twice and being completely disappointed I thought I would try it just one more time.  Results....the same.  While the space is not bad and the staff is quite friendly, the food is average.  They have been open for months now and you still can not get any french fries as they don't have a fryer.   They installed a 5000 lb. BBQ smoker but couldn't figure out how to get a deep fryer going? Seriously though...the brisket is just average.  Single serving portions are small and so are the sides that come with it or purchased separately. Hill Country BBQ on 26th Street serves amazing BBQ in comparison.  Mighty Quinn's should send a spy to reverse engineer their brisket.   We truly hoped for better in the East Village.  Perhaps the new BBQ place opening at the old Lucky Cheng's space on First Avenue will offer better fare.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"When the bowl arrived, I instinctively tossed in a few dashes of salt and pepper. It was a personal ritual that I always did before spooning into a serving of matzoh ball soup at my Nana Tillie's. Laughing at myself, I had my first mouthful in the present at Bubby's. Beyond all hope, it actually tasted a lot like Nana's. It was a great bowl of soup. Now, that's comfort food. Bubby's has been around forever, and always has had a very simple formula. Take the best of comfort food from every ethnicity that has some on the menu, update it slightly, and then serve it to the well-heeled stroller crowd of Tribeca. Other reviews have included the words ""trendy"" and ""overpriced"". I take exception. Serving the classics is hardly trendy, and Bubby's has had a ramshackle appearance for nearly 20 years. The prices are bit high, but everything in Tribeca is. My group of 6 enjoyed a hardy brunch for $136, with mostly soft drinks in the beverage section. The table was very pleased with the food, ranging from clam chowder to fluffy pancakes. Despite facing an army of demanding mommies and their overindulged children, the staff was up to the task. One neg - wait time. If you want brunch, get there before 11 if possible, and definitely before 12.

"One of my favorite handheld meals has got to be a shawarma. Now, I like certain carbohydratess thin such as, pizza crusts, tortilla wraps and pitas so in my opinion, Wafa's does it just right. If you like thick breading around your wraps, this might not be the shawarma for you. This place is small, but don't let the size fool you. It's homey and quaint, and the owner (Wafa) just might know your name. The small space has the charm of eating in a friend's mom's kitchen when you were a kid. Wafa's makes one of the best chicken shamarmas I've ever had. All the ingredients are fresh and abundantly wrapped up in a thin, warm pita. The chicken breast is grilled and sliced, the veggies and tzatziki sauce gives it that perfect crunch and tang. Let's not forget the hot sauce. SPICY!  (Tip: Even Wafa's suggestion to have it mild was a bit hot on my scale. And I enjoy spicy food. ) And, it's huge! They also make lamb shawarmas which is also tasty. You lamb lovers know who you are. There are plenty of other dishes to try. Once, the lady, saw that we were contemplating which appetizers to try and offered to make a sample platter for us. Score! It was delicious. I especially loved the grape leaves. She even gave us a free piece of baklava at the end of our meal. I'm sure this was an uncommon treat seeing that it was near closing time. She might have just wanted to clear it away for the day. So if you're ever in this neck of the woods, head over to Wafa's for some delicious Lebanese/Middle Eastern bites. Afterward, you can walk to the multiplex around the corner... $6.00 matinees! Do you feel me?!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"* Namaste from India. Okay, so Woorijip has been on my to-do list for a long time. Really wanted to check out their buffet boxes, but somehow it was overlooked. Finally, I checked it out for todays lunch. * Initially I had apprehensions about how it might taste, but yeah the first bite of the Chicken & Kimbap box allayed my fears. Kimbap (the Korean version of sushi) was neat. The fried chicken pieces had a sweet and tangy flavor to it. Somehow it reminded me of the Indian bhel having a similar taste. The dish came with cold cucumber soup. * Somehow after finishing the first box, I felt like trying out some new dish. So I went for the Korean sausage box. It was nicely mixed with cabbage and spices. Neat again. * The 2 boxes were very filling for about 11 bucks. Good tasty delicious food makes me sleepy though and my post-lunch productivity definitely takes a hit. Hey but I swear the lunch was superhit. Will definitely come back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I gave this two stars because I have definitely experienced better- even in my own home, and I would have saved myself a decent amount of money. I really had much higher expectations for this place, because fried tater tots and gooey greasy grilled cheese; how could you go wrong? Apparently....very, very wrong. I can say that the customer service here is very friendly. I mean, just kids, but they didn't have any attitude, and they were helpful. I always like when a cashier rereads our orders back to us, because it eliminates any potential mistakes. There were a lot of negatives: -It's not a real restaurant, just a store front, basically a good truck minus the wheels, Lol. I guess I wasn't expecting that, and as a result, there were no tables to sit at since it was an open area full of tables occupied by tourists or people relaxing after work. Of course, they had no food, but their asses were taking up seats anyway! But we made do and sat along some benches. I don't mind slumming it but if I wanted a meal on a bench or along the marble like bench structures surrounding the area, I could have gotten a hot dog and a soda, for under 5 bucks. -A lukewarm can of Coke. Maybe they don't have a fridge or a cooler large enough to accommodate cold beverages. Who wants a lukewarm can of Coke with hot grilled cheese sandwiches on a humid summer day, after a long day of work no less? Luckily, the girl knew this without me saying anything aloud- she told me to wait as she got a cup of ice. I really appreciated that. -Cold, coagulated cheese between two slices of Chewy bread AKA, my classic grilled cheese sandwich with maple syrup bacon. FYI, they were stingy with both the bacon and cheese. I couldn't taste much of either those ingredients between the bread slices. But the worst part of this place was their timing; I had a feeling they cooked this either before, or during the cooking of the tater tots, but tater tots take longer to cook. So the sandwiches were just sitting around, getting cold. And cooked bread gets chewy fast, if it's not eaten quickly enough. And cold, hardening cheese in between? Yeah...I could have nuked some bread slices in the microwave and slapped in two cold slices of cheese in between...IF I wanted to eat at home, or have sub par grilled cheese sandwiches. Again, a helluva lot cheaper. ****The only good thing were the tater tots. They were cooked PERFECTLY. Warm/hot, crispy and golden on the outside, cooked 100% on the inside. The only sucky part was their sprinkling of parmesan cheese on the top. I either didn't read the menu carefully enough or that was their way of making it fancy, but not everyone likes the taste. It has a lot more flavor than regular cheddar. I would have preferred them plain. I may be open to trying the other location in the village, but for now I won't be coming back.

"This was our first dinner with Lebanese food in NYC. I had tried Lebanese in other countries and was very much looking forward to this experience. We were not disappointed. Atmosphere. Contemporary and somewhat stylish but not too much to keep ""normally"" dressed people away from the restaurant. For those that like to have a drink before or after a very inviting lounge area around a nice bar. Service. No complaints here either. Very attentive staff. Good counsel on the wine choice (try the Lebanese red wine which is great!) and the menu that sometimes requires translation. Quality of food. Outstanding. We had the appetizers to share which we very much liked (even our 14 year old daughter). The fresh Pita right out of the oven was delicious with all those starters. The entrees very good as well. Try the Lebanese rice on the side! We will be back. Great food, service and atmosphere at acceptable prices.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Service at this place is horrendous and this wasn't just on one occasion.  I've tried to look past the terrible treatment because of their xiaolong bao(soup dumplings) but after my last visit I'm never going back. The teacups were sticky and one of them had lipstick on it.  We had to wait 20 minutes for our appetizer and this was when there were only 3 groups of people in the restaurant.  Their food is not good enough to tolerate the extremely poor service and filthy drink ware.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Decided to go with a friend for a late lunch, had not been here in a long time. We were seated brought water and given time to look over he menu. Being that I had not been in some time I did not know what to pick the waiter recommended the Buffalo chicken sandwich, my friend ordered the turkey burger. I also opted to go with the sweet potato fries for the up charge, when our orders came, I was immediately disappointed because I thought the chicken would have been grilled, it was fried and the pieces were small and flat barely any chicken and buffalo sauce on the side. In addition my sweet potato fries were these really thick wedges not my and didn't seem fried more so baked or pan fried. My friend was not pleased with the turkey burger well more so the cheddar cheese on it. Overall the service I can say I was somewhat pleased not sure when I will revisit or if I will.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First off let me say that I LOVE the food here.  The stracci is amazing, and the beautiful ribbons of prosciutto are mouthwatering.  This is one of my go to places for birthdays, out of town guests, or a special date night.  The reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because of the service.  This is the second time I have taken someone here for their birthday, and the second time they did not even acknowledge the birthday after I told the hostess to let the server know it was a birthday dinner. One nice surprise of this dinner was that a food runner mistakenly brought us a meatball appetizer (very tasty) and was happy to let us keep it after we told him we didn't order it. But like I mentioned earlier, service wasn't great.  It was pretty slow and our table seemed like an after thought.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My review is for dinner here, not brunch The interior is nice, with a sizable bar as soon as you walk in, followed by the dining area. Reservations here are recommended, we got our table right away, but it was very crowded when we got there so assuming the wait would be long without one. The food: -Pork nuggets - exactly as they sound, were tender and flavorful and came with a delicious spicy green sauce -Green tomatoes - consensus out our whole table was that these were completely flavorless, i've had fried green tomatoes at just about every place i could think of and these were the worst, should not be on the menu -Wings - Nothing mind blowing but had good flavor, were smoky, and came with a delicious white sauce Cocktails - tried about 4 of them and all were good Entrees: -Burger - Perfect, juicy, flavorful meat and good bun -Steak - literally 4 tiny medallions plus 3 tiny potatoes, you know its an issue when your friends are monitoring their potato to meat fork ratio. -Shrimp and grits - did not look like the pictures of the brunch grits, but was still pretty good. Grits were in cake form which made it interesting Overall the service here was pretty slow, the food was just okay overall, and the 5 of us ended up driving to get pizza after, because only the two people with burgers got full.

"Writing a five star review for Mighty Quinn's feels like throwing some small kindling on a giant bonfire.  But I'm just checking in to agree with everyone. Th BBQ here is solid- it only comes drenched in sauce if you choose to douse it yourself (and their sauce is KILLER, so I say go for it).  The ribs fall right off the bone, and the brisket is nice and juicy.  Additionally, pretty much everything on the menu -minus the sweet potato thing and a few of their seasonal salads- is safe for celiacs.  Rejoice!","[1.0, 0.0]"
We were looking for somewhere near our theatre before the show for dinner. We used to come here ~20 years ago either before or after a show. Back then if you wanted the burger you'd have to ask for it since it wasn't even on the menu. It was good then but weren't sure how it would hold up. It was even better than we remembered. We started with the guacamole and endive. What an amazing idea to serve it with guacamole. The guacamole was as good as any Mexican restaurant. We both had bacon cheddar burgers that were one of the best in the city and I've made a personal journey to try all the best here. We split the chocolate pudding cake for dessert. Simply incredible. We'll be back and not even when we're going to the theatre. Highly recommended.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
It's a neighborhood place- people come to hangout.  They serve good food and great wine.  The decor is rustic and warm.  Sounds like just another hole in the wall?  I think better than that.  Most people say UES is stuffy but not so at Uva.  The place gets really crowded and front / bar area is hopping.  The crowd is 30 something professionals and I really enjoyed the friendly conversations.  That is enough to get someone back there again. One thing about it was the bar and the restaurant are actually separate business so the taps are separated.  Weird set up.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

Where Carino's goes from 3 to 4 stars for me is the service. The staff is willing and able to answer any of your questions about the food, but most importantly the tequila. I learned quite a bit about this spirit by talking to the bartender and trying the tequilas that he suggested. At the end of the night, he had an on-the-house nightcap with us.

"As the night cooled down, it was the perfect weather for a ramen-filled evening. Being in Brooklyn, the list was short and Chuko was on top. The girlfriend approved. The wait was a bit on the longer side, 30-40 minutes (fully packed, people hanging outside) but all was well once our order started arriving. The pork bun was as soft as freshly-made dough with juicy slices of pork inside. The chicken wings well-fried with just the right amount of crunch (and seasoned adequately) and then, the miso ramen came. We basked in it's broth-appearance;  the pieces of tender roasted pork floating leisurely, a poached egg teasing us to poke it vigorously and the noodles wanting to perform acrobatics on our chopsticks (the fork could only watch this time). A spectacle for the mouth! But then the chilli sauce (?) made an appearance and with a droplet or two light up our tongues (in a good kind of way)   Chuko, my heart & stomach request another visit.

"I honestly don't understand why some reviews mention the ""atmosphere"" when critiquing, but Trattoria does have an especially beautiful and serene interior for a NY restaurant.  The servers were friendlier than in most upscale places as well. Swankiness aside, the food was very memorable, particularly the eggplant tapenade (Eggplant can taste buttery?) and lamb osso buco.  Unluckily for me, both of those dishes belonged to my mom. Although I was excited to see ribollita on the menu, it didn't compare to traditional (re: I'm a huge snob and spent a semester in Italy).  The spaghetti with clams was al dente, but the sauce could have done with more garlic and white wine.  Then again, lack of garlic and wine is always my complaint.  The lemon dessert at the end might have pulled it out: It's so rich and tart that people almost won't make fun of you for not ordering something with chocolate because apparently not liking chocolate makes you some kind of a freak, jerks. Final analysis: Better than Babbo. P.S. Pretend it's your birthday. They put ~*~sparklers~*~ in the cake and sing a round of ""Happy Birthday, Dear Stranger.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
"These guys make some of the best pizza in NYC by far.  Their fresh ingredients and home made sauce is to DIE for.  Their brick oven is part of why it's so darn good (regular ovens don't get hot enough to cook pizza to its full potential).  The staff is also very friendly.  Another great thing about this place is that they sell pizza by the slice as opposed to whole pies like some other brick/coal oven pizzerias.  Their Sicilian squares are probably the best I've had... yup, better than Spumoni Gardens in Bay Ridge!.  Their margherita slice is also top notch and my new favorite:  VODKA SAUCE PIZZA!

"Piccolo Angolo, I thank you for a really wonderful night. My family (about 10ppl) was seated right away for our 5pm reservation. The place is TINY, so reservations are a must. We got started with delicious garlic bread and the house red wine. Since there were so many of us we got a few of the appetizers: baked clams, Caprese Insalta (with buratta) and calamari. The calamari was not fried it was cooked in a fra diavolo (spicy sauce). It wasn't chewy or gummy and tasted like fresh calamari should taste. It was one of my favorite dishes of the night. My second favorite dish was the lobster canneloni in vodka sauce. Good size portion and there was ALOT of lobster for a very inexpensive price. When I go back, which I will, I will be ordering that again. My family ordered dishes ranging from chicken francese to steak to both Shrimp dishes. Everyone was completely satisfied and stuffed....but everyone made room for dessert. Chocolate Chip cheesecake and the tartufo were my personal favorites making it the perfect italian ""dolce"" ending to a splendid Italian evening.

"What a great little restaurant tucked into an otherwise residential part of Fort Greene. I came here for dinner with a girlfriend on a Tuesday and we were seated right away. The decor is charming and has plenty of personality - the bar is decorated with ornate mosaic Spanish tiles, high ceilings and livened up even more with big potted palms beside a few of the tables. I had a few of the Oleopolitan cocktails, which were delicious and refreshing. I love the tapas style menu so you can sample a bunch of different things, but they also have big entrees if you're looking for something more hearty. The paellas were calling out to me, but we didn't want to over-order - another dish for another time. We ended up sharing the Spanish poutine, falafel crusted artichoke hearts, salmon rillettes, and Tuscan kale salad. Great sized portions! I loved their take on classic poutine - the gravy was creamy and well-spiced, and the crispy pieces of chorizo on top added a nice crunch. The falafel crusted artichoke hearts were a nice unique dish, and the kale salad was simple but tasty with tangy grated pecorino cheese and toasty pine nuts. The salmon rillettes, a special that night, were delicious! The big salmon chunks were seasoned in a nice lemony yet creamy sauce, and they were served with fresh sliced cucumbers and toasted pita triangles. For all this food and three drinks each, the bill came out to $50 each which was totally reasonable considering we probably had about $30 in drinks alone.

We came in with a reservation for a large party and would have preferred that our tables were available and not wait.  The service was a little slow.   BUT The food was so good and the choices of beer and wine so lovely, that we forgot about the rest of it and we are coming back with another party in a month!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Vegetarian group of 4 - we visited the place recently for dinner. Our group showed up late by 20 mins, but it was a monday and they still helped us out. Kudos there. However, every item we ordered was horrible. -Paneer tikka where the paneer was very lightly grilled. needed a bit more there. -Palak Paneer was the worst I have ever tasted. no flavour whatsoever. -Jaipur kofta was basically a bhajiya with gravy on it. If you are Indian and vegetarian, please avoid with a plague. -Lassi was so spicy that it had to be returned -Naan and Roti were not up to grade Just like many other places in NYC (Masala times is another similar place as well), I find a stark difference between indian and non-indian clients at these kind of places. Please avoid if you are Indian.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yes.. This is THE ONE & ONLY Halal Cart to go to Yes... Across the street is the same guys/co. and you DO NOT have to sit on that ridiculous line The white sauce is key and nobody (that I know of) can figure out the ingredients The Hot/Red sauce is REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HOT... No seriously you'll start tearing, hallucinating and maybe visualize the devil --SIDE STORY-- On one occasion, I saw a cute girl grab the hot sauce bottle as I was pouring some white sauce on my platter... Immediately I warned her about how HOT it is, and she just gave me this drunk nasty grin as I was trying to kick game to her. So what she does is completely ignore my friendly gesture and squirts 2 complete rings around the platter! for her sake I wanted to jump across and slap the bottle out of her hand... But instead I said ""That was a mistake, you just ruined your plate."" So she ignored me again and left... But as she was walking away I kept an eye on her.. AND WHAT HAPPENED?! She took her first bite and it was like a phantom punch to the face ***POW*** threw her plastic fork down and started coughing uncontrollably (Punk) If you like hot sauce just put in a dab... its enough -TRUST- Tip don't come here sober.... its so much better inebriated","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you get one pizza while you're in New York, make it this one. I've been to several pizza joints all over the city, and I have to say this is the best one (also the most unique). A lot of them do a boring pizza very well, or have some interesting combinations, but this place has it all. Maybe it's something with the bricks, or more likely the water, but whatever it is, this place is second to none when it comes to Brooklyn's finest. There almost always a wait, but it's not usually too bad. Parking is limited (who has a car in NY anyway?!), but if you're staying in Manhattan, take the train down to the financial district and walk across the Brooklyn bridge. It's probably a two-mile walk from the beginning of the bridge Manhattan-side, but I always feel better after walking there and back because I know I'm going to house the better half of a pizza. I love pizza in general and I'm really picky about my pizza, so trust me when I say you've got to go here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friend and I came here the other day for dinner. We were so excited because we heard that the chefs here used to work at Il Mullino where they cooked for big names such as President Obama and Clinton. The atmosphere was so romantic and quite with a candle and a rose on each table. We couldn't wait to choose the seats at backyard. The staff were so attentive and cute. When I couldn't remember the name of the cocktail I wanted to order, they created one according to my description and it was exactly what I wanted!! As we were not too familiar with Italian cuisine, the staff explained everything and really made us feel at home. My friend ordered Beef carpaccio as appetizer and Branzino as main dish. I ordered Broccoli rape as appetizer and Lobster as main dish. The food was exquisite and delicious and we never felt alone because the staff would always be there to take good care of us. I could still remember that they quickly took the bone out of the branzino, which was so thoughtful. You could easily see that everything was with high standard and quality. This is definitely a place for a date, anniversary, party, family reunion, business, etc. I could imagine this will be a perfect place for a romantic proposal with many roses and delicate wines. lol~~~ I can't wait to come back again with my friends! ^-^","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mediocre chicken sandwich The server told me that the chicken is marinated in tabasco and buttermilk Yuk! The marinade drowns out the flavor of the chicken. The biscuit was soft but needed a tad more butter and salt; the gravy, likewise. The crunchy, cooked purple cabbage was the tastiest part of the sandwich.  Makes me wonder why there are so many reviewers raving about this sandwich. I surmise that the reviewers come from homes where fried chicken is not a specialty.  My parents and grandparents were from Harlem, where fried chicken is King. The space inside is narrow and has one bar and a table to sit.  The place is suited for take out. However, I will not come here again.   It is not worth the time or money","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Last week, I booked a private party at Take Root to celebrate my birthday. I brought ten people together, most of whom did not know each other well, to gather around a table and share a meal. I can safely say that this experience was  amazing not just for the fantastic food (which was probably the best I have ever eaten), but for the impeccable service as well as undeniable bonding that took place while collectively sharing in this unique experience. Anna warmly greeted me when I arrived, her beauty matching the decor of the space perfectly. Freshly seasoned pop corn was placed on the table spiced with Elise's secret ""pickled"" flavor to snack on as I waited for the rest of the guests to arrive. Amazing music was playing in the background, a playlist I am certain as the night went on was purposefully selected to accompany each bite. With every course I was continuously more amazed. Anna was gracious, making sure we were comfortable and not in need of refills of water or wine. She was the perfect blend of funny and serious whenever she came to the table, sharing anecdotes about her and Elise's trials and tribulations with opening the space as well as her opinions on the food she was placing in front of us, all around a fantastic server. Elise came out from the kitchen to explain to us the inspiration behind every course, a thought process I had never thought about until that night -- why she chose each specific flavor, color, or texture, the way she went about conceiving each dish like a writer with a pad by her bedside for when inspiration hit in the middle of the night. Now, I am an eater. I am known to consume every bite on my plate without so much as a thought to the experience, shocked when I look down to find the food is all gone. Elise's mastery in the kitchen had me pausing between bites, savoring every morsel and experiencing food not just as sustenance, but as an art. Take Root Truly redefined my relationship with eating. Anna and Elise are inspirational, not just to young and strong entrepreneurial women, but to the LGBT community at large. Their love for one another along with their dedication to the credo of bringing people together in their love of food is going to leave a lasting impression on Brooklyn. This is the way things are supposed to be: artistic, elegant, and filled with love.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My husband and I thought we would give Freemans another try since our first visit was quite fun and enjoyable.  What a mistake.  We decided we would sit at the back bar where during our first visit the male bartender was friendly, efficient and welcoming.  Not the case the second time around. From the moment we sat down the female bartender greeted us with a frown which never left her face and set the tone for what was to be our abbreviated and perhaps last visit.  As we looked at the drink menu she threw several empty liquor bottles into a nearby garbage can with a loud crash.  When the drinks arrived, both signature cocktails, she couldn't get one of them to catch fire so she just threw the lemon peel in the drink and walked away. We had hoped to have several drinks and dinner, but by this time we were getting really uncomfortable.  She never came back to ask us if we wanted another cocktail and never asked if we wanted anything to eat.  What a disappointment. It ruined the evening for us and cost Freemans a hundred bucks + and two potential loyal, local customers.  Comments about ""surly"" service should be heeded.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A friend of mine took me here a few weekends ago when I came to Williamsburg to check out the area and see an apartment that I was thinking of moving into.  As soon as we walked in, I felt at home.  It's small, intimate and cozy... not to mention packed, which is a good sign!  We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table since it was a Saturday night and we found a spot at the bar and ordered a pitcher of Sangria.  The bartender misunderstood us and only poured two glasses instead of setting us up with a pitcher.  We mentioned it to her that we wanted a pitcher and she apologized, made us a pitcher and then told us she wouldn't charge us for the two glasses she initially poured - that was very nice!   We sat down and although the tables are small and close together, it  managed to feel intimate.  The music was Spanish and amazing as well and all of the waitresses had accents.  We asked ours where she was from and she's actually from Argentina.  Gotta love it when the employees are authentic.   I ordered the corn-fed pork chop with carmalized apples and vanilla glaze.  My friend ordered the lamp chops with chipotle BBQ - both dishes were fantastic!!  We also ordered the avocado fries and shishito peppers to start, both of which were amazing!  We ended up hanging out until they were about to close, it was that great of an atmosphere.  I fell in love with this place and so last night I went back into Williamsburg with another friend of mine and took her there to share the experience. This time, I ordered the short-rib with malbec reduction, oh my!  The meat just fell off the bone and it was served with a mashed potato dish that tasted a little bit like sweet potatoes.  My friend ordered the chicken roulade stuffed with spinach and proscuitto which was also delicious.  We had a bottle of Malbec with for $32 was a terrific value for the way it tasted.  Again, the music was amazing and the waitress was adorable.  This is already a favorite. The best part?  When the bill came it was $81!!  For two people to eat an entree each, 2 apps and a bottle of wine.  Can't beat that!  Another cute thing they do, is hand you the bill paper clipped to a postcard that has El Almacen on it with pictures of horseback riders.  I've been saving the postcards and plan to make some sort of collage out of them, they are very cute.   I can't wait to go back!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

People are always asking for comparisons to the now commercial 53rd & 6th Halal Guys in the city.  As previously mentioned the big difference is in the spices the meat itself is cooked with  as opposed to the latter cart's flavor coming mainly from their infamous hot sauce.  Also, they throw in a sample of their staple falafel ball along with pickled radishes to give your taste buds a nice contrast. My usual order is the Junior combo with bismati rice for 7 measly bucks.  An added bonus with this cart is being located right outside of a grocery store parking lot which makes it easy for those that drive, something not normally found when dealing with street meat.  Just come with cash and an insatiable appetite and you're good !

"I have not had a good experience at this restaurant and I was a local.  First, I had been taking breakfast and lunch and meeting with people for several days, and working on my computer for several hours a day.  The ""café"" is generally occupied at 15% capacity except weekends.  My bills were usually quite high because I would eat and other people with whom I would meet would also eat.   So you can imagine the fees which, though I was sitting in a mostly empty café, were over $100 for a five or six hour period of time.   However, recently  while I was eating lunch, the restaurant was somewhat busy, not at all full and  the owner of the restaurant came up to me and said, ""You know we are not part of the hotel.""  I looked at him and said, ""Yes, I am aware of this"".  He continued, ""I don't mind that you stay here but when we are busy you cannot"".  I responded, ""But I am ordering food and eating...""--I had just been served my meal.  The gist of the conversation was that because I am a regular (I am living at the hotel in the midst of moving house) I am differently treated, a posture I find curious since he relies heavily on this hotel for his morning business and then tosses us when it gets busy even though we are eating, just like the other clients. The whole scenario was bizarre. To be frank, I am a New Yorker, I know how business in restaurants works and have worked for many years an underground restaurant critic, at times I am even hired by owners of restaurants to critique the service and food in their own establishments.   So you can imagine  how  I was shocked at this owner's attitude toward me when I was his client, consuming and leaving hefty tips.  It seems that the owner of the Café Gitane is quite content to toss out the guests of the hotel and I imagine those who consume less than a tableful of Fashion Week victimistas-- even if we are eating (I was eating a soup $9 and salad $14 with drinks when he told me this).  As someone who has lived and dined all over the world, I find this posture horrifying and greedy.  I am quite aware that had I not been consuming her could have even asked me to leave his establishment. But the attitude was really one directed at people who are regulars, and there is a clear discrimination against people who are not in large groups and who are not fashion victims. Waiting for friends to arrive, I noticed a pampering of the ""elite"".   It seems this ""bistro"" doesn't know what it wants to be--it calls itself a ""café"", wants clients of the Petrus, has food that is not spectacularly excellent and doesn't realize that its best clients will be its regulars who would be more forgiving about the food if the attitude were not so haughty.  After all, I would tell my friends not to go there just out of the sheer rudeness towards certain clients.   We need to frequent businesses that treat clients with kindness and respect.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to Queens Kickshaw a couple times now and I have to say it's quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in my neighborhood. Kickshaw reminds me of a coffee shop you'd find in hipster central, down to the industrial/rustic interior and the a-little-bit-of-everything music. It's a hip, chill spot to stop in for a coffee or to gather a group of friends for a laid-back brunch. When I'm there, I always see people hanging out with their laptops and books so it's probably a nice place to study too.   Want a cool and refreshing drink? Give the ICED MATCHA GREEN TEA a try. yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… Are you a chocolate lover? Kickshaw's HOT CHOCOLATE is rich but not overly sweet. yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… How about something unconventional? Their BLUEBERRY SHRUB is made from pickled blueberries that they make in house. yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… Or maybe you just want coffee. Kickshaw has it all: espresso, cappuccino, latte, macchiato, and more. If you're hungry, Kickshaw has an eclectic list of gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches. So far my favorite is the FONTINA VAL D'AOSTA (marinated mushrooms and basil pesto open-face on focaccia with green salad and toasted pine nuts). yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… Melted cheese conceals the mushrooms and pesto on top of the focaccia slices - definitely not your traditional grilled cheese and oh-so-tasty. The simple green salad with pine nuts was also delish. I think it's awesome that the salads that come with each sandwich are different to match the different ingredients. The GRUYERE (pickled and caramelized onions on rye with napa cabbage-caraway slaw) was also good, if not a little sweet. yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… The GOUDA (black bean hummus, guava jam, pickled jalapeños on brioche with green salad and jalapeño vinaigrette) is great for people who like a little spice. yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… With so many great sandwich choices, I won't be ordering the CHEDDAR & MOZZARELLA (brioche with tomato soup) again. yelp.com/biz_photos/YAQk… The grilled cheese was alright but I didn't enjoy the tomato soup at all. It was just roughly blended tomatoes and it was like eating pasta sauce. A creamy tomato soup would have been the perfect complement to the grilled cheese.

"I do not typically write reviews but after my experience at Parker & Quinn I felt that it would be a great disservice to the restaurant not to. My husband and I had such a wonderful time dining here a few weeks ago while on our first trip to The Big Apple. It was recommended to us by some friends who live in NYC, near Parker & Quinn. It was a fairly busy place and the bar was loud but we enjoyed people watching and the energy level was intoxicating. Laura was our waitress and she provided perhaps the best service that I've ever experienced. She was personable and charming but also knowledgeable on the menu. My husband eats gluten-free so we had plenty of annoying questions for her however, she didn't seem bothered nor annoyed. She cheerfully suggested a few of their signature cocktails and then wine that paired well with our entrees. Despite being obviously busy and fighting through the crowded bar to tend to her tables, Laura was attentive and observant to our needs. Our food was almost as good as the service. We shared the octopus appetizer, which had so many different and unique flavors.  I had the scallops for my entrée and they literally melted in my mouth.

"Based on reviews here we decided to give a visit to Caracas Arepa Bar. Can't say we were disappointed, but at the same time I don't really get the amazing reviews on here. The food was alright, but nothing more than that. Arepas are small, but filling, but I couldn't help to think it's a dish you can easily and cheaply make yourself at home. Hibiscus Ice Tea is disgusting. Maybe I just don't like Hibiscus. Whatever that is. The service was good, no complaints there.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at La Sirene.  I think the tininess only adds character and builds an intimate, homey space.

There might be crack in the broth, its rather addicting.  The service was also great.  I guess its hard to go unattended when everything's a foot away but she was always there to refill our wine glasses.  The only con I have about this place are the entrees - the meat options are pretty much just plates of sliced meat.  My lamb was slightly overdone for medium and bland.  I liked my friend's duck.  The dessert was awesome - profiteroles, very good to share.

"This month, I went on my ramen quest. My ultimate ramen experience was in Japan, and people keep telling me that it's hard to find the same quality over here. That being said, I reconsidered my expectations as to looking for the next best thing. Ippudo is like an elite ramen house, almost impossible to get into. The first time I tried to sample the fare, they told me there was a 3 hour wait. (this was around 8 o'clock) Finally, I got into Ippudo without the 3 hour wait. We went here around 5:30pm and got seated almost immediately. It was already starting to get full around that time and that gives more justification to how awesome Ippudo is. I tried the Akamaru Modern Ramen with the soft-boiled egg. The tonkotsu broth was rich, delicious and not overly salty. It had a familiar taste to the Filipino ""batchoy"" dish. The noodles were on the thin side. (Momofuku noodles win by a slight margin) But overall, the Akamaru lives up to its name. You have to mix the broth and noodles with all the other toppings for a complete, amazing experience. If you're a ramen newbie, this one is a definite must-try. My friend tried the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen which was pretty much a spicier version of the Kogashi Miso Ramen. I've never tried a Miso Ramen before and I thought that it would taste like miso broth. I could probably be wrong about my idea of a miso ramen but this one, I certainly didn't taste the miso. The broth was dark, thick and spicy, with a bed of oil on top which my friend found a little disconcerting. I've had spicier broth before but this was enough to get you sweating. The hirata pork buns were gorgeous. The pork was not as fatty as the ones at Momofuku and they use mayo and a special sweet-spicy sauce. The sauce begins sweets and leaves a spicy note in your mouth. Food was amazing, they had good sized portions for what you're paying and the ambiance is cool, hip and upbeat. The only downside is the wait, and for me that's very hard to overlook. The staff would yell welcome in Japanese and only a couple of them were Japanese so that was a little weird. In a perfect world, you can get in Ippudo and be seated within 5 minutes. But it's not. Is it worth the 3 hour wait? Maybe if you had something else to do, or you can walk around the city for 3 hours. I would probably just go earlier. Nobody makes me wait for my ramen. :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

This time, ordered 1/2 mushroom and half jalapeno.   The cheese has become extremely oily and the pizza very greasy overall.  The sauce is not even tasty either.  I hadn't been back in about 5 months after a similar experience.  For an $18 thin crust pizza, it should be fantastic and I was again, seriously let down.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ok so i NEVER write reviews but have promised myself I would for this unbelievable hidden gem in our hood. We LOVE this place they seriously have the best brunch i have ever tried in NYC. This includes everywhere i have tried in the meat packing and soho.... Love the space outside and even there regular coffee is delicious. Now it may sound like im raving about this place but I AM... and FYI I am a very fussy restaurant person, not proud of it but Ny can have that affect. The only downside is that they are not open on Saturdays for Brunch, which is a real shame as there is no where else that offers this standard of food and ambiance in Sunnyside. I do feel that this place is still undiscovered and I hope that as the word spreads they will consider opening on Sat morning. Now this is only a brunch review as Ive not done dinner here but we are planning too very soon. Food recommendations so far are: eggs benedict = perfect and goats cheese omlete= perfect oh and i have a sweet tooth so the yogurt, granola and dried fruit is a perfect compliment to the savoury. Just one tip quaint... please keep the portions generous they have been getting gradually smaller every visit.....

"Let me make this clear,  this four stars are for the the Shanghai dumplings only.  Now with that said,  in to the review.   This place is known for their dumplings so it was a no brainer to stop here since I was in NYC for the week (so sad that it was only a week,  oh why can't I be richer! ?) We ordered the dumplings, Shanghai noodles and red bean flat cake thingy (I forget what it was called exactly). The dumplings were as praised. They were huge,  full with soup, and everything about them was good.  The rest of our food was pretty bad.  The noodle and red beam cake were so oily and tasteless that we didn't even care to finish them. After l leaving all I could think about was how stupid I was for not ordering just the dumplings but instead wasted my stomach room for crappy middle and red bean cake.  So the very next day I came back for more,  except this time I only ordered the dumplings.  I'm so proud of myself lol If you are a fan of Shanghai dumplings then this is the place to go!  Also they charge a 15% service fee on everything regardless of your party size or how much you order.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was mildly difficult to eat here as a vegan (but the place is called The Spotted Pig, so fair enough).  I ended up ordering a mixed vegetable plate which had beets in it (which I hate, but remember, no alterations...) but I thought I could just eat around them.  Wrong.  They were all cooked together and so the beets flavored everything else and I couldn't finish the plate.  Probably should have just ordered a bunch of sides for dinner but whatever...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If I had to choose one word that describes how I feel about Room Service, it would be DISAPPOINTED. Don't get me wrong, the ambiance can definitely fool you when you walk into the restaurant: chandeliers, perfectly matched gray hues that mesh into the floors, furniture and bar... You think you're going to be wow'ed. A friend of mine who works for the same company as I chose this in hopes to be able to plan a departamental function. So, what better way to try it out than on our lunch break with a friend new to the area. I wish I could write, the service was great, or that the food was amazing. I CAN write about how I walked in when there were no other tables filled, saw the restaurant get packed and die down again WITHOUT A MOUTHFUL OF FOOD. I CAN write that I asked for a manager 4 times and all that was getting told to me was ""oh you're food's coming"" with nothing to show for it. And I can CERTAINLY write about how we were flat out denied an audience of a manager from a waiter. I can also say I had to order from another Thai place and eat at my desk after using my hour lunch break waiting for them.

Came here for brunch on a Tuesday morning. This place is packed so i'm sure on the weekends there is probably a wait. Luckily we got a seat right away.

"We went to another Italian restaurant the day before which was superb (a block away, newly opened at the same price range)! So our expectations was quite high. It stated good with the owner (I think) welcomed us and got us a nice table and he was very polite. The waiters on the other hand was running and they were very stressed. I asked them to level our table since it was standing on uneven ground, they rush in and put a napkin under the table and rushed away without checking wether or not it was fixes, which it wasn't so I had to call him over again to fix it. We ordered an appetiser and main course. While we were waiting (not very long) the waiters kept on running around and being super stressed, I saw them poor wine over a table and knocked down a jug of water in a stroller, luckily there were no child in it. The whole atmosphere was stressed and not very pleasant. The appetiser was not very good, can olives, can artichokes along with a bland salad (I don't think any Italian would be proud if that appetiser). The main course came out just minutes before we had ended the appetiser which gave us the impression that the main course wasn't given the attention that proper cooked food need, and we were correct - this was the most bland and tasteless pasta that I think I have had since school. It didn't taste anything like the pastas we have had the other day. When I told the waiter that this wasn't a very good dish he just went away. After a while the owner came by and I had to tell him again what I though about the dish and he apologised. When the bill came they had deducted one of the main courses, which was a nice gesture, but on the other hand that dinner experience had left us with a bad taste for the rest of that evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"First stop on the barhopping train for an amiga's bday. Crowded and dark inside, decent ambience, near impossible to get the bartender's attention, moderate amount of dancing in the back, okay music. There was a sticky moment when my friend ordered a drink and the bartender told her that she needed to order a specific amount in order to pay with her card. Say what? We had an entire night to party and order more drinks so we were like okay, and the bartender said that she needed to hold onto my friend's card. Not okay. It took about ten minutes for us to get her attention again so we could just pay with cash. I'd recommend NOT EVER using your credit/debit here cuz it's way too risky with that many ppl smushed up against the register and surrounding bar. Mark my words, just bring cash. Definitely coming back here though to try their food. I think this place deserves a better rating, but for now I'll stick with the 3 stars until I try again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"we were in Manhattan to eat last week, and this is the place i picked for friday night.  it seemed to have a reasonable reputation, and i had high enough hopes.  hopes that were quickly dashed.   there was something seriously wrong at the restaurant on this night.  when all was said and done, we had the distinct impression that several key players at the restaurant had died that very day and had been quickly replaced with local actors.  no one save the sommelier and one of the side waiters had even the slightest clue what they were doing, and it looked as if the hostess had been crying. we were seated in the lower basement level, and were repeatedly treated to the sound of crashing plates.  a door opened right onto our table and waiters passing through repeatedly bumped my chair.  we had ordered the smaller tasting menu, which turned into a three+ hour endurance match.  wine pairings were ordered with each course, but we had to literally beg to have them brought out - so by the time we got the pairing for the course, the food had been sitting out long enough to become cool from that aforementioned drafty door. course arrivals were spaced out erratically - at first rather quickly, but then with exceedingly long waits in front of empty un-removed plates. the people around us were experiencing similar feats of non-service and were alternately agitated and demoralized by the ordeal. one older gentleman was repeatedly asking for his check - from literally every member of the staff that came anywhere near.  and it took a good hour before he was finally given it.  someone involved with the restaurant seemed to know things were seriously screwed up and attempted to assuage every table around us with a complimentary creme brulee.. but this was on top of the already large quantity of dessert course served.  and the salvers of mignardines and whatnot.  the food rates the barest of mentions, really.  as everyone else says, the porcini 'flan' (more of a thickened crab soup really) was pretty good.  a lobster dish was tasty enough but rather tough.  a farm egg wrapped in prosciutto was unusual but not particularly appetizing.  a bit of duck breast was reasonably well prepared.  wines (late arrivals all) were not bad. but i'm honestly surprised i remember the food at all considering the ridiculously poor service.   i am sure that this was a fluke, and that we just arrived on a really bad night.  but at the prices charged, there should NEVER be a bad night at bouley.  i sincerely hope no one ever has to live through a meal like this there again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Aww, I love little hole in the wall ethnic restaurants! Interesting, I don't usually like Chinese food - with the exception of dim sum. My coworkers have been ordering steamed dumplings lately and even though I am not (usually) eating meat, I made an exception today and got both a pork bun and pork steamed dumplings. Both were excellent and of a quality of the better places in Chinatown. I did feel a little bad - I took my friend with me, and she ordered the fried dumplings, which were actually fried to a hardened crisp. Fortunately, as I wasn't sure if the buns we ordered were large or small, I ordered ten dumplings and she and I shared (the buns were huge, btw - they were sold out of the 3-in-one-order, which I assume would be smaller, and we got the 1 for $1.25, which is the large size). The steamed pork and chive dumplings were delicious, as was the huge roasted pork bun. Oh and did I mention that everything here is CHEAP? We ate lunch for less than $5 each here - and if the fried dumplings hadn't been so hard, my friend would have come out of it under three dollars. Of course, I have the usual questions about quality, sourcing, etc of such cheap food, and I am met with the usual ""I'm going to selectively ignore this for a second"" attitude I get when it comes to small ethnic restaurants.

Finding good fried chicken in NYC is difficult. Some of the most highly rated options I've tried were no better than the Publix Supermarket deli chicken (although their chicken is great).

The staff is also friendly and keep the long lunch lines moving quickly.

Perfect place for a casual lunch, although can be eerily quiet come dinner time, especially once midtown empties out. The place is quaint and rustic, but very small- seating is hard to get during the lunch rush so definitely seamless it or call and order for pickup. They have student discounts after 3, really affordable dinner specials after 6, and a frequent customer punch card! Also serves beer and wine, along with a great variety of Italian sodas and coffee.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Brickyard Gaastropub is a great place to grab a tasty brew and some tasty morsels in Hell's Kitchen.  They have 24 beers on tap, and 30 bottles to choose from. I've had brunch, bar food, and dinner here.  All of the meals I've had here have been great.  The Irish Bacon is a great addition to any brunch entree, the sliders are tasty, the chicken under a brick is a great dinner option, and the bread pudding is an awesome dessert option to be shared. On every visit, Brian was our bartender and he's always been very attentive and knowledgable about the beers they serve. As far as a great place to enjoy craft beers go, as well as to enjoy a snack or a full meal, the Brickyard Gastropub can't be beat in HK. Cheers!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had a lovely dinner here last night with a friend.  The food was delicious, and the staff was very nice and professional.  They always make sure your water is filled up and even folded up my friend's napkin while he was in the bathroom. We started with an appetizer: the Cockles with chorizo, potato, and scallion, which was $12 and comes with 4 pieces of baguette bread.  The bread is perfect for dipping in the watery sauce that the cockles are sitting in, and they offered to bring us more bread if we needed it. Then, we had the Ribeye Cap (steak) with black truffle butter and garlic fries, which was $28 and delectable.  On the side, we had the Brussel Sprouts with Applewood smoked bacon and dried mission figs, which was $7. They have happy hour from 3:30-6:30, and we got here around 6, so I enjoyed a glass of $6 Prosecco. The only reason this place gets 4 stars and not 5 is because they don't have cocktails - just wine and beer.  (And I love me a cocktail.)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wandered in here for brunch, mouth already watering in anticipation of a succulent burger to cure my traditional Saturday afternoon hangover. Mushroom gruyere burger with caramelized onions ought to do the trick. Take some time to take in the wall of wine bottles before deciding that a more conventional bloody mary is on order - I'll let my companion sample the grapes. Ah, the baby arrives, in all its rare (as in cooked rare) splendor - and it does not disappoint. A gastropub experience to take note of, and the extensive bar holds promise to quite stylish nights, too. Perhaps I would hope for something a bit more creative to complement the excellent burgers, e.g. Saxon + Parole's fabulous blue cheese mayo, but can't complain.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Amazing!! I went last night with a few of my friends and we were all impressed. I didn't think that a neighborhood restaurant could be this good haha. We had 11 dinner dishes and  2 dessert dishes. We got the lobster salad, yellowtail, mussels, scallops, korean bbq wraps, oxtail terrine, pulled-pork sliders, crack & cheese, meatballs, pork belly tacos, fried chicken, rice krispie with the marshmallow ice cream and lychee panna cotta with yuzu buttermilk sorbet. All the food were consistently delicious. My favs were the scallops, pulled-pork sliders and the pork belly tacos. I'm not a big fan of carrots but the carrot puree with the scallops was just so good. I was thrilled to see pork sliders and tacos on the menu and was glad that it did not disappoint. It was just so tender and juciy. I was also blown away by the lychee dessert. I don't like lychee but this was made just right!! It melted in my mouth. I also loved the marshmallow ice cream. It was so different but tasty especially with the rice krispie. They don't sell liquor but the servers said it's coming soon. They also said that the menu is going to change from time to time which I'm excited about. I guess it'll change every season or so which is cool. The staff was extremely friendly so that made my dining experience even better. I hate it when I go to restaurants and the servers are so mean and rude for no apparent reason but it wasn't like that at all. I also enjoyed the music haha. It was smooth listening. Overall the atmosphere was great. It's a great place for an intimate date, a night out with your girlfriends or even a night out with your family. I will definitely be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Not sure if what you're eating is sustainably fished? Wild Edibles, on NYC's east side, just below midtown, has a menu guide denoting the status of each fish on offer - either for you to pull up a chair and have it cooked for you, or to take to your home chef. There are a number of inventive starters and mains (as well as fish prepared simply with your choice of dressing and a side salad), including lobster rolls and a particularly good tuna tartare. There is a small wine list and a number of draft beers on tap that change regularly. The Narragansett Lager was particularly good with the dishes.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I see a lot of Yelpers sucking the mac N cheese' cock, but I'm going to be an individual and talk about the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes. This is like my favorite brunch spot in NY. First time I had the B.R.P.'s, the waiter brought them out and forgot the syrup. I started to throw a BF, but didn't want anyone to think I was being a queen over some syrup, seeing as though this place is in Chelsea.  So I man'd it out and started to eat them without the syrup and found myself saying, ""fuck syrup and it's mother"", because they were that amazingly moist. You know how some pancakes are super dry and you have to choke them down? These pancakes were the opposite. Btw, the truffle mac n cheese smells awful. They don't even use real truffle oil.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great food, great prices!   Located between 5th and 6th avenues (closer to 6th) on 13th street, Da Andrea is a stand out in food and price, especially considering the number of Italian restaurants around the city. I love the fresh focaccia that is brought to the table shortly upon seating. Specials truly leverage what's fresh for the day - if it's available I highly recommend the (chicken or pork) ravioli. If not, I almost always go for the pappardelle with sausage ragu. Then again, don't think you can go wrong with any of the picks as nearly all the pastas are homemade.  I usually bring my meal to a sweet close with the tiramisu - the best in the city.   Truly delicious food at great prices.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"More restaurants should take a cue from this place and name themselves descriptively (and accurately). This place does in fact serve tasty hand-pulled noodles. The only other adjective I would add is ""cheap,"" but that applies to almost any place in Chinatown that isn't Peking Duck House. The noodles are definitely the show here; the broth and accompaniments are pretty meh, but given that a bowl is around $5, it's pretty hard to complain. Depending on when you go, you can actually see them in the kitchen making the noodles. I haven't seen them riding the bamboo pole to flatten out and knead the dough (he he he ...

"Man, from the moment my friends and I discovered this place in the 90's, we were slaves to it. Before Manhattan had morphed into a place where every brain dead chimp was a self-proclaimed foodie because they'd seen the Food Network. Before the Meatpacking District lost its tranny hookers and actual meat packing and was refashioned the Meathead District. Before all of that, this place was the bomb. It was our go to late night spot to grab a bite without losing our buzzes. The first place we brought out of town friends to. And the place we fantasized about when on out-f-town business trips. And even as its reputation quietly grew and the lines became increasingly irritating, the mighty Bistro Burger was always worth it. But, sadly, after an extremely long run, the place is just coasting on its reputation now. I still go every few months out of a combination of habit and wishful thinking, but the burgers are now smaller and pretty ordinary. It's still a pleasant way to waste a Saturday afternoon or grab a late night burger, but the only explanation for the still massive lines is that people are either still in love with the Corner Bistro of yore or they're part of the dim masses who catch everything too late and have no clue that they're singing the praises of a ghost.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I've never gone wrong with anything at Penelope, but my favorites are the Chicken Meatball sandwich and the When Veggie Met Sallie salad.   The fries are out of this world good.   Penelope is comfort food done right, and the staff does not disappoint.  Like others have said, sometimes there is a wait, but isn't that always true of the best places?   Besides, the vibe is such that you don't really want to rush back to work, anyway.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Preface: Only sampled some of the apps/tapas. I'm just gonna show my cards from the start: 1) Ambiance - 4 stars 2) Food - 2 stars 3) Service - 4 stars Great place for a glass of wine. Great ambiance with light music in the background. Great Brooklyn vibe. I just wished I didn't sample the apps. Maybe we ordered wrong but, my friend and I were just not impressed with what we ate which included the falafeled artichokes, bacon wrapped dates. the fish finger and the pitza. First, I don't even remember eating the pitza ultimately making me realize how unmemorable that dish was which is a shame since I adore Manchego. The bacon wrapped dates were amazing but to be expected. As I mentioned to my friend I find that one can't judge a restaurant on bacon wrapped dates because that dish is just amazing. Always. The fish fingers were extremely fishy and almost inedible though the crust was perfectly fried and the tartar was a must if you were gonna swallow these bad boys. This leaves the falafel artichokes great in concept but, not so great in actuality. The thick falafel crust took away from the artichokes and just wasn't a great combination in my opinion. Overall, this is a solid spot and if I happened to be in the neighborhood wouldn't be opposed to trying an entree and enjoy the space and wine but, overall wasn't a great start Olea.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The food was gorgeous; I had the sauteed calamari to start, which was tender and beautifully seasoned, followed by the lemon spaghetti which was fresh, simple and delicious. I also tried some of my friend's gnocchi, which was good. The place feels really comfortable and the decor is classy. My only gripe is the price. I paid $14 for my rather small bowl of pasta, which had only a garlic and lemon sauce on it. Similarly, I paid $7 for a very average-tasting and very small glass of Pinot Grigio. Should be priced more honestly, in my view. Still a safe bet for a good meal in a nice environment.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went on June 8th around 7:30pm in the middle of a downpour, which unfortunately didn't have any impact on all their tables being booked. Nonetheless, the maitre d' took pity on my friends and me and offered us the chef's table; a small counter (4 stools) overlooking the kitchen. Shane Lyons, the head chef, introduced himself and offered us complimentary popcorn dressed with garlic & cumin. Tyler was our waiter, and the service was very attentive. As you can see from the 5 stars, between the lively (but not raucous) atmosphere, thoughtful service, inventive drinks, and interesting & delicious food, I can see myself coming back to Distilled every other week. As for the food: Popcorn. Appreciate the low-carb alternative to table bread; perfect addition if I was just there for drinks. The cumin garlic combo keeps it light and it literally melts on the tongue. Ahi tuna crudo. A smaller portion size than other plates, and a very delicate interplay between the flavors. If you're ordering it, get it before the wings etc. or else the flavor might get lost. Tuna was (as you'd expect) very fresh. Liver pate. A medium-sized pot of pate with smaller pots of whipped, buttery honey and diced wine pickled shallots on the side. Enough for 3 to get a good taste. How good? Well, my friend (from Switzerland) is normally not a fan of pate (shocking) and he ate most of it. It may be somewhat grotesque to ""recombine"" the animal by pairing the pate with the skin but it is mouth wateringly good. Even better if you mix all three (honey, pate, and shallots). They'll bring you extra chicken skin if you ask, which you will. Wings. My girlfriend forwarded me the Thrillist wings link, so I expected this to be my favorite dish. Bonchon-style chicken, we got the large and barely made it through. Perhaps almost a little too much sauce vs. meat, but that didn't stop me from creating a small graveyard's worth of bones on my plate. King Salmon. As with the crudo, this is a delicate interplay of tastes that may get lost if you've just had the wings. But damn it is good. Almost Scandinavian in the combination of horseradish and buttery bearnaise, with the big hunk of Salmon remaining v. central to the taste. Burger. Big, big piece of meat. I was a huge fan of the burger from Bouley Upstairs (RIP), and was worried by the price + standard fare sounding offering here. I shouldn't have been: this was a really, really delicious burger and the size made up for the price. Tater tots were some of the best I've had, although agree that there aren't quite enough of them! Fried Duck and Waffles. Favorite dish of the night. Yes, it is rich-- it's duck and waffles. I'd normally reserve this for brunch but Chef recommended it so I thought I'd give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. As with the crudo and king salmon, this was a very careful balance of tastes- just enough sweet and savory to make sense for dinner. I tried the leftover maple syrup afterwards and by itself it is crazily potent, but mixed with the duck, french toast-y waffle, and basil leaf, it's perfect. Smores. We were too full to order but he insisted so we took the Smores, and I'm very glad we did. Deconstructed and taken up a notch, and the perfect amount (even on a full stomach) to end the night. The chocolate pudding is heavenly, could eat by itself. Drinks: Sparkle & Shine, outstanding. Franklin Fizz, looks like a beer, very full taste. Sueno Vida, dulled kick with a bit of heat behind it. Dram Betty, you really, really taste the rosemary; not for everyone. Will be trying the Tribecan next time. I can't wait to go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Get here early, because a line starts forming before they open.  They have the system down to get people moving through.  This place is pure comfort food.  I will come back here ever single time I visit NYC!  I was with two of my kids so we ordered the basic ramen, it was still amazing.  The guy next to me says he eats here at least 3 times a week...I would too if I lived in the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Warning, do not be deceived by the pictures on yelp.  Chicken and waffles are only served on weekends here. I went there on a Monday and even though it was a Federal holiday they were not serving the weekend menu and wouldn't accommodate my request for it.  I would definitely recommend that they change that.  I hate it when a place has different menus on different days. Overall the food was good but I wasn't blown away. Had the pancakes and chicken sausage which were tasty but the sausage had an overwhelming taste of sage and lavender.  A pretty expensive meal for breakfast, about $45 for me and my husband.  The atmosphere was nice, clean but cramped (definitely felt like I was all up on the next table).  Service ok but we waited a while for the food. Would not recommend if you have a large party because chances are you will be waiting for seats.  But for two it's fine.  I may try it again if I'm in NYC on a weekend just for the chicken and waffles.  But otherwise I could take it or leave it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Sooooo here goes..... I wanted to try one of the best brunch locations in Brooklyn, and The Farm on Adderley came up. The reviews were interesting as well. Upon arrival, I noticed the resturant was a little busy, the hostess looked a little ""overwelmed"". After waiting 40 minutes to be seated, the seating area was a little tight. The atmoshere was cool though. I had the Sausage and Eggs dish and a side of Bacon. The scrambled eggs were really good, however the sausage was UNDERCOOKED and most of the bacon was burned. There goes my dish!! My girlfriend had the French toast and strawberries, which was AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG!!! I was soooo Jealous! The service was standard. I'll go back to give it another shot, especially with the great reviews.  Maybe next time it'll be better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We ate here twice during a recent visit to the big apple.  Expect to wait about 20 to 30 minutes for a table.   The restaurant itself  sits on a corner in the Nolita neighborhood, and the seating is very tight inside.  If you're lucky, you can grab a seat at the counter.   The grilled corn is a must when dining here.   It's served as corn on the cob.  The flavor is unbelievable.  Lighlty dusted with cheese and chili powder. The fish tacos and the pulled pork sandwich are other highlights of Cafe Habana.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Five of us had a marvelous lunch at Bouley on Saturday, Feb 11.  The interior design transported me to another beautiful world.  Everywhere I looked there was something to see, from carved antique doors and fruit-themed chandeliers to huge floral bouquets and lovely drapery.  The French sommelier charmingly picked out a reasonably priced wine for us from the rather intimidating wine binder.   Our waiter knew all the details about our food and even told us how to make the salad dressing at home.  I ordered the salad with Bibb lettuce, watercress, hearts of palm and mushrooms.  It was superb.  All the china is unique and beautiful.  I was so tempted to flip the pieces over and read the bottoms.  I ordered the porcini flan with Dungeness crab which was also perfect.  My entree was chicken with vegetables.  By that time, however, I had eaten too much of the bread. One server pushed around a bread cart with 6 different wonderful breads to try and I overdid it. Dessert was sublime--a hot caramelized pear with toffee sauce and ice cream.   I felt like I was having lunch in a welcoming, elegant home.  Our group of five people had cocktails, a bottle of wine and the full 5-course tasting menu.  It came to $110 a person including a 20% tip.  The lunch was worth every penny.  Absolutely loved it.   I'm from San Francisco and my friends can be kind of snarky and find faults with lots of things. Aside from the busgirl who was rather dreary and bored, we found not one fault at Bouley. P.S. Don't know if I would have wanted to sit in the downstairs eating area as much.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ah, the first day of cold weather in NYC calls for some hot noodle soup.  I was originally craving some spicy beef noodle soup (tangy broth, sour cabbage), but for some reason, I love it back in the suburbs at Atlanta and have been struggling to find a good place in the city. So, after a couple recommendations, a friend and I stopped by Bo Ky.  This place is CHEAP!  It's a no-frills, cheap food, eat and go type place, so don't expect too much. Wonton noodle soup was a mere $3.75.  I opted for the Cambodian noodle soup.  I'm not really sure what was ""Cambodian"" about it, since my parents both grew up in Cambodia and I'm pretty sure I know what Cambodian food is supposed to taste like.  It's just a really salty, plain, tasteless soup with pho noodles and some strange meats and fish balls, garnished with bean sprouts.  I added some spicy hot oil to add flavor. The egg rolls, however, are some of the best I've had lately.  I love love love egg rolls with taro in them like my mom makes, and Bo Ky had them! We also got the ""country style"" plate of meat - literally a plate of pig parts.  The waiter was nice and warned us of the parts, but that's exactly what we wanted.  The flavor of the dish was traditional (five star anise) and the pig ears, tongue, intestines, and other parts were not too gamey and the right consistency. Not sure if I would actually crave any of this food again, but it's a good bang for your buck.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I absolutely LOVE this place. The atmosphere is great (yes it gets loud sometimes, but it's never annoying), the service is always friendly and *on point*, and the biggest thing to me: they mark all their gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan dishes. The drinks are delicious and as a vegan you have more options than just another salad. They have delicious quinoa cakes, tofu-steak, vegan tacos and their sides are amazing too (spinach, kale, plantains, vegan black beans..YUM!). I will keep coming back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I usually go here for breakfast. Dining in, my experience has been good and bad. On the other hand, if you call for delivery, it's a whole other experience! One time I called and I asked for Sausage, and the man over the phone didn't know what sausage was!! No I'm not kidding, he really didn't know what sausage was. OK fine, but the second time I ordered (which will be the last), my food was ICE COLD. It's absolutely disgusting to eat ice cold eggs, especially after we spent $30 bucks for breakfast. I had also ordered a poppy seed bagel and an everything bagel, instead I got two everything bagels. Minor mistake, but the worst part was when I called to let them know my food was ice cold, the reply was colder than the eggs I received. I got ""Oh I'm sorry"" and proceeded to rush me off the phone, and hung up. There was no attempt to fix what went wrong, not even a sincere ""I'm sorry"". So overall, if you want to order in, don't order from this place. It seems like they make the food 20 mins prior to when it actually goes out, and they could really care less if you're happy or not.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place was my regular spot for years, prior to a recent move.  The food menu is small but delicious (local ingredients, high quality, etc).  Try their burger, their mac n' cheese, and their fried pickles.   Their beer selection is fantastic as is their cocktail menu.  They know how to mix a good cocktail and if it's not too busy will also make something up for you on the spot.   That said, this place is way better if you're a regular and come when it's not utterly packed.  On nights when you can barely fight your way to the bar, I leave.  I'd rather have a spot at the bar, have some food, a few drinks, and chat with the other regulars.   It's also worth noting that the music selection is always great and the back patio is cute and peaceful, albeit small.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A brief lesson on how your breakfast choice will be interpreted: McDonalds = I am buying you breakfast because that's how my momma raised me and because you're still around, but let's just be friends * Traif = You entrance me.  I want to skip through a field of flowers with you and wake up next to you every day for the rest of our lives So be very careful about taking a love interest to Traif...because you may find yourself the object of lustful obsession!  Especially if you sit in the back patio, looking out into the sunny, flower-filled garden! Luckily, I did my dry run with Luscious Leckie, the perfect partner in crime, who never judges me when I suggest that we order the entire menu!  Thankfully, thoughts of the impending bikini season managed to rein in our impressive greed: 1. Red Plum Salad ($6) - To be honest, we ordered the salad as a healthy concession, but it was so much more delicious than we ever imagined!  Slices of juicy red plum frolicked with bacon pieces, figs, cheese, mixed greens in a delicious truffle vinaigrette!  We loved it! 2. Baked Blackberry Pancake ($8) - SOOOOO ludicrously thick and fluffy!  Stuffed full of ripe and juicy blackberries with delightfully crisp edges!  We spoke with the chef who mentioned that these are baked for optimal fluffiness!  Oh man!  Just thinking about these makes me want more! 3. Egg-In-A-Nest ($9) - Think of this as the most opulently buttery, grilled cheese (brie) and mushroom sandwich imaginable with a hole cut out of the center and a perfectly fried egg tucked inside.  The hole is presented as a mini sandwich, which is simply adorable!  There are more mixed greens with the dangerously addictive truffle vinaigrette as an accompaniment! 4. Chicken 'n' Biscuit ($10) - Perfect for sharing, we got two biscuit halves topped with decadent bacon gravy on either side of some minty apple salad, and perched upon those gravy laden biscuit halves were golden fried, juicy thighs with hints of honey here and there.  The bites with crispy chicken skin, fatty bacon and creamy biscuit were just...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 5. Bacon Doughnuts ($6) - We were pretty full, but there's ALWAYS room for dessert...and it may be true that we'd already had a sweet fix with the pancake, but NOTHING and NOBODY and certainly NO FULL BELLY was going to stop me from trying the famous bacon doughnuts...and if we were uncomfortably full and had to walk off our blimpyness after brunch, well, at least I can tell you one thing...IT WAS WORTH IT!  I HAVE NO REGRETS!  THESE DOUGHNUTS ARE JUSTIFIABLY FAMOUS!  EAT THEM!  You get four of these beauties (see picture) and they are munchkin sized yeast style doughnuts covered in dulce de leche and sprinkled with crispy bacon bits with a side of coffee ice cream that totally works with the flavors! 6. Buttermilk Panna Cotta ($6) - Perfectly silky panna cotta with a bit of a tart kick from a luscious passion fruit sauce and adorned with pomegranate seeds, blueberries and blackberries has convinced me to order every single dessert on the menu every single time I go to Traif PARTING THOUGHT: I've spent so much time writing about the food that I've neglected to mention the incredibly warm service and the friendly owners!  They were awesome!  I can't wait to go back for dinner!  And if you are planning a solo meal, be sure to grab a seat at the bar where you can see the chef in action! * Unless we are talking Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and a Bacon Egg and Cheese McGriddle...then you're just sending mixed signals!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Dare I say I liked the XLBs here better than Din Tai Fung's?? (please don't shoot me... and I mean only the DTF in Cali). They are bigger than your average soup dumplings at Joe's, but that's not why I liked them. The quality of the meat, soup and skin was noticeable. And their scallion pancake is a must order! I didn't try anything else here, but there really is no need... those two things are where it's at. The only reason why I docked a star is because I hate the whole communal seating idea. It is really awkward to be sitting at a table with a bunch of people you don't know. Luckily the people at our table when we went were cool, but I can imagine if you come here often you'll find yourself stuck in an awkward situation at some point, especially if you come solo!","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was close to closing, and I've worked in service so I understand the desire to get out in as little time as possible, but I had to wait forever for some pickles. Meanwhile our waiter was running around dumping stuff and shining glasses as I did everything to get his attention, including flopping over in an attempt to appear dead (which did not work).

"Margon is living proof that authenticity still exists in the midst of Times Square.  I stumbled here for lunch one day.  The service is always quick and friendly.  The sandwiches are constructed in the open as your enter.  I ordered a Cubano and the sandwich was accompanied with a side order of rice and beans and maduros for $9.  The sandwich and rice portions were GINORMOUS and super flavorful.  It's stuffed with salami, ham, tender pork tenderloin, pickles, mustard and gooey mozzarella cheese... all pressed to perfection.  The union of such simple ingredients works so well.  I've had my fair share of Latin American food and the food is definitely much more Dominican that the Cuban that it claims.   My expression of contemplating how I was going to down the epic portions of food for me, myself and I must of lasted for good ten seconds before the lady snapped me out of my zone with ""I know.."" and offered me a doggybagging aluminum container.  Note that takeout orders are $ .25 extra.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Amazing.  The pizza is wonderful, the salads are great, the sandwiches are delicious.

"It's on MacDonough not Mc Donalds is what I was trying to convey.  ""I told you to meet me on MacDonough.""  This is part the conversation that went down while waiting for my friend at Peaches.   Peaches is a member of the B+C Restaurant Group, which owns the other Peaches, affiliated restaurants such as Peaches Hot House. The space: Is chill, warm and inviting and if the weather is right the outside seating area is open.  I have been here I several times for several occasions: Drinks, Dinner and Brunch. Drinks - A solid idea, however the Peaches spot next door would be a better choice for more intense libation partaking.   Peaches does have a creative and diverse drink menu for those who like cocktails.  Myself I prefer my bourbon, scotch or whiskey like a seasoned vet straight up. Dinner - I enjoyed dinner here and it is a perfect location for an after work dinner catch up.  The menu is solid and most selections were filling. Brunch - Was okay, however I prefer dinner here.  The upside is they have live music and a decent brunch menu selection; however the portions tend to lean to the smaller side.  During brunch they are packed, pretty busy and a little understaffed if you want to chill I suggest taking it outside. Overall I like Peaches and I say go for it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Brunch at The Smith in 5 bullets: 1. Extensive brunch menu (diner style with a little of everything; complete food envy watching entrees arrive for neighboring diners ) 2. Slight sense you are dining at a food factory (45 minute turnover rate and super efficient with carved walkways for the servers) 3. High quality meal ( those grits and biscuits were damn good; the chicken salad was veryyy fresh and creative; fairly decent bloody mary) 4. Didn't miss a beat (seated right away, sparkling and tap water served with bread when you arrive at table, waitress(es) super attentive) 5. Fair prices (breakfast special includes entree with choice of bloody mary, mimosa; very generous portions) With a growling belly, this place was just what I needed on Sunday morning.

"Good pizza, especially for the price - $2.75 for huge slices.  Almost made me forget about slices at Joe's - but Joe's has meat, is a little more true to the NY style with thin crust, and can handle the volume.  It is about a 30 minute wait, and everyone is sort of scratching their head in line - it looks like all five people are feverishly working...but the line is going so slow.  Maybe if they had one person take your order and money, instead of all at once, things would move along.   No seats, and they are working on getting their liquor license.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I can't understand why other people gave this festival four or five stars. Maybe they were employed by Broadway Bites. I was really disappointed for several reasons: 1. It was too expensive.

After eating an $8 steak sandwich, I was still hungry, and had to walk to the $1 pizza to get more food. 3. The quality of the expensive food is not so good. It was a rip-off!! There were some advantages, though: 1. The staff was really nice and friendly; good service. 2. There is a HUGE variety, you can choose many things there. 3. You can drink alcohol there!

"One of the best pies in BROOKLYN, after DiFara's (I grew up on his slices). Sometimes Grimaldi's pies are a bit limp but the sauce is always heavenly and the toppings are divine. There's definitely a wait, order by pies only, and cash only. If you order to go the waiter brings it out to your car. It's conveniently located to the right, after you get off the Brooklyn Bridge, a block pass the ramp getting on the BQE, which makes it irresistable not to stop by before heading home.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is excellent!  From the decor to the food, Pure ain't your typical thai place.  You'll find some spring rolls and Pad Thai, but there's a whole lot more too.   Something is enticing about homemade noodles.  The freshness, the labor of love that goes into it, or that having something homemade goes above the normal cookie cutter feel a lot of Thai places in NYC have.   The spring rolls were good, not amazing.  The Sukhothai Pork Noodle Soup was slammin', though!  (Side Bar:  I love peanuts, am from the peanut capital of the world, and am just nuts about nuts.)  The seafood and pork flavors went well, along with the crunch of the peanuts and touch of spicy. All of this shophouse decor and deliciousness doesn't come at a premium, which is great.  They deliver, do take-out, or you can dine in.  I think it's cool that they used colored folding chairs and Thai signage.  Very classic and not ultra modern feeling.  I'll be back, with love, Pure Thai!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"From previous reviews, you will notice that as you depart, Eleven Madison gives you a gronola jar, Jean Georges gives you chocolate. Public is more discreet with their gifts. Your 'souvenir' can be found in the Public bathrooms. When you pay a visit to the bathrooms, you will find the bathroom walls lined with bars of soap and you are welcomed to take them as complimentary gifts. (They are wrapped per bar in Public wrappers ready to-go) What this means is, if you have splurged on a meal and want to stretch your dollars, please take a couple of soap bars. I took 5. Anyway, food was excellent. We had the soup and the grilled kangaroo for appetizers, and the lamb, venison and duck breast for entrees. The LAMB was super amazing it was cooked to perfection. So I highly recommend the lamb. The wine suggestion also complemented our meal very well! Public lost one star because service was a little slow. We got most of our food in decent time, but having to wait 45 minutes after we finished our meal for our brussel sprouts was not the best use of my time. And they told us they didn't forget our order. The sorbets were really delicious, and felt home made. Overall, I recommend this place especially if you're on a date and want time to freeze eternally to savior that moment - this is your place, the waiters will leave you unnoticed. And if any consolation, you remember your fond Public memories when you use the bar of soap. Photos to see the amazing lamb!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The baked beans and sweet potatoe casserole were equally good as sides. Those pickled veggies went perfectly with the meal, just a little spicy.

"Absolute best dining experience of my life! I reserved a table to celebrate my anniversary and they were so wonderful. We were a bit early and we were asked to wait at the bar area, we were given delicious drinks and then taken to our table. Everyone seems to know who you are, making the night extra special, we were given complimentary champagne to start our meal with. The meal was absolutely fantastic, I started with the trout and my husband with the lobster pappardelle, then continued with the chicken and sausage dish and the flounder, all of which were perfect. My favorite part, the gorgeous desserts. We ordered the delicious chocolate banana slice and the cookie plate which came accompanied with a complimentary coconut cream cake with a beautiful ""happy anniversary"" written on it. The service, food, decor, all on point, completely perfect, the night could not have been any better! (AND we found free parking right across the street)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Let me start by saying DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! Got there around 10pm on a Saturday night and we were fortunate they had a table left. The place is small, but has a nice cozy feel to it. The decor is rustic, and lighting is dim so its nice for groups and dates. I have to start by saying the staff was amazing! Extremely friendly and accomodating, especially the waitress. She was helpful with suggestions, very attentive and super friendly. Now let's get to the good stuff...LA COMIDA! (the food lol) APPETIZER: We ordered the trio empanadas (one of them was beef, one was corn and the last was spinach and cheese) PROS: They were all delicious. They weren't too small, and it was nice to have a variety. My personal fave was the corn, it was different and savory. CON: None really, they were all delicious, not greasy. We also wanted to try the spinach gnocchi, so our lovely amazing waitress suggested splitting one portion into two so we can both have a taste. PRO: I'm not a big fan of the regular potato gnocchi but I knew this was something I would need to try. Even though she split the portion for one person into two bowls, I would say we both had a nice amount. The spinach gnocchi was DELICIOUS! The lamb ragu was excellent, and even had nice chunks of lamb meat that went perfectly with the gnocchi. The gnocchi wasn't dry and definitely was fresh. CON: NONE... ENTREE: He ordered: some sort of seafood Carbonara pasta dish. I can't really review it because I didn't eat the whole thing. He liked it very much, pasta was fresh, it wasn't too creamy, it was very delicious. I ordered: one of the specials of the day, the filet mignon (ordered medium/well) with the asparagus and mashed potatoes. PRO: WOW....that meat just melted in your mouth, the outside had a nice crispy crust to it, like it was freshly cooked and the inside just melted in your mouth. I literally savored every bite of that meat. CON: I'm not a fan of mashed potatoes in general, I should have ordered more veggies instead, but thats basically the only con I could possibly have. DRINKS: I wish I knew the name, but again, our great waitress suggested this delicious red wine to pair with our meal. It was a mix of Bordeaux and Cabernet wine of some sort. I wish we had gotten the name, but it was just delicious, smooth, not too dry and not too sweet. & now the best part...DESSERT!! Although we were pretty stuffed, we always have to leave room for dessert! Avocado Flan (don't judge it if you haven't tried it) PRO: When I read this on the menu, I knew I had to try it. The flan itself is beautiful, a nice mint green gelatin looking flan is presented with a mint leaf (I think its mint) decorated with a balsamic reduction. upon your first bite you have this delicious sweet sensation on your palette and as the flan melts in your mouth you taste that delicious fresh avocado. It is not too sweet and in NO way does the avocado overpower the dish at all. One would think it would have a guacamole-ish taste to it, but it really doesnt. Words cant really describe how good this was, you really MUST taste it for yourself. CON: I wish I had more.... He ordered the Creme Brulee with plum compote PRO: Delicious, creamy and light tasting. CON: Next to the avocado flan, it was pretty neglected. Not because it wasn't good, it was a delicious creme brulee, but the avocado flan was just out of this world for us. Overall, as you can tell if you actually read this long review, we absolutely loved our experience here. I cannot wait to come back and try more delicious dishes and have more of that flan! Its definitely not a cheap place, but in the end it is worth every penny.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"If you'd like to sample authentic Greek food, skip the diner or the local gyro stand and come to a place like Anthi's. A small mom-and-pop type shop located on the Upper West Side, Anthi's is a wonderful place to stop off at when you're craving Greek. Apparently, the owner is of Greek descent; he and I even chatted a bit in Greek. Note that the place is very small, though, and will not accommodate eat-in, so be prepared to grab your grub and eat on the go. I took advantage of the Yelp deal ($30 coupon for $40 worth of food) and chose several items. The karydopita (walnut cake) is absolutely exquisite--so much so that this item alone is worth a trip back! It's spicy, sweet, wet--the best I've ever tried. The tzatziki (yogurt-based garlic-flavored dip/sauce) is another winner. Speaking as someone who was raised with Greek traditions and who has even made tzatziki himself, the tzatziki at Anthi's is truly top notch. You'll never again care for that bland mass-marketed commercial-grade paste that sells elsewhere. Thumbs up, too, for the Greek yogurt--thick, flavorful, and delicious (but not the sort of thing too eat much of if you're counting your cals). I also tried the both the pastitsio (layered pasta dish made w ground beef, tomato sauce, and bechanel/custard sauce) and the spanakopita (traditional spinach pie) and came away a bit disappointed with both. The pastitsio seemed too dry and the spanakopita lacked the richness and flavor that I've come to expect from good homemade spanakopita. In all fairness, though, I ate them both cold since I forgot to request that they be heated. If you get either of these--make sure that you eat them warm. The temperature factor aside, I'd say these were about average. Overall, a thumb's up. Anthi's is an authentic, take-out only, reasonably priced (relative to UWS prices) establishment that provides friendly service and serves anywhere from average to outstanding Greek food items.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Just got back from a trip to NYC and still thinking about this little gem! I was expecting great drinks but the food was some of the best I had the whole trip. Highly recommend the pizzas and wings.

Huge chunks of chicken, lightly breaded with a very different, but great buffalo sauce. After dinner, we decided on the original cheesecake, which was outstanding! Such a perfect density and flavor. We also had superb service, the best we had in New York, from Mary! She was so friendly and sweet.

"I'm a big bruncher. That is to say, I've been to a lot of brunch spots all over the country. The experience I had at Olea was by far the best I have ever had. Service: Our waiter was incredibly professional and courteous the whole time. 2 of us changed our minds about our food/drink order and he changed it right away without complaint. Drinks: they have an entire array of mimosa flavors, from mango to pomegranate! They also have brunch drink specials - I got the Aperol spritzer which they make with mango purée. That was my favorite! Food: best for last. I ordered the Brioche French toast, which melts in your mouth and is a welcome sweet treat next to all of the incredible savory dishes they have. Speaking of, though I didn't order this, I demolished the LAMB HASH. I literally almost fell over when I tried this. Hands down, the BEST brunch entree my mouth ever tasted! It was presented in a very authentically Moroccan style with the food in the pan. Each egg had an incredible white cheese and was topped with a Muhammara sauce that added a little spice. It's not until you get to the bottom of this masterpiece where you have the real treat - mounds of tender, juicy spiced lamb mixed with this cheese and seasoned potatoes. We all nearly abandoned our own meals so we can have more of the lamb hash. I would come back to NYC just to have another brunch at Olea!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to calle oche in February 2012 for my friend's birthday. I was a little hesitate and really did not want to go there because I did not like their menu. In spite of this, my friend wanted to go because on a certain night, you get free sangria with dinner. However, we all agreed that the food was excellent. We were a big group. Therefore, I was fortunate enough to try everything. I had the salad with goat cheese, vegetarian paella and the flan. The paella was the best paella I have ever had in my life. The salad was perfect, and the flan was just okay. Everyone in my group enjoyed their food very much. I can't wait to go back, and I'm so glad i went there. I would highly recommend it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here on Mother's Day around 5pm. The wait was 2 hours. We waited. The host took down our number and texted us when our table was ready. This was great because we were able to walk around at Fairway Market and check the view by the shore while waiting. Another option while waiting - they had games in the back, which I hadn't checked out, but I would probably grab a beer by the bar and check the games out next time. - Little Neck Raw Clams - Very fresh! Recommended! - New England Clam Chowder - this was a disappointment. I would not get this ever again here. It was very bland and tasted watered down. - Brooklyn Crab Royale For Two ($95) - this was delicious! and it was good to share amongst my small family. Highly recommended. We came here specifically for Maryland crabs. Unfortunately, there was a shortage in the area at this time. (So we heard) The only item they had available with Maryland crabs were the Maryland Crab Roll - we got this and it was delicious. Service was pretty good. Food didn't take too long. It was nice sitting on the deck, having dinner while watching the sunset.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Delicious food - you can taste the top quality ingredients. Portion sizes are perfect - for those that have ventured outside the US, the sizes are normal by international standards, so probably smaller by US standards but the quality of the food makes up for it (you really do not need more than what they serve, quality really does trump quantity). Coffee is excellent for US standards - comes close to tasting like a real Melbourne-style coffee (very hard to find!!). Service was nothing to rave about, but nothing to fault either. Highly recommended for the local area. And their take-out store a few doors down is perfect if you want something to go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Delicious and amazing. Very small and intimate space with an open kitchen where you watch the chefs prepare the food you are going to be served. Their pickling liquid was used multiple times to pickle different items throughout the dinner and was amazing - especially noticeable when eating the ""quail egg"" (actually spherified aioli). Highlight for me was the cured swordfish belly which was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted. I also loved the bread that was basted in pork fat - so amazing - I know I am going to dream about this piece of bread. I think the one miss was that the restaurant tries a bit too hard to make things appear as something they are not; It worked most of the time, but sometimes the food was very very interesting but tasted just okay as with the ""lichen"" cracker and the churro which was actually dried salsify. It was a unique, delicious and great experience overall which I wouldn't miss out on.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really like this little place. in the summer they have a couple tables outside. on this cold winter night I brought a friend here who surprisingly had not been. this is the person who has taken me to most if not all the places I have written about so I was pleased to show him someplace new.     all of the food here is made on hot plates! the food they put out is great I would never have guessed. the restaurant is tiny 6 tables max but they try to put an elegant flare on the dining experience, it comes off as very authentic Italian. we had the anti pasta salad to start- very fresh we shared a daily special as a entree- still plenty for us. I like my butter served room temp if ifs not I end up passing on the bread. here the butter comes out cold- sigh... on the bright side I ate a lot less bread:) I like that their sauce has a little kick. Italian food can be very bland or too garlicky, they do a great job here of making the food tasty without overdoing any one flavor. this is a gem in tribeca- inexpensive food at $ 14 entrees!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ippudo....how can i summarize my experience there?? well, the ramen was good, but not superb. honestly, if i waited for about an hr for a table for two, i expect it to live up to the hype. and i am thinking that my ramen was not WORTH the one hour wait. the pork was dry, but i gotta say that the ramen and the soup was good. once again not superb. this place, i feel is a one-time thing. i wouldn't wait just to eat here all the time, but i just wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. i came here with my sister on a Friday night, and it was absolutely bustling at 10pm. we didn't get a table until 11pm. one thing i could've gone without are all the waiters screaming welcome in my face when i get in. holy hell, it's hella annoying and it's just way too smiley and happy go lucky for me. all i want is a nice meal and not the same scream/chant/what have you whenever someone walks in or leaves the door. GOSH. i came in hella tired, coming back from grad school for a weekend, and frankly, it was the LAST thing i needed on a Friday night. Overall, i'd say that the food is a 7/10. when you have THAT many people waiting, there is a certain expectation. and unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. maybe ramen is just not my thing, but i think it's awfully expensive for just a bowl of noodles with soup and a couple pieces of some darn pork.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's always hard to review a restaurant when things go fairly smoothly for you and pretty bad for your dining partner across the table. On the positive side, I'm shocked that I'd never been to this place before. It certainly plays a great purpose as a casual dining, basically American cuisine option with a full bar. We arrived on a Saturday night with a taste for sandwiches or burgers. We walked in to find several tables available and were fairly quickly shown to our seat. Unfortunately it was located right below the restaurant light switch which the staff adjusted several times while we were sitting there. Reach over my head once OK, but 10 times is kinda awkward. Once our waitress took our order, I felt pretty comfortable, but soon learned that all requests were not heard. My friend and I love wings, so ordering wings as a starter was a no brainier. I just wish that we could have enjoyed it more, but like 3 minutes into enjoying our appetizer, the waitress bought out our main meals with no effort to delay this. Somehow she tried to fit all of the plates on our small table. Let's just say, the setup to make this happen, was tacky at best. As soon as we finished our wings we placed empty plates on the empty table next to us. This was followed by my friend hating her main dish, sending it back and ultimately giving up and not eating. This wasn't going very well. Alas another employee arrived. Not sure if she was the manager or a hella efficient worker, but she was chatty, friendly and somehow turned my friend's frown into a Smile. I meanwhile was loving my wrap all along. Ultimately, I think Borough Restaurant works for when you are walking by and struck with a quick hunger element OR possibly to come in and hang out at the bar for a drink.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I go for dinner once a month now.  The food is glorious, hearty, creative, interesting, perfectly executed - I love the bread basket - I always order the special pasta (last time it was a red sauce with mussels and rock shrimp - I took bread and got all the sauce out of my dish and my friend's dish).  But, the service is slow as hell - for a 9:30 ressy we didn't end up eating until 11:45 - it's really nice and people sit at their tables for a while, but I just can't make late ressy's anymore - now I go at 6pm on the weekends for an easy good time AND they have the special roast sucking pig at that hour (they always run out later in the evening) - which was the moistest piece of roast meat I have ever eaten.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great location--right in the middle of Times Square and right by all the theaters! AMBIENCE:  3.5 stars--pleasant dinner in the heart of NYC. SERVICE:  I was seated IMMEDIATELY about 1 hour prior to my show.  The host staff was very pleasant and efficient.  My server was amazing--knew the menu front and back and was definitely used to serving people who are in a rush to get to their play! FOOD:  4 stars.  I am a little embarrassed to admit this--but at my server's recommendation I ordered a type of sandwich called ""something quite different"" or something quite close to that--basically two potato pancakes with beef brisket in the middle served with a side of au jus and a side of chunky applesauce.   I could only eat about half--but it was quite delicious!  The potato pancakes are crispy on the outside, the brisket was pretty good (needed a bit of salt), the applesauce was great!  I had the basic cheesecake for dessert and it was VERY good.   ALCOHOL:  2.5 stars.  Decent, run-of-the-mill margarita.  I am a margarita snob, and I live in Tucson where we have a lot of good margaritas; so....meh... VALUE: Come on!  It is Times Square--nothing is cheap here!  But given the amount of food I had, the prices were decent. OVERALL 4 stars.  Good comfort food served by friendly people.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am a believer in substantially priced small dishes.  But in this case, they should taste big.  The brunch items at this recently expanded restaurant nestled inside Chelsea Market are simple and pretty good, but seem rather overpriced for the type of food and portion size.  A $12 brunch salad is a small bowls of greens, a few raspberries, and a little cheese.  $15 eggs are 2 eggs and some greens.  The food doesn't quite seem special enough to generate such prices for the small portions, but the restaurant does take brunch reservations.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So many good things about Queens Comfort! 1. We sat at the ""bar"" and our server was great. She was passionate about the restaurant and the food and recommended awesome dishes. I can't remember her name but it ended witth an ""omi"" sound. 2. It's BYOB (and cash only). We went down the street to grab a $12 campaign bottle which was awesome. 3. Food was awesome - had the street corn for a snack, the captain crunch coated chicken fingers and animal burger for entrees then ended with the red velvet rice pudding. Apparently the menu changes all the time - can't wait to go back again and to try brunch! 4. Atmosphere was so relaxed and quiet. I am sure it gets busy all the time, but we went on a Tuesday night around 7pm and though customers were eating, it was very calm. 5.

"Tough to beat for busy Times Square area on a Saturday night - Reasonable prices, good food and good service. We wanted a 6:00 time to allow cushion for our 8:00 show, but it was either 6:30 or 4:30 so we took the later time even though we were concerned about making the show.  There was no reason for worry - we were done by 7:30 thanks to a supportive waiter.  We skipped the app, but had Caesar salad and a main course plus wine.  Food arrived quickly, but we never felt rushed.   The salad plus vodka mushroom sauce pasta and chicken parm was more than the four of us (big eaters) could finish.  Chicken parm was the highlight for us.  People next to us ordered some sort of seafood medley with calamari, shrimp and a bunch of other seafood - we were lusting over that and they raved about it. As other reviews state, it is a bit loud.  We were seated in the basement which wasn't as loud as upstairs.  Plus, at 7:00 it started to empty so other than the beginning of the meal it was quite pleasant.   Lastly, we came back post-show for desert.  We had to wait about 20 minutes because it was very busy, but it was also worth the wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"For all of my pizza-eating life, I've been looking for that absolutely perfect pizza crust. Not too thin and crispy, but not too doughy. A little bit of char, with a lotta bit* of chew. Thankfully, after years of testing and tasting, I can call off the search and just head on over to Paulie Gee's! Prepare for ultimate crust satisfaction! All crust aside, Hundreds of Yelp reviews aren't wrong - this place is absolutely as good as they say. Some of the best pizza (if not THE best) I've ever had, in a relaxed and rustic setting. Great service and great food. What could be better? My three friends and I got four pies to share and it was the perfect amount (they're medium-sized, 4-6 large slices each). Of COURSE we had to go for the Cherry Jones and the Hellboy, but we also ordered two pizzas off the Secret Menu: The Mootz (a classic white pizza) and the Famous Original A (sweet Italian fennel sausage, tomatoes and sliced red onion). The winner hands-down for me was the Cherry Jones for its unique flavor combo, but they were all fantastic. The hot honey on the Hellboy is indeed awesome, Yelpers. And the PIZZA CRUST! We already went over that. Paulie was making the rounds that night and stopped by our table twice to check in on us and chat. What a lovely guy.

"We love The Spotted Pig.  It's our favorite NYC restaurant.  This past trip was our fourth, and each time has been memorable.  We always start with the chicken liver toast which is just amazing.  The liver isn't overpowering at all, just a nice hint of the rich liver flavor, not sure what they add to the liver mixture other than olive oil, but try it.  Also had the roll mops which were so tasty.  I love pickled herring, and this was as good as it gets. I had the burger for an entree, which was a simple medium-rare patty (you can request it to be cooked any way you like, but why would you ruin such a nice burger?) seasoned well and topped with roquefort cheese.  The bun is toasted and perfect.  Served with shoestring fries.  It's all you need.  Don't ask for ketchup or mustard.  Just eat it as it was intended and you'll be happy.  My wife had a prosciutto and ricotta tart which was perfectly balanced with thin prosciutto with a sweet ricotta on a flaky tart.  She said she really enjoyed it.   No room for dessert although the menu looks great.  I can only nitpick a little about the service, which is impatient and a bit hipster-ish, but they are efficient and knowledgeable, so I can deal with the lack of friendliness.  I'm not here to make new buddies for life. So yes, go here, try not to act like a tourist because they really hate that, and enjoy some amazing food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went to Joya last night based on rave reviews from a friend. My boyfriend and I were really disappointed. The chicken satay are mediocre at best and so was the peanut sauce.

My boyfriend ordered the spicy pork and pineapple fried rice. The brought him spicy seafood fried rice. He started to eat it, but didn't like the taste. He then picked up a shrimp and that's when I picked up the candle to take a closer look at his plate. OMG!! He is allergic to shrimp.

"I have been checking this place out for s long time and decided to come in one morning and check out the omelettes.  Saw a review and was inclined to check this place out.  I went here twice before I wrote this review the first time had the omelettes with cheese and spinach and the second time had the croissant with provolone cheese n sausage! Yummy! Everything tasted fresh!  The waiter and I guess owners were very engaging and helpful ad the restaurant had a very nice crowd.  I will be going back here, because the variety of food is definitely a selling point and they do it well! There is something for every palate at Cornerstone Cafe! (Gets real busy on the weekends)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been to Stone Park Cafe a couple of times, and each time it's been great. That is, until the last time I went. I experienced a rude, tastes less, and crass waiter. I've never felt so uneasy and upset by a waiter and it's huge disservice. He was the most brusque waiter I had ever dealt with. Now I won't discredited the cafe altogether, however I strongly urge the manager to oversee closely his employees and the job they are doing. A disgusting waiter like this guy could seriously ruin a business and it's reputation. As a consumer, who you deal with directly and the experience they brought to you, can strongly persuade your feelings and perception's) in how you view the restaurant as a whole. Legendary customer service is EVERYTHING in my book. Like really, who wants to spend money and deal with a rude and crass waiter. Not I.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My boyfriend and found this yummy Thai spot about a month ago! ...I've had authentic and expensive Thai before and I was amazed at the tasty meal we had for $35 bucks...including a calamari appetizer, the mango salad is great, two entrees and Thai Iced Tea's ...which taste better without the cream... not bad...the only thing that suck's is if you can't eat out side its super crowed inside and usually packed with a 45 min wait. boo...we've tried going back but didn't want to wait to eat that long even if it's cheap!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"i luv this place! i've only been here twice and both times i've had fun. the crowd is pretty fun & diverse, the venue i would describe as trendy, but not pretentious, the music is a good mix of just about everything (hip hop, old school,. pop, funk) and the bar is a long oval which spans the entire room for easy access to the bartender. there is space to dance (towards the back), lounge, and eat. my only negative would be the mixed drinks were a bit weak- and i'm a petite girl! but overall, i like this place a lot and would gladly make it my go-to spot for a fun night out!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Mew Izakaya is your classic four star place~ perfect for that casual get together, the start of your night of drunken revelry that you'll never remember, or that out-of-the-way place you just might impress a date with -tho chances are your date will have already been as Mew seems to be ever more popular these days as told by the wait during peak hours. Reservations are taken tho I've always managed to walk in. Most recently I walked in to a quiet 6pm start to their Saturday happy hour which runs til 7. Of note, happy hour does recur from 11pm til closing. The place did quickly fill up and with the noise level rising correspondingly. The staff are very cool and while the quality of the fare is typical to what you would expect for the reasonable prices offered, special regard for their 6$ green tea creme brulee.. it wasn't bad! And, watch out for their lychee makgeolli~ at something like $15 for the bottle, its tasty, refreshing, and will steamroll over you before you know it if you don't keep a wary and increasingly bleary eye on it.. bad makgeolli!

"This one gets a 5 for being the best ramen in the city.  I've been here a number of times.  The best one they have is the Akamaru Shin.  A friend of mine that grew up in Japan asked them where on earth they got their noodles for this dish, as they are a rare specific style of noodle that she's only been able to find in Japan.  Their response: ""Thank you for noticing.  There's no where in America that you can buy them, so we make them here"". This is the real deal ramen with no sacrafice in quality...even if that means that they have to take drastic measures to live up.

I always look at the long line and just think I wish I had the stamina to stand in the big line in mid night last night the weather was good and I don't know how the line was very short too so I tried their food. I liked it as it was not very oily and enough for a person to be full,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Happy to see this place add some diversity to a neighborhood saturated with New American gastropubs and winebars. The owners of this place thought very carefully about their design and layout choices, and I think they chose well. The mood is super romantic and intimate with candles, perfect for a date or a small dinner with friends. Low hanging horizontal mirrors that add dimension and interest to the space, and midcentury jazz adds the right touch. The menu ranged from very standard French bistro fare (steak frite, escargot) but featured some other nontraditional items like salads and pasta. The desserts were pretty standard too (creme brulee and molten chocolate cake) but we were too full to try. The salad with duck was great, with the duck seasoned perfectly. Escargot came in a red sauce which was unusual but tasty. Onion soup was spot on and had a nice char on the cheese. Drinks were inexpensive but a little light in the pour. Overall, I liked my dinner a lot, and I will be coming back! À la vôtre! Cheers!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Had dinner here recently and came away quite impressed. Loved the decor from the knife board on the way down to the basement level to the train boards at the bar announcing the cocktails and starters.  We had a great four-top table on it's own by the fireplace in the front room but some of the other tables are pretty close together.  Our waitress was very friendly and we had good service throughout the evening. Started off with the oysters and the mushroom pot.  Oysters were great but the mushroom pot was pretty amazing.  It was pure deliciousness and definitely one of the more unique items on the menu. I had the roasted chicken for my entree and it was quite tasty although a little salty.  Never would have thought to put oranges with roasted chicken but it really worked.  I also got to try the miso and sweet potato tortellini which I wouldn't hesitate to order on a future visit and the grilled & chilled tuna salad is a great choice if you want something on the lighter side.  My brother had the burger which he thought was fantastic and we all got to enjoy his fries with sriracha ketchup and blue cheese mayo.  Never had blue cheese mayo but I could not stop dipping my fries in it.

"Yeah, this place should be called ""Are You Fucking Kidding Me? - Breakfast for Douche Bags on the Go."" Now in its defense, we didn't actually eat the food - however, GOD KNOWS WE TRIED 3 TIMES DURING THE HOURS POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE! Only to get a 'my-dad-is-paying-for-this-years-business-venture' response of ""Uh.yeah, we don't go by those hours anymore..."" Really shithead? Take into consideration that people may travel to try your place and being open when you feel like it is about the same business plan the past 7 businesses in your spot (in as many years) adopted and look how they're doing. Even the ""Juice Shop"" up the street past the 9 salons in a 1/4 block has more consistent hours - and i've never - NEVER - seen anyone walk out of that place with a juice of any sort, and that guy has been open (and terrifying neighborhood residents) for YEARS. So here's my advice, remove the hours from your site - and try your hardest not to roll your eyes at people that want to give you money and support your (dad's) business. So huge thumbs down to the business practices of this place and hopefully acquiring a solid schedule will be their new year's resolution.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The service was more than terrible. Had to ask for the menu a total five times from three different waiters. Waitress suggested to us its green tea ""gelato"", which was nothing more than overly sweetened crappy frozen ice cream (ice specks). Not gelato in the furthest sense. The restaurant was way too busy and did not have enough wait staff. Inconsistencies with waitresses too- I asked for lettuce and garlic for the bbq meat, and while one said she will be right back with some, after 10 minutes without being back with some, I asked another and she said the restaurant ran out. ?????

"Two years ago, my son and I travelled to New York for a vacation. Our main reason was for me to take him to a Yankees game before The Stadium was torn down. Fortunately we were able to do that. Unfortunately, the Yankees didn't make the playoffs! But besides seeing the game, Spamalot!, and other attractions the highlight of our one week stay was Patzeria Perfect Pizza! Every night we'd buy a slice or two, take them back to our room and watch Sportscenter as we ate the best pizza in the city (or anywhere else for that matter)! Since we were staying at the Hotel Edison, it was easy to simply walk out the 46th street exit, make a right turn and walk a few steps to Patzeria Perfect Pizza. My only complaint is that I can't get them to FedEx a couple pizzas with dry ice to California. I'm considering a trip back next summer for the pizza alone! It is THAT good!

"I started going to this place when it first opened.  It looks nice.  The bartenders are pretty good guys.  The food is OK.  It's not the bomb.  If I wanted a burger in this neighborhood, I'd go to Bareburger or maybe three other places before I would even think about going to Afton.  Their burger is fine, but it's nothing special.  And the bun is usually slathered in oil.  Basically it's good when you're hammered and you need something to sop up the alcohol. Two big problems with this place... the reasons I no longer go here: (1) the nightmare hipster invasion that I had feared has converged on this establishment... every twenty-something yahoo in Astoria is now here on Friday and Saturday night, and the place is swamped.  If that's your bag, come and get 'em.  Good for the proprietors, they're reaping some success, but woe is me when I want a drink and a decent conversation. (2) the bouncers are bent on establishing a violent fascist authoritarian state.  Having worked as both a doorman and a bartender, I can say that these are the kind of guys that ruin a patron's first and last impressions of a place.  Attitude problems and intimidation galore... but then again, maybe it's justified with so many scary hipsters around.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I have placed orders here for a few years and am very familiar with what is, and isn't included in their fical BRUNCH menu - yet, she insisted (pretending to put me on hold and speak with the manager, which of course, did not happen), and then she overcharged me for a substiution, charging me for a full separate side!!

Anyway,gave 3 stars for their food & environment. I ordered: ---Pinto iced tea(it's reli Thai tea,they gave u bunch of containers to mix by ur own,which kinda diff) ---Satay (average, the source wasn't that great) ---crispy chicken & five seeds ( too salty w. too little white rice, the quality of white rice is terrible,any of Chinese takeout restaurant has better rice than that!)

"The biggest problem is their seating process. They arbitrarily make you wait up to 45 minutes or more. The food is ok but certainly not worth waiting 45 minutes for. Even with a reservation they will make you wait up to 15 minutes. What's more there is no waiting or reception area so people bunch up at the entrance and the stairs. It becomes elbow room chaos. The overall dining experience does not produce enough value for prices charged yet they keep raising their prices every year. All in all not reflective of  the type of restaurant they are trying to be -- high end New American. Service can be good or bad depending on your luck. Same goes for the dishes, sometimes care is taken. Other times they're somewhat sloppily assembled, going by their own standards. Most of the servers are professional but some are a little bit dizzy and inexperienced and the rest fake it till they make it. The ambience is slick with live jazz some nights. The sushi is pretty good. The steak is mickey mouse, go to a proper steakhouse instead. The burger is decent but also overpriced. You can most definitely get the same or better quality burger at more than several similar places in the city at a lower price than what Hillstone charging.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Best burger I've ever had...Well, outside my kitchen that is. They've truly perfected the medium-rare beef to a SCIENCE! I didn't expect that from a nice French restaurant. Sliders and bone marrow, yes, but burgers? Wow, that blew my mind. Oh and their slender fries that came on the side were YUM, but many of them got over-fried (as if into chips) because they were so thin. Their cooks are great, but I can't vouch the same for their servers. Mine was social, but sorely inattentive. He really didn't seem like he wanted or cared to be there. I wonder what their training process was like to work there. They didn't sound like they've tried any of the dishes. When asked to describe them, one guy said: ""Yeah, I mean...you know, it's like...this circle, bone marrow."" REALLY?! I've worked in the service industry, and my manager at LEAST gave me some lines to memorize. At a restaurant like this, I KNOW you can certainly do better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been thinking about the egg salad, fontina and chive oil crostini since I had it a few days ago.  It's tastes like the world's best egg salad sandwich, but is also light and the oil really elevates it.   Of the two salads I tried, both were great.  The Beets with Baby Arugula was dressed impeccably, the beets and goat cheese were a natural accompaniment to one another, and I - who loathe, detest and despise nuts in my salad - didn't mind the minutely chopped walnuts.  The Baby Green Beans was also yummy; the cheese and truffle oil helped the flavor of the green beans to come out, rather than masking it. I had the Prosciutto panino with gorgonzola dolce and fig spread.  Just as amazing as everything else, it was perfectly balanced and all of the flavors were clear and delightful.  I'm making myself hungry again! Finally, I tried a new beer, Crabbies Ginger Beer.  I would happily drink that for the remainder of the summer. Il Bambino is going to be reason I go back to Astoria over and over!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Great little date spot (shout out to Heather G. for the recommendation). Food was yummy and much better portioned than most tapas places I've been. Could have used a few slices of crusty bread to mop up some of the deliciousness. Drinks fell somewhat flat as well so I would stick to wine or forgo it all together and have a drink at one of the many bars in the area before heading over.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had a positively lovely time here! Food was delicious (we did the lamb feast for our table), drinks were tasty (I tried the orange fennel soda--refreshing, good for the stomach, and not overly sweet!), and the service was great (I love, love, love that we were not rushed through and we had a nice pause before the mains were brought out). It also helps that the ambiance is so cozy and pretty and warm and inviting. Loved the candles, the small vases on each table, the wooden details throughout and the ridiculously gorgeous light fixtures. We really had a great experience and will definitely be back to try the seasonal meat menus (and the vegetarian one as well!). (Ooo: the one suggestion I have is that the restaurant accomodate gluten-free palates, especially since the feasts only come with one dessert option, which is usually where gluten hangs out. I didn't ask for an option that I could eat--which I certainly should have--but would be great if there was a notation on the menu about this to make it less awkward for those of us who don't want to be ""that "" person in a group ;) ).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"SO GOOD!! I sadly only got to experience these huge slices of deliciousness once during summer, but I would definitely go back. There's ALWAYS a line, and the line was still out the door the day we went, when it was POURING RAIN. What New Yorkers will do for good pizza. The staff is friendly, and watching them make pizza, you can tell they enjoy their jobs, as they constantly cranked out pizza after pizza. We got a slice each of margarita, crab, and artichoke&spinach. They were nice enough to cut each in 3 slivers for us so my 2 friends and I could all taste the different flavors :) YUMMY, all of them! And actually quite filling.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My first Venezuelan culinary adventure didn't disappoint. The environment was vibrant and energetic and i loved the music they were playing. The staff were delightful - Marcello in particular was incredible! - and the drinks, food....wow! We ordered the drink special of the day and it tasted like it was straight out of a tropical island on a sunny day, plenty of real mango juice and rum but still not overly sweet. Starting with a basket of fried yucca fries, plantains and potato croquettes, all were well prepared and not greasy despite being fried. Deferring to Marcello's recommendation, the main course was a Venezuelan sandwich that was incredibly tasty. Why use bread when you can use fried plantains? Generous portions of roasted, pulled meat, avocado chunks and melty gooey cheese....Will def be back on my next NYC trip!

I got the artichoke pizza of course, since everybody on Yelp raves about it. And it totally exceeded my pizza expectations! I've never tasted anything quite like Artichoke pizza. It almost tastes like spinach artichoke dip on pizza, and that is an amazing combination. The slices are greasy, HUGE, very cheesy, and not at all skimpy on the artichokes. Love it, will be back often, and will recommend it to everyone! Yay Artichoke!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came to Blue Ribbon Brasserie last Saturday night at around 10 p.m.   It was about my 10th time here but hadn't gone in about 2 years...  What's the verdict??? It's as good as I remembered and we were thoroughly happy.  I usually get the rack of lamb but I decided to try the seabass.  My date had the grilled octopus.  Both were above average, though not spectacular... So why 5 stars?  The bone marrow/oxtail marmalade was ridiculous (have had it at blue ribbon sushi midtown a bunch and in las vegas @ the cosmopolitan), the fried oysters were also amazing and of course for finishers the chocolate bruno dessert (yep it's flourless!).  My only regret was not getting the steak tartare.  There's always next time... Always a good meal.  A top 5 restaurant for me in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend and I went to this place today because we thought they should have nice food and would not be expensive. True, the prices of the dishes weren't expensive, however, the quality of the food doesn't even worth the price that we paid. My friend ordered a vegetable and yam noodle soup for $ 8, but the vegetable seems like coming out as a frozen product, moreover, it was like it was in the fridge for a long time and it was not fresh and has yellowish, slimy looking appearance. My friend told me she can even make it at home by herself. For me, I ordered a salmon teriyaki dish which cost me $10.75, and it was okay, the kind of food you can just get at anywhere. The food wasn't the worst part, it is their poor service that makes me rate them with only one star. There was rarely a service other than food delivery to our table. No water adding, nor asking if anything is needed. At the end of the meal, they asked for 20% tips for the whole thing! Moreover, the way they asked was very rude: the waitress counted the bills in front of us, and told us what we give was too little. I do not think they deserve an almost 20% service tips, not to mention the quality of the food and their attitude! I will never come to this restaurant again, and it is just a below-standard restaurant. I feel if you really want a good noodle soup or nice rice dishes, Menchanko-tei could be a better choice, which I think the food is much better and not pricy either.  But definitely not recommend Udon West, a kind of restaurant that you can see at anywhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of my favorite kids' book is Uptown by Bryan Collier, which explores life in Harlem through the eyes of a little boy.  My favorite line is this one... ""Uptown is chicken and waffles served around the clock.  At first it sounds like a weird combination, but it works."" And work it does.  If you're looking to try this treat, Amy Ruth's has a popular and tasty version, named the Reverend Al Sharpton.  I am not a huge fried chicken person, but theirs was ungreasy and crisp-skinned, served atop a huge, fluffy, moist waffle, with maple syrup.  Other hits included their sweet tea, cornbread, sweet potatoes, and mashed potatoes (mac and cheese was universally rated so-so).  One of our friends got the honey dipped chicken, which worked better on the waffle than off, and the ribs were ok. Don't bother with dessert; the red velvet cake was begging for a thicker layer of frosting and the peach cobbler tasted canned.  Stick with the Al Sharpton and you can't go wrong.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We were told the food was not ok!  If a restaraunt does not want to adapt to allergies that is their choice, but they should say so up front. What they did made someone very sick and for some allergies it  could have been worse. So the SERVICE STINKS! Also, the server from the get go was disinterested. She had no interest in our party or our experience.  It was too bad because the food was delicious and the cozy intimate atmosphere was very nice, but  the disregard was inexcusable.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My potatoes were cold (though spiced nicely, so they would have been great if warm), the salad had some dead leaves, I got meat when I asked for no meat, and I got the wrong kind of bread. Also, no refills on coffee is madness, but the coffee itself tasted fine. Lastly, my portion was tiny and I was still hungry after the meal.

The charcuterie plate is a great value for the money and the bruschetta are awesome. They have updated their menu and added  some more entrees. We tried the lamb shank and Salmon both were perfectly cooked and some tasty brussel spouts with pancetta.  I would not call this small plates, as the portions are closer to entree size. If the mac and cheese is a ""small plate"" I am afraid of what a regular plate is! The bourbon selection is great and you can try most in one ounce portions- nice on the wallet and minimizes the headache! The glass wine list is mostly under 10-11 bucks, which is great as it is harder and harder to get a decent glass for wine for less than 14 bucks these days.

I love that I can order a snappy juice concotion (especially at daytime) that is as satisfying as a cocktail but much more healthy.  Though on my last visit there I discovered their utterly irresistable sangria (maybe a special that night?) and I may never go back to juice. The space is beautiful and airy, lovely during the day with natural light pouring in from either end of the room; intimate and romantic at night with flickering candles and exposed brick on the walls.  I get a sense that the staff enjoys working here because they are warm, welcoming, and smiling--happy to engage with customers, yet completely professional, never crossing the line into getting cheeky.

"I first came here a few years ago and was not impressed.  I recently came back for lunch and am updating my review. I liked Ippudo much more this time around, mainly because (1) there was no wait and (2) I think they've toned down the saltiness of the food.  So I think Ippudo is a solid 4 now - I'm still never terribly impressed with ramen, but Ippudo is pretty good as ramen goes.  Here's what we had: -Hirata buns. The classic pork buns, the pork is nice and not too fatty (just enough).  I'm still not fond of mayo in my pork buns, but it's otherwise quite good. -Roasted shishito peppers. These are excellent with the yuzu salt. -Shiromaru hakata classic with pork belly. Really good pork flavor to the broth, it's very rich. The roast pork was a bit dry and underwhelming, but the pork belly add-on was very good.  The condiments went very well with the soup and the ramen was perfectly cooked.  Still a touch salty, but much better than I recall -Akamaru modern with egg.  The broth here is really good too, and the roast pork a little better.  The egg is a must-get.  And the ramen is quite good too. Overall pretty decent (though a bit pricier than I'd like for lunch).  And definitely better without a 3 hour wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Called and made a reservation for 8 people, they stated it would have to be at 6pm and 3 would have to be there at the time of reservation to be seated. When we arrived they said they had no reservation even though I called earlier in the day to confirm it. 5 people were there and they were giving them a hard time to be seated which is ridiculous. Only after persistence were they able to be seated. The food was good and actually came out quickly (Platano Relleno, Guac & chips, Empanadas and taquitos were the best). But management was not only rude, but unaccommodating. I brought in cupcakes so my gf could blow out a candle and he wanted to charge $2 per person to light the damn candle.

It's hard to find good food in Square but this is the place to bring your out of town friends.  This place does a great job putting out very solid food on a grand scale.  Reserve early and expect to wait but this is part of the experience.  Every one tries very hard to provide you with a great meal.  Family style dining so most of the items are for 3 of more guests.  What else can I say - very solid and consistent.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"This quaint, friendly Venezuelan restaurant in the heart of Chelsea is a reprieve from the trendy bad Thai food and over priced mediocre restaurants. It is a small friendly candle lit place that turns out great food like the empanadas, and traditional cuisine. We order 4 empanadas (cazon, carne, jamon y queso & Pabellon) to share and get a taste of different type. They were all very good although the shell was a bit tougher than I've had before. I'm sure it was re-heated and since we came for a late dinner it probably wasn't as fresh. We tried a variety of dishes and this time ordered the Asado Negro to try this time around. My friend enjoyed the dish but I'm not really a big fan of sweet mole type of sauce with pork. I much preferred La Bandeja the last time we went here. Overall, the food quality here is good and satisfying when you leave. I just happen to find a dish I didn't 'love' but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. Since the other side of the table cleaned the plate.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"When I heard Life Cafe was closing I was devastated. That is until I heard that the restaurant would only be temporarily closed as it goes through renovations and would shortly be re-opened. Now that it has been reopened I can safely say Im extremely disappointed.   While I must say the new layout and over all atmosphere is a little more laid back and more aesthetically pleasing I cant help but be turned off by the obvious act of gentrification that is happening in my neighborhood. The last thing we need in this area is another stuck up, fancy-schmancy, over priced restaurant/bar. Those are a dime a dozen out here in ""East Williamsburg"" I also feel a little disgruntled by the homophobic and sexist remarks I over heard among the staff/management. The rosemary fries were good and the sides were reasonably tastey but I noticed the mexican aspect of the restaurant is nearly gone which not only adds to my previous statement about gentrification but also leaves my taste-buds extremely let down. If you insist on checking 983 out I hope your pockets are deep, your taste buds are dull, and that you tip your server well (because they cant get paid nearly enough for the shit Ive seen them having to go through both at Life (some of the staff transfered over) and at 983)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've only been to Degustation twice, but both times have been fanastic. There's simply nothing better than taking a few hours to work your way through the tasting menu with friends, watching your food being prepared with expert precision and care by the chefs right in front of you. Service was impeccable both times, a benefit of the tiny (TINY) number of seats which are positioned around the prep area. Dishes are perfectly proportioned for a tasting menu, with a rich variety to keep the interest level high. Wine selection matches the food perfectly.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I requested a table near a window well in advance of my visit, but at the door was told that was impossible. The server (Matt?) was overly friendly and slightly obnoxious, even touching me at one point to adjust my collar. The food was good, as was the wine, but the presentation was lacking. Perhaps he didn't take presenting the wine to me seriously (even though I ordered it) because I was younger than everyone at my table? Food was good, but I wouldn't return due to the service.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was hungry--or I think I was hungry--last Thursday when it was 900 degrees outside.  The trees in Washington Square Park were breezeless, and the fountain was dry.  Through my tears of sweat and tears of tears, I spotted the Dosa Man on W 4th street. I thought, ""no way, it can't be.  It's summer. How is he doing this? The city is on fire, and he's cooking outdoors?! Is he made of magic?""  But that was a stupid question for I already knew that the Dosa Man is made of magic.  So I ordered my lunch from him. He was kind and wonderful as usual, and I blissfully waited for his uttapam (I ordered it spicy) to raise my internal temperature to match the external one. The Dosa Man and the Dosa cart are glorious. Everything I have ordered (which I think is everything) is perfect, and I would eat here every day if I could.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Was really looking forward to eating at this place. Left feeling frustrated. I am allergic to shellfish.The waiter gave me the wrong dish, which contained shellfish. When this was brought to his attention, he stated that  all soup broth served at this restaurant contain some type of shellfish and that I should have known that. His ""assistant"" waiter had the audacity to ask for a tip...he also wrote the word on a piece of paper...and  when I stated that I could wind up in an emergency room due to their mistake he responded by saying ""that's your problem"". I was appaulled by the attitude of these male waiters and have vowed to never return to the restuarant. So IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH BEWARE!!! I must say the prices are cheap, the only plus to the place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"What a disappointment.  Had lunch there with my almost 4 year old son.  The staff was as kind as can be but ... 1.   I knew I should worry when the table next to me was seated about 10 minutes after us and got their food first.  Took a long time for the food to come out.  That's usually fine so long as the food tastes good and is hot.  No luck there.  The hush puppies were luke warm.  My son's chicken fingers and french fries were cold.  How can fried food be cold? 2. A few minutes late, the brisket sandwich arrived ... cold and I told the server that it was cold (obvious if you just put your hand over it).  Told him the hush puppies were cold as well as my son's food.  He took back the hush puppies and the sandwich, but my son was hungry and he kept eating. 3. When I look at my son's plate, I realized we got the ""tailings"" of the french fries, the little odds and ends that are all crisped up with just a few real fries... for a kid's meal from the kid's menu?  Just not acceptable.  Anyone with kids will know and appreciate the fact that french fries is really the child's main course. 4.  I thought about not sending back the sandwich because I was afraid what would happen... and it happened.  It appeared they just microwaved the brisket and the brisket was really more cardboard than anything else, dry as can be with zero flavor. I am really disappointed to have to write this review.  I have gone to Bubby's for years, but just not recently.  No longer, off my list of neighborhood places.  Just plain sad.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I wish we had a camera to take a picture of the humongous veal parmigiana. It looked like they took the baby cow, smashed it flat with a hammer, breaded it, tomato sauced it, cheesed it and dropped it on a plate. It still had a bone sticking out and was overflowing over the edges of the platter sized plate. Did I mention how delicious it was? My friend said he hadn't tasted a veal parmigiana so good since Gino's in Boston closed 30 years ago. This is an example of how a family of 4 might come here and order a few antipasti, a salad, a pasta, one veal parmigiana entree, 2 desserts and everyone leaves full. 2 of us had the prix fixe dinner which was ok, the highlight being the homemade papardelle with mixed fresh seafood (I think it was a half portion but anything next to the veal parmigiana looked tiny). Negroamado wine was a nice recommendation from the waiter Mike. Good service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Food: Delicious! I have a special place in my food circle for Japanese curry - and this place doesn't disappoint. It's not the best that I've had - but the katsu and the curry in combination with the rice definitely took me back to some fond eating experiences while I was in Japan. Service: I have mixed feelings about the service here. The guy selling the $5 lunch boxes outside was outstanding. Very personable - and a cheerful seller. Inside - the service that I recieved at the counter was a bit disappointing. I wanted to add some of the pickled veggies to my meal - per the recommendation of the lunch box guy - but the cashier was being difficult. I offered to pay for it and she kept telling me that they could not do it. At last she gave me some and when I offered to pay, she wouldn't take my money. Location: While it is convenient for me because my office is a few blocks away - the restaurant itself is small and a little disappointing for a Japanese place. In comparison with some of the most casual curry counters in Japan - Go Go Curry still falls short. Overall I liked this place - and would recommend it to anyone who loves curry.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love love love love this place.  How can you not when the $1.00 stretches far here.  For less than $5.00 you can easily order up two meals.  $1.00 for five pork chive dumplings (fried), $1.75 for a sesame pancake with pork, and $0.75 for water.  So double up and take it home! I've tried a lot of things on the menu, and the fried pork dumplings and the sesame pancake with pork are among my favorites.  The noodles with meat sauce (ja jiang mein) or beef with noodles are not worth the $3.00 and you could probably fulfill that craving at Vanessa's dumpling down the street.   The place is small, but there are a few, and I really do mean a few, stools that you can sit and eat at -- but most stand outside the shop and eat their delicious treats. So give your wallet a break and your taste buds a thrill ride -- this is one great hole in the wall that I find myself revisiting again and again! Happy Eating!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It feels blasphemous to write a five-star review for the place which replaced the honest to god original Ray's Pizza earlier this year.  Especially since I am a sucker for nostalgia and everything old school NYC.  Even more so when I say that one of my favorite slices in NYC now is not your classic Neapolitan slice, the kind you eat folded in half, but instead comes in the shape of a square. The truth of the matter is, Prince Street Pizza's Soho Squares are just %&@*^%$ good pizza. Let's start with the crust.  The Soho squares are baked on heavy, what looks like cast iron, rimmed pans.  The effect is a perfectly golden brown and crisp exterior while the thick, inner section of the crust is soft, moist and buttery.  Next the sauce made in house.  It has that nice thick texture of crushed tomatoes to it.  You feel like you are eating something that came from a real tomato, not a jar or can from a factory.  It is slightly sweet and has a very very mild kick to it - a good balance.  The mozzarella comes next and is also made in house.  It's fairly mild and doesn't overpower the pizza.  This is definitely not a slice for people who love really cheesy pizza.  I think the ratio of crust to sauce to mozzarella is perfect though.  Last come the pepperoni slices.  They are nice thick cuts and baked along with the pizza until they turn slightly, slightly crispy and curl up at the edges.  This is important, because it keeps the fat from the pepperoni contained.  You can easily dispose of it if you please, but who are we kidding, just eat that #*@( up - you know it is #*(%&#$ good.   I am so happy that I live within walking distance because I can eat this pizza all the time.  I think there was actually one day where I went for lunch, dinner and a late night slice...  It's that good.  I've ordered whole pies here, but it's best to just go in for a slice and eat it right out of the oven.  Putting pizza this good into a cardboard box just doesn't do it justice. Almost all my friends I've brought here have said: ""This is the best slice of pizza I've ever had.""  That's a verbatim quote.  Personally, I'm hesitant to say this is the best slice in NYC, because I haven't gotten around to all of the outer borough spots, but it is hands down the best slice in Manhattan at the very least.  Take your canned artichoke dip in a can on a piece of $*(@+@ crust and fuggedaboutit!!!  Prince Street Pizza is the real deal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I was led to La Sirène by the glowing crowd-sourced reviews and was not disappointed; flawlessly executed food. We began with the octopus appetizer, which was copious and extremely tasty, and followed that with the filet mignon de porc and the hanger steak. The latter was perfectly cooked, generously proportioned, and had a wonderful garlic and pepper side sauce, while the pork was tender and excellent with a sauce that may have been even better than the steak's. The Bordeaux I had by the $9 glass was also very good. Also, the side-plate vegetables that accompany the main dishes, which in many restaurants would be an after-thought, were also quite wonderful: four or five different vegetables (green beans, purées, etc.) that all sang.

"Hatin and appreciating is what I do and to be honest it's a talent.  So NYC is known for its pizza, which it shouldn't be due to the talent and closeness of a good CT pie that is home to some of the best pizza down hands down.  Also most folks that come looking for a pie are not from true pizza areas such as I don't know Kansas LOL.  Anyways let me get off my soapbox.  I've been to Roberta's a few times mostly for Tiki Disco and this is where I tried there pies and a few apps.  You know for what they were doing the pie was pretty decent the idea, the prep and outcome is done right.  I think I could actually head there and have a sit down and engulf a pie.  My main deal is I love the venue during the summer months it caters to my taste in some ways.  Pizza, tall boys, strong drinks, good music and woman (yeah that's how I like it).  Some folks complain about the amount of hipsters, but I say this you don't complain about the amount of obnoxious post grad frat boys when you're out at a typical sports bar do you?  The truth be told extremes are annoying due to the fact in most cases it's not authentic.  I liked Roberta's and will continue to go and you should too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

There are a few non sea food choices but its seafood where they excel.  The seating is tight as the dining area is small but as the room is small you dont end up feeling overcrowded.

The seafood served is fresh and clean tasting and absolutely well prepared. My friend and I had salmon and scallops and both were moist and tender. The scallops had a nice outer crust but were not overcooked, which can happen so easily if you dont know what you are doing. We didnt bring wine and instead stayed with iced water which was refilled throughout the meal. Veggies that came with our entrees were thankfully cooked not overcooked and retained a slight bite.

"A friend and I fell upon this place, just randomly walking around West Village. Realize if you read previous reviews, I rarely make reservations, I like to bar hop and get it a taste of NYC restos. We walked in, very modern layout. Need the bathrooms, first 2 doors in the waiting area. We grabbed seats at the bar, realizing there were 2 bars. The difference between both one has the liquor bar! Nice and cozy, with a full open kitchen. Next time we'll seat there. The wine list is incredible, they have a range of varieties from each region of Italy. I was looking at the menu, and I totally flipped when I saw Sweetbreads, the best thing to eat! So I did Sweetbreads and my friend went for the Quail. To unique, but you got to try them both. At first I was shocked about the portion for the price we paid. But I finished my plate, even scrapping the last bit of sauce with bread. It was delicious. The sweetbreads had a parsnip puree with cranberries. The sweetness balanced with acidity and the fatty sweetbreads, I still have that taste in my mouth. And the quai, nice and crispy, with brussels sprouts and squash.... The bartender, Roberto was great on advice, and mention the menu is like a tasting menu, smaller portions to let you explore the menu. Bring your wallet, but it's worth it.

"I would AVOID at all costs. Initially appeared to be a friendly, busy bar. We were attracted by the Happy Hour signs (outside, on posters within the establishment) which are a common feature of bars in NY. We ordered 2 cocktails each, and they were reasonable. We then went to pay, and the bill did not match the prices advertised - we had been charged full price for some of the cocktails. We enquired, at which point the demeanour of all the members of staff changed. They became very aggressive and unpleasant, saying only some cocktails were at the Happy Hour prices. We were confused and stated that none of the advertising or staff who served us gave any hint of that. Again, their customer service was appalling, in response to what was very genuine confusion. The male bartender handed the bill back with sarcastic comments about a tip and the manageress couldn't even bring herself to say goodbye. This place appears to be very friendly when they're taking your cash, but very very unpleasant if, heaven forbid, you should not give them as much money as they want. Very hypocritical!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Incredible. Waiter was kind and had impressive knowledge about wines (for our party with a wine connoisseur) Everything here was fantastic. The pastas are a bit small so definitely plan for appetizers or to share something with it. This is the kind of place I reserve for very special occasions, it's going to cost you, but they serve a feast.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have to say that I wasn't expecting much of this Times Square establishment.... I tend to find that food in this area is more expensive than it is good. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Came with a party of 10 for a birthday linner--- made reservations, so no wait. We ordered a ton of food: stuffed mushrooms, stuffed artichokes, calamari to start. I can only speak of the delicious stuffed artichoke, it reminded me of grandmas home cooking. For linner we had cheese ravioli, rigatoni with garlic and broccoli, chicken parm, shrimp scampi, a veal dish, and a side of meatballs. Standouts: The chicken parm comes with melted mozzarella on every square inch= amazing. The meatballs were moist and tasty. We tried to squeeze in some dessert to celebrate a birthday- the chocolate torte and strawberry shortcake. The torte was extremely rich and dense chocolate.... the shortcake was impressive to look at-- in the shape of an actual strawberry, but mostly just whipped cream. Also, not to be missed, the pizza bread that comes with your meal... you might want to order extra.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I really liked this place.  For appetizers, definitely get the fried oysters with avocado and bacon.  Great combination of flavors. Steak tartare was good too but fried oysters were  better. On the dinner menu, the hamburger isn't on it but if you ask for it, they'll serve it. My hamburger was sooo good! A bit too greasy but delicious. Cooked just right. Didn't like the fries that much though.  The fried chicken was also good! Porkchop was a bit dry.  Staff was friendly and nice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Amazing!    I think I've tried just about everything on the menu I go so often.  Yesterday I had the steak & eggs (poached to perfection) with a kale salad and it was delicious!  The food & service keep me coming back every week.  The people there are super friendly & know a lot of their customers by first name. It's in a great location a block from Lafayette stop off the C train. The menu is diverse & has great options for people who have dietary restrictions...the gluten free pastries are the bomb!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Limited menu, but pretty solid burger.  I thought this was an Italian place when I walked past it (I work in the area), but then my friend told me it has great burgers, so we went before a show we were seeing that night.  The fries were bad though.  Really dry and hard and felt like they had been frozen, refried, and remicrowaved a dozen times before they finally got to me.  The toppings for the burger were pretty expensive (but I guess that is typical of the location) and to get a decent burger, you would've spent almost 20.  I could've went to Shake Shack for half the price.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I love this charming little sushi restaurant. The quality is generally excellent (I have to admit I've had one so-so meal here but I go here a lot); they turn over a lot of raw fish each day. Fairly standard menu and great lunch specials. It's like a private find in the Heights.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have never written a review on Yelp before, but after eating at Joe's Shanghai last night, I felt compelled to set the record straight.  Bottom line:  The food here is horrible.  I had high expectations coming in after seeing a four star rating on Yelp with 1000+ reviews, but was utterly and completely underwhelmed. Could not for the life of me understand the hype about the dumplings.  They are gross and horrible.  The whole fish is fishy and horrible.. the service, decor, everything - all horrible.  Best part of the meal:  the orange slices that come with the check. Not even worthy of half a star.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I used to love Amy Ruth's, but not anymore.  I used to order their catering for my clients in Harlem, and knew Carl the owner.  But that was a few years ago and now I wanted to order just a couple of dishes for a party I'm having do I went on-line to see if that;s still something they do.  I wanted to order the Mac & Cheese and the Collard Greens for 60 people.  I decided to make the arrangements in person and after work, traveled from Brooklyn on the subway.  They weren't interested in helping me because it was after 6 pm and the rule is that catering orders have to be placed before the catering manager leaves.  I was bent because it didn't say that anywhere on their website. (OK- my bad for not calling first.) So the trip wasn't in vain, I ordered a dinner plate to go: smothered chicken, mac & cheese and greens.  All told it came to $15-- (plus my carfare) and it was not even good.  Just OK.  No corn bread, and the portions were small.  I will not go out of my way for Amy Ruth's again.  And I'm ordering from someplace else for the party.  What a turn off.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Tasty and unique but not as great as I expected. I've had Spumoni Gardens bookmarked for some time and today presented me with the perfect opportunity to pay this place a visit and get a taste of the much talked about Square slice. About the pizza, it was pretty good. Its very saucy which is good thing because the sauce is the highlight of the slice. It has a distinctive sweet/tangy flavor that pretty much saves it from the downfall of not being cheesy at all. I know there was cheese on the slice but not much. Some slices had more cheese than others but even the cheesiest ones have very little cheese. The other thing I didn't like was the crust is kind of Doughy.  All in all it's still a good square pie but it defiantly wasn't this best in the borough, end all slice of pizza it's being made out to be. As far as the place goes I thought it was really cool, they have a large outdoor area to enjoy in the summertime (if your lucky to get a table with an umbrella). They even have a section of the restaurant that serves what appeared to be some delicious ice cream treats. I'd give the place a rating of 3.5, I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood and i'd enjoy the slice, but if I came here from another borough expecting greatness I would certainly be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm not gonna lie.  I'm cheap.  I went in here with cheap expectations and you know what, they met them.  I got a been enchalada with taco shells on the side.  The beans and cheese were fresh and it had a nice kick overall. It felt like I was at my grandmother's house and that's a great compliment since she is the queen of Mexican food.  Really enjoyed this place and will be back without a doubt.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Been here a few times for brunch already and it's always worth going back.  While it can get pretty packed without a reservation, it's easy to see why. The food, especially the homemade pickled veggies, are amazing. The pickled beets and jalapenos are worth a try. As for meals, I've tried both the chicken and grits, and the western omlet on separate occassions.  My gf had one of the southern biscuit sandwiches and we both loved all of the above.  As an added plus, despite how packed the restaurant is, the staff does their best to get you seated promptly and the restaurant makes substituting ingredients extremely easy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wanted to dine at Amy Ruth's for the last 5 years and finally had the opportunity yesterday. It was horrendous.  From the uninspired  cornbread that tasted exactly like it came  out of a Jiffy cornbread box, to the crabcake that was chock full of artificial crabmeat, to the chicken wings that we ordered as an appetizer that had the same flavor of the wings I order at my local Chinese restaurant, my entire meal was a disaster. Both my parents are from South Carolina and I spent every summer of my youth in the south, so I KNOW  southern cuisine and this was NOT it.  I'm inclined to believe that this food will be appreciated by people who don't know anything about southern/soul cooking. The potato salad was watery, the sweet tea wasn't like any I'd tasted before.  It was brown sugar water.  You couldn't taste the tea.  My boyfriend's short ribs had some wierd colored gravy on it.   It wasn't bad, but  it wasn't good either.  I will say the sweet potato (it wasn't yams) was ok. The guy at the door was very nice and allowed me to be seated while my dining partner parked the car and our server was very nice. DO NOT go here looking for ""authentic"" southern cuisine if you've had good soul food in the past or if you had Sunday dinner at your mom's house the week before.  Amy Ruth does not compare and does not live up to it's repuation.  The food is a mass produced mess!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Four stars for now because I haven't tried the food. We waltzed in on a Saturday afternoon and this place was shockingly empty (even for 4 pm). Meanwhile, Bedford was crawling with human beings, many of them choosing other drinking holes. Biblio is somewhat stenciled in the gastropub mold, but is friendly and cozy. The bartender tended to us very nicely. We sat on the back porch, which is one of those converted Brooklyn back yards, and sipped some great late summer brews. They had a couple of very sold Belgian and Belgian-style ales as well as hefeweizens and the rest. Things definitely started to pick up as we were leaving.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Some colleagues first took me to Sakagura to celebrate the end of a difficult negotiating period at the United Nations. I failed to see the small sign in front of the building, and when they led me down some cellar stairs behind the elevator, I joked: ""Are you guys taking me somewhere to kill me or feed me?"" They responded: ""Wait, when we open this cellar door you will be transported to Tokyo."" And indeed I was transported to the most eye-opening, amazing Japanese dinner I have had this side of the world. We paired up every amazing dish with the sake recommended by the knowledgable staff, and nary a sushi roll was to be found. It is the most authentic, creative and inspiring meals around. I've since dubbed it ""Secret Japanese Place"".

But it would definitely benefit from less hipsters. My experience would have also been more enjoyable if I weren't eating on top of my neighbors on a small cramped table near the entrance.

"***WARNING: CONTENT OF REVIEW MAY RUIN YOUR APPETITE.*** Having had a few bad experiences with diarrhea after eating out, I developed the D-Scale, where I give grades based on the reaction of my bowels.  The scale works as follows: A = No diarrhea! B = A loose stool hours later that may or may not be attributable to the restaurant reviewed.   C = Diarrhea hours later.  Pretty sure it was what I ate.   D = Diarrhea upon coming home or back to work.  Or frequent diarrhea hours later F = Had diarrhea in the restaurant and/or had diarrhea for more than 4 hours.   I hold a one strike and your out policy for C grades and below despite the taste of the food.   Now, my review of Udon West: D-Scale Grade: D+ I should have known not to order the chicken teriyaki curry.  So I gave them a D plus because I should have known better.  The picture on the menu already looks like diarrhea.  When I came back to work, I felt like I had to fart but wasn't sure if it would actually be excrement.  When in doubt, always err on the side of caution.  Long story short, it was a two flusher and had some longevity.  I don't know if it is a two-parter.  I still feel uneasy.   The service and food itself was great.  I may break my one strike rule and try something that is less likely to to give me the runs.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Let me just tell you, I am so glad I have Yelp to explore all these new places! Random outing last night with a few friends and we didn't want to go to far from my apartment (okay, maybe it was more like me who didn't want to travel...) so we Yelped out and found this place. Made a reservation for an hour from then and bam, we're there and ready to eat. Hidden in the skirts of KTown, it's a tad hard to find this place because you have to walk down the stairs. MEW Izakaya is dimly lit for intimacy yet it's a pretty wide open space. It's pretty romantic yet great for having a beer and some Japanese appetizers with friends. Don't know what you get or what each dish consists of? No worries, they've got a menu with pictures! Regardless of what you get, all the food is pretty good. - The Okonomi yaki (Japanese pancake) is pretty big for sharing. - The avocado tofu salad is light and crisp ginger dressing. The MEW special roll had a great texture. Soft tuna & salmon pieces with some mouthwatering avocado? Yes, please! - But what do I definitely recommend? Get the Omu soba (yakisoba wrapped in an omelet) and the tempura soup. Just looking at the Omu soba was so intriguing and the yakisoba has so much flavor. Plus to be wrapped in an egg? Ch'yeahhhh, boy! And the tempura soup was surprisingly a lot better than what I expected. The broth had full flavor and the fish cakes were large in portions. Will definitely make the trip back. And soooooo glad that's it's so convenient to get to!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is one of those amazing little shops in my area that I have to thank Yelp for. I would have never wandered in on my own, but with some guidance I found it, loved it, and have gone back many a time. Food: My first time in was when I had a craving for a simple sandwich for lunch at work one day. I was quick to zip to Yelp, and found Lamazou. I smiled, thought it would be a great idea, and when I got there I waited in a line outside the door. Now, I'm of British heritage, it is in my blood to queue, but it cracked my up that New Yorkers were having any of it. Just goes to show how great Lamazou is. One glance at the lunch menu and I knew what my mouth and tummy wanted: Their Flaminco. Serrano ham and manchego cheese on a baguette? Sign me up! Since that fateful lunch day, I have continually returned to Lamazou for the occasional simple and inexpensive sandwich. But my relationship has evolved. When I do wine parties with the girls: I go to Lamazou. When I do tapas dinners for friends: I go to Lamazou. When I feel the craving for any sort of Kinder chocolate (although they lack Kinder Eggs): I go to Lamazou. It's an amazing little shop, and if you're in the area, you must shop by. Venue: It's a tiny shop, it can probably only hold about four customers at one time, but every single space on the wall is covered with European imports and delicious foods. The men behind the counter make a mean sandwich, and the woman at the cash register is quick to recommend something to do with anything you might want. While I've never asked, I'm sure you can get things special ordered. I plan on asking for some andouille for a gumbo I'm working on, and I'm hoping they can get it for me!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went here last weekend for brunch and it was not as great as it looked from the outside.  The food was ok at best-- but the price for the portion was quite a bit more than it should be.  I ordered 2 poached eggs with a tomato/pepper sauce (it came with pita bread & hummus too) but I could have made that meal myself for less than $4! The service was even worse!  I ordered a juice drink (which I immediately regretted because it was a whopping $4!) which never even came, but showed up on our bill anyway.  The waitresses were quite inattentive and seemed to stare into space instead of doing their job.  The brunch was also supposed to come with free American coffee which we never received either.   If you want a good brunch place in Park Slope go to Aperitivo ($13 brunch including unlimited mimosas/bellinis/champagne!!!) I may try this place again for dinner/lunch, but there's probably a lot better out there.","[0.0, 1.0]"
