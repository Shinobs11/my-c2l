352538,184726,3080,2014-03-11,"Read a review about The Marshal & was impressed by their farm-to-table concept. The small and quaint interior was welcoming & inviting. Upon sitting at the bar I was immediately greeted & offered a drink. The wine by the glass selection was decent for the small sized bar. I decided on two ""starters"" for dinner, the raw butternut squash salad & the scallops. Both came out quickly & were amazing! Shaved raw butternut squash with goat cheese, walnuts & cherries was the perfect flavor combo! The scallops were cooked perfectly & wrapped in duck bacon served with fig jelly, again, awesome flavor combinations! I was too full to enjoy dessert but no doubt it would be just as good if I decided on it. Would highly reccomend for someone looking for a unuiqe dining experience with amazing personal service! Can't wait to return on my next trip!",5.0,1,0

491251,230264,3207,2014-08-30,"First sign of good BBQ is the smell of BBQ down the block.  After parking the car I could smell the smoke.  I went for lunch.  Get there before 12 noon to miss the line out the door. Meal:  Brisket sandwich, side of mac & cheese and beans.  Also two slices of turkey. Brisket was terrific.   Mac & Cheese very good.   Beans were good but a little too sweet.   Turkey was moist and tender.  Turkey can easily be over smoked and dry and it was done just right. The sweet BBQ sauce was good and I added it at the table.   Corn bread was OK.   The sweet tea was also good. I've been to Bear's in Windsor and it was good but lacked atmosphere.  The new Hartford location has great BBQ and atmosphere.   Two negatives: 1.  The parking situation-- you have to find a metered spot or park in the garage. 2.  Price.  It was a bit pricey for lunch. This is a GREAT addition to the Hartford dining scene.",5.0,1,0

But really, you come here for the pizza and the pizza here is very good. We had sausage, basil, tomato, cheese. Simple ingredients. Just the way I like my pizza. The crust was SOOOOOO GOOD. AGHHHHH! I loved it. Overall the food here is great but the wait can be annoying. My paragraph rant: The wait was pretty long ~ 1hr at 830pm on a Friday. Now, I'm used to waiting and it's okay with me, but one of my pet peeves is when the host grossly underestimates the wait time. He told us 20 minutes and we ended up waiting at least 1 hr. Is it so much to ask that the host SET EXPECTATIONS properly? It's always better to undersell and over deliver. Nevertheless, I would come back to Luzzo's because the pizza is some of the best in NYC.",4.0,1,0

Artichoke and cheese dip served with toast. I only ate my own entree, which was filet mignon with caramelized onions and mashed potatoes and I have to say it was pretty good.

329769,20986,2870,2010-01-10,"Review w/ pics in Blog Arriving just before 8:45PM the place was (as expected) packed, but there was an open seat for one at the bar just calling my name.  Coat and bag checked with the ridiculously cute coat-check girl I took my seat and once I declined alcohol my water glass was filled immediately and kept full throughout the meal. A few notes about sitting at the bar in January - it is absolutely fantastic to watch the cooks, especially the head chef, do their craft at such a rapid place without missing a beat. That noted, you will get elbowed by passers-by (not the staff) and every time the door opens you can fully expect a blast of cold air.  While the elbows were a tad frustrating, the air was never really a bother as I was in a sweater and the grill was damned hot, anyhow.  Service, both at the bar and at the seats, was very professional and my only ""gripe"" is that they require one to order everything at once instead of adding courses depending on hunger. Watching the chefs work I must note the music - this is a Batali restaurant and the music followed suit - a little too loud, but excellent featuring the Doors, Hendrix, The Who, and The Stones.  Arriving approximately 5 minutes after my order was placed I received a basket of bread - a crusty Italian served with a bowl of bay leaf and rosemary olive oil with about 6 whole olives.  Excellent flavor, good balance, smooth and glassy - I ate two mini-loafs of the bread and asked for some extra olives which were presented without question or charge.   Arriving shortly after I'd started working on the bread was my first dish - Duck Egg with Mojama, dried potatos, and winter truffles.  Probably the most famous dish at Casa Mono there is good reason - the egg was flawless and creamy, the Mojama salty and not at all fishy, the dried potatoes ""dry cooked"" like a baked potato but certainly not ""DRY"" and the smooth truffles lending an earthy component and their complex aroma - wowing.  Clearly an in interpretation of breakfast with the combination of eggs, potatoes, and a meat I'd eat this for breakfast anytime - and although it is still early it is the best savory I've eaten in 2010 - better than anything at Ko, A Voce, or Daniel. Telling my server that my socks were indeed knocked off my plate was collected and I went back to watching the cooks as they prepared what must have been 10 orders of Brussels Sprouts for various tables - it is apparently their #1 seller.  Arriving after approximately 15 minutes (longer than Baba O'Reily, at least) was Sweetbreads with Fennel al Mono.  Perfectly fried and piled three high, the sweetbreads were wonderful - creamy interior, crunchy exterior, no gaminess at all and melt-in-the mouth.  Set atop pan seared fennel - cooked just past perfect with a little bit of char - and topped with a reduction of golden raisins and I believe some sort of sweet alcohol - this is a beautiful dish that I'd heard mixed reviews of in the past but found to be on par with the excellent deep-fried sweetbread preparations of Chang and Symon. My final dish - and another winner - was Foie Gras with Cinco Cebollas.  Drizzled with truffle oil just prior to service and again piled high (clearly Casa Mono has an interest in vertical food) this dish was astounding.  Featuring creamy leeks, a ""flower"" of red onion, long sliced green onions, pickled cipollinis, and I believe also scallions as a base, topped with toasted bread, and then with the large portion of seared foie (smelling this cooked in front of me was fantastic) I found this dish fascinating in the same way as Savoy's preparation in Vegas - using something pungent and heavily nuanced to temper the unctuous liver instead of something sweet - and I think I may have actually liked this version better.   Prepared at the station closest to back I didn't get to see this one made aside from the torch used to caramelize the bread, Bread Pudding with Port Poached Pear and Caramel Ice Cream was the first horizontal plate of the night featuring a ""scoop"" of the pudding, a half of a warm and punchy pear, and thick-rich caramel ice cream.  While the pudding itself was excellent with hints of cinnamon, custard, and pumpkin I found the pairing with the port pear to be a tad strange until I tasted it with the bitter-sweet ice cream that sort of smoothed everything out creating an overall flavor of an alcoholic pumpkin pie - unique and good, but not as good as the savories - again, better than the desserts at Ko, though. When it was all said and done I was full but not stuffed and happily paid the bill.  Overall I must say I really enjoyed the experience and if I lived local I could see this being the kind of place to go with friends for food and drinks at night - but I also agree with Casa Mono's Michelin Star because the food, service, and experience is on par with most of Batali's other restaurants - perhaps even better.",5.0,1,0

I can absolutely say I had the best experience ever! Why?! Because I came, ate, and conquered! LOL The chicken and waffles was amazeballs and the maple butter was the icing on the cake. I've never been a waffle fan (I'm more of a fench toast or pancake girl to be honest) but Clinton St Baking Company has to be doing everything right to produce such fluffy and light waffles.

Never gonna happen in Chicago. Oh, the locals think it does and for some reason chefs keep opening ""seafood"" restaurants to much fanfare (ie GT Oyster), but guess what - they're straight up wrong.  If one were only to take a look at a map, one would notice a funny thing about the Midwest & Chicago in particular: it's about, oh, 600-700 MILES FROM THE NEAREST SALT WATER. That overpriced tiny oyster being sucked down is most likely a week old & already rackin up stupid frequent flier miles. Kinda sad in sustainability crazy 2012. All that being said, I personally have a funny habit - I try my darndest to only eat sea creatures when I am near the sea.  So on any trip back to the East Coast, I make a point to gorge myself on as much seafood as possible.  This trip was barely 24 hrs and I hit four spots, one of which was this Disneyland of Italian food, Eataly. Overall not a bad experience. A dizzying array of food choices in a supermarket on steroids can actually yield some true gems in the rough.  The urchin and raw, surprisingly nutty rock shrimp I slurped down at the seafood counter were both elegantly simple and simply spectacular. However the ""fresh"" pasta I watched being made while I did so left me disturbed.  The giant shiny Willie Wonk-ish ravioli machine resplendant with two large rolls of pasta resembling paper towel rolls seemed to be cartoonishly stamping a single raviolo out of each large sheet of dough. When I inquired with the starched white & oversized Oomp-Loompa manning the contraption, he said that because of the size & shape of this particular pasta shape (4"" square with squiggle edges), the machine could only make one at a time out of each 7"" sheet of dough.  The trimmings could not be used again because the dough would be too tough.

We started out with the Hiramasa Tartare and a deconstructed eggplant parm. I loved these dishes and especially the hiramasa- nice acidic cut through a creamy/ oily sauce with some cilantro. The deconstructed egg-plant was really cool with all the ingredients (bread crumbs, cheese, tomatoes standing on their own where you combine them yourself)- A+ for originality and recommend it if only for the cleverness. Main- Pork Tenderloin Parmesan and Blue Moon Sea Scallops. The pork was smoked with a side of canellini beans covered with a fried egg in a garlic broth. Fantastic. The Sea scallops were perrfectly cooked  and covered in a fantastic garlic sauce. There was some fennel sausage sprinked in over the scallops and made a perfect combo. Both dishes were very hearty: comfort food comes to mind. Desert- apple pie souffle- lets just say it was tasty. Perfect texture, freshly prepared. If you order this you'll have to wait like 20 minutes but it's worth it if you are of the souffle persuasion. Bottom Line: I really recommend this place. The iron chef was actually there preparing meals!!! How often do you see that??? It's a little dark in the dining room. The cocktails are STRONG.

It was a bit dark for me the night we came but still warm and romantic.   The man escorting everyone to their tables, who I assume was the manager was very good to us. He was attentive, alert and friendly.  He immidiately took our coats and had us seated.  Once we were there I think he noticed that my husband and I were seated in a bit of a tight spot between two other couples, (I am 8 months pregnant and my husband is 6/2 with a football player's build) and he kindly offered us a table for four since that table wasn't reserved till 9:30. The seats & tables are very close to eachother.  We greatly appreciated that. Our server was great.  He was a tall blonde gentlemen with an accent.  He checked in on us often. He took our order and we recieved it as ordered (our churasco skirt steaks were cooked to our asking.  He was very friendly and attentive.  Our water was always filled and my husbands drinks came when he asked them to arrive during the meal. As far as the food goes, we were both disappointed.  Not because the food was bad but because it wasn't anything too extraordinary or wowing.  We had expected from  the popularity of the restaurant and the pricing that the food would be mouth watering, and it was just good.  I had the octopus appetizer and was disappointed in how charred it was, and how much the sauce tasted like just plain mayonaise. My husband's lobster bisque  was delicious.  The warm bread they give in the beginning was nice.  We had the churasco skirt steaks for an entree and the flan for dessert. My appetizer and the two entrees were pretty small portions.  The steaks were a bit small compared to photos we had seen but were pretty tasty. The flan was delicious.   Overall, I like Tabare.  I think its a beautiful restaraunt, the service is excellent and the food is well done and tasty.  However, for a $135 night I don't know that the food is worth that high of a price.  Perhaps, the crowded restaurant made consistency difficult to keep up.  We don't mind paying that I just don't think the food was worth the money.  I wouldn't mind returning and trying the food again because the place is beautiful and the service is fantastic.",3.0,1,0

My friends fiancee was having his Bachelor party (that my guy was at), so we decided to have a little messy fun of our own. We actually walked 2 miles here (we needed to work up an appetite) and got here 15 mins after it opened: already was almost full in the back and only 2-3 tables were open. If you can, come before normal dinner rush hours... this place gets packed after 7/8pm. We kicked things off with a bottle of Sauv Blanc - tip: its New Zealand, which is my personal favorite. All their bottles of wine are $28 - not bad! Tip: Get a full glass down the hatch before you begin crackin' as your hands get juicy and youre so obsessed with your meal that you don't touch your wine for an hour. We ordered the 6 oyster appetizer: the mignonette sauce was vinegar and full of chopped shallots.. the red cocktail sauce had a nice little horseradish kick. Our oysters were plump and fresh. We kicked things off with a C combo (crawfish and a dungenous crab), as well as a full pound of king crab legs. All combos come with a teeny piece of corn and a few halved baby potatoes. We got it medium spicy: it you like spice, start here (anything hotter and you probably wont be able to taste the seafood). Because we are 5'3"" and full of spunk, we challenged each other to split one more effing dungenous.. that baby was tough to fit in whatever stomach space we had left, but oh-so-worth-it.  I was licking my fingers, my palms, and my elbows (JK!) by the end of the meal. This place is CASH only, so come prepared (pricing for meals is listed on their website so you can plan accordingly. My advice: bring twice as much cash as you think youll spend here).

I could chalk that up to the kitchen's fault, but the waitstaff is nonapologetic and sometimes rude. Maybe that has to do with dealing with drunk rednecks all the time, but if a customer is nice, please be nice. I have a hard time justifying much of a tip at this place. And the food is really not very good. They have some things that sound good, but they really don't execute, nor do they use good quality food.

467431,137910,3259,2014-01-14,"Without a doubt Ippudo creates ramen the way it's meant to be. Food: 5 Stars There are few ways to describe the food at Ippudo and I can't think of any other than delicious. The chicken and/or pork buns are a must have for starters. The amount of spice and flavor that blends with the chicken/pork the lettuce and even the bun itself is amazing. To the people who have phobias of spicy food, it is time to convert and eat this splendid dish. Even if you come here only to try the buns the trip is worth it. I have only tried about 1/4 of the starters in the many times I have been to Ippudo and you can't go wrong with any of them from the buns to the Shishito. Of course what would a ramen place be without the ramen itself? After trying all, but one of the ramen dishes (except the Shoyo Ramen [BLARG TO VEGETABLES!!! BLARG I SAY]), the classic is my favorite. All the ramen at Ippudo lack that sodium (salt) enriched flavors that you find at cheap ramen places or instant ramen. Instead you taste the silky smooth broth blended together with all the fresh ingredients. I know I sound like an advertisement for Ippudo, but it is just incredible. It makes it worth waiting an hour to get a table. Drinks: 4.25 Stars Overall Ippudo has a standard lineup of beers, wine and sake found in most Japanese restaurants, but my favorite drink has to be the Shochu w/ Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit Juice. It's shochu with grapefruit juice, so what? The only reason it is my favorite, isn't because of the flavor, it's because you have to do the work yourself. They provide you with the shochu is a glass as well as a half grapefruit and a juicer. In other words you squeeze the grapefruit yourself. You can't get any fresher than that. I haven't tried all their mixed drinks yet, but being the alcohol lover that I am, it's only a matter of time. Service & Ambiance: 4.5 Stars As you are being seated/leaving the restaurant, it is a very homely feeling, but the overwhelming crowds and wait time makes you want to find another place to eat. DON'T DO IT! Ippudo is NEVER empty. There is always a crowd no matter what time you arrive. The servers are always there to help you if you have any questions especially since there are many new faces that arrive there daily hearing about how excellent  Ippudo is. Overall: 5 Stars No matter how good/bad the service is, or how crowded/quiet it is, the food is the star of the show here. There is no doubt that Ippudo is one of my favorite restaurants and I will be going there many more times in the near future. No matter what your tastes are, Ippudo is a restaurant you go to have your mind blown each and every time you return.",5.0,1,0

522668,20918,2017,2012-04-07,"This temple to pork tonsoku, aka pig trotters, is tiny, a cubical wood-paneled dining room overlooking West Village.  Like the Spotted Pig, you'll often run into paraphernalia of the oft featured beast, sophisticated red stamp on napkins and paper lanterns, a pig-shaped box perched on a sedate sake and glassware shelf, unapologetically pink and cute, with ears. Hakata Ton Ton features the cuisine of the southernmost island of Japan, Kyushu, and Hakata (officially known as Fukuoka) is the largest city, both illustrated on a huge map on one wall.  I am not familiar with it and very eager to try.  Pork is the focus, and their most famous tonsoku is ubiquitous on the menu.  Other regional specialty ingredients that show up frequently are collagen and mentaiko (spicy cod roe).  There's a special menu collecting together offal offerings, called motsu.  There's even a tasting menu, very reasonably priced.  Overall, the menu reminds me of Japanese izakayas, rambling and expansive, with plenty of small plates and several shabu (hot pots), which seemed like requisite ordering. Their beverage menu is also long, casual, and varied. On a whim, we inquired about same day reservations while in the area and got prime time seats at the L-shaped bar, which doesn't offer any advantage over tables except if you're dining solo; nothing much happens there.  Comfortable enough, casual and low-key atmosphere.  Service was courteous and efficient, and warm as well. Choosing from the menu was fun (because of all the interesting choices) and challenging (so much to choose from!).  There were many plates that were good and well-made but straightforward and not otherwise exciting, like crispy skinned gyoza on a hot plate and classically steamed monk fish liver.  Others inspired wide-eyed looks of delight, like a luscious, cool salad of tonsoku chunks and cucumbers, touched with heat, and the veal liver sashimi, smooth, earthy, and well dressed with citrus, sesame, and scallions. Their sauce-heavy okonomiyaki was served in the shape of a loaf or layered cake, a rich version of melded ingredients and big flavors.  Soft shell crab arrived in unrecognizable fried chunks, but were lightly crispy, with an interesting, slightly tart and savory flavor, and good crab underneath. The shabu takes the longest to prepare.  As we worked on our small plate parade, the staff brought out a portable gas stovetop, set the large stone pot of broth and ingredients on top, and started the cooking.  After everything wilted into the bubbling broth, we spooned out portions into serving bowls and dug in.  Portions are sized by the number partaking, minimally for two.  We chose the Hakata TonTon Hot Pot with tonsoku, Berkshire pork belly, dumplings, tofu, and a garden of vegetables in their collagen broth.  Delicious, rich and porky in flavor, this hearty shabu makes a great meal by itself; perfect for a cold night. I loved the trio of condiments set out for each party.  Yuzu kosho and yuzu hot sauce were both addictively tasty, refreshingly tart, and dispensed a nice heat, with the relish-like kosho edging out as my favorite.  I think they could go with nearly everything.  Both can be purchased from Hakata Ton Ton, and in fact, I may have to go back to get that yuzu kosho. To end, a special strawberry ice cream confidently labeled ""delicious,"" which I found hard to dispute, accompanied by imported pre-packed mochi, the classic sticky and sweet version; I'm undecided about being served pre-packaged products (would I have felt better to have them put it on a plate for me?  I suppose it doesn't matter much), but either way, I don't personally like traditional mochi. Hakata Ton Ton is a casual Japanese restaurant serving hearty, satisfying food from a region not well represented in NYC.  I think they nailed the best description for their own cuisine when they call it ""Japanese Soul Food.""  It's justifiably popular but under the radar with the profusion of newer, hotter Japanese restaurants.  Not to be overlooked, it's excellent and well worth a visit.  Also, a fun note that our waitress followed us out and offered candy from a pig-shaped PEZ dispenser.  Simply quirky and charming.",4.0,1,0

246328,52944,2136,2012-05-21,"My friends and I rolled up to Lucali on a Saturday night a couple weeks ago for dinner. I specifically say 'roll' because we drove and were fortunate enough to find an open parking space in front of the restaurant, where my friend made a hilariously awful parallel park. It was so bad that the hostess asked him if he was from New Jersey (ouch!). This really hurt his pride, but I think it's partly what got us a table. Lucali is a busy place and when we arrived people were crowding underneath the awning, but someone cancelled right when we got there, so a combination of that and a little sympathy for parking-gate nabbed us a table in fairly short order. On our way in I overheard the hostess remark that the wait was an hour and a half. Yikes! I first heard about Lucali from Paulie Giannone at Paulie Gee's, which is the first pizza joint I've been to that I would ever consider a date spot. Paulie said that he modeled his restaurant on Lucali, and I can see why. Low candle lighting, exposed brick, molded tin ceiling and wood furnishings? Yep. Kitchen(?) and pizza oven in the totally exposed and hardly separated back half of the restaurant? You bet. BYOB? Hell yeah! Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong playing? Ain't misbehavin'. Lucali has a very sparse menu - pizza and calzones, nothing more. Choose what you want, add toppings and go! We got sausage and onions in our calzone and garlic and basil on our pie. The calzone wasn't what we were expecting - instead of a short speed bump-shaped lump of dough and cheese, what came out was something that looked like a big slice of pizza that had been folded over on itself in thirds from tip to crust. Inside is nestled an impressive array of cheeses that I can't entirely remember, but I think there was ricotta, mozzarella, bufula mozzarella, parmigiano and a secret cheese that our server couldn't disclose (we think it was a mild blue). The calzone was pretty good, but a little light on the toppings. Out next came the pizza. If you are a devotee of thin crust pizza, you need to drop everything and get to Lucali now. The crust was so paper thin and brittle that it felt as though it shattered like a very finely caramelized sheet of sugar. It also had a decent bit of char on it. The cheese was great and the sauce was good, but the entire experience was overshadowed by the basil. Instead of dropping a couple leaves here and there, our pie had a generous helping of sprigs, such that I had a tough time tasting anything but the basil. Service was a little distracted - we had to flag down the servers multiple times to refill our water glasses - but overall the experience was really great.",4.0,1,0

448256,46979,3806,2011-01-04,"Mulberry Street,a tree-lined stretch lined with avant garde boutiques and charming red brick facades, just may be one of NYC's most charming.  Situated in trendy Soho, the neighborhood is hardly lacking in the restaurant department but, while there are a few gems, I find it safe to say that quantity prevails over quality.  To put it more gently, there are not too many eateries that I would consider ""destination worthy."" ...That was, until I dined at Balaboosta.  Middle Eastern and Israeli small plates (though there are full-sized entrees, too) line the menu at Einat Admony's second successful restaurant venture (she also has Taim which, arguably, is home to the city's best falafel). Balaboosta's space could best be described as cozy, rustic, and lively. Exposed-brick walls, a tiny open-kitchen, book shelves lined with wine bottles and chotchkies, and dim lighting anoint the interior.Upon seating, Moira and I were handed food and drink menus as our server simultaneously listed that particular evening's specials - which were also hand-written on a chalkboard, conveniently hung above our table. A gratis bowl of addictive seasoned-crisps (god knows what they were made of and shame on me for being too distracted to ask!) arrived with our beverages.  Along with my red sangria, I ordered a glass of homemade mint-lemonade.  Double-fisting never tasted this delicious. Instead of ordering separate entrees, Moira and I chose to share an array of small plates. Balaboosta's Smoked Eggplant Bruschetta: Hugging the top of a crunchy, super-buttery slice of toasted bread was a thick schmear of garlicky, creamy, smoked eggplant dip.  A lawn of emerald-green parsley shreds crowned the Bruschetta. While I typically take my salads with extra dried cherries, candied pecans, blue cheese, and some sort of creamy dressing - I have to give Balaboosta credit for creating a colorful plate of lightly-dressed greens.  Citrus segments, thinly-sliced radish, and roasted squash were dressed in a tangy blood-orange vinaigrette. Falafel-wrapped meatballs: This dish was the turning point - the moment, during the meal, when I fell in love.  What appears to be falafel-on-a-stick is actually a falafel-wrapped meatball on-a-stick.  And this isn't just any falafel, it's the famous product that put Taim and Balaboosta on the culinary map!  A crunchy, flavor roller coaster of exterior falafel gives way to a meatball that is so perfectly cooked and juicy, that you can't help but wonder, How in the hell did they pull this off?  A parsley-oil topped tahini sauce proves to be the ultimate accompaniment. Fried Olives & Organic Labne, Harissa Oil: A small bowl is filled with organic Labne (a Middle Eastern yogurt/cheese), a thin drizzle of harissa oil, and topped with the most perfect, golden, fried-green olives.  Long tooth picks/sticks join the dish as olive-dipping utensils. The presentation of the hummus and pita was more pleasing that its actual taste.  While there was nothing fundamentally wrong, I found the pita bread to be on the dry side and could not figure out why the hummus was served in a guacamole-esque mortar bowl. While Balaboosta's falafel-wrapped meatballs had me falling in love, it was the ""Crispy Cauliflower"" dish that changed my life.  Literally. I was so taken aback when our server informed us that the cauliflower was the most ordered - and raved-about - item on the menu.  I mean, wasn't this the crap that our mothers forced us to eat by threatening ""no dessert until you finish your veggies?""  I couldn't figure out why this tasteless, texturally awkward and, frankly, gnarly vegetable was so popular. That was...until I hesitatingly tasted it for myself.  Florets of cauliflower were dredged in crack a delicate batter, fried, and then tossed with sweet currant berries and earthy pine nuts.  Sure, this may sound like an odd combo, but take it from a former 'hater: this is one of NYC's most delicious and unique dishes.  I would return to Balaboosta for the cauliflower, alone.",4.0,1,0
529192,242014,1416,2011-12-10,"Last night, I went to Tashan with a fellow foodie friend of mine (and lover of Indian cuisine).  I've read great reviews of this place, so I was super excited to get Friday night reservations.  The decor was beautiful: very modern and cozy, with an open kitchen...it looks like a great place to be on a chilly Friday or Saturday night.   Overall, the experience was fine, but just a few issues that need to be ironed out: 1. Our waiter, who had been there since the opening, was not as familiar with the menu as he should've been.  The kicker was when he mispronounced (twice) ""gulab jamun"", a popular Indian dessert. 2. We sat very close to the kitchen, which gave us a front-row seat to the chaos and confusion with numerous orders and which table they belonged to.  There was a lamb shank that was sent to a table near us twice, and twice the couple sent it back saying that they didn't order it. 3. Our order of ""Butter Chicken"" (which was a somewhat tasteless tomato-y chicken tikka masala) was a late arrival to the table.   4. It seemed like our water glasses were being filled after taking one sip!!  It was way too much. To be fair, the staff are very friendly and customer-oriented.  The chef, Sylva Senat, came over to our table to inquire about our dining experience.  Also, one of the managers offered us complimentary Tashan martinis to compensate for the late Butter Chicken. I'm hoping that these are just growing pains that will be resolved over the next few months.  Tashan is only a few blocks from my house...it would be great to have an upscale Indian restaurant that I can walk to.",3.0,-1,1
563724,20812,4698,2011-10-15,"Date/Time:  Friday - 10:30pm Occasion:  Snacking Party of:  Two Location:  A typical food cart amassed with a long line Ordered:  Chicken and rice halal platter Total incl gratuity: $6 Even though we had eaten several meals already that day, we happened to be strolling around midtown and found ourselves at the ever so famous 56th and 9th Halal Street Cart after dinner.  After so much acclaim and seeing such a ridiculously long line, we had to see for ourselves what all the hype was about so we got in line.  The line moves fairly quick.  We waited about 10 minutes.  You can choose lamb, chicken, or combo.  Since I don't eat lamb, we opted for chicken.  They top yellow rice with hashed chicken and a few slices of pita.  Like they say in Fried Green Tomatoes - ""Secret's in the sauce"".  This platter would not be what it is without the white sauce you smother your rice platter in.  It's like a creamy white lardy sweet mayo.  It goes well with the white sauce and of course some dabs of the hot sauce as well.  The hot sauce is not that hot - It adds a nice kick.   My verdict?  It is definitely worth trying.  Very good!  However, beware...it is EXTREMELY high in calories so those watching the waistline - stay far far away from this cart.  It won't be good for you!",4.0,1,0

We showed up on a Saturday night and sat right down with no wait. We ordered three appetizers that were all very good, my favorite being the cheesy tater tots. For my meal I had a Space Jam Burger which consisted of blueberry jam and bacon and was excellent, my only complaint was that there was too much jam on the burger. My favorite part about Queens Comfort was the service and atmosphere, our server took all of our orders without writing anything down and got everything correct and was very polite in the process. The atmosphere is really cool, as everything was very laid back and interesting, as they served water in mason jars. I would recommend to anybody visiting New York City to make their way over to Queens and try out Queens Comfort.",5.0,-1,1

This chef here really cares about innovating and making sushi fun, tasty, and unique! Every roll is absolutely delicious and fresh. They use Black Rice and Multi-Grain Rice. The presentation is always amazing as well. You can see in the picture I posted. The flavor combos really work well regardless of which roll you choose. The rice paper wrap I tried was also great! It's called Spicy Shroom. Sweet and refreshing. Talking about sweet and refreshing, the watermelon mint lemonade... awesome. They have been 100% vegan since early August and used to be vegetarian (using egg and mayo). They haven't yet updated their menu or website but I can confirm they are totally vegan. Unlike Soy & Sake, the vegan sushi here is not made of mock meats to imitate fish. Instead, they are made from delicious fresh veggies! The man making the sushi is a really nice guy who was actually on Hell's Kitchen. He's always there making his unique brand of artfully prepared sushi. You can tell he's really got his heart in the place and really loves making sushi. It shows in the rolls. My favorites (though all are great): Spicy Mango and Mighty Mushroom. It's got three tables and it's more of a take out place but if you have the chance to sit down, do it. Hands down my favorite sushi spot, can't wait to bring all my friends.",5.0,1,0

A selection of cheeses to start - ricotta with a rhubarb compote and butter crackers, pecorino with roasted hazelnuts in honey, and a creamy goat's cheese with a flaky topping that reminded me cornflakes but sweeter. So amazing. Then we had the Tagliatelle Bolognese Bianco, the carbonara pasta special, the branzino and a lovely pumpkin/squash ravioli sent courtesy of the kitchen. The branzino was probably the best i've ever had. The ravioli was so decadent and creamy. The white bolognese was buttery yet had all the familiar taste of a tomato-based bolognese that we are all so used to.

I came here with my wife last weekend, and while the ambiance and vibe of Chatni is great, you know within a few minutes if you're in for a LONG NIGHT. We'd brought our own bottle of Riesling and the waiter didn't even open it until asked. Usually, at good places, your waiter will seat you and then ask to open your bottle simultaneously. At Chatni, it seemed only two people were working, and they were WORKING. The food was fantastic, however. My wife and I split an appetizer, and then we hit the entree. I got the Lamb Vindaloo, which was done at medium spice (as per your request), and brought out pretty quickly. The lamb was cooked beautifully, and covered in a nice spice. It came with rice on the side, to which you pair with the Vindaloo and have a nice little concoction. It was delicious, and I finished it pretty quickly. Chatni, although the wait times were excessive, has an excellent menu and quality about itself.

We didn't know whether to choose Pat's or Geno's when we walked up, and both places were almost equally busy.  Maybe it was just my aversion to the way too bright lights of Geno's that made me want Pat's, but I was happy with the choice!

We were too full to eat it while it was hot, so next time I'm back, that's what I'll do.  But even eating it later, I realized this was much better than the previous one I'd had.  The portions were obviously crazy generous, the meat was way more flavorful, and though the mushrooms & onions blended in with the whiz & meat & provolone so you couldn't really taste them, it was good.  The bread was all gooey cheesy meat juicy, in a very good way!

All were pretty good. The mussels in red sauce had an nice kick to them, a nice change from the average red sauce for mussels. Downhill from there; entrees were not impressive. Chaufa de Mariscos was sent back for being so salty as to be inedible. Arroz con Mariscos was fine, but very disappointing as good Peruvian food always has a nice unexpected flavor and this was pretty much what you would get at any average restaurant serving this dish, Mexican, Spanish, etc. No seasonings (guess they were all used up on the other dish). Waitress was unexpectedly concerned and responsive about the salty dish however - unexpected because until then it was as if she had been carved in stone and was squarely between being unpleasant and pleasant. They redid the dish quickly and it was reportedly better, but still not good. Two had the Lomo Saltado, and neither finished - and these are men not finishing steak. For one, it was the first time a dish has gone unfinished! Waitress remarked on that and the unfinished less salty dish with some concern. Flan and ""organic ice cream"" were good desserts.

The restaurant space is a little bigger than most, and I loved sitting at one of the tables for four. In most Manhattan restaurants, especially in this part of town, the tables are together in a long line against the wall. At Jane, you can go with a group and not be wedged in between other people. I went here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of friends (we had made a reservation earlier in the evening). Their spicy blood orange margarita is delicious. And the gnocchi definitely lives up to the hype. It's cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the white truffle crema gives the dish an extra bit of flavor and richness. The goat cheese flatbread was cooked perfectly too and was a great combination of flavors. I had a grilled pork chop for an entree, and it was cooked just right, and I loved the cheddar grits on the side.  I also tried some of my friends' brussels sprouts, and they  were seasoned and cooked just right.

Even upon ordering they ran out of clams and said they will be replaced with mussels.  A cheap shot move IMO.  The other dish was the gnocchi.  For me it was horrible.  The potato noodles were green balls and a bland white cream sauce.  Biting into one revealed threads of dust??  Are they hand making these with cotton gloves?  I just manned up.  The glass of water had a bug on the bottom which I wasn't man enough to do.  The portions are small as hhell and I'm about 180lbs.  Service was horrid.  The place is loud and crowded which is good for certain occasions but not all.  I was so unimpressed by my experience I don't understand the hype and why this restaurant keeps popping up first on the long lists at yelp.  Go here for a loud crowded place that seats about 30.,1.0,-1,1

150812,7449,1038,2012-02-27,"(4.75 stars)  The gentrification of Montclair Center has been many years in its evolution and refinement.  Through this time the unspoken question has been, ""does Montclair offer a dining experience to rival those of Manhattan's elite?""  Osteria Giotto not only answers the question in the affirmative, but may rank among the best Italian restaurants in the metropolitan area. Through an interesting series of coincidences we had 6:00 reservations for both Saturday and Sunday, and were able to sample a solid cross-section of the menu and specials.  Two quick points; first, the dining rooms are tiny and packed, reservations are a must on weekends.  Next, there are probably a dozen specials recited by the waiters and this is more than can be processed and remembered.  Both points are, in context, trivial. DeMetri was our waiter on Saturday, and his personable demeanor and thorough professionalism compel a special acknowledgment.  Sunday's waiter was also very good, although she lacked the same level of polish.  We were seated immediately, as a party of four, on Saturday.  As eight on Sunday we waited forty-five minutes beyond our reserved seating time for a birthday party who overstayed their welcome.  The restaurant is small enough to make a wait of this duration a minor ordeal. Osteria Giotto is BYOB, and most tables avail themselves of this feature-- there is no corking fee. Portion sizes at Osteria Giotto are large, making it very fortunate that the food is so good-- there is plenty to share.  The appetizer sized portion of gnocchi are pleasantly light and served in an equally light (but flavorful) tomato-basil broth.  A foreshadowing of just how well the kitchen makes and serves pasta, the gnocchi were stellar.  The filet mignon carpaccio was prepared in a lemon infused oil and served with shaved parmigian and mushrooms.  The quality was remarkable, as were the presentation and flavor; a clear notice of how adept the kitchen is.  The antipasto misto was generous and very good. Sunday's entree was the homemade spaghetti in a light tomato frutti di mare, loaded with lump crab (scallops were listed, but no complaints here), calamari and mussels, and finished with some littleneck clams and shrimp.  Wonderfully nuanced, decadently prepared and flavorful beyond description, the perfectly al dente pasta combined to make this an amazing dish. Desserts here are up to the same standards.  A dense, egg-only pistachio panna cotta was extraordinary.  Their homemade gellato is excellent, particularly the hazelnut flavor.  A surprisingly light puff pastry and pastry cream napoleon was also delicious. Osteria Giotto has already become the front runner for my ""Best Meals of 2012.""  The loss of a quarter of a star has two causes.  First, there were a very few minor details separating it from perfection.  Next, I look forward to a return visit and need something additional to offer in return for another dining experience of this caliber. Has Montclair Center come of age in comparison to Manhattan's best?  Osteria Giotto says ""yes.""",4.0,1,0

It was clear from the first moment - the place is affluent in pretentiousness: intentionally unintentional. The crowd I'd say was similarly intentionally unintentional. The waiter writes down the plates of the day on the paper table cloth. Attention here - no prices ;) 4)  we order a salad and an entree each: one was chicken something, the other lamb-asparagus-something. The salad was delicious, amazing I can say. Both of our entrees amazing as well - delicious, well made and most importantly prepared from extremely carefully picked meat! I think I haven't eaten better lamb in New York. I wonder where he got it from.  But, be aware !!! the chef, as much as he is good in choosing the right ingredients and cooking them just perfectly,y has one little but important problem - I think he has salt-sensing deficiency! Both our entrees were very, very, very salty! Might have this been only on this specific evening? I don't know, perhaps, or I hope. I hope, because there was no real reason to cover the food with salt since the meat was so obviously fresh and good anyway. 5) oh, and we saw a rather famous musician sitting at the bar 6) finally, the check revealed to us that one of the entrees was seriously overpriced.

It is my favorite preparation of coffee, not just because it is so fascinating to watch, but because it tastes absolutely delicious. Ray's has a wonderful selection of roasts, including Jamaica Blue Mountain, Japanese Charcoal Roasted, and more. The tea selection also looks excellent, but I confess I haven't yet had tea here because I can't resist the coffee.

My latte and the mocha were delicious!! Seriously, the first time in a while (sadly), that I've had a good latte! Unfortunately, all of the baked goods were a bit on the stale side-- I'm not sure if it's just due to the storm and perhaps they were made the day before?? Generally, croissants do have a relatively short shelf life and I did get there around noon. However, my brownie and the lemon poppy loaf had to have been made a good 2+ days ago which was very disappointing. The brownie had major potential-- it was fudgy- but had that cakey/dry consistency that occurs after sitting out for a while. The lemon poppy loaf was so dry, it wasn't enjoyable. 4 stars for my killer latte. Next time, I'll come back when there wasn't just a snowstorm and hope that the baked goods are worth the trek to Gowanus.",4.0,1,0

I also had potato salade. The space was nice and uncrowded. Before stepping down into the seating area I spied 2 sad pies near the register. The cat fish was just two skinny strips dredged in cornmeal. The tarter sauce was runny milky liquid with pickle and dill. The potato salade was just boiled potato drowning in the same milky liquid. The slaw was over chopped and tasteless. The watermelon juice was good but served in a small glass. La Superior serves fresh in a tall glass. Worth the price. Maybe the chicken is what to get. The family funded restaurant has the right idea but sadly I wasted 13 bucks on milky runny liquid and two dried out fish stix. Proceed with caution. I want a refund.,2.0,1,0

Given the large number of sushi places in the city, let alone in that neighborhood, they have chosen price to be the focal point of their business. By offering cheap sushi they have carved their niche in the sushi community. Unfortunately though, the sushi is just bad. The three times I have ordered from Vic (I have never actually been in the building) the rolls were sad with the rice falling off and the ingredients tasted like they had wilted a bit.

Cheese sauce: Typical cheese sauce. Like I said, not adventurous. However, I would reco this as the size/texture of the fries works quite well with the cheese. Peppercorn Ranch: Was hoping it would be better than what it was. Maybe I just don't care for the combination. Probably should have tasted other sauces before getting this one.

600355,263132,4988,2014-12-29,"Just yesterday on the 27th of December I treated my parents to Umami Burger. I saw a post on amNY Umami Burger offers $8 burgers through end of year. I saw this, went on yelp and found out that they got pretty good reviews (970 reviews and a full 4 stars). Umami Burger. You can see their menu here if you're planning to head out tonight! Price-wise this place wasn't so bad for a place in Manhattan. Place is 2 floors with comfy atmosphere. Hit-music on the speakers and some nice staff I didn't speak to all of them but the bartenders seemed enthusiastic about their job which is always a plus. Seating wasn't too squished... bar on both floors. I dont know! go try it and see for yourself ^_^ The Truffle Burger My burger was the Truffle Burger (Truffle aioli, house truffle cheese, and truffle glaze), I had it medium-rear as recommended (best if looking for the strongest flavor). I would say this burger was simple yet delicious. The bun was soft to the touch (had to be freshly made) with a U embroidery for Umami. The embroidery had to be fresh too, crunchy to the bite (probably did it after it was made with a brander). The meat was juicy as expected with a medium-rear cook and with the combination of the truffle cheese it was heaven! Tasted like a Truffle Gouda cheese with high quality beef. Out of a scale from 1-10 I would rate this an 8. The Ahi Tuna Burger My moms burger was the Ahi Tuna Burger (seared sushi-grade hand-chopped ahi patty, daikon sprouts, crushed avocado, gingered carrots, wasabi flake, wasabi tartar). She doesn't eat beef so I was glad that the restaurant offered the same types of burgers but 'un-beefed'. They would replace it with anything of your choice. The bun is the same bun as any other burger. The Tuna was lightly seared on both side but mainly it is raw (like tuna sashimi). Overall, the burger was decent. This one I didn't really like but that is only because of the gingered carrots (sort of like the stuff they have next to wasabi in sushi plates where its sour). The ginger carrots messed up the whole burger. The crushed avocado was good sorta like guacamole. I believe this burger would go better without the gingered carrots that took away the concentrated flavor of the tuna that would have been paired nicely with the wasabi and avocados. I would rate this a 6 out of 10 but would probably be a 9 without the gingered carrots. This rating can vary with different individuals as this is a sushi-type item containing raw fish. The Manly Burger This is the manly burger (beer-cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami house ketchup, mustard spread) for manly people like me BUT I was upset I didn't get to try this burger out. I originally ordered it for me but the order got mixed up and I wanted my daddy to eat the good stuff. I can't really give an honest review on this besides that the bacon lardons were DELICIOUS. I would believe that this burger is really good based on the pairings. Onion strings were fried, bacon is one of the most-loved foods on earth and a medium rare beef patty. The burger should be crunchy and soft at the same time giving your mouth an orgasm. Just by the looks of it, it looks good but NEVER judge a book by its cover!! Tempura Onion Rings and Truffle Em' Fries I am a FAN of truffles! On the right you see the truffled fries which I rate a 10!!! Only bad thing is they dont put enough on it but the taste is AMAZING. The Onion rings on the left are called Tempura Onion Rings... I don't like them that much but they were made with huge chunks of onions but didn't really taste like onions... but fried food tastes good almost all the time so I don't know! maybe you would like them! Caramel Coffee Ice Cream 'Sandwich"" I don't think you can really call this a sandwich... I did not like this AT ALL. Terribly made, sandwiches should be at LEAST some-what soft. This was more like a hard cookie with coffee ice cream on it. I don't know if this wasn't fresh or that's how it usually is but I DO NOT recommend this. I feel like it would have tasted a lot better if it went with a bun instead or something soft instead of this hard cookie... I would rate this at a 3! In general, this place was a pretty nice experience. Burger-wise it was fantastic, it's pretty hard to find a good burger joint now.

563065,9614,4698,2012-07-23,"I've wanted to try chicken and rice here for YEARS - seriously. I've heard about it in high school; people would go at night, when I wasn't allowed out. I've heard a high school friend say that his parents drive 8 hours down to North Carolina (where we went to college) with boxes of frozen chicken and rice because he craved it so much. I've heard various reviews from my friends - from the ""absolutely phenomenal, incomparable"" to ""overrated."" I had to try it for myself. I was actually feeling slightly ill as we were walking to the Halal Cart, and I felt really anxious; please, pleease let me be able to eat this! I've wanted it for so long ... :( A friend bought me ginger ale and I sat on one of the benches around the corner. (Walk along the street where there's a halal cart on every corner, to the end of the block - there is A LOT of great seating). My other friends stood in line and I waited anxiously for my body to recover by the time they got back. It didn't fully recover, and my friends were worried that the chicken (and lamb) and rice would exacerbate my situation. It did not. Contrary to all expectations, every bite made me feel better, and I eventually started scarfing it down. The pita was delicious, tinged with meaty flavors and white sauce. We didn't get as much white sauce as I would've wanted, but the taste of the juicy chicken and lamb really came through. The Halal meat was delicious - not exceedingly flavorful, as I had expected, but lightly done so that the flavors of the chicken and the lamb were brought out. I usually HATE lamb, but I couldn't say no to my friend (whom I was sharing the chicken & lamb & rice with) because she likes lamb so much. For the first time ever, I actually really enjoyed it. YAY! All-around fantastic experience - made me feel better, made me enjoy lamb, and all for only $3 (since I shared it with a friend). Very filling, too. Fabulous. Be careful not to go to the wrong cart; there are quite a few on the corner of 53rd and 6th. That said, I still need to try other carts' chicken and lamb and rice.",4.0,1,0

The manager tried to tell me it was my bank....so, giving him the benefeit of the doubt, I called my bank and they said that is something they could never do...only the merchant.  So I call back to discuss and this manager tells me, ""Oh you called your bank this late?  Who do you bank with?? They're open??""  WTF kind of response is that??  Yeah dipshit....major banks have 24 hour customer sevice hotlines, where you been??? in a cave???  Then I tell him that has NEVER happened in my entire life, anywhere...then I mention ""as far as I know that might even be illegal to charge someone more than they bought""...then, DEAD SILENCE...either he hung up or didn't want to incriminate hinself at that point....

252602,74043,2181,2014-12-26,"Small, mom-and-pop, CASH-ONLY, BYOB establishment that serves OUT OF THIS WORLD Cambodian food!  It is well-priced.  You leave full, satisfied and with leftovers as well! They don't take reservations and I wouldn't recommend dining here for a large party.  I would stick to a party of 4 or less.  The service can be slow a lot of times, but the server is super helpful and the FOOD IS WORTH THE WAIT!  I recommend calling ahead before making the trip to S.Philly because sometimes, they may close for Cambodian holidays or for a catering job.  It's the worst to be excited for a meal to find out that the restaurant is closed that day! MUST TRY STARTERS:   GRILLED SEASONED MEATBALL STICKS:  These are AMAZING!!  Unfortunately, they don't always have it because 1) there was high demand for it that day and they ran out or 2) it's the winter time and they can't grill these bad boys in the cold!  I usually call ahead to see if they have any that day or can put some aside for my visit! PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH:  This is a caramelized ground pork with various spices.  It is served with seasonal vegetables that you use to dip in the minced pork.  The smell may be tough for diners who are new to Southeast Asian cuisine, but it's a tasty must-try! MUST TRY FAMILY-STYLE DISHES: SOUPS:  I really enjoy ALL of their soups/stews.  But my friends and boyfriend's favorite is the SAH-LAW MACHEU KAHTEEH with the PORK RIB TIP.  It is a slow-simmered sour soup prepared with coconut milk base, fresh pineapple, and fresh basil.  The coconut and lemon grass makes it very tasty and aromatic.  It has A LOT of pineapples and we wish they had less pineapples and maybe add potatoes or carrots to balance out the sweet pineapples and to absorb the tasty broth.  It is served with pork ribs and tips.  It would be even tastier if there were more pork ribs because the meat on the bones are much more tender! CHA MUSSLES OR TALAPIA FILETS:  This dish is prepared and cooked in a special blend green curry mix and spice tossed with fresh basil.  WE LOVE THE CURRY and always ask for extra sauce, please!  Most diners order the mussels, but I prefer to order this dish with the fileted tilapia.  It really depends if I'm already ordering another fish dish or not.  If I order another fish dish, then I order this with the mussels.  If not, then I order this with the tilapia. WHOLE TALAPIA with Tamarind Sauce:  Some may be afraid of eating whole fish with the head and bones in tack.  But com'on, the rest of the world eats their fish this way - it's so much tastier.  I love the tamarind sauce that they give on the side - I pour it all over the fish. SO-SO DISHES: GRILLED BEEF STICK or GRILLED CURRY CHICKEN STICK:  These are ok - they can be dry and lack taste.  The Cambodian street vendors' sticks are tastier and more tender.  I would recommend the meatball sticks instead if you can eat pork. BOK LA-HONG:  It is a spicy papaya salad with fresh tomatoes.  I don't always order this because of the other great dishes, but sometimes I will if I feel like I ordered too much protein and need some more veggies in my meal. SKIP THIS DISH: PLEAH SACH-KHOE: The menu says that it is ""thinly sliced choice beef marinated in lime juice, lemongrass, khmer kitchen sauce and spices top with fresh herbs.""  The description sounds good and we've mistakenly ordered it a couple of times, forgetting that we didn't like this dish before.  I would suggest SKIPPING this dish.  The beef doesn't have much flavor and is not the best quality.  And the beef is not marinated - the sauce is served on the side.  Khmer Kitchen has so many other great dishes.  Skip this one. Man, I am salvating and want to go to Khmer Kitchen now!!",5.0,1,0

The food was amazing and I love that it was a BYOB. I've read many reviews saying that the wait is long. So, we made reservations on line for 7 pm on a Saturday night. I completely expected to have to wait. Pleasantly, we walked in at 6:56 and were instantly seated. Based on an earlier review, I tried the Lobster bisque. AMAZING! It was not too creamy or heavy. No, it was just right and had lovely chunks of lobster! Yum! The Crab Guacamole was perfect, enough said. I also tried the Garlic Clams and linguine. I am officially ruined for this dish anywhere else. There was a perfect amount of spice and no chopped clams, just fresh, in shell. Overall, a wonderful experience. The only reason I rated this establishment 4 instead of 5 stars is because, it was too family friendly for me.

It was also not as meaty! It was also kind of blah!  Price of a Geno's Wiz Without $9.00 Pat's was chopped up and I could taste the flavor!

I must add that John's Roast Pork makes a far superior cheese steak, and that you should try theirs instead. Both Pat's & Geno's are riding on their reputation and is really just a big tourist trap.

In terms of appearance, the lighting and overall atmosphere are all well suited for the overall resturant feel. we were told our wait would be 15 minutes, which ultimately turned into an hour. this wasn't unsurprising due to the relative ""compactness"" of the resturant. When we were finally seated, our waitor was relatively friendly and somewhat educted in the menu and it's specialties. We order the overpriced chips and guac, the entire time we felt that the chips were overly oily whereas the guac was lacking flavor but tttempted to mask it with large chunk of avacado in the guac. Next we had the campechana ceviche. the whitefish and shrip paired well but the ceviche sauce tasted like cocktail sauce from a can. An insult to an educated pallet. We continues to have the arabes taco and skirt steak. The plating of these items felt akward and unattractive, an though they were just thrown onto a oblong plate. The skirt steak was actually done well and was surprising flavorfull, but the arabes was overly dry. Due to our long wait our server brought us a complementary black bean enchilades. I've never been one to turn down free food, but after two bites of the extremely oily and bland enchilades I put it down, and decided to wait for our final course, Los moles. I was actually looking forward to trying this after being thoroughly dissapointed by everything else, but once it arrive it became much of the same. The dish was so-so, for lack of a better word, with no clear  winner between the three choices of mole Negro with lamb, poblano with chicken, or the pipian rojo with pork. We didnt finish any of them infact, and choose to skip dessert. Our overall dining experience wasn't negative, due to the friendly staff and decor to distract you, but the food was not creative or innovative in an manner.

It closed shortly after 911 and tons of bars opened  up. 911 changed NYC in ways you can't imagine. Culturally, the way we live our lives the way we eat and live. Sake Bar Hagi is as close to Tatany  52 as I have seen since 911.The only difference is the sushi is not as good as Tatany 52. Maybe if the economy improves it will be. The stand outs were the fried pizza which tasted like Zeppole's, best as an appetizer because at least for me it's not good to eat too much fried food. But it was nice more like a dessert. The bacon Asparagus and Pork belly were good both served at Tatany 52 and just as good. Emi had Uni my husbands favorite but it must have been a special. It wasn't on the menu. The Salmon was good and my hubby said the beer was super cold and delicious!

We had reservations at a restaurant that on the surface was amazing, but after looking at some reviews, it seemed like we would be better postponing our dinner for something ""amazing.""   We googled ""molecular gastronomy"" and we found Marigold Kitchen.  We called MK the night we cancelled our other reservation, but they did not have a table available  ( I called twice hoping they would have an opening) Nevertheless, we made a reservation for 11/10/2012. We were patienly awaiting our reservation. When we arrived, it was a humble atmosphere. One where you could feel completely comfortable considering the level of food we were about to experience. We chose the 5 course tasting menu with the fish and meat as the dinner options. That was only the beginning! They served about 7 amuse-bouche's. The dinner was so amazing, but the amazing tastings you will experience before you even have your meal are enough to talk about to everyone you know. We had truffle popcorn frozen with nitrogen, so when you bite into it, smoke comes out of your mouth! We also had Halibut ceviche, Caprese Salad Dippin Dots! (unbelievable), ravioli with salted chocolate, a homemade craker with cheese that oozes out of your mouth when you bite into in (and many more). The kitchen seems capable of anything you dream/imagine. The five course meal was just as imaginative and creative as anything you could dream. The desert  was an experience as well. Our server (strawberry blonde!)  was helpful, and knowledgable about everything we were trying/experiencing. (My husband and son tried (sweetbreads!)

579113,256991,2706,2014-08-31,"I truly wanted to like this place. My husband and I were very excited after returning from our honeymoon in Portugal to find that Newark had a plethora of places to choose from. Unfortunately, we chose wrong. Our first tip off should have been when we called looking to make a reservation, and the person in the other end was short with my husband, told him not to worry and then hung up the phone. Our second clue should have been that no one was there eating when we arrived. Third, we were greeted by an older waiter who started by rolling his eyes at us for asking to be seated. The same waiter could not be bothered to pay us any attention at all as we looked at the menu. The service only got worse as the meal went on. He barely looked our way and rolled his eyes whenever we had a question. We both got the sinking feeling that it was because we weren't from the neighborhood, ie- we do not speak Portugese. The other two tables of customers were Portugese and the wait staff were on them like glue. I've never felt so uncomfortable in an establishment in all my life. Adding to this, the food was awful. The seafood rice had chewy seafood and lots of broken shells. It was listed at $15, and we were charged $17. The grilled cod my husband got was barely edible- the fish had zero taste, the broccoli rabe was beyond bitter and the potatoes were no good. I don't know how you mess up potatoes, but they did. Suffice it to say, we barely ate our meals, asked for the check (that took way too long to receive), paid and left without a word from anyone. Terrible experience. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy.",1.0,1,0
205664,126327,4976,2011-04-18,"My first visit to Sazon was with a large group of gluten-free diners, and the owners were very accomodating. For a fixed price, we were able to try a number of dishes family style, rather than ordering 12+ separate dishes. Our meal included the following dishes: Domino arepitas (appetizer-sized portions of the Domino arepa - black beans and white cheese in a corn patty) Ensalada Mixta - their house salad Fried sweet plantains - starchy and sweet Arroz con pollo Asado Negro (by far the best dish that night! beef slow roasted in brown sugar can and garlic - it melted in my mouth and everyone at the table kept going back for more) Pabellon Vegetariano (grilled tofu with portabella mushrooms, tomato sala, and served with brown rice and black beans) I would go back for the Asado Negro alone! There's another dish that I have yet to try that sounds similar to one of my favorite Filipino dishes, Bistek Encebollado. Sazon is also well-known for their hot chocolate concoctions. The owner takes pride in combining ingredients for any kind of chocolate craving you could imagine. This drinking chocolate is not for the faint of heart - I actually felt slightly hyper after drinking the Calabaza King (creamy chocolate with fresh pumpkin, pecan, nutmeg, cardamom, and cinnamon)...it was like drinking a chocolate pumpkin pie. The El Orgasmo is like a peanut butter cup with a hint of banana. When the weather permits (usually when it's colder outside) fresh chocolate truffles are also available.

I had convinced my breakfasting companion to come here since so many people were talking about it. We were thankfully seated straight away by some rude waiter.  It took forever for a waitress to come over and then 25 minutes for the food to come once we had finally ordered.  Again, it was good but not OMG I CAN WAIT 25 MINUTES FOR BREAKFAST good.   The crowd was an annoying mix of yuppies, hipsters, and your general not from Philadelphia scene of jerkwads ( That is the only reason I can think of why this place does so well is that it's a ""quaint"" place for people to be seen.  So that you can say you ate at Morning Glory and everyone can nod accordingly and mummer about how great their food is and how surly the service is.  I can't not stand this crap.  Where the hell were all the black people?

Their house wines & sangrias are very good. Secondly, their prices are very fair for both tapas & entrees, so you could easily come here for just tapas or just entree and be happy -- and not break the bank. Finally, the food is delicious. We tried two tapas and two entrees, and for tapas we ordered a seafood salad, which was lightly pickled and had a good mix of different seafoods (not just tuna) and came in a little dish, and a roasted octopus leg, which was thick, tender, and wonderfully spiced. For entrees, we ordered the whole roasted fish, which was delicate, flaky, and filled the plate, and a sausage-stuffed chicken breast. Both came with a delicious sauce and perfectly cooked vegetables that balanced the main dish well. They also were totally cool about the groupon, the fact that we used opentable to make the reservation, and so on -- it's nice to go to a restaurant that doesn't freak out about the internet.

192977,120472,4523,2014-05-25,"The restaurant never explicitly or implicitly stated that there was a cancellation fee if a reservation was cancelled, rescheduled, or provided any time frame to cancel without penalty or if a cancellation was made. Needless to say that we had to cancel approximately 2  1/2 hours before our 5:00 pm reservation for Sunday (May 18-2014) or try to reschedule for a different day. Cancellation was made because two seniors in our party, 85 and 79 years old on wheel chairs took ill. A fact which was made known to the Manager, Mr. Justin Bothir who insisted that there was going to be a cancellation fee and that reservation for a later day, Monday was not available. To quote him, Mr. Bothir responded, ""no"", ""no"", we are fully booked. My wife then interjected to the phone conversation stating that it was the first time a cancellation fee was mentioned, and that it's not right. Our daughter then called the restaurant back and the manager stated to her that there is nothing he can do, but he later told our daughter after consulting with the owner, Mr. Avi Szapiro he could only give a restaurant credit for the $275 charged to the card for a future dinning. This was in line with our initial suggestion to reschedule for another date and make up the cancellation, even if penalty for cancellation was not relayed to us while the reservation was made, as well as during our 3 subsequent contact with the restaurant after the initial reservation was made. Anyway, my daughter's reaction to the restaurant's offer, was that, it's not fair, that her family came from out of town, and she's graduating leaving town, and that would not work. My wife then got on the phone, to see if she could reschedule for the next day (Monday), as I indicated earlier, but got the same response of ""no"" ""no"" that they're fully booked. However, we subsequently learnt from ROIA's website that the restaurant closed on Mondays; so was ROIA fully booked for the next day Monday or closed per ROIA's website? However, later in the day (Sunday May 18) at approximately 3-30pm the manager then called our daughter left a voice mail message that the best he can do is credit back $75 to the card. We were willing to work with the restaurant to honor either the restaurant credit for $275 for a future dining, or more than the $75 or all of the $275 credited back to my credit card. Subsequent calls and messages left for Mr. Bothir or the restaurant owner Mr. Szapiro are not being returned nor has any credit back to the credit card been made. I was left with no choice but to file a dispute for the unauthorized charge with my credit card services, and would go to small claims court if a positive resolution does not result from the disputed claims. It's a matter of fairness and having an ""explicit policy stating the penalties, if any, for cancellation of reservations"" which was nonexistent in our case at all times, but surreptitiously  became so only when we called to cancel or reschedule. Dining at SOULE DE CUBA (Friday), PACIFICO (Saturday), RUDY'S (Tuesday lunch), and especially ROIA's replacement and the highlight of all, from the 19th floor breathtaking view, cuisine to service; the JOHN DAVENPORTS at the Omni rescued our Negative Management experience with the ROIA.",1.0,-1,1

The meatballs in this one were a beef/veal/pork combo, which lent a very tender and moist quality, while still having a great firmness. (The fact that I'm talking about meatballs like this is disturbing, but it's also unavoidable.) From its menu description, I thought it was going to be a bit dry, so I asked for a side of marinara, just in case. Served on a soft, chewy roll with heaping mounds of kalamata olive tapenade and generous slices of piave vecchio cheese, there was no need for the additional sauce. The sandwich was nicely balanced and quite flavorful. With 4 meatballs, I was able to make 2 meals out of it for just under $9.

First, let me debunk some of these bad reviews: The guy who said that Cluck has the smell of curry engraved in it? That's not true at all. That's the smell of cayenne pepper in the sauces. When the sauce comes in contact with the grill it carmelizes and smells like curry. And even if it did smell like curry, that would make sense. The place next door is an Indian restaurant. So your review is just uneducated and silly. Some people are saying the food has been dry? In all the times I have been there that has not been a problem. In all my experience there, I have gotten the mini-bites almost every time with traditional sauce. Then I do the side of Fries with cheese & gravy.  I recently started getting a side of ranch for the mini-bites and it is great. If I don't do mini-bites, I have the boneless chicken strips. Order 5, and get 6 or 7. There is a lot more meat in those, so they are more filling. The service is exactly what you would expect. A couple high schoolers working the register, they have never screwed up my, or any of my friends, orders. The food is consistent, and the location is very clean. The only problem I have ever had is the location is the parking. There is only 6/7 spots out front, but that has never actually been an issue.

Patrons are left to either wait outside or fight for a little piece of real estate in the form of a ledge by the door.  This leads to my second minor issue with Risotteria (and I suppose everyone's issue with NYC in general) -- space. There is one long row of bench seating along the wall with what seems to be on long table (actually many little tables) and then chairs on the opposite side of the bench.  If you can imagine, I felt like the portrait of ""The Last Supper"" was a point of view shot and the disciples were strangers as I dined with Jesus.  It was very tight and if you are looking for privacy, you probably shouldn't go here. Conversely, the service was good.  The food bordered excellence, although I did catch myself occasionally wishing I ordered what one of the ""disciples"" were eating.  While crowded, another perspective would be that it was a place where you could go to make new friends for the hour and it represents a trendier, gluten free version of a big Italian dinner.

A search for chaat on Yelp pulled up Delhi Chaat House in the list of local results and a glimmer of hope lit up in my mind. A restaurant with chaat in its name might have potential to serve some amazing plates that the parents were craving for. As we pulled into the Royal Plaza Shopping Center, it was apparent that a restaurant which we loved at first and loved to hate a few months later (thanks to two horrible incidents) was gone and what stood in its place was the brand new Delhi Chaat House. Ordered a papri chaat, an aloo tikki chaat, an aloo tikki burger and a tandoori paneer. When my aloo papri chaat arrived, I realized that I had forgotten to mention 'no yogurt'. The waiter had not asked about food allergies either and I'm mildly lactose intolerant and try to avoid it given the choice. Oh well whatever. A first bite revealed a punjabi homestyle chaat which was no surprise given the new owners but one of the ingredients was a bit too cold (read straight out of the fridge a little prior and onto the plate) and that was....you guessed it right - the yogurt. The papri was crispy and tasted fine. My mother said that her aloo tikki chaat was alright but nothing spectacular. The tandoori paneer arrived sizzling on a skillet mid way through our chaat course. The presentation on this plate was good and the paneer itself was grilled quite nicely, but under-seasoned. The accompanying mint chutney was very sad. If one muddles mint a lot,  the fresh flavor changes to a slightly grassy and bitter one and this seemed to be the case with it. The restaurant has more potential if the new owners put extra care and effort in producing sublimely tasty and homestyle dishes. Whatever we had tonight seemed like a half-baked attempt. We will give this place another shot to be fair and to try some of their entrees. But for now we would say that whatever we had on our first visit, was quite forgettable in the grand scheme of things.",3.0,1,0

We ordered two pies as we were advised that is a good amount for a party of two. It was just the right amount. We were satisfied and not super stuffed. We had the: - Cherry Jones: An amazing blend of sweet and salty at the same time. Makes your mouth explode. If you are not a huge cherry fan, don't worry, you won't even realize they are cherries. The prosciutto and mozarella cheese had a great contrast and complement to the bing cherries. A MUST HAVE!!! - Hellboy: One of their staples! You can't not come here and not have this pie either. Fair warning, it's got quite the spicy kick to it. HONEY ON TOP? Who would have thought? It provides a surprising and delicious complement to the spiciness of this pie. The spicy isn't overwhelming but it does linger on. The sopresatta is delicious and you will not be disappointed with this pie. SERVICE: Very attentive and sort of Brooklyn trendy as well. Can be a bit rushed at times to bring dishes but don't take it the wrong way, they are just busy sometimes. We came at 5:15 PM and it wasn't too busy. If we had got there at 6 PM there would have been a 30 min wait. Paulie Gee walks around and greets you and gets your feedback so it's nice to see the owner care for his business like that. He did promise me a drink that he never followed up on, so that was a little disheartening, but all good. No harm, no foul. ATMOSPHERE: Has a industrial, wine cellar vibe. I love seeing the oven in the far back and all the furniture and fixtures similar but nothing is exactly the same. The place has a very dim lighting and can seat small or large parties. They have a bar seating area as you come in and a decent amount of space for people who are waiting. I would recommend coming at 5-6PM as the wait can get long when the weather gets warm.

328244,27041,2864,2012-10-13,"Before my visit here on Monday night, I only knew chef/owner Scott Conant from his terse comments as one of the harsher judges on the ""Chopped"" competition series on what else, the Food Network. I didn't even know he owned Scarpetta although I had heard about the place from my East Coast friends for the past several years. Lucky me I was in New York on the first day of a new job, a business trip with my manager and a local colleague, and as it turned out, we are all foodies. The first thing that strikes you when you enter Scarpetta is how incredibly dark it is. I get the cosmopolitan ambiance they are trying to capture here, but personally I found it a bit excessive given how much effort is placed on the presentation of the food at least judging from the website. Funny thing is I just read about a new app on TechCrunch called Chefs Feed in which famous chefs list their absolute favorite dishes at other chefs' restaurants. I downloaded it and found the $19 Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms mentioned with gusto by Chris Santos of Beauty & Essex. By coincidence, I recently saw the tail end of an episode of the Food Network's ""The Best Thing I Ever Made"" where Conant was making his signature dish. Sold. It was sensational - luxuriant with the chicken-infused morels and preserved truffles almost as velvety as the cream-based polenta itself (see photo). My dining companions agreed. But even before the polenta came one of the best bread baskets I think I've ever devoured. It was filled with not only thick slices of rustic Italian bread and foccacia but unexpected slabs of Stromboli oozing with salami and mozzarella, all of which was quickly devoured (see photo). The three condiments were almost unnecessary, but they were excellent - a buttery mascarpone, a citrus-herb-infused extra virgin olive oil, and an eggplant caponata. Just as we were savoring the polenta, the $25 Short Rib Agnolotti arrived, and the platter presented melt-in-your-mouth pieces of short rib into a ravioli-like folded pasta and blended them with root vegetables in a horseradish brown butter (see photo). Gone too soon. The entrees came in quick order, and each provided individual pleasures. The $34 Fennel-Spiced Black Cod came in the form of two large filets with the crispy skin left intact and piled atop concentrated tomatoes and artichoke leaves. It was all surrounded by a creamy mantecato & black olive oil sauce that brought the proper amount of decadence to the fish (see photo). The $33 Branzino was more simply presented with a large piece of the seabass covered in bottarga (tuna roe) breadcrumbs and sitting atop a blend of sunchokes, cotechino (salami) and leeks (see photo). Fish is definitely a specialty here, but I had the rock star of the night, the $33 Spiced Duck Breast surrounded by a foie gras emulsion (yes, it was a brownish orange foam) and served with butternut squash, Tuscan kale and pickled raisins (see photo). It was succulent as you would expect but with unexpected flavors that kept my palate tantalized. Mere mortals would have stopped there, but an expense account empowered us to move forward with the decadent dessert selection at $12 a pop. First up was the Amadei Chocolate Cake with a salted caramel gelato (a tad too bland) and chocolate butterscotch (see photo). The cake was deceptively small, but the Italian chocolate was obscenely rich. The second was the Sesame-Honey Semifreddo, which was milk chocolate mousse shaped like biscotti with a sweet potato gratin and malted chocolate crumble accompaniment (see photo). Both were lovely, but the unexpected surprise was the Coconut Panna Cotta, a milky tropical creation sitting in a pool of cool guava sauce with a sprinkling of caramelized pineapple. Delicioso, Mr. Conant. You're not chopped. FOOD - 5 stars...masterful execution of dishes that seem deceptively simple in concept with the polenta and panna cotta the genuine standouts of the evening AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...personally thought it was too dark to allow the eyes to complete the picture of the luscious food SERVICE - 4 stars...solid if a bit unctuous, almost too attentive perhaps due to the lateness of the hour TOTAL - 5 stars...Conant definitely knows his food",5.0,1,0

They have an extensive Belgian beer bottle list as well as several standard Belgian beers on tap. The Cuvée BXL was particularly good as a house beer. Our group also ordered moules frites during the match. We chose the grand mere as the style and it was fantastic.

They eventually brought us some so it was almost like two meals: the mussels and fries then we got to dip the bread in the broth. Phenomenal!

All I remember from that visit was walking into what seemed to be a biker bar and getting led from room to room until we reached the pool table and met up with some long lost friends. I recently ventured into the new Rudy's and found it to be vastly different. A dive bar no more. It is sleek and chic. It was a hot night and they had the windows next to the almost empty bar open, but it was a Tuesday night so I guess some people have to work the next morning or something. My friends and I sat at a table and put in an order for some drinks and an order of frites with mango sauce at the bar. The frites and the sauce were delicious. I washed it down with a glass of Petrus as the jukebox picks made by my friends filled up the room and I thought to myself, ""I like this Rudy's.""",4.0,1,0

We nearly ate all the crumbs from the bottom of the Triscuit box in the parking lot of the glass blowing place!! Luckily Grub Buds iPod Touch got service in a strange location and Yelp was there to help! We got the Shepard's pie and it was very good. Way better then Grub Bud (male's) parents used to make. He hated it, but this trip gave him a newfound respect for the dish. Grub Bud (female) enjoyed the salad bar. We also got a special which was several BBQ'd meats .

He knows good food, he knows good Italian food, BUT hold your breath, this is not one of Batali's Italian gems. This is when I guess Batali was trying to get out of his comfort zone of Italian culinary and might I say did a great job with this Spanish tapa joint. I'm not a seasoned Italian foodie, but those that are familiar with Batali's food say this Spanish tapa place has an Italian flavor to it. First of all, if you ever visit Casa Mono, please sit by the bar where you will see the food made right in front of you, almost home-style with no plastic hand gloves (you know the way your mom or grandma makes your favorite dish at home, before everyone became a germaphobe). My date insisted that we sit by the bar and I'm glad we did. We enjoyed as the guys showed us the art of making mouth-watering small-plates while enjoying a good wine. Believe you me, if you are on a match or OKCupid date, you will at least have something to talk about in case you run out of things to say to each other. You just watch and see how the guys at Casa Mono make the food and talk about the different plates as they come out heading to their respective tables. It's also a plus in that the place is intimate, so it should make for a great date. This is not an overstatement when I say every dish looked like a piece of art and what we ate tasted like the best thing in the world, definitely tasted like 5-star food. One good plate came after the other, from good cheese, salads, seafood, beef, chicken, pork. I won't name the plates we had because a few people on this page have reviewed these plates pretty well & thoroughly. What a way to get introduced to Batali. The only negative about this place is that if you do a sit down during dinner-time (that's when we went & we went on a packed Sunday), I don't know about any other time of the day, you have to buy a minimum of 5 tapas for two people. That can be quite heavy on the pocket.  Per my recollection, the average cost of each of these tapas was somewhere between $15 and $18. Now think about multiplying that by five. Keep in mind that there are items that cost on the high end of the spectrum, i.e., over $20, some are on the low end, like $9. I'm not sure if this 5 tapas order requirement is the norm or if it was just for that evening.

I checked again but it was still waaaay to crowded.  The hostess then advised us to wait outside. In 40 degree weather..... really, Mario?? Our group decided to cancel & move on. If you don't mind being cramped, elbow to elbow, very loud acoustic environment & don't have expectations of any sort of timeliness, then Casa Mono is ok. Like I said, the food and wine is always good. I'm sorry to say that we won't be returning.",2.0,1,0

311220,28911,1306,2011-11-29,"So looking for a good brunch place in Queens wasn't an easy task but this has become a staple of mine. Like, every Saturday for the 2 months and the hostess knows me by name kinda staple. The best deal is the prix fixe where it comes with a bellini, mimosa, bloody mary, or juice (with a refill), coffee and an entree. It's not some weak alcoholic drink either, it's an honest to goodness REAL drink. What should you get? Peanut butter banana pancakes. I've gotten it multiple times, my friends have gotten it multiple times, it's blow your mind awesomeness. Other good recommends include steak skillet, crab cakes benedict, bbq pulled pork sandwich, bistro burger, crispy chicken sandwich. Be sure to get the sweet potato fries with the burger. My friends and I have tried almost the entire prix fixe menu.  I have not had a bad thing yet, but I would not order the croc monsieur again. It's not that it's bad, it's just misleading as it doesn't taste like an actual croc monsieur, more like a good grilled cheese. Not as worth it with all the other better choices on the menu. As for off the prix fixe, the soups and mussels were also great. It's open 24 hours, great environment, just a awesome find in Queens.",5.0,1,0

I had read about it and decided to visit it but nothing prepared me for it. Having said that I have to mention, that if you just want to see the creative use of space then you have to pay a visit to Graffiti a. Even though it's a small place, you feel cozy rather than cramped. Chef Jehangir Mehta (who owns Graffiti) has added so many quirky design elements to the interiors of the restaurant that for a few minutes after entering you just look around in wonder, taking in all the personal touches to the design that make the place so warm and inviting. I really loved the funky animal chopsticks. The service at Graffiti is flawless. Actually that is how I spoke to Chef Mehta for the first time and heard that he was one of the participants on the Next Iron Chef. I now watch the show regularly and make sure I tell everyone that I have met him. The place is almost always full so I prefer to reserve my table, especially on Fridays. Though they do accept walk-ins, be prepared to wait for quite a while. Graffiti is always full! I don't like waiting for my food and that is another reason why I appreciate Graffiti so much. They serve food giving a detailed description of each preparation. This is something I really appreciate about the place. It makes you feel like they really know their food and they genuinely take pride in what they create. The proportions though small are filling and the best part is that nothing gets wasted.

484684,228336,4045,2014-08-19,"On a Friday night, we walked into the restaurant, the ENTIRE restaurant was EMPTY. There were SO many servers just walking around aimlessly who looked like they were literally trying to find stuff to do and maybe 2-3 tables in the entire dining room had parties seated. When we walked in, we were told to wait a moment then taken to our table. Our server was a pleasant gentleman but something just seemed really off about this place. There was a weird smell in the restaurant the servers just looked very unkempt...something wasn't adding up. We put our gut feelings aside and decided to place the order for our food. Here's where it got really bad - the bread came out, stale as ever. It almost felt like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a week and they just brought a basket out to us for the sake of serving bread. Few minutes later, the fried calamari rolled in for our appetizer. The moment I laid my eyes on the calamari I knew it wasn't going to be good. It just looked like it was drenched in oil without any seasoning and of course, one bite of the calamari and i wanted to literally vomit. All you tasted was breadcrumbs drenched in oil. About 5 servers walked by our table and gave us puzzled looks as to why we weren't eating the bowl full of calamari and just siting there waiting instead to be acknowledged. Finally, our server made his way over to us and we told him how we felt about it - he was nice enough to offer to get it remade but we politely decline and gave it back to him, and hoped that our caesar salad and mushroom with crab meat (2 more appetizers) would be better. Took about 25 minutes for the caesar salad and the mushroom with crab meat to come out since the calamari incident. It wasn't even like they were busy - the restaurant was literally empty and we were sitting right by the kitchen where we could see the kitchen door opening and closing - the entire kitchen was visible and all I saw were people just standing in there yapping away constantly. Anyways, so the salad and the mushroom with crabmeat came out - the salad was DRY without any sort of dressing on it. And the mushroom, lol well it was looked burnt. My husband took one bite of the caesar salad and just said no, I can't do this - it tasted STALE as anything and dry...it was literally just romaine lettuce tossed with cheese, that's IT. My mushroom was SO burnt that I actually heard it crack and burnt pieces fly out when I was trying to take a bite of it - the crab meat was horrendous - again, felt like it had been sitting there for ages and was jus heated up with lemon juice and served to not have to waste old food. We just sat there, again, waiting to be acknowledged and when another server walked by, we asked him to cancel our entrees and bring us the check - we just couldn't put up with this. Our server came rushing to us and asked what happened and we explained to him that this food was just not cutting it for us and meeting our standards - he was very polite and went away for a few minutes. About 5 minutes later, we were approached at our table by someone who seemed like the manager, a younger gentleman with an older gentleman. They asked us what the issue was and my husband explained to them how his caesar salad was dry and how my mushroom was burnt - the older gentleman had the audacity to ask my husband ""Do you know what a Portobello mushroom is?"" As if he didn't believe that the mushroom was burnt and that we were idiots for thinking it was....t was so SHOCKED by the way he approached us and almost was trying to challenge us in a way that we were wrong and what his kitchen had produced was fine. It was the worst response from a manager/owner I had ever experienced. In the mean time, the younger gentleman took our appetizers to the kitchen and both of them disappeared. My husband I just sat there puzzled wondering what the heck was going on - we just wanted our check and wanted to leave ASAP. Few minutes later, the younger gentleman comes out and goes ""I'm sorry it was our mistake - the mushroom was burnt."" And then he disappeared again....we were just sitting there wondering what in the world is going on we just wanted to get the heck out of there and get some food. Waited another 5 minutes and finally saw our server, I asked him for the check and he was nice enough to say that there is no check - it's all fine. We insisted on paying him at least a tip because it really wasn't his fault and he did wait on us but he refused to accept anything and we were on our way out in no time. It was just weird how we kept asking for the check and no one would flat out tell us that there's no check or you're free to leave - the situation was handled SO terribly.",1.0,-1,1

I went for the paella which is what I usually get at the restaurants in the area. It was huge, filled with seafood and meats. But the rice was strange to me and I didn't really enjoy it. It had a chewy consistency. My husband got steak, which was not that good either. It had a charred flavor. We had a Groupon so it was a good deal. But I think I would be more bothered if we had paid full price.",2.0,1,0

My family and I regularly do brunch in the city, and we love trying to new places, especially restaurants with great reputations such as Maialino. To be fair, I think your dining experience here will depend on what you like to eat for brunch. My family typically chooses an egg dish, and true to form we ordered the fritatta bianca, contadino, and porchetta. Overall I found our meals lacked a lot of taste and the pork too fatty. However, the almond croissant was absolutely delicious! If you enjoy savory home made pastries, then this place is definitely for you. I must also give credit to their dessert selection. I feel this review of their sweets deserves its own paragraph to emphasize how phenomenal they were. Their gelato/sorbet selections were unique - I chose the strawberry basil, lemon curd, and olive oil. While lemon curd was my favorite due to its rich and creamy texture (literally could have been the custard filling of a pie), the strawberry basil was refreshing and the olive oil was simply very tasty.

511957,20918,4267,2012-05-15,"Miriam is an Israeli restaurant in Park Slope serving brunch and dinner, warmly furnished in wood and brick, restrained accenting with ornate glass and metal decorations.   The small corner dining room is lined with windows, anchored by a bar on one side (serving up wines, beers, and cocktails) and many small tables on the other, along with a showpiece table by the front window for a larger party.  Staff are friendly.   Israeli food bears similarities to its Middle Eastern neighbors, and will look similar.  Miriam serves up a more refined version that falls between casual and fine dining.  They offer a long list of mezes, or small plates, served at the great happy hour price of 4 for $12. In the name of full disclosure, these are truly small plates and will not be adequate for more than 2 people. But for 2, it's perfect for a variety of tastings. Our four mezes were good and, at a bite or two apiece, satisfying and worth the sampling although none merit special mention.  In all, preparation, flavors, and textures were fine but not exceptional.  The meats, meatballs and merguez sausage, were basic; the former came with a pomegranate sauce we were curious about, that had sweet and sour notes but was not otherwise memorable.  Fried eggplant and cauliflower were limp from not being freshly fried.  Probably the best were well-cooked shrimp wrapped in kadaif.  House seasoned pita wedges paired nicely, and were plenty tasty on their own; I may have liked it better than all the mezes. The flavor of their couscous leans on sweet, co-mingling with savory, slow-cooked with butternut squash, raisins, pumpkin, zucchini, and cabbage.  Of the four additions offered, shrimp and calamari was not a great match, overwhelmed and disappearing into the flavorful couscous, but they were also not exceptional specimens that could stand up to the task.   Miriam's food is not ambitious, and it is not a culinary destination.  But in Park Slope, it is squarely in its own niche when accounting for type of food, ambience, and price, and when combined with daily brunch hours and daily happy hour specials, Miriam is a very good neighborhood restaurant.",3.0,1,0

24260,26326,167,2009-03-17,"I was very excited to try Local 44 when I heard about it, but sadly I had a bad experience because my group was asked to leave our table after finishing our food. First the good news: The selection was phenomenal, with about 15 drafts plus a couple on cask. Everything I tried was delicious. It was Philly Beer Week, so perhaps they pulled out all the stops, but it seems they always keep a great line-up of drafts. Although the beer was clearly the main event, the food complemented it well. It was a nice selection of pub fare, very tasty, and reasonably priced. Then the bad news: Our server was wonderful, but the owner asked us to ""finish our drinks at the bar"" once we had finished our food. The bar was too crowded to comfortably accommodate our party of five so, in effect, the owner asked us to leave. To be fair, at least one other party was waiting for a table. But I have never before been asked to leave a restaurant or bar, and I found it to be particularly offensive in this case for the following reasons: - All but one in our party did order pub fare, and we were asked to leave very soon after finishing it - All five of us were consuming and continuing to order beers (in fact, we canceled our pending orders when asked to leave) - It was Philly Beer Week during an advertised beer event - The menu begins with and is dominated by beer, not food - Local 44 advertises itself as a ""Beer Bar,"" not a restaurant (Website, local44beerbar.com, says ""Local 44 is a neighborhood beer joint."") Because of the clear focus on beer, I was most surprised and disappointed to find that the owner will only allow a table to be used during such time as its occupants are ordering or consuming the pub fare. The Bottom Line: Local 44 has a wonderful concept, but I was both frustrated and disappointed by my experience there. It seems like a great place to enjoy good company and potables, and the beer is fantastic, but if I can have a table only at the risk of being ejected when the next party shows up, then I'll choose to take my business elsewhere.",3.0,-1,1

Though I didn't order a drink, there's a bar with a good-looking bartender. In retrospect, most of the staff were good looking and helpful. The waiter sat us down and ask for our drink orders. After he delivered our beverages, we ordered our meals. My sister ordered a torta, the chicken cutlet sandwich. It is cut into 2 halves. She gave me 1 half to take home. The next day, the guac was brown. Guess adding lime or lemon juice would mess with the flavor of the sandwich. Otherwise, that's a tasty sandwich cuz of the chipotle mayo and bread & fried chicken cutlet. I was SO tempted to order a rice & beans dish or Cubano. I ordered a few appetizers:  oxtail empanada and fish tacos. With all that came on top of the empanada, it tasted flat. The fish tacos came alive with fresh squeezed lime juice on top and lots of guac. Guac added a creamy-feel to each bite. I wanted more tacos. For dessert, I forgot the waiter told us the special dessert of the night:  Kahlua tres leches cake. DAMN, I ordered the tres leches cake from regular menu. At first bite, I tasted alcohol as if Kahlua liquer and waved the waiter telling him he gave me the wrong cake. He said it is the right one and that the kahlua cake is brown. After he left, I ate a few more bits and waved him again. I told him it tasted like alcohol. He again said it's the right cake. He left and after a few more bites, I waved the waiter over and said it tasted like alcohol. He finally explained that rum is in the sauce on the plate. AH-HAH. The rum sauce kinda got to me so I didn't eat the entire cake. The sauce smelled & tasted menthol-ish. I feel the restaurant should've noted on menu that there's rum sauce for the tres leches cake.

Now for the bread...It is good, not the best rye you have ever had but very good flavored rye bread. In no way does the deliciousness of the juicy pastrami get thrown off by the bread when eating your sandwich. It also holds up well to the meat even when you get the large size sandwich. It should be noted that the pastrami's flavor is not overwhelmingly smokey.  It is not as robust a flavor as other deli's pastrami meats are. This is a delightful difference for me from the pastrami I was raised on for 35 years which tended to be much fattier than David's is. The beautiful pastrami that David's offers is available in 3 sizes to serve your stomach's needs.

I frequented el almecan at least once a month, but sadly that's all over now.   We went at saturday evening (we had friends visiting from germany and they really wanted steak)  The hosted told us an hour wait and to go some place else for a drink and when the table was ready and that they would call us.   An hour and 1:15 minutes passed and we went back, and she said it was going to take just a bit longer.  We went for another drink, at this point starving, no call, I went back to check (2 hours had passed at this point).  2 new tables where sat.   I asked the hostess about them and her response was they are friends of the managers... then a large party was about to leave, I asked about that table, her response was another party just called and they were coming in.  She just told me to go try to see if there sister restaurant down the street might have seats available. My problem is not that the restaurant was busy, but the rude mismanagement of the place.  If you know there are multiple large parties coming in, then deter the customer away from the start,  Don't make them wait hungry for over 2 hours.  I've worked in restaurant all over the city, and we never treated the costumer with such rudeness.   Luckily we ended up going to marlo and son's afterwards where not only are they pleasant, but the food is alway excellent.",1.0,-1,1

The cafe is conveniently located in Cobble Hill which made for a great little walk through the neighborhood. We got here around 12 pm on a Sunday and luckily there was no wait. We actually were able to score a table at the outdoor patio in the back which was quite nice... until a bee decided to torment me by hovering around my face every 5 minutes. I get it, you think I'm sweet, but buzz off before I curse you with CCD. It was one of those Sundays where I wanted a drink. Hm something spicy or something sweet? Let's go with spicy. I had the Bloody Mary to ease my headache which I must say was pretty good. Not the best I've had but it was definitely made from scratch with some good L&C. For food I ordered the Tuna Fish Club sandwich, he got the poached eggs with gravalax salmon, and we got an order of the famous pancakes to split. Now my sandwich wasn't bad by any means, but I didn't think it was delicious. I felt like it was a little dry and I forgot how much bread is in a club. Three slices of bread people!!! I wish the salad had had something sweet/with texture to make it a little more interesting like apples or cranberries... Again, not bad by any means I just felt like it wasn't fully satisfying me. However, the pancakes with fruit and maple syrup were great! I don't think I could ever eat the whole plate by myself as it would just be a total sugar/carb overload but these were so yummy. I don't know how they do it but the tops of the pancakes were slightly crispy. I'm just going to blame it all on butter and the Devil. The inside was so soft and fluffy that you just wanted to lie down and take a nap using the pancake as a pillow. Those little qualities really make these pancakes stand out in my mind. They also topped them with freshly cut bananas and strawberries. So freaking good. I think everyone should get an order of pancakes to share; they are the true winners. Overall I enjoyed my little trip to Cafe Luluc. I don't think I'm dying to run back here as there are tons of places to try in Cobble Hill, but I will say I have fond memories of those pancakes... and they're only a 15 minute walk away.",4.0,1,0

Hard to describe. The crust is thin, cracking and buttery. The tomatoes are sweet and tangy (is that even possible?), the mozza is melting in your mouth. Also tried the cavatelli (my motto is, if there are homemade cavatelli, you have to have them--same with gnocchi; they have both, but don't serve the gnocchi for lunch). They were perfectly cooked with a hint of garlic; the broccoli was a bit bitter, but just enough to marry the flavor of the bits of sausage.

Yes, they have festive lighting and hype the Latin theme, but there is no quality. Your small town friends may feel in vogue that they got a unique Manhattan dining experience here, but deep down in your cultured New Yorker heart, you'll know that this is Epcot at best. Our friend's restaurant concierge convinced us to try this place and having read the reviews before going in, we made clear that we wanted chicken that had not been oven roasted for too long a time. Despite the request, the chicken was among some of the driest meat I have encountered. It was arroz con pollo constituted from a dehydrated mix to which insufficient water was added. The ceviche was not fresh, the fish tacos were all batter presumably to cover up the frozen fish, and the cocktails were made incorrectly (no salt rim as requested with the margaritas). As if the bad food was not enough, the service was OFFENSIVE. We waited 25 minutes for our first drink. To their credit, the manager recognized the inappropriate wait and came to our table to take our second drink order (as if his presence at our table made up for the long wait). Of course, the second round was equally slow to be brought out. I am normally not this snarky, but the series of events that transpired next prompt me to warn folks about this place far and wide. We asked our waiter to remove the food from our table. Seeing that we barely ate it, he inquired why this was so. We explained our disappointment in the food, however we did not request a re-preparation or alternative dishes. Rather, we planned to finish our long-awaited cocktail, pay our bill, and depart. Subsequently, the manager returned to our table with a fiery step and defended the chicken, exclaiming to us that it was our taste that was flawed. Rather than pointing out the well-traveled background of our friend or the significant amount of time we have spent in Latin America practically living on arroz con pollo, we respectfully disagreed and requested the bill. Thankfully, the most prompt feature of the service that evening was the bill arriving at our table, and of course the bill arrived without even the slightest reflection of culpability. The manager accosted us as we walked out of the restaurant, continuously defending the meal-gone-wrong like a child who knows he did something bad but will not admit it. He followed us out of the restaurant with escalating anger at our staunch disengagement from his antics. Perhaps he had a few too many drinks. Needless to say, we will not return. The restaurant concierge will remove this from the company's repertoire, no longer to be recommended to their large clientele, and I sincerely hope that I have saved you from wasting your time, money, and mostly your appreciation of Latin American cuisine.",1.0,1,0

As for decor, it was pretty typical, they also have hibachi there which was pretty empty, they had one group of 4 for the whole hibachi and then it looked like it ended up with just 2 people at the other later on so if you're looking for the whole social aspect of hibachi you might not get it for a couple and the oddness of being the only 2 people at a hibachi wouldn't appeal to me. It could have just been a slow night but it was a Saturday so I don't know what to think about that so I would say if you're planning on hiibachi make it a group event. EDIT: Went backa second time, things were still good but I rethought the 5 after getting salmon sashimi that was frozen and somewhat poor service, not so much bad as inexperienced it seems.",4.0,1,0
101166,74862,1809,2012-08-14,"Move over cupcakes, your illustrious time in the dessert spotlight is over - it's now all about the macaron. Cupcakes and macarons are diametric opposites. One resembles more and more like a mini couch while the other is cute and petite. The cupcake is decadent and guilt inducing with its many sugary decorations. The macaron is sinfully good, but without all the consequences of a dietary quandary afterwards. I never do after eating half a dozen within a matter of minutes. Growing up, I only knew about the American macaroons. You know, those dense pastry clusters of flour, almond paste (or other nuts) and coconut flakes. Moist and sweet, they come in a variety of ways. Sometimes dipped in chocolate, sometimes piped in different shapes and so forth. Macaroons were solid dessert options for a post-dinner dessert or the perfect accompaniment with tea or coffee. But, Ladurée macarons are not the aforementioned cookies. French macarons are in a league of their own. ""You must mean macaroon right?!"" No, these aren't the American versions of macaroons. No coconut flakes here. What are these concoctions with the singular o? The French macaron is sly with its light and fluffy texture. It teases you with its two meringue based outer shells filled with jam/ganache/buttercream reminding me of an adorable petite UFO. It comes in a dizzying rainbow palette of colors that would make even GLAAD jealous. Flavors can be as simple as one singular flavor such as strawberry, vanilla, chocolate to as unorthodox and complex such as fried chicken, salted butter popcorn, Vegemite sourdough and burnt rice. If you bite into one, it should feel effortless with very little residual crumbs left behind. It should be slightly hard on the outside and moist on the inside with the inside jam complimenting the meringue flavor. The filling shouldn't be overly sweet or powerful. While they are delicate baked goods, it shouldn't be delicate to the point of disintegration once you hold it. You don't sharply bite into them, but slowly wrap your mouth around one to envelop its goodness. It's best consumed slowly with multiple bites to intensely savor each bite. Follow with a sip of sparkling water or hot tea to cleanse your palette. The tastes are nuanced and subtle with each flavor having its own distinctive aroma. I prefer the rose (very light, floral), salted caramel (rich, creamy with a kick of salt) and the pistachio. Ladurée was founded in 1862 and eventually became famous for their macarons, though the store also sells other confectionaries such as chocolates, sorbet and pastries. There are currently outposts in 15 cities including Paris, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Japan and the New York City (the only United States brick and mortar store) location which opened in spring of 2011. Currently, there is a second planned location in New York City which will be opened in SoHo this fall of 2012. The store shines because it focuses on simplicity in its macaron offerings. Unlike other shops (see: Pierre Hermé)  offering fusion, unorthodox or multiple flavors in one cookie, Ladurée  offers singular flavors ensuring quality ingredients and products.  It doesn't attempt to re-create the proverbial wheel and focuses on what they know they do best - a simple macaron. The store is also synonymous with fashion. Remember that scene in Sophia Coppola's 2006 film Marie Antoinette where Marie (played by Kirsten Dunst) lounges around in her palatial compound with Ladurée sweets adorning her room? Yeah. Macarons in general seem to be stylish with its air of sophistication and elitism. Ladurée sell its for $2.70 each, a decadent and indulgent treat for those who adore the finer things in life. I've been lucky enough to experience them as gifts. You can have these sweet babies wrapped up in a variety of heavy duty printed boxes with ribbons for a small fee. I love re-using the boxes for crafts or to store other odds and ends such as old stationery and cards. I like to think of the store as a jewelry store for pastries. It's absolutely gorgeous and luxurious. If you're in a never-ending quagmire over where to purchase macarons in New York City, stop researching and go here. Ladurée easily creates some of the most sumptuous delicacies with a luxurious experience to boot. While there are almost always long lines on this Upper East Side establishment, it's justified as I believe it's one of the best places in NYC to purchase macarons. Bon appétit! PS: Enjoy them as soon as possible. PPS: Did you know French McDonalds sell macarons? I am so jealous.",5.0,1,0

221522,12098,1920,2010-02-14,"My husband took me here tonight for Valentine's Day dinner. I knew nothing about the place in advance except that it's a Marc Vetri restaurant, and he is an amazing chef (though I've yet to make it to Osteria, it's on my list). We were not disappointed. Every dish was fantastic.  I stuffed myself silly (small plates? how much can I eat? yeah, right) and hope to save up all day next time for a meal this good. Brief description: this sleek industrial/modern space is really inviting. I love the fact that you can eat at the bar and watch the cooking take place. That is really cool :) The place was noisier than I expected and the tables were very close together, so you were kind of sitting (almost) on your neighbor's lap.... but these are minor details :) Now onto the food..... there is much to choose from, which is nice... I'm a huge eggplant fan, and the highlight of my evening was the eggplant brushetta dish. I have never had eggplant spread that good. My only complaint was that two small slices of garlic toast were not enough to sop up all of this goodness (no fear, there was other delicious bread on the table). If you get nothing else at Amis, get the eggplant bruschetta. A close second are the eggplant ""fries"" that strangely decorate the rigatoni with swordfish. Delish and addicting. If they sold these fries from a street vendor, I'd be in big trouble.... Other standouts: Roasted potatoes (my husband's favorite), crispy and delicious Baked clams (yummmmm) Turkey cutlet - who would of thought that turkey mascerading as a thinly pounded veal cutlet could taste so good? Simple, but delicious, and nice with the accompanying greens and freshly shaved parmesan. Others: The grilled cauliflower lightly breaded -- ok, but not exceptional. It was too hard for my taste. Beef carpaccio - nothing against, it, just not my thing (hubby loved it) I hope I'm not forgetting anything.... Desserts were good. The menu is extensive and everything looked delicious. We had an ""ice cream sundae"" with the most delicious amaretto-tasting ice cream I've ever had, sprinkled with walnuts and covered in fudge. My husband had the chocolate ganache cake that was good, but I wasn't a huge fan. I'm coming back for the Belgian waffle with nutella ... had I not had pancakes for breakfast, I definitely would have gotten it. Service was great. Very attentive and helpful. A new favorite -- we'll be back for more.",5.0,1,0

480282,226922,3981,2014-09-28,"Very disappointing food and service from Nubian Flavor restaurant. Ordered through Grubhub, on which the restaurant offers delivery service. After placing an order (and paying a delivery fee) we received a call from Grubhub informing us that the restaurant does not deliver on Sundays as they are just, ""too busy."" We decided to go and get the food ourselves. On Grubhub, the restaurant lists that grits, hash browns and toast come with a breakfast platter, but when arrived I was informed that I had to choose between hash browns OR grits. Once we arrived home and checked our bags we realized that we should have cancelled the order entirely. The food was prepared carelessly and parts of our order were left out. There were hard, gritty pieces in the eggs over easy which I can only hope were eggshell and not something worse. I'd ordered the corned beef hash that comes with the dish well done - it was not. My hash browns were missing - never included with my order. The hash browns that my girlfriend received with her platter were bland and flavorless. Very disappointing. We contacted Grubhub about the missing hash browns, and the 'restaurant' refused to make it right, insisting that they were already included in our order. This is not our first time ordering from this establishment and we noticed a lack in consistency with food preparation and delivery time, but we wanted to support a local business and give them another chance.

Decent sized parking lot but maybe not large enough if there is valet on fri/sat We were told to sit wherever & of course I chose the table(it's at the far wall on the right) with a warped floor area as 3 diff chairs were wobbling noticeably(didnt wobble at the tables i took them from).  Was tempted to change tables but dealt with it.  Also, the pepper shaker had a brownish hardened something on it?  Switched that with another table & that one had a smudge. Standard sesame Italian bread--butter was hard so had to wait a couple of mins before eating.   For drinks I got the thin mint martini(tasty but low on alcohol & at $12 not a bargain)--other got red wine Wanted the fried homemade short rib ravioli but waiter came back to say they were out & offered cheese ravioli instead.  We passed & wanted something similar so we ordered a 1/2 portion(you can order appetizer portions off the pasta menu) of the papardelle braised short rib tom sauce & dollop of ricotta--that was very good but at $13 considering the entree price was $18 was a bit higher than expected(usually restaurants will charge a little over 1/2 the price so I was expecting $10 - $11--not that a couple of dollars is a dealbreaker but it still creates the thought of being gouging). They were out of 3 different seafood entrees but none of them would have been ordered anyway so no harm. Entrees were jumbo shrimp oreganata(tasty---sides of string beans a bit too crunchy, mashed pot plain no taste).  Other got the cavatelli bolognese which was very tasty.  For a togo got the veal milanese which was pretty good though was hard to find the sausage(keep in mind it's preparation description looks like it got inadvertently switched with the filet but that is how they prepare it). However, you can have preparations altered to suit your taste. Desserts were spumoni(standard) & tres leche which the cake was ok but the icing was a coarse sugary type which is not how it's supposed to be(maybe it's the Italian way to top it as I've always had it at Spanish restaurants previously) I had cappuccino(misspelled on the menu) which was hot but not too strong. Service was fine & sociable but keep in mind there were only 3 tables at any given point so on a fri/sat not sure maybe check other reviewers. So for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, 2 desserts & 1 cap with tax/tip(if total out of pocket) would have been $140 which is a bit high. I prefer to give a detailed rating as opposed to just saying I liked it or I didn't. For me I rate a restaurant in 4 categories in order of importance: Food Service Value Décor/ambience/misc If you're wondering why this is the order for me I rather have great food & so-so service than the other way around.  You can always plan around a slower evening to make it just as enjoyable but not around mediocre food whether it's fast or slow paced. My 3rd item I call value instead of price because based on the taste & serving portion of the item compared to similar items at other restaurants tells me if it's a good value.  For instance the best steak I've ever had to date runs about $44 but besides being delicious(a way to tell is it stands on its own w/o adding any sauces) it is boneless & about 24oz so you get two good meals.

6783,11606,57,2013-11-24,"My family and I just had the most unbelievable experience at Continental Mid-Town. We went to Continental around 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon figuring it would be empty, and we could get in and out without issue...... I was right about it being empty, dead wrong about not having any issues. Our experience started out ok.  Seemingly friendly waitress, drinks ordered and French fries ordered for my child.  We ordered our meals, which the waitress repeated back to us.  Our appetizer came out but with no plates.  We had to wait for the manager to come around to get us plates and napkins.  Then half of our meal arrived.  This is where our experience gets ridiculous.  After waiting 15 minutes for my husband's meal to not arrive we started looking around for someone to ask.  Literally 10 minutes without anyone on the floor.  No servers, no bussers, no manager and a bar tender eating in the corner.  Finally we see our server and ask about my husband's meal.  She proceeds to insist she didn't hear us order it.  But she had repeated our order back to us.  There were 3 of us, so common sense would tell you 3 plates of food right?  Also if you are a server your job is to listen and hear what your customers are ordering so you claiming you didn't hear us order it makes you horrible at the job you have.  The matter proceeds to get completely out of hand from here.  She starts giving us a ""what do you want me to do attitude"".  Her options are discounting our meal or putting the order in.  Now these seem like perfectly fine options but not while you are rolling your eyes and giving an attitude about it.  Well, we didn't have any more time to spend, we just wanted to leave but there was no way I was leaving without saying something to a manager.  She says ""You want my manager, FINE"" and storms away.  She also quips in that ""I was nice to you guys, I even brought you syrup like you asked.""  Well genius, we ordered pancakes, which on the menu states they come with syrup so if that makes you a nice waitress I stand corrected.  As we are speaking to the manager she proceeds to keep eavesdropping and stomping back and forth and rolling her eyes at me.  That's the point I pop her the middle finger because I am severely annoyed with her childish behavior so when in Rome.  As we are trying to discuss the situation with the manager the waitress proceeds to stand behind him stomping her feet, pouting and rolling her eyes at me.  I am not one to keep my mouth shut and quite frankly I was at my absolute limit with her so I asked her to remove herself from us.  She proceeds to call me a ""Psycho"" and makes some comment about me having a child.  How the managers didn't remove her from us in the first place is completely unprofessional but allowing her to insult me being a mother, drawing my child into it?  Can you imagine something like this ever happening to you in a restaurant that is expected to have a higher caliber of service?  Yelling insanely personal insults at a customer that you gave horrible service to?  3 hours later I am still insanely shocked and appalled.   We eat out several times a week, from places 5 star to 1 star all over the city.  Never in my life have I ever had such a horrific experience at a restaurant.  Not even at a McDonalds.  We used to frequent Starr Restaurants, not just the Continental, but that will end as of today. It's not just screwing up, but having such an unprofessional childish meltdown over being called out about it, and then being allowed to remain on the floor, eavesdrop and insult customers.  Two mangers were sincere in their apologies, but at that point the situation was too far out of control to be rectified.  Obviously we didn't pay for our food, but we barely touched it waiting for my husband's meal.  The managers offered something to make up for the issue but I would never go back to the place after being treated like this.  I am really conflicted posting a review about this because you could tell the managers wanted to try to make up for her behavior.  If she would have just apologized without an attitude or blaming us for her mistake we probably would have walked out remaining customers, and she still would have gotten a tip as we are minimum 20% tippers even for lack luster service.  I hope this review steers people away from a restaurant that hires people who treat customers like garbage and don't deserve to be there.",1.0,1,0
334200,33971,2900,2014-02-27,"Who says brunch can't pack a little bit of heat? One of our freshman year hallmates was in town, so we decided to have a catchup reunion over brunch. Not sure how we picked Cafe Condesa, but it turned out to be a pretty good choice. I was extremely late (20 min) and we had an extra person come, but the hostess was very accommodating, reseating us to match our larger party. The only downside is that I didn't receive a water glass until another 20 minutes after I had sat down (which I guess is my own fault but still...) I settled on the huevos divorciados (which apparently is a secret menu item!), and a long while later (I think they were seriously understaffed), I got my platter! Covered in a red and green salsa, this was probably the spiciest brunch item I've ever ordered. The eggs were cooked to a great consistency, with the yolks soft to the touch. I got a side of steak, which was recommended, but honestly, the dish would've been fine without the meat: add-on at your own discretion (add'l $4). The home fries were also a welcome change. Not crispy as I'm used to, they had more substance and spice to them, which was a great contrast to my spicy eggs. All-in-all, the food was delicious and well-priced (most entrees are less than $10). My only complaint is the waiting. We ended up spending close to two hours there, even though we were only eating for 30 minutes. However, it was rather relaxing and we weren't really rushed out, as would be true with some other brunch spots in town. You make the call.",4.0,1,0

More so, the portions are huge that I, my friend, along with her baby were full when we left and even go left overs. As for our server, he was very attentive but not suffocating. He even asked if I'd like to sing but given that our lunch is scheduled to be a ""chika"" time for my friend and I, I politely declined but will definitely take up the offer when my Husband and I visit this place in the next few weeks. The server and owner also said ""Hi"" to my friend's cute but ""malikot"" baby and even offered to help clean with the mess she made.

The food is reasonably priced and super tasty.  They have traditional Japanese izakaya dishes like chicken karaage, fried squid, takoyaki, croquettes, gyozas, omu-soba, etc. along with some Korean inspired dishes such as kimchi cream udon. The standouts were the first two i mentioned along with the kimchi cream udon. I went with a group of 8 people at 6:30pm on a Wednesday and they were able to seat us even without reservation but only until 8pm so I think we got lucky and would suggest definitely making a reservation. They can accommodate groups but the diners we saw there were generally couples or less rowdy young professionals. It's more of a place for a quick drink after work or a date.",5.0,1,0

The only thing consistent in this place is that creepy portrait of the Kennedys hanging on the wall. I used to love this place before they created their other offshoots but without most of the original guys in there making the pies it's like a great musical group without the original members. Naturally, I went with the artichoke slice. The bread quality is the first thing I noticed that seemed a little off. It seemed like they had these pies preheated a couple times. The cheese still has the familiar taste but it's as if something is missing. I guess you just can't hand off a recipe and expect it to taste the same when it's in the wrong hands. I didn't even bother with the margherita or the sicilian slice. I'd rather remember the good times. Coming back to here made me feel the way I felt while watching The Godfather 3.

He is a creative and talented sushi chef who really enjoys interacting with his customers. Despite the renovations, the iffy wait staff at times (yes, I agree the ""dreaded"" waitress is the worst) and a really tough location he has remained loyal to the neighborhood and survived where I think most would fail. That should tell you just how good the sushi is here. Every person who has tried this restaurant on my recommendation has been very impressed.

Calamari was a bit salty, but was neutralized by the marinara sauce (not thinking about the actual amount of sodium I ingested during this dinner- yikes!). Baked clams were quite tasty too. We had the fettucine alfredo and chicken parmesan as entrees. Obviously we were so stuffed from the appetizers that we barely touched the entrees, but they made a very tasty lunch the next day.

On to the meal, which was good but I don't think warrants the number one ranking in Philly. Both my friend and I opted for the taste menu.  So you get the 8 salads, one of the hummus selections for the table and then you get to select one thing from each column on the menu, plus a dessert.  I explain this here because our server while very charming didn't do a great job at explaining what this selection entailed. So, the 8 salads were...meh.  The hummus was awesome, we ordered the one with the fava beans and thoroughly enjoyed every morsel.  I had the stuffed peppers, the chicken with some sort of grain that I can't remember, and the salmon with pomegranate and Israeli cous cous...All very tasty but nothing near a culinary orgasm kind of experience.  I finished the night with the ""deconstructed baklava"" which was just ok.  I'm usually good at this but for some reason can't remember what my friend chose, besides the grouper which was delish!  I can say that she was similarly underwhelmed.   In conclusion, I would go back to try some of the other things on the menu, and definitely have a few drinks, but it's not at the top of my list..so take that Philadelphia Magazine ;)",3.0,1,0

We went on a Friday night right before the restaurant and area got busy - and were seated right away. Upon looking at the menu I knew I had to try a little of everything: appetizer, meal, and dessert. We started with the fried dumplings, which were fantastic. My meat eating boyfriend loved them as well.  When it came time to order I was honestly a bit squeamish about ordering ""chicken"" as those words haven't passed my lips at a restaurant for four years. However, I went with the genera tsous chicken, and my boyfriend with the sweet & sour chicken.  We were both pleasantly surprised at how delicious the meal tasted!  The texture was a bit chewy, but really quite good.  The only strange part was the color - which was more beefy than chickeny. Regardless, I enjoyed my meal immensely and did not leave feeling greasy and yucky like from other chinese restaurants. When it came time for dessert, I knew I had to try the cheesecake. We went with the waiter's recommendation and ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake.  Without the strawberry topping, the cake is a bit ... off, however if you take each bite in with the strawberry deliciousness it'll knock your socks off for being made from tofu.   Overall we had a great experience here, and both agree that we would like to return to see how other familiar dishes taste.  Definitely worth a visit by vegetarians.",5.0,1,0

First of all, the service was poor.  I had to take my father's coat at the table and seek out someone to check it.  Our table was repeatedly interrupted mid-sentence for inane questions/comments from waitstaff.  Two  of our dishes were served to the wrong person at the table, which is unimpressive at a five-top.   In terms of the table, we were seated two on one side, three on the other.  I couldn't hear or see one member of my party because of the table setup.  The music was so loud that it inhibited conversation considerably-and I'm young (and love the velvet underground and the clash!).  I don't know how the older members of the group managed at all.  When we left, I heard that someone had asked that it be turned down a little; it was not. Secondly, the food was not up to standards for a restaurant of this type.  I've been to other Colicchio restaurants, and there was clearly something wrong here in comparison.  My baked ricotta was nicely flavored but inedibly hot, which left me way behind everyone and slowing down the pace of our meal.  It was served with nothing to spread it on and also no spoon.  An embarrassing amount ended up on the table since  it was too flaky to be eaten with a fork.  My biggest disappointment, though, was the quinoa ""risotto.""  I was excited to try this hybrid of two of my favorite carby indulgences.  Instead of the creamy dish I anticipated, I got a wet plate of one-note quinoa, like the last helping of a grain salad with too much dressing, or a bowl of brothy grain.  I left lots on my plate, but no server asked if I was satisfied.  Obviously, I skipped dessert--why waste the money or calories?  People at my table enjoyed the pumpkin panna cotta, which they said was excellent, while I suffered through bitter and weak coffee.

Although meaty, the pork ribs tasted freezer burnt and were dry. The baked beans were similar in texture to the ribs, old and/or under cooked. The corn bread was saturated with butter, reminiscent of movie theater popcorn.  I requested corn bread without butter and was rudely told by the waitress its only made with butter.  The collard greens were very good and it was the only thing I finished eating. The waitress did suggest the beef brisket as an alternative so I agreed to try it. Meanwhile, the nosy elderly White couple (primarily the female) sitting next to us within 6 feet watched intently my dissatisfaction with the meal. After finishing their meal, some 10 minutes later, the White female stood up and stated that I was trying to get a free meal which was over heard by the approaching manager (he was also White). The couple then abruptly left as the manager and waitress arrived at our table with the beef brisket. I calmly told the manager that the ribs, baked beans and corn bread were awful and why. Before I could even sample the beef brisket the manager felt I was annoying his customers and it was best that we leave, so we did. I offered to pay for the overpriced drinks, he said it was okay, just leave. Now, had we been White, not Black and male... I believe we would had been treated much differently with a better remedy. We left, drove off and who's walking down South Street, it was the elderly White couple. I stopped along side of them in my 2011 top of the line Acura and flashed a wad of $20 bills at them. I shouted, ""Does it look like I'm in need of a free meal?"" The White male apologized for his ignorant, prejudice wife. I simply pulled off.

I also had the pleasure of discussing my awful experience with one of Percy Street's regular customers who told me the restaurant is known more for it's beef brisket than ribs.

I had a coupon which Mehek had emailed me from from their own restaurant email list.  The waiter looked long and hard at the printout and even tried to turn me down initially for it until I was adamant to point out that the coupon was valid for almost another week.  You'd think that a restaurant with so few waiters would know about the promotions their own restaurant is sending out.  Lastly, a young gentlemen (non-indian and most likely a busboy or assistant waiter) was kind enough to pack up my food, but I realized when I got home that he combined the rice with the non-vegetarian chicken dish.  That's a big no-no.  Now I can't use the rice with the veg entree which I brought home.  Rice should always go in a separate container!  It comes off as cheap trying to cut corners by not using a separate container like that.  Despite being open for several years, this restaurant still has room for improvement and can't survive if it keeps making these mistakes. As another reviewer mentioned, the waiter gives you a tough time on the minimum credit card charge as I've gone through it.  I understand why restaurants have a minimum limit for a credit card charge, but I don't see why they have such a big issue with it if you are going to add gratuity to your check (which will put you over the minimum limit).  If you're going to be using Groupons or discounts, be aware of this minimum credit card charge for balances so you don't have to go through the hassle with the waiter,  Doesn't the business understand they'll lose a customer over giving them grief over a minimum credit card charge?",2.0,-1,1

They told her it was because the children & babies took up a seat & they had to charge. I will never go here again & I will tell all my friends to stay away.

330484,33197,2875,2013-03-10,"Since my previous review (yelp.com/biz/percy-stree…), Percy Street listened to my grievances and changed the recipes for their sauces so they are again gluten-free. I greatly appreciate when a restaurant listens to its customers like that, especially when it concerns food allergies. When we went to eat here last night, the service was excellent, as always. The food still left a bit to be desired for our own tastes, though. Our turkey tails appetizer was tasty, and while I was able to enjoy the two new sauces, I still prefer the old trio that used to be served. Our waiter informed us that the chicken is now being grilled instead of barbecued, which seems odd to me, so I opted to try the spare ribs with a rootbeer-chipotle glaze and pickled watermelon rind, while my girlfriend went with the pulled pork sandwich with a red cabbage-apple-sesame slaw. The ribs were cooked well and the pickled watermelon rind was decent, but I didn't taste any hint of rootbeer in the glaze. Adding some of the house sauces helped put a bit more flavor in the dish, but I wish the rootbeer would have come through more, as I've always found that and beef to be an excellent pairing. My girlfriend wasn't crazy about her sandwich. Though the menu clearly stated that it came with slaw, she wasn't expecting a huge pile of slaw to be *on* the sandwich itself (she said the ratio of slaw to pork was greatly skewed in favor of the slaw). She had to eat a lot of the pile before she could even put the sandwich together to take a bite. When she was finally able to try the sandwich as a whole, crumbs flew everywhere, as the bread was extremely crusty and not very conducive to holding together a sandwich. She tried adding a bit of the house sauce to try and soften up the bun, but to no avail. We did take the leftover sandwich home, though, so perhaps a night in the refrigerator will soften up the bread a bit. Overall, my feelings toward Percy Street from my previous review still stand. I understand their wanting to take a risk and change things up, but for us, the changes are mostly negative. While I again commend them for changing their sauces to be gluten-free, the quality of the dishes just doesn't correspond well with their current prices, which increased again since February for the spare ribs and chicken, though the lamb ribs are now a bit cheaper. I'll continue to look at the menu on their website now and then to see if they continue changing it around in terms of both price and selection, but for now, I don't feel the need to dine there again anytime soon.",3.0,1,0

Me and my friend came here at midnight, just the two of us after a movie. It was still quite busy. They close at 3am. My friend raved about this place having the best Sake and food ever!

Me and my friend started out with the White Peach Sake. SOOOOOOO GOOOD! A bottle is $25 -the size of a wine bottle. It was a good size for two people. We ordered the Buta Nabe with the chicken, chicken meatball and pork belly yakitori as well. The yakitori was tiny and not filling, but good. You have to order a lot of it though if you want to get full. The Buta Nabe was excellent. It's basically just veggies and pork belly stir-fried. SO GOOD! It's light and not oily. My favorite! Then we were still hungry so we added the Bara Nin soup, the octopus balls and the chicken and garlic fried rice. Yeah... Uhm, we were slightly tipsy and very hungry. The soup was SO GOOD.

529197,242019,1416,2014-04-30,"I was in Philadephia with work and had been craving Indian food for weeks coz surprise surprise! Indian is my favourite cuisine in this whole wide world. Since I'm new to Philly I had no idea where to go to satisfy my craving until last week, when a really sweet Indian colleague recommended Tashan to me. So off we went, a party of 6, to try this place out. On the way she explained to me that Tashan meant 'style' in Hindi and I found that bit of trivia amusing.  The first thing that will strike you about Tashan is that how they have done away with that typical kitschy interiors that most indian restaurants in the US seem to love. Tashan is apparently designed by some famous NYC based designer which is probably why they look like a really upscale fine dining restaurant. However, because of the open kitchen, the place smells great, with a great mix of all indian spices and herbs. Coming to the food, I ordered the Samosa chaat for starters as I was really craving a samosa. My friends ended up ordering the Tandoori shrimp and the Duck Shashlik, both dishes were top notch! Their portions are ideal for sharing and since I was having Indian after a long while, I really wanted to try as many things I could. For dinner, we went with the Tasting menu which is a great way to acquaint oneself with the things on offer at a new place. We ended up having succulent butter chicken, some quail and also a vegetarian dish. The tasting menu comes with wine pairings which were done quite well. For dessert, we ordered the Tashan Creme Brûlée which came with this indian dessert called gulab jamun. It was decadent. I also must point out that even though I didn't drink much, I noticed that they had a GREAT wine selection. I really feel that Tashan has managed to keep the essence of Indian flavours alive while taking the entire preparation to a fine dining level and adjusted the palate to suit our tongues.",4.0,-1,1

So when I hear him suggest a place I know it must be worth the trip. I've visited twice now and got different hot pots each time. I don't remember their Korean names, but one was with pork and one was with squid. I've also tried the beef one. All three were pretty great, but for me the pork reigns supreme. Perfect amount of spiciness and lots of flavor, and my hotpot was just the right temperature to get some nice crispy rice bits in there. I like that with all the hot pots it's not just getting the same thing with the meat swapped out, but they actually change the veggies and sauce according to the dish. And the place is pretty cheap! My dish plus bubble tea came to around $12 and was my lunch the next day. Not bad if you ask me. While the food is my favorite part of any restaurant visit, I also gotta give Koreana points for efficiency. The service is friendly and fast. You order and pay up front then seat yourself, help yourself to water and condiments, and bring up your tray when you're done. It's not luxury dining by any means, but considering it gets crowded with college students by dinner time it's certainly better than waiting around. Also, they're closed on Mondays.

I also like (and I mean this sarcastically) the way the ""Ajumah"" (those that know the language knows what I'm talking about) kept trying to sell me the $50 Kalbi for two instead of the $40 Bulgogi for two because ""it is a more healthy & satisfying dish"". 2) EVEN THE SIDEDISHES WERE DISAPPOINTING: they gave 3 pieces of kimchee for a meal of two...need I say more? 3) QUALITY: the food itself was not bad nor was it that great...actually hard to ascertain how good/enjoyable the food was when there was such little of it to eat in the first place. 4) SERVICE: not the most important category here as long as they are not rude, which they weren't...however, after giving us the bulgogi, they pretty much ignored us till we asked for our check, though...my water was never filled and left empty all the way till check time..could not necessarily ask for more water when they were not around for me to flag down 5) OPTIONS: to get decent Korean food and decent prices, there are no other options for CT residents other than NYC (a bunch there, especially in Koreatown) & New Jersey...few half-decent ones in Hartford, CT & the Edo restaurant in Norwalk gives you a little more for the same price but nothing to write home about. I'm writing this review because it's important that people get decent value & service for their money and I don't want people thinking this over-priced Korean restaurant represents what all Korean restaurants are like, because there are some truly phenomenal ones in NJ and NYC.

Beana's play area meant that my wife and I could have a rare meal out where we ate together while we watched our son entertain himself with puzzles and coloring books. Now, our boy is a young man and we still go to Beana's. In the 20-some years, I have only sent back one meal. I found their chili to be greasy. That aside, Beana's food is always consistent. Their refried beans are wonderful. The taste can't be found in something in a can on a supermarket shelf. I always ask that they serve them 'naked,' without cheese or salsa on them as they taste great all by themselves. Also recommend the fajitas dinner, which is too much for one person to polish off. Tacos, hard OR soft shell are another delight. If you are a vegetarian, you can ask for black bean filling instead of beef or chicken. Although I am a dedicated carnivore, I have frequently opted for black bean tacos. Yes, the drinks are in red Solo cups. Who cares? The birch beer is just as sweet as in glass.

Having all you can eat meat was great, but a restaurant like this seemed to lose its quality over the quantity which I find completely understandable. I did enjoy the waiters and the chefs. They were a delight and were always very considerate and very personable. Moving onwards to the food. I would have wished to try all the meats, but there was such a wide selection and so much to get to that it became exhausting, in a good way. As for the meats itself... Frango- the chicken I was not a fan of at all, I actually did not eat the whole piece simply because the flavors tasted a bit off. When it was wrapped in the bacon, the flavor of the bacon overpowered the taste of the chicken which was disappointing. Cordeiro(the lamb)- the leg of lamb may have been the best part, however the lamb chops were constantly dry. The leg of lamb was so tender and moist. They had begun my meal with the leg of lamb and it was a great start and led me to high expectations of the other meats. Sirloin- All of the Sirloin meats were fantastic except for their house meat the Picanha. The Picanha seemed a little too salty for my taste. Filet Mignon- The Filet was great, very tender, and each piece cooked to perfection. Even  the bacon wrapped filets were great, and the bacon this time did not seem to mask the taste of the filet. It was a very fair balance. Linguica- the sausages were small but so good. It was very sweet, and had a nice little kick to it.

First of all the location couldn't get better as it is only a couple of feet off of Times Square. If anyone has eaten in this area you know that due to huge influx of tourist most restaurants charge an automatic 18% gratuity to your meal regardless of your party size. This high class establishment does not, impressive!      As you walk in you notice the decor, rustic modern but very much warm and welcoming. I must say though the hostess and waitresses aren't easy on the eyes! My wife and I was seated fairly quickly for a busy Saturday night, it seemed like they had endless sitting for them to be able to accommodate the revolving door of people walking in. Even though the portions are family style the seating was not which is always a plus when you want to have romantic night out alone.      The food was decadent and flavorful, you could actually taste the freshness in the seasoning. As I stated before the portions was plentyful so we ended up sharing a plate of chicken parm over penne (Three people could of eaten from this plate). If you order the meat over pasta it is only a $10 extra charge as opposed to paying $25 more for a side plate of pasta. The meal came out to under $50 with soft drinks, bread and tip. For a couple to eat for that amount of money in Times Square and have the quality and portions be what they were is the reason this place has now gained a loyal customer for years to come.",4.0,1,0

It turned out to be luke warm and slightly sweet. when I remarked about this, he retrieved an ice bucket noting awkwardly it would get colder soon. It turned out the guy was in training, first day on the job. But that shouldn't be our problem. The more competent waitress who took over explained this to us and apologized, at least. But that was it. We ordered the mussels and clams as an app- our impression was they were slightly overlooked. The broth had flavor but was over salty. I had the sautéed halibut in lemon sauce- fresh tasting, nicely done - best with the good ratatouille we ordered as a side. The fries were not worth the $6 price or the calories- fat and mealy and tasteless despite the spice layer. Husband ordered the steak which was perfectly fine. The best part of the meal was the warm mini baguettes with butter!",2.0,-1,1

Admittedly Peppinos has much higher quality in their regular menu but so many of us in the neighborhood are just picking up dinner for ourselves, and I think that Peppinos is designed to sit down with a family.

I am not a fan of sweet sauce so my immediate reaction here is negative, there is virtually no acidity to the sauce and I imagie some people like this...I do not. As far as the crust, yes it is thin but unlike the other big New Haven names it is tough, it holds up well in the oven and does not get soggy but in order to get to this thinness the dough has been overworked with a cardboard like result, some people ay prefer this over a real thin crust that will not be as firm I do not. The crafted beers are great and reasonable, and the overall ambiance nice.

Little later I had to go for second dinner. Their noodles are very good in flavor and texture as well as all toppings.  However, the soup base killed all the good ingredients.

My wife and kids and I have been here at LEAST 10 times and have never had a bad meal. In fact it has always been excellent. I have been to many thai restaurants both in NJ and NYC. This small place where the husband (Iggy) takes orders and the wife cooks up the most delicious food ever is the best thai I have had. The pad thai is excellent. the shrimp and garlic lover is amazing. The coconut soup and the hot and spicy soup will leave you wanting more. My kids love the spicy fried rice. The prices are very reasonable. We have never spent more than $70.00 which usually includes 2-3 apps, 3-4 entrees, soft drinks ( the thai iced tea is so refreshing) tax and tip. It is BYOB for those who care.",5.0,-1,1

Sure, the burger was okay, but it was definitely not in my NYC top 20. The meat was tender and tasty enough as was the bun, but the Roquefort Cheese was a bit overpowering. Plus, I asked the waiter for lettuce and tomato b/c I generally enjoy them on my burger... and he said, ""We don't do that."" Well, they certainly have salad on their menu, so how big a deal would it have been to send out some leafy accoutrements?!?! A bit of a crazy policy, IMHO. As for the shoestring fries that are served with the burger, they are tasty... but they're hard to dip into ketchup making them more of a mess than anything else. Again, IMHO, the fries are just all hype. [SPECIAL NOTE: The food runner mixed up the ""medium rare"" burgers with the ""medium"" burgers when he was passing them out to our table, so be sure to double check before you bit down!] The atmosphere at Spotted Pig is eclectic and interesting and is probably comfortable most nights...however, on the night we visited, it was hot and humid outside and the air conditioner in the restaurant was broken. NOW I understand why our wait went from 2.5 hours to ""oh, we can seat you immediately."" Beware of this place until they get that fixed, or you'll be sweating like a pig in the Spotted Pig!

The place is well kept.  It's actually pretty appealing on both the inside and out, and for a nightclub in Hartford, I would say its definitely pretty upscale.  Both younger and more mature people would have an equally nice time / feel comfortable here.   2. The dance floor was immaculate and there was a sufficient amount of room to dance.  It is probably one of the best in the region.   3. There were quite a few pretty good dancers and plenty of people to dance with.   4. The drinks are descent.  They are not watered down but they are not large either.  They are reasonably priced and the service is fair and prompt.   5.  They have two dance floors so, if you want an occasional break or you are like me and prefer salsa over meregue etc. etc., they have another room for the mainstream stuff.  Even this room is pretty good because they mix it up with newer music raggaeton and some old school hip hop / R&B. 6.  They people are pretty cool here overall.  No drama, just people who sincerely like to dance.   The Bad: 1.  If you are a guy, you will still get felt up by security / patted down.  It is not ultra aggressive and doesn't leave you feeling like you just got groped by an ex-con.  Unfortunately, some knuckle heads have ruined it for the rest permanently.   Overall, very nice spot to do some salsa dancing!  The earlier you get there the better as the floor gets crowded quickly.",4.0,-1,1

However, by removing the platters and the meat choices all together, it killed the feeling of an authentic BBQ joint and now just feels like any other upscale theme restaurant in this town.

69876,45871,615,2013-01-06,"Not a very good example of a speakeasy with great cocktails. That's really too bad because the potential is there. Not a very good value, either. The bar itself is beautiful, but it's barely a speakeasy (basically just a bar behind a curtain), and the drinks are way overpriced given the quality. The best cocktails I've had in the city have come from some of its better New American restaurants (e.g., Buttermilk Channel, Marlowe & Sons, Gwynnett St., etc.), and Employees Only is more expensive and not in the same league. It's the little things that matter with these drinks, and it's the little things that weren't there. The egg whites and the purees came from bottles (i.e., weren't made fresh), and when you say pistachio encrusted rim, I assume that's what I'll get. Not great complexity in the cocktails--I wouldn't say one-dimensional, but underwhelming given some of the genius drinks being made around the city. Plus, they're priced 50% than their competitors. Just not worth it. Go to Fig. 19 instead. The bar is beautiful inside -- absolutely. But there isn't a ton of bar seating, and even if you're a party of four just getting drinks and there are open tables, you can't sit. Just not the most comfortable space if you're not eating (or maybe bribing the host? not sure how that might work).",3.0,1,0

The first night my gal pal and I were headed to another establishment following promises of outdoor seating and tasty veggie dumplings. When the night turned windy and rainy my friend asked about switching locations after seeing Han himself standing outside of his restaurant. The two had struck up a conversation and by the time I arrived I felt like was in Han's pocket. We were intrigued by the Dry Hot Pot style with rabbit and were dissuaded by Han himself to sample the dish with another meat. If I weren't sold already on the simple decor and delicious scents in the air his recommendations sealed the deal. I would have eaten out of his palm. And then there were the dumplings in chili oil. Oh dear lord. I have gone back each time dreaming, salivating, having dirty thoughts about the satisfaction of Han's chili oil sauce. These dumplings make me want to write home to Mama. The flavor is full and well-developed. The heat of the chili pulses outward from my mouth into every pore and yet the food is delectable, not at all overpowered by the heat. Han and Eric (the other gentleman who I've had a chance to meet) are both wonderful.

Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs: AMAZING.  My favorite dish of the night!

BBQ, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli: The sliders are about 3-4 bites so don't expect anything extravagantly large.  The short ribs resembled something similar to pulled pork - shredded and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were fried lightly so they had the perfect texture.  The smoked paprika aioli was great, but moderate - it's a bit salty!

Needless to say, I was spoiled as all get out when I got to Beau Monde; I was not disappointed. I should be honest; I don't remember much of the service other than one minute I was crepe-less and the next minute...I had a hot, fresh, delicious Coq au Vin crepe steaming in front of me (this is, to date, still my favorite crepe in the whole world.)

I found myself there again this past week to meet up with my sister and brother-in-law before they headed to the Beacon to catch a show. We split the calamari in a sweet chili sauce with toasted almonds, which was very tasty. We also had the mac n cheese bites with roasted red pepper ketchup (very good) and had one of their Oktoberfest specials (bratwurst sliders) which were also very good. The bartenders are attentive and friendly, while the atmosphere is great, whether meeting friends for a few cocktails or to watch a game.

246487,143651,2136,2010-10-11,"Born and raised in Brooklyn, I've become very critical of any pizza other then the select few establishments which have been around for years (L&B, DiFara, Totonno, etc), but I must say Lucali ranks up there at the top. Not only is the pizza one of the best pies you'll have in your life, the atmosphere makes it even more worthwhile. It's the perfect place to go an impress people, take a date, go with your family or on a causal Sunday evening. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Natalie at the front desk always takes good care of us and is extremely professional and courteous. Once of the great things about Lucali is that they keep it simple. Many of these new trendy boutique artisan pizza places (Fornino's, Nate Appleman's place, Artichoke, etc) have all these fancy choices that are over priced and frankly nowhere as good. When you come to Lucali's you come for the pizza. Plain and simple. Their topping selections change consistently and they are all fresh. Since the pizza's are thin crust, I would suggest limiting the toppings so you enjoy the flavors of the cheese, sauce and crust (and so it's easier to eat). Make sure you get one of their calzones as well. They use the same dough that they use for the pizza and the ricotta cheese is the perfect constancy. Make sure you get some of the marinara sauce on the side for dipping Tips: Lucali's is a small place intimate place and obviously had developed a following. They do not take reservations, however if you call a few hours in advance and are going to be in the area, they will take your name and number and tell you approximately what time a table will be ready. Just make sure when they call you, that you are 5-10 minutes from the restaurant. Also, they are BYOB. If you bring a bottle of wine or beer they will kindly give you glasses and uncork the bottle for you (no fee). All in all, if you want to have a quality pizza for dinner in a nice setting with nice service, Lucali is definitely worth it. Simple, cheap, great pizza and in Brooklyn! What can be better?",5.0,1,0

The service is rarely great, and the food is generally good to excellent. However there have been surprising lapses in the food quality and these have become more frequent. Recently three of us dined on a Monday night and I was served a sole mousseline with a cream sauce that was inedible. The fish smelled fishy, the texture was rubbery, and it was barely warm. It was blanketed in a sauce with the consistency and color of sputum. This $28 mess was garnished with a piece of wilted parsley. I can only surmise that the server recommended this dish to push it out because it was stinking up the kitchen. My advice? Stay away from ULC on Mondays when the kitchen appears to be run by subs without tastebuds. Or better yet, head down Chapel St. to Zinc where the food is always freshly prepared and the servers are on the ball and personable.",3.0,1,0

During a Yelp search, I stumbled upon Zutto's, who conveniently enough, took online reservations. At 7pm, the place was empty. There were maybe one or two other tables taken. But come another half hour or so and it was packed. The service was very good, though a bit frantic towards the end, and the ambiance was lovely, especially since we had secured a table in the window. We ate family style and the bill came to $75 a person, which included a very generous tip. Here's the order (for 4): Four bottles of hot sake: Decent enough, though low in alcohol content. They let you pick out a glass for your sake. It was a cute touch. Short rib steamed bun (two per order): Amazing. Flavorful and rich but light at the same time. Pork belly steamed bun (two per order): Another amazing choice, thought not for those who do not like fatty foods. Edamame: Not your mother's edamame...Charred and delicious. Different but great. Shishito Peppers: Spicy, tasty peppers very similar to those you find in Spain. Lemon aloi on the side cuts the heat in those that are on the spicier side. Premium Sushi Assortment (we ordered two) and Sushi and Sashimi Combo: AMAZEBALLS (and those of you who know me, know I do not use that term loosely.)  Some of the best sushi I've had in New York City. It melted in your mouth. I had to order a few extra pieces of Toro just because it might have been the best I'd ever had.

The pizza is definitely hand made, with fresh chunky sauce, Polly-o mozz, lots of grated cheese, olive oil and fresh basil.

This is the most expensive pizza that I've ever had. Not to mention, the place is a dirty dump. After Di Fara's I drove straight to L&B for a real slice (only $2.25) to chase down Di Fara's lest I return home to Long Island completely disappointed. Many may like Di Fara's. I just don't see it.

I came for brunch with a fellow foodie friend. We both started with mimosas - for myself, the blood orange mimosa, and for my dining partner, an apple flavor of sorts. Both had a good punch to them and tasted very fresh. And because we eat essentially the same foods, we both ordered the kale salad with eggs over easy on top. Magnificent! Fresh, light and flavorful.

Of course, being an Austrian bar, you can expect their beer selection to be top notch. Trust me, it is. Go for dark lager, man, go for it - it is smooth as black gold. And there are the bites... of sausages. Bursting with juices as you bite into it, soak all that goodness with perfectly crisp bun, and do not forget to order their sides! Cucumber salad was nice, my only gripe that sides are rather smallish to be a separate item on menu. But, hey, lets get back to those sausages. I mean, that's what we came here for, right? (and beer of course!). The käsekrainer is classic. If you been to Austria, you will agree with me. It's super juicy and rich with cheese stuffed into it.

471245,72235,3899,2012-09-07,"Located right next to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, The Islands is a great place to catch a heavy lunch or dinner. The dishes here are heavy, and you get huge portions. I tried the following: Curry Goat - Goat meat marinated and cooked in curry spices and herbs $11 Jerk Leg of Lamb - boneless leg of lamb stuffed with Jamaican jerk spices and roasted with mint chutney $12 Jerk Chicken - Spicy chicken baked with spices from the island $10 Between the three my favorite dish was the curry goat, it may have been because the jerk leg of lamb was too spicy for me.  Spicy and a bit oily.  Although Ben G seemed to have liked all the oils in the Leg of Lamb dish, he wanted me to pour the whole thing in my rice and eat it. The curry goat and leg of lamb were both super tender.  If I lived near here, it would be a place I'd come to at least monthly.  I've never had Caribbean food before, but it was (to me) similar to Indian food with all the spices and curries. The Islands is a super super small restaurant.  It's actually not even a full service restaurant, most people just come here and order to go. There is only one or two people working here and the same person does the order taking, cooking, and serving. They have a more limited menu on the weekdays, so come on the weekends so you can try EVERYTHING! My most favorite thing on the menu, are the stewed veggies that came with each dish. :)",4.0,1,0

The fishiness just permeated the burrito and so it didn't taste good at all. However, the CUBANO on a SANDWICH is highly recommended. It's savory, like a nice Philly cheese steak, but somewhat....different (in a great way). I seriously never tasted anything quite like it, and I am amazed at its novelty. The corn is not like anything I've ever had before. It tasted pretty good, but I felt like it was bit forced in that they added so much seasoning on it that I could barely taste the corn itself. I still recommend it, though, because after all, it IS one of their specialties. I have to admit that they did a great job of not overcooking it though. Nothing's worse than trying to nibble soggy, squishy kernels off the cob. Overall, the portions are a bit small, but it's enough to keep you satisfied. More than anything, I loved the milieu. It's a very cute place, full of vibrant colors. The outdoor seating is self-seated and family-style arrangement. I could see it being a great bar scene at night, so perhaps I will return for it's nightlife. As for now, I won't be coming back for the food any time soon.",3.0,1,0

Mind you, we got there around 12:45 (were seated immediately and Kathy came right way) and left hungry at 1:32.  Just ridiculous but the top of the cake was having our waitress come with an attitude and let us know that it was not her fault and that she put the order on time which we suspect she didn't because the ticket that she showed us had an entry of 1:30.  She quickly recovered by saying that the time printed was the time she printed out the ticket to show us then she goes on and tell us that they had a party going on in their party room and that again it wasn't her fault.  The thing that did it for me was her attitude - NASTY in my opinion.  Never again we will be going here, even if I think they have the best ice cream in NJ.",1.0,-1,1

I'm not sure if this place is supposed to be a fusion between Vietnamese and something that speaks Spanish, but the name is catchy. However, the bánh mì is not the most authentic that I've tasted. I ordered the beef short rib sandwich and the pork chop over rice. I've never had a beef short rib bánh mì from a Vietnamese restaurant before, so I don't have a benchmark as to how it should taste. The sandwich was nonetheless very tasty, and the short rib was marinated well. But, the sandwich is spoiled by the over-powering vinegar from the sliced carrots. The sandwich is also missing the crunchiness from the baguette. The pork chop over rice was probably the more underwhelming of the two dishes. They really skimp on the meat portions here, and for what you pay for a pork chop over rice, there was an obvious imbalance of rice-to-meat ratio and a clear intent to fill you up on rice. As I mentioned in the beginning, I'm a bit confused by the name of the restaurant, as there wasn't anything remotely Spanish about their menu. I am most likely not going to order from here again.",2.0,1,0

I'm not a big lover of Mexican but usually order beef fajitas when she drags me to one of these places.   We arrived later in the evening so the place was fairly empty,, only 2 other tables occupied with 4 and 5 people. So imagine my surprise when we stood waiting in the entrance-way for over 12 minutes waiting to be seated. I finally wandered to the back of the house looking for an actual employee.  At that point the waiter pops out from somewhere and asks if he can help us. I inquire is they are still open as we have been waiting in at the door for over 10 minutes. He say, ""yeah, well, I'm by myself tonight"" as if that should explain and make everything alright then, So we are seated and he take our drink order. The wife orders a margarita a I a coke. Just about another 10 minutes pass before the drinks arrive. During this time I note that fajitas are not on their menus. However, when I inquired he states they make them, it's just not on the men. Although the price quoted seemed a bit high, I was just happy that I could get my fajitas. My wife also ordered a beef dish although I forget exactly what. And off he goes to put in the order. About 10 minutes later he's back at the table to tell us that ""they are out of beef"" and asked if we'd like a chicken dish? Having now wasted almost 3/4 of a hour here  just to come to find out that they don't actually have anything we felt like eating, we gave the thing up as a bad job and headed to the local Chili's having sampled only the Coke and a margarita, which the wife says pretty much sucked.

A sushi bomb came, various other sushi items came. We continued to think about the pork betty. We ordered some fried chicken as an afterthought. Fabulous.

I never knew where the Piazza was, even though I frequent Liberties Walk, which is right next to it. Stumbled upon PYT while walking home one day, and my boyfriend and I were both starving. I was excited to finally eat there, and we even sat outside because it was finally a nice day out. He ordered the original PYT burger with onion rings, and I ordered a normal cheeseburger with the PYT ""special sauce"" added to it, with french fries. We waited for our food for a long time. Another couple who sat down 10 minutes after us, ordered after us, got their food before us. Turns out, they received our order. I suppose that's what happens when people other than your own waiter brings out your food. I told our waiter about the mix-up and she told us we were right, and apologized. Asked if we wanted anything else, and the manager would definitely do something. I told her kindly that it wasn't her fault, and sure enough, we got 50% off our ending bill. The food was actually delicious, the perfect portion size and great fries and onion rings. I'd definitely go back again, but won't go out of my way to go.",3.0,1,0

But it is happy hour on a Friday night so can't be too surprised. My girlfriend and I just had eaten across the street at Lobster Joint so we only popped in for a pint. Yet when the menu was given to us, our eyes both went straight for the cocktail section. Why have a beer when there's a cocktail called Contraband and Mexican Revolver? Such excellent concoctions they were! I was a little apprehensive because I'm not a big fan of spicy cocktails and the Contraband has Jalapeno in it but our lovely waitress told me it's more smoky than spicy so I went for it. Glad I did because she did not lie. My girlfriend had the Mexican Revolver and enjoyed it so much, she ordered it twice because I'm a slow ass drinker. As it was happy hour, the cocktails were $8 instead of the usual $12. Not bad. The service here is great. They were checking on us without being in our faces and the manager (Jaime, I believe?) came by for a chat. He was funny, helping us find a solution to my slight insomnia, and friendly.

The variety of snacks all kinds their carry looks infinite. As well as noodles, or instant ramen. There is sauces and spices and a small aisle dedicated to some beauty products. Also available some small dishes in the fridge like onigiri, grilled fish, small salads and so on. Definitely, grab a beer package before you go. The selection is quite good and unique. Perhaps my favorite aisle of all. Then, you are all set. I found myself into a shopping routine at Taiyo already. The service is courteous and friendly. The closing time is 10 pm everyday and credit cards are accepted over $10. However, I also find that due to business type exclusivity at the moment we may overlook the fact that is neither well priced or that exclusive or carries that infinite variety of things.

The sauce it was sitting in was sweet and too addictive that I sopped it up to the last drop with the bread served. Got the Bufala 16-inch pie to share with my wife. It's cut into 8 slices.

I love ribs and this is nothing close to any of the ribs I've eaten in Memphis. Salt and Pepper Shrimp: B --to salty but the BF liked it. Broccoli Rabe with mushrooms and truffle toast/egg: C+ It was just okay--not good/not bad. Not what I was expecting for dinner.  It was more of a brunch menu. Probably my fault though. Very little truffle flavor. New Zealand cockles : D  --way too much bacon in the stock, made this dish inedible.

I was so excited to try some of the best Japanese food I ever had - especially after reading all these 4.5-5 star Yelp reviews AND it being an obstacle to get a reservation booked. I emailed the restaurant to request an invitation (and got a very polite response!), and took my friend here for his birthday because his favorite foods are Japanese wagyu beef, seared foie gras, AND he loves scotch and this place shaves their own ""ice ball"" for their scotch on the rocks. This place seemed perfect.... But sorry to say, this food was only mediocre at BEST. The birthday boy was so disappointed in the quality of the food...  AND we found pieces of plastic on two separate dishes of our food! :( The first time we told the waitress, and she was very responsive and brought an extra dish. The second time, it was in our dessert, and at that point we were just so appalled that we decided to stay quiet and just enjoy the night as much as we could. Some tips: 1) The ""Japanese Wagyu"" was not anything special. DON'T SPLURGE ON THIS. It tasted like a standard ""good steak"" you would pay $50 for at a nice restaurant. It was pretty tough too. $150 for the NY Strip was just such a disappointing waste of money. 2) The Branzini was something I could have made at home. I am Asian and it was a simple dish that wasn't cooked over an open fire or anything, but just on a simple cast iron (which I have at home). Nothing impressive And the fish was overcooked and tough. 3) The pre-fixe menu was NOT worth it. The foods were so simple and mostly bland - flavors were nothing impressive at all. 4) If you ARE going to come here, get the foies gras soba. That was a unique combination of foods and you really can't go wrong with seared foies gras! 5) Request to sit at a proper table - NOT on the couches + coffee tables. It was pretty uncomfortable to eat leaning over the entire time. We spilled stuff constantly since the table couldn't fit everything comfortably. All in all, I was really really looking forward to this place! Especially because I took one of my favorite people here for his birthday... and expected so much. Instead he ended up getting plastic in his birthday dessert and he, being the classy gentleman he is, payed for the dinner and you can tell he just thought it was the biggest waste of money :( The place really isn't BAD - but given we came here with such high hopes, I had to give it 2 stars. In reality, if there was no super hype and ""exclusivity"" wrapped around this place, I would have given it 3 stars. *** If you're looking for an amazing bday food experience + service that goes above and beyond, go for lunch at Bouley!

568720,8225,4735,2012-06-10,"With the Pho 75 in Chinatown closing and the bulk of the Ramen Boy reviews scaring me I found myself in serious need of finding a quick and easy noodle fix when I didn't feel like climbing aboard the Pho Train (yelp.com/biz/pho-xe-lua-…). Fortunately I remembered Rachel's and Steven's reviews and was able to savor a bowl of the comforting pleasure that hand drawn noodles delivered. if my pho addiction had taught me anything its that the perfect asian soups have to be filled with a revitalizing broth, a plentiful and oftentimes odd assortment of additional ingredients, and a helping of some of the best noodles that you've ever had; all while coming at a fairly inexpensive pricetag. And for just $6 the seafood soup with shrimp, scallops, clams, and fish balls had Nan Zhou delivering on all cylinders. But the main thing I wasn't expecting was the fact that the tantalizing consistency and interesting back story of the hand drawn noodle recipe may have me giving pho and ramen a stink eyed comparison for the forseeable future. Be sure to bring cash to get your fill, but not a whole lot unless your table feels the need to split random delicacies like marinated duck, beef tendons, and spicy pig ears.

He anticipated our needs before having to ask for anything. The variety of food, quality of food, portion size and presentation was outstanding; 12 meals, no complaints and high praise. Cleanliness was also noted at this establishment. The drinks were generous at the bar as well as while dining. We can't say enough about this ""Gem"" in Philly.

503162,9496,4117,2013-01-16,"5-star food 5-star service from the owner to the server's assistant 5-star decor Combine this with reasonable prices ($45 for two dinners)  and you have Piccoli Trattoria! Okay before I begin I know you are asking, okay Neil B. if it is so good why not 5-stars? Well it is a pet peeve of mine, but often restaurants do not list the price of the daily specials on their menus because they know that most people (not me of course :-) will be too embarrassed to ask the price in front of their other half so they can tack on a few extra bucks. Now I am not saying this is why Piccoli does this, but in my opinion a restaurant should list the prices of everything it offers. Thus my current ranking is four (actually 4.5) stars which will go to 5 if prices of everything offered are listed on our next visit. We have been to Piccoli's takeout restaurant in Windsor Terrace several times and each time we have been very pleased. I think we were even more pleased last night when we happened to choose a Tuesday night when the restaurant was not crowded (which I am sure is quite unusual at a restaurant this good). The place is small and the tables are line up in rows allowing for easy passage between the rows but on a crowded night you will be only inches away from the people eating next to you. The atmosphere is exceptionally pleasant with customers of varying ages and as previously mentioned, the service was friendly, efficient and spot on. We began with rolls that were so good that we took them up on their offer for more. The second serving happened to have been rolls that had just come out of the oven...heavenly!  The rolls came with a tomato base dip but we asked for butter that melted on contact with our second batch of rolls! Now while I would have been happy eating warm rolls and butter all night, we then split orders of rigatoni Norma (eggplant, tomato sauce, fresh basil & fior di latte Mozzarella) and risotto bianco (cauliflower & parmigiano cheese risotto topped with anchovie pangrattato). Both were excellent and the tomato sauce, we agreed, may have been the best we have had in our visits to countless restaurants! We ended the meal splitting one of  Piccoli's exceptional tiramisu's and two decaf coffees.   Wow...what a great restaurant at which to have dinner! Update: We went back last night for another visit. The food was again excellent, the prices were still not listed on the specials but we had a server named Justyna who was even more fantastic than the very good server we had on our first visit. Thank you Justyna for your help, friendliness and attentiveness! Yet another update:  Last night was first time I used their restroom. It looked and even smelled nice!  Also we say outside on a temperature perfect night! We were, however, disappointed that we were charged for our coffee refills ($2.50 a cup) when even the diners refill for free. I asked our server why we were not charged last visit for our refills and she said it must have been a mistake (it was a different server than the one we had last visit).",4.0,1,0

My friends' dishes looked much more enticing (poached eggs/pancakes seem to be more popular) so I may have to try that next time. A huge con is that the waitress pretty much asked us to leave because there was a line of people waiting to get in. It's definitely not a nice place to have brunch and casually chat with friends.

It's like an epidemic of average food is swarming the city and I'm relegated to hyping the praises of the Whole Foods sushi bar and City Pizza in order to convince friends to come over. To be honest, this is kind of the last straw. Full disclosure, I've been going to EW for about two years, since I moved to Hartford. My partner and I love the quirky decor, the music on Wednesdays, the menu, and begrudgingly don't mind the prices for quality food. We've had credit card mishaps here a few times but still came back- the food was awesome! Unfortunately, the last two pick-up orders have significantly dropped in quality. Our standard, two orders of pad lao, tasted like they'd been waiting for someone to pick up since lunch- bone dry, tiny shards of noodle, a paltry amount of dry chicken, and barely any sauce for $13. We all but had to remake them ourselves with Bulldog sauce, vegetables, and more meat. Totally uncharacteristic and a real bummer. Because I'm so enamored with this place, I'll come back one last time, perhaps for brunch or pad lao to see if the last few months have been a fluke, but if it happens again, I'm afraid to say I'll have to cross another former favorite off my list.",2.0,1,0

Everything else i've had there is good-standard NY chinese food fare, but these two items are the stand-outs in my memory. The soup dumplings are a little tricky to eat your first time, my method is putting them on the spoon, carefully, and then poking a hole in the top of the dumpling with a chopstick to let the steam vent. Then sip from the hole, then do whatever you want when most of the liquid is gone. Inevitably i will end up tearing one taking it from the steam basket, as i will inevitably get some liquid on my shirt. I am not a mega bizarre-eats-foodie, i won't even touch seafood, but i love these. It's soup and meat in pasta, what's not awesome?

Holy disappointment this turned out to be. The star is for the excellent service from our very nice waiter. Eggplant caponata app -- Nice price of $6.  This is usually a fave of mine but found it to be much too oily and lacked the true flavor it should have.  Served with super thick slices of not good tasting bread which were all terribly charred. Okay..so the 3 pasta dishes should be better..After all we were told to only order the pasta here and from the looks of our dining neighbors next to us they left almost all of their food on both their plates and sort of shook their heads (looked as if they had some sort of fried filet with a salad?)  So of course we were lucky enough to know to order the right things! Wrong. I have never had heavier sauced pasta dishes in my life.  Normally I am a salt-aholic and put salt on everything.  This was the first time I didn't want to.  Everything was so completely OVER salted it was barely edible. The pastas all so overcooked you couldn't tell if you were eating fresh pasta - In fact it could have very well been a store brand. Squash lasagna- an oily mess with what tasted like cheap cheddar cheese melted over the entire thing.  Overcooked mushy lasagne with a tiny amount of squash, which gave it really no squash flavor - just salt and cheese. Tonnarelli cacio e pepe - thought I was going to choke to death on a peppercorn.  The tonnarelli was wayyy too overcooked. The most overly creamy/buttery/salty dish I have ever had in my life.  Olive Garden could do it much better than this - and that's not saying much - at half the price. Pappardelle with oyster mushroom ragu  - the dish I was dying to get after seeing it on the online menu.   This was the best one of the night.  Again- too much oil and salt but the mushrooms gave it some actual flavor.  Noodles were again too overcooked, but not as badly as the other 2 dishes. Once again my theory proves right!  If I don't like the bread at a restaurant I end up not liking the meal.  The bread looked like focaccia but tasted like some stale sourdough.     This isn't good cooking.  If it were the pasta would have been cooked al dente to perfection, the sauces would be light to compliment the pasta, half a salt shaker wouldn't be poured into the food.   I'm a tough critic, I know..

179434,78908,4771,2008-11-02,"Based on a friend's recommendation, I visited here on a Friday night for dinner. Apparently, this is where all of the locals go. Half of the place is a pizzeria and the other side is a sit-down restaurant. I ordered stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, which were subpar. It seemed as if the mushrooms weren't even cooked through and the filling was a tasteless mush. For the entree, I ordered the salmon in a white wine sauce with chucks of crabmeat. For nearly $20, I had high expectations, but the meal was average at best. And even though the food was considerably below expectations, perhaps the most disheartening aspect of this visit was the service. The waitress had the nastiest attitude I've ever seen, forgot to bring the salad that I ordered, never refilled the water and not once checked to see how food was. At first I thought maybe I did something to her, but she was one of only two waitresses working and treated every table the same way .... poor. The below average food combined with the surliest waitress ever made this my second worst restaurant experience ever. I will not be returning and neither should you.",1.0,-1,1

326018,175184,390,2009-10-10,"Casa Mia is one of several restaurants trying to carry on the tradition of good Italian Food in what is known as the Little Italy of Hartford, which is mainly Franklin Avenue. I lived off of Franklin Ave. for a few years as a kid and have a lot of mouth-watering memories of spinach pies, gelato, lemon ice (the real thing), anise flavored cookies, huge aluminum containers of melt-in-your mouth ravioli - and on, and on.   Back then, most families also had gardens in their backyards, complete with grape arbors for making their own wine. There was never any garbage on the sidewalks and it was safe to stay outside with your friends well into the evening in the summertime. A lot has changed since then, but as I said, there are a few spots trying to hold on to the traditions. Casa Mia, a family-owned restaurant at 381 Franklin Ave. (at the corner of Preston Street) is one of those. It's a little bit formal - you wouldn't go there in shorts and a T-shirt - a little bit subdued, a little pricey and the waitstaff is a somewhat reserved (not aloof - more like dignified). The menu items include plenty of pasta dishes and lots of seafood, as well as chicken and beef. They post their menu online, so you can browse and see that most of the dishes are upscale Italian. When I was there earlier this month, I overheard a fellow diner say he was surprised to see a wine from the area where he grew up in Italy. Casa Mia serves lunch and dinner, but when I was there on a Wednesday for lunch, there were only 6 people in the place. It seemed a shame. They have a cozy bar and a nice glass-enclosed area with a few tables - with brick walls and wooden beams and wine bottles tucked into arched windows - where you can watch people coming and going. Lunchtime specials (appetizer and entrée) are all priced at $16.50 and dinner specials are $28.50. Or you can go with antipasto - choices include veal, sirloin, chicken or seafood and range from $13.95 to $16.98 per platter. For my appetizer, I chose Calamaretti Affogati - squid slices in a spicy tomato sauce with capers, olives and spinach, beautifully cooked and presented. For my entrée, I chose Ucelletti di Manzo - beef top-round rolled with asparagus, cheese, proscuitto and herbs served with broccoli and cauliflower on the side. The beef was tender and deliciously seasoned, with a pleasant salty note from the proscuitto. Casa Mia also will serve your meal family-style for a group of at least six. This includes four courses with unlimited servings and salad, a side of vegetables and coffee, at a price of $16.95 for lunch and $28 for dinner. Hours are from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (closed Tuesdays), from 4 to 10 p.m. on Saturday and from 4 to 9 p.m. on Sunday. Major credit cards are accepted. There's plenty of parking, but you have to watch for the entrance, which is off of Franklin.

First of all we had to take a shifty elevator up to the second floor, together with the frantic servers and bus boys. Then, the food was right there, in a small alcove right in front of the elevator! Upon getting off the elevator, we bumped into a few patrons who were getting the buffet food, because the space was very narrow and awkward. Then, I noticed one of the bus boys sneaking some of the food off the buffet and earing desperately, huddled by the elevator. The food itself was cold; the flimsy little serving tray warmers were not sufficient to ward off the cold air people were bringing in via the elevator. Honestly, the presentation of the food itself in that buffet looked like a make-shift continental style buffet you see at those hotel training seminars. I can only say that the food, had it not been cold, was actually quite good. Very good food. To add to the experience, somehow Champagne was sold only by the bottle, their Chai tea was all 'out' at 9pm. And the waitress we had was so busy that we were long done eating before she came back to bring our Coke, and tell me that Chai was all out and they were done making it for the night. I must have had high expectations, because even décor upstairs seemed drab and a little creepy. There was no artwork no the walls, our table was one of the outdoor ones. I kept hitting my shin on a metal bar underneath. I can tell you, honestly, that was one miserable experience for the both of us. And the final bill of $79 was absolutely a slap in the face.",1.0,-1,1

566830,16999,4724,2014-03-16,"Came here with a group of 4 for breakfast and we only had to wait for about 30 min before getting seated. Just a note, if you have parties 5 or more, 20% gratuity is automatically added. I don't know about your but 20% is A LOT for a cash only place. We ordered, The Big Boy, Pulled Pork Hash, Chicken & Waffles, and Fried Okra. I liked my Pulled Pork Hash. It was very flavorful, the egg still runny and the dish tasted great even after breaking the yolk and mixing it into the dish. One issue is the pork, it's not as soft as it could have been. The dish does appear kind of small but it is filling. I kind of wished it was served in a bigger bowl. I didn't get a chance to try The Big Boy but there is a lot of food on that plate. Really nothing special about this dish. The Chicken & Waffle was okay. I thought the gravy and waffle were a let down. Not much flavoring/seasoning in either components. The chicken was was moist, probably over fried but quickly became soggy because of the large amount of gravy that was put all over it. The waffles were also dry. The fried okra was okay, just felt too much friend stuff towards the end. I wish they did a little more twist to the dish. It's basically battered okra, nothing else. Very much one note. We also had a strawberry milkshake. Tasted more like a vanilla milk shake Barely any strawberries or strawberry flavor in it. Overpowered with milk. Service was excellent. They definitely have enough staff and they are attentive to your water level. Everyone is really friendly there. Also, the consistency needed to be more viscous. It tasted kind of water downed. As for the food, I think it's more of a solid 3 stars. I may come back and try some of their lunch dishes but I'd be hard pressed considering it's cash only and there are better places for the same price that accepts credit cards. If you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try but I definitely would not make a special trip to eat here.",3.0,1,0

Once my friend arrived we were seated quickly (they definitely move you through there and flip tables quickly). We ordered the guacamole and chips (very fresh, not much heat...could have been spicier). My friend had margaritas and I had homemade Palomas (they have Jarritos soda!) with a glass of tequila on the rocks and a full bottle of soda. Food: one each of Pork, Fish, and Steak tacos. My friend had the same except got the ground beef instead of the pork. Rank them in that order (the ground beef was a little greasy and had peas in it). The pork and fish tacos were both great. Service was good although had to ask twice for waters and a chip refill (the small guac is generous but the basket of chips was stingy).

Not wanting to splurge too much even for a special occasion, we picked the cucina povera menu, a three-course prix-fixe ($35). We got the wine pairings to go with (3 good-sized glasses for $15). Prix-fixe deals can be disappointing because the rest of the menu hints that there are greater things to be had. But this combo hit all the right notes. The chilled zucchini basil soup was creamy but light and topped with a delicious basil oil and pine nuts. The pork tortelli were in a very flavorful broth with a little bit of kale. Pig explosion. The dessert was panna cotta with candied almonds. I LOVE panna cotta. All three wines were interesting and delicious and I would never have had the good sense to pick them out for myself nor the opportunity to pay so little for them. This is the kind of place where you have a waiter but really everything in the restaurant is looking after you. For example: my husband's napkin got folded when he got up to go to the bathroom; I arrived schlepping too much stuff and the hostess checked my bag to unburden me. The only downside was a particularly loud and obnoxious woman at another table. Here's a hint: please do not sing over dinner in public. But there's nothing the waitstaff could have done to chill her out except start feeding her, after which point she was quieter. Bonus: as an amuse bouche they served a shot glass of chilled fennel soup. My husband loves it when you get a treat at the beginning of the meal. They have a ginormous binder of wine and other alcohol offerings, which we did not delve into because of the pairings, but I'm sure you could find whatever you wanted here.

523048,240125,4382,2012-11-28,"The meal, experience, and aftermath was a disaster, so much so that I am driven to write my first Yelp review.  Let me break it down by issue, although I think what may be of most interest is the last section where the manager promised to mail a complimentary gift certificate because of the negative experience AND HAS YET TO DO SO OVER A MONTH LATER. 1.  The Context:  6 of us had reservations for 8:15 on a Friday night (October 19) to surprise a friend for his birthday.  We all arrived promptly and were seated by 8:20.  Their menu is very limited, which I don't begrudge them, but it was very frustrating that by 8:30 on a Friday night they were already out of 20% of their appetizers and 30% of their entrees. As this is one of the most expensive BYOs I've attended (think $15/app, $25/30/main), I at least expected excellence in the quality of the remaining dishes they had.  We ordered around 8:35/8:40, although we were ready to order earlier.  In solidarity with some pregnant friends, nobody was drinking.  We are all 30-something parents who got babysitters for what we expected to be a special meal, albeit not one that would last close to midnight. 2.  The Service:  To be kind, it was abysmal.  We waited approximately 30 minutes for our appetizers (which we ate promptly) and were not served our main courses until 9:50.  The table next to us had ordered after us and were served their main courses before us.  At no point did our server make any acknowledgement that we were waiting an inappropriately long time (almost 1 1/2 hours for our main), nor did she even provide us with a refill of our bread or anything to hold us over.  When we made some comments to her about the wait, she said nothing sympathetic or reassuring in response, nor did any manager or other employee.  When the food finally came out, we were served unevenly and some of the dishes were lukewarm.  Again, at no point was there any acknowledgement that this was not right nor was there any offer to make amends with a comped dessert or even a bread refill (not even for the birthday boy).  Completely tone deaf. 3.  The Food:  The food was most definitely not worth the wait.  Of the remaining dishes they had on the menu, the food was generally bland and not more flavorful than what friends have made for dinner parties.  I don't even remember what I specifically ordered -- it was eminently forgetable.  We also did not even get to ""enjoy"" the food at the appropriate temperature as it came out lukewarm.   4.  The Aftermath:  My friend, the birthday celebrant, is non-confrontational so in deference to him we did not raise an issue at the meal.  The following day, however, I called to speak with the manager about my experience. He didn't disagree with any of my characterizations that it was an unpleasant dining experience and one that Russet should not provide to its customers.  While he initially did not offer any kind of resolution, after a little prodding he volunteered to provide a gift certificate to Russet, which I in turn intended to provide to my friend.  I provided my mailing address, which he read back to me, and thanked him for his time.  It has now been OVER A MONTH AND WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE GIFT CERTIFICATE.         My dining experience was awful but what I find even more insulting/offensive is Russet's failure to even do what it said it would do and provide the gift certificate.  I don't know if the manager thought I wouldn't follow-up or if this just was not a priority, but there is no excuse.  Each couple paid about $120 for sub-par food and a below-average dining experience.  Not only do I not recommend Russet but I found the whole experience so disagreeable that I want to share it with others.",1.0,-1,1

For example, the fontina and goat cheese with mushrooms - if you don't like mushrooms, they can scrape them off, but not make you a sandwich from scratch without them. Another plus is that fact that the ""classic"" can be made from a choice of cheeses (not just ""American"" which is not, in my opinion, real cheese!) and breads (wheat, white, or sourdough). I went with the Classic but aged cheddar instead of American. It was grilled well, crunchy on the outside and the cheese was thoroughly melted.

One other thing, and MANAGEMENT PAY ATTENTION, there were smokers which is against state law and none of the staff did anything about it.  We didn't make a fuss about it but it is ILLEGAL and could/should affect you liquor license.

525165,240839,1241,2014-07-01,"So I should have known better than to trust yelp with finding an AUTHENTIC dim sum restaurant. The ""dim sum"" was no better than any other random Americanized Chinese takeout or buffet. I was coming into the area four hours away from Syracuse and knew that I had to get some dim sum since I was in the Chinatown area. I am only basing this review on the dim sum options which was not much even though the name itself contains the words dim and sum. I walked in with four other friends and immediately knew I was in the wrong place. There was barely anyone there, no food carts, no wheel tables but we gave it a chance anyways. Yes the food was cheap and it came fast. Some of the dishes were alright, like the scallion pancake but  the pork dumplings and shumai were EXTREMELY questionable. When you grab the pork dumpling with a chopstick or fork a watery/pinkish ooze came out of it and that's when I knew that those pork dumplings were something hellish and steered clear from them. Shumai is normally made with a filling consisting of pork, shrimp and black Chinese mushrooms. The ""shumai"" here was made from some type of rice mixture. Definitely not shumai. Besides the food the waitresses were OK. They were prompt with water refills and service. On the other hand the cooking crew in the back were creepy as hell. The restroom was right next to the kitchen so when you walk past you get the eerie feeling of being starred by multiple kitchen members. Gross. Some tips for finding some GOOD ASS dim sum: - the restaurant should be VERY busy - there should be servers pushing carts stacked with steaming entrees around the aisles. (the steam indicating the freshness of the food) - there should be no menus, you order by what you see from the carts - the restaurant itself should not look modern - there should be a circular revolving table in the center of the dining table (confusing but you'll know when you see it)",1.0,-1,1

The outdoor tables with a view of Rittenhouse square are charming and romantic. The space is so large that we didn't have to wait for a table- a HUGE plus during the brunch rush. The bread basket is a delicious starter, with particularly amazing sourdough. My table ordered the salad lyonnaise and the macaroni au gratin to split. The salad was light and tasty and the egg on top was cooked to perfection. The macaroni au gratin was unbelievably rich and flavorful. I got the eggs florentine, which was outstanding. Although it's a pretty standard brunch dish, not every restaurant can execute it to perfection quite like Parc.

Yes, the lines can be horrendous... but The Meatball Shop has implemented a courteous text messaging system where they'll take your number and text you a few minutes before your table is ready.  There are plenty of fun places to explore in the area, so this frees you up without risking having your name crossed off the list (*cough cough Totto Ramen*). Staff are, for the most part, friendly.  Best service I've had tends to be at the bar (which is first come, first serve seating btw).  The restaurant is small and loud, so it's best to come with a party of 2... and no more than 4 if you want to have an audible conversation. The Foodnalysis: - Meatballs - My favorite combinations include: (1) chicken + parm sauce + risotto (under)... rich and decadent (2) spicy pork + classic tomato sauce + smash (3) chiken or spicy pork or daily special + spicy pork sauce + simple salad - House Lemonade - Homemade and tart, just how I like it.   - Beer & Wine - Lots of great options, very reasonable prices. - Ice Cream Sandwiches - LOVE these.  Love how you can pick two different flavor cookies as well!  My favorites include chocolate chip cookies + mint ice cream and ginger cookies + ginger ice cream (daily special).

The radicchio salad was bland. A little salt and pepper helped, but I wouldn't recommend it. Radicchio is too strong for such a mild dressing. The spaghetti was just the right amount of chewy and full of flavor. I ordered my steak medium and it came out very well done. The server took it back without hesitation. The second time around was a charm - it was tender and juicy and the accompanying baby turnips were tasty as well. The French fries in truffle oil were delicious, as were the beignets with blueberry sauce. The food, except for the salad, was all quite good. The service was fine if a little rushed. She seemed a little too eager to take our various orders i.e. to get us out of there quicker even though there were plenty of open spots. When I say I need more time, that means more than a minute! My only gripe was the portions - they are skimpy (which my companion had also said after his first time there). I am not a huge eater by any means but after half a salad, half an order of French fries, a whole 6 oz. sirloin and a few beignets, I still felt like I could have eaten a little something else. My companion's spaghetti was downright kid-sized. There was a bunch of beefy guys at the table next to ours and they ordered two appetizers and two entrees each! Anyway, it was a fine experience.

I like their breakfast/brunch as well as Henri's burger and short-rib sandwich, and if you're a fan of crepes, they have many to choose from.

I was with a friend, but somehow 8 other groups of 3 or more who were all behind us in line were seated before us. It is a testament to the pizza they serve that despite the wait, and the weird door man, that I actually consider coming back to this place. What makes their pizza special? It's the crust. It had a distinct flavor that  I can only attribute to their oven. The toppings or the sauce were not especially memorable, but the crust is sublime. One tip, do not put roasted peppers, somehow their roasted peppers were too watery and it made the pizza soggy. Oh another tip, bring your cutest girl friend to come along, and ask her to wear next to nothing, that seemed to help shorten the wait for a table.",3.0,1,0

At least they were offered a free app for their trouble. Bottomless pasta  (choice of ravioli, pesto penne, spaghetti) after a long day of traveling was great but I should have passed on the Caesar salad starter.

Right off the bat one of the most annoying things was having take out  customers dressed in their beach clothing sitting and standing near the hostess desk. Listening to complaining about how long of a wait (hour plus) they had for take out pick up. To make matters worse the food service was slow, as a table near us was complaining to us that they had been waiting an hour for their food! They were approached several times with the offer of free drinks and apologies. The take out customer received a free app but if she was correct she should have been offered more. The dining room was not busy at all so it was a little odd that the 5 or 6 take out orders could throw a kitchen off by that much? The other annoying and health code violation thing was the cabana boy from the beach club who came into the restaurant for an order with no shoes and beach sand all over his feet walking around the entry and restaurant. It was ignored by the staff. It was disgusting and is a health code violation for a reason! It is a very small restaurant so  to make it a more enjoyable experience for the sit down diners that are looking for some kind of ""dining experience"" the management should really have their  take out customers wait for their orders in the lobby where there's plenty of seating with the statues. :) So they're not gawking at you while you're trying to eat your expensive meal. And here's a hint for the manager, your wait station for napkin folding and doggy bags and such should have a partition around it so we don't have to watch this activity while we're trying to enjoy a night out . It was just a little ""campy"" like being in a Ponderosa Steak House Restaurant. Figure out who you are a campy place, casual, rustic chic, beachy convenient?  But, don't try to be a little bit  of everything it just doesn't work. As for the food it was pretty damn good! Steak was awesome tasty, tender and cooked to perfection. The calamari app was not my cup of tea... too thick like x large rubber bands and the ""special"" calamari with peppers was just sliced cherry peppers thrown around on it.

Makes you want more but you have to hold yourself and resist. Jumbo lump crabmeat - Don't get this... This comes with a side a hardcore mustard which unfortunately becomes the best part of the dish. The crab doesn't have the fresh taste to it and whomever pulled the meat out of the shell didn't go a great job so you literally had to eat it with care since 99% you'd bite into little pieces of shell. Crispy braised pork hock - This is what I call badass! I've been here around 10 times and I always get this as an entree. Yes, I do want to try other plates but I can never get myself to cheat on the hock. I feel like they've changed the hock in recent months. It's become much smaller but yet tastier.

You can put down your name and number and they will text you when your table is 5mins away. We ordered all East Coast oysters because the bf thought they would be fresher - but judging by the quality of this place, I bet everything would be super fresh. They give you a piece of paper with the list of oysters on them and you order them by writing how many of which oysters you want. They are in order of least mildest to most flavorful. The oysters were plump, fresh, and we could taste the difference as we made our way around our oyster platter. We also split a seafood bouillabaisse. Ugh, such a great decision. The broth was TDF and the mussels, clams, shrimp, fish, and scallops were big and flavorful. How is seafood SOOO good? I don't understand it!! They also have a great beer selection - perfect on a summer day. A gulp of beer and a slurp of oyster. What more can you ask for? Oh yeah, free whiskey cake!",5.0,1,0

I thought the dumplings had plenty of soup inside.  However, I thought the soup and meat filling were greasy and had too much fat.   The meat in the dumpling was also fatty enough and/or finely ground enough that I found the filling mushy.  I would prefer a thinner broth with a leaner meat filling.

The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala were joined by a lot of other great dishes, so it was worth it. They brought fresh naan to the table, too. My husband said it looks like an Indian diner with the booths and the location isn't the most fortunate (squeezed between an automotive repair place and a hole-in-the-wall take-out Chinese place) but the food was good enough to overlook the lack of ambiance.

597544,250153,4969,2014-04-18,"SUMMARY: The wife and I had a lovely dinner at Baker & Co. last night. It was delicious and the service was good. We look forward to a long brunch (once they launch it) on the patio in the summertime. We plan to go back to Baker & Co for sure. FOOD: Very, very good. We both cleaned our plates. I had the Burrata with roasted artichokes ($12) followed by the Paccheri pasta with lamb ragu, olives and mint ($17). The pasta was delicious and perfectly cooked. The mint added a very interesting dimension to the dish that really worked for me. The only hiccup was that the burrata was served cold. It's typically meant to be served at room temperature. My wife had the grilled squid with smoked paprika, capers and rosemary ($13) followed by the pappardelle with veal cheek ragu, fava beans and Grana Padano ($19). She very much liked both of her dishes. I'm not a huge squid guy in general so no comment there but her pappardelle was excellent. We selected the Friulano (Tocai) at $38 which was very good. SERVICE: Good, but there were definitely a few ""we've only been open a week"" kinks that we noticed (two bus boys stood next to our table and chit chatted for like ten minutes in the middle of our meal. It disturbed us, what can I say?). On the whole, however, our waitress was attentive, helpful and in no way overbearing (we took our time and never felt in any way rushed). The manager, Marcus, was very involved and I suspect that these kinks will go away. DECOR: Rustic, cozy, dark, comfortable. All good.=",4.0,1,0

22506,24777,151,2012-12-17,"A few of my coworkers had heard excellent things about Cuban Pete's and after doing a fair amount of research online as well as calling the establishment, my office decided to conduct our annual holiday dinner party (for about 20-25 people) at Cuban Pete's to appalling results. Firstly, we contacted Cuban Pete's a couple of weeks before the date of our party in order to make reservations for our party. However, we were told firmly that the restaurant has a strict ""no reservation policy."" Fair enough.  We then asked if we could arrive at around 6:30-7:00 and we were told that the wait time would be about 3 hours for 24 people. We then followed up by inquiring if we could be seated at around 5:00 pm before the dinner rush began. We were SPECIFICALLY told we could do so and while the restaurant couldn't guarantee us reservations, as long as arrived before the dinner rush (around 5:00) we would be accommodated. Fast forward to December 8th, members of our party arrive at Cuban Pete's around 4:45- 5:00pm and were flatly refused any kind of seating inspite of the fact that there were 2 large tables in plain sight completely free and set up with plates and napkins. We asked the hostess as well as the manager for a reason and were also refused any kind of reason for why they were refusing us any seating.  At this point, most of our party (including children) have arrived at the restaurant and are waiting so we asked them if they'd be willing to seat us as we come in (in groups of 4-5). Again, we were refused without any reasoning and were told that we'd be waiting for hours for any kind of seating.  At this point, there were two tables of 12 completely unoccupied. We sought out Cuban Pete's since a few people had recommended the place to us and people couldn't stop raving about their food. However, their customer service was nothing short of appalling and we will not be attending Cuban Pete's or recommending it to people from this point on.",1.0,-1,1

The Parc sits on a street corner on Rittenhouse Square. Two sides of the restaurant open up onto the sidewalk and, in Parisian fashion, they have sidewalk seating which is the perfect place for having a drink and people watching. Inside the restaurant, they have done a great job creating an authentic Parisian feel to the place.  From the marble columns to the inlaid ceiling and tile floors, the architect got it all right. Decent selection of wine and beer.  The steak tartare and the mussels were both amazing.  Maybe the best steak tartare I've ever had.  I plan on going back and trying a number of different entrees and appetizers that were calling my name. I dropped a star off of my rating for the service.  Our waiter had no 'touch'.  Every time he came over, he was unable to stop himself from interrupting our conversation.  And, he must have stopped at our table, no exaggeration, 10-12 times during our meal.  Dude! our food is fine.  Stop bugging us.  That said, I have only been there once so it's likely that the service provided by our waiter was an anomaly.  May amend my rating next time.

The food was delicious. We started with a fried shrimp and calamari appetizer. It was perfectly cooked, very light and not chewy.

I went with my boyfriend and another couple on a Saturday night and was surprised with how short the wait was. We ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas, chips, salsa, and guacamole as our first course. I have a pretty low tolerance to anything spicy but the chips were still addicting. As an appetizer, my boyfriend got The Chronic, I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, and the other couple shared a Smoked Chicken Quesadilla. My boyfriend's sandwich was incredible and the Mac N' Cheese definitely made it. My sandwich was fine, although it was a bit dry. I wish they added some more mayo or ranch dressing. The other couple loved their quesadilla. Before completing our entree's, we asked for another pitcher but asked for peach instead of strawberry. After a short deliberation, we confirmed that the second pitcher was also strawberry. That was a small mix-up but based on his overall attitude, it seemed a bit intentional. I guess it seemed easier for everyone involved to fill the pitcher with strawberry instead of dumping the remaining ice and getting a new, clean pitcher for the peach flavor. Whatever, I still got drunk and the strawberry was still good. I'd like to return and give this place another shot since people do seem to rave about it.",3.0,1,0

If this is your first time also, I highly recommend doing half chicken and lamb to get a taste of both and see which one you like more if you were ever to come back again.

I usually judge a bar by whether a place can make a manhattan correctly and this was probably the best I've had in quite some time (also stirred and double strained - not shaken!!). My girlfriend had a drink that I think was called salt and smoke. It was a combo of mezcal, pisco, cucumbers, fresh lemon, and salt - don't quote me on exact ingredients. The drink was phenomenal and all of the cocktails on the list looked very innovative and had a great focus on seasonal ingredients. The draft beer list was refreshing, and you could tell that they spend a good deal of time selecting the choices as nothing was mainstream, but there were good local alternatives. I like to try new things and this is a great place to do that. The only problem seems to be that the majority of the crowd didn't feel the same and was content drinking bud bottles. Changing the local crowd is very hard to do, but I do not think this place is going to hit it's full potential if they cannot get their regulars to try the 'brand' they're going for. To move onto the food some of our favorites after our 3 visits have been: oysters on the shell - they had 2 different kinds to choose from and the bartenders were very familiar. The cucumber mignonette was something different and the oysters were certainly fresh. The fire islands were our favorite! Steak Burger with Jalapeno relish was smokey, savory, and juicy. Fried Chicken was ridiculous and had some kind of truffle honey on it that was addicting. Truffle oil can be overpowering when used in the wrong place but the balance with the sweetness of the honey was just stupid! yum! We have also enjoyed an asian inspired special with udon and a kung pow duck confit leg, which showed just how versatile their chef is. Besides the drinks and food the live music on Saturday nights is great and the service is very homey and warm. There was some acoustic band that was there a few weeks ago playing some americana, blues that made the night. I don't see why Park Central is rated so low on yelp.

Cute and kind of Brooklyn hipster yet cozy little brunch spot in the middle of nowhere(or it appears to be according to NYC standards for middle of nowhere) for brunch in Philly. The bf and I yelped this place for breakfast and had no wait even though it was packed. It has kind of an artists studio look with exposed industrial touches. I would believe it if it used to be an old warehouse. I realized the tables were too close together that further emphasize how packed we were. You can hear conversations from both sides! But getting on the food. The menu looks great! Everything sounded so delicious. I was stuck between the mushroom frittata and the huevos. I chose the frittata, my bf got the breakfast burrito which he loves. We ordered a side of sausage and lemon ricotta pancake to try. Food took long to come out which is understandable for very busy morning brunch hour. They actually forgot our pancake until we nearly finished our meal, apologized and put it on the house which was a nice touch of them to do! Philly people are so nice! But unfortunately it was not memorable. It was light and fluffy in lemon flavor but ricotta to batter ratio was too low. The BF's burrito was good! But too little cheese! On the other hand I didn't realize my frittata had Italian bacon on it(which I don't eat) and instead of sending it back to be remade and starve, I gave it to my bf but still didn't feel as satisfied with it as I hoped to be. It was decent because I like eggs but I feel it was missing something. Maybe a variation in bite. The texture was a-okay, not too soggy but lacking in flavor. I would've made it with onions and fresh green bell peppers for a little more interest. (I make mean a frittata btw!) the home fries were absolutely delicious though! It was an Eagles game day and everyone and their moms had their Eagles pride on! It was funny seeing a whole lot of green that wasn't the Jets.

49416,29473,365,2014-04-14,"I've been on a quest to try every pho place in the area, and especially given the fantastic Yelp reviews, this was on my list. First impression was that it's a very ""hole in the wall,"" family-owned kind of place. Finding parking at lunchtime on a Saturday was a nightmare, and the lot was almost too tiny to turn around in. We ended up parking across the street in the commuter lot. The menu is incredibly simple and is posted on the wall. (Certain items are only available on specific days.) I was a little turned off on the walk to our table because one of the restaurant employees was busy shredding a huge pile of raw meat at a table in plain sight of where we were seated (not wearing gloves or a hairnet, didn't seem incredibly sanitary, and I'm a vegetarian on top of all of that). But I've been to Chinatown restaurants plenty of times to know that appearances don't always represent how good the food is. The one type of pho they had on the wall-menu for Saturday was beef pho, and I asked if it could be made vegetarian (meat broth was fine with me as long as there wasn't chunks of meat in it). The waiter asked if I wanted extra vegetables, to which I agreed. When I got my non-beef pho, I realized ""extra vegetables"" actually meant three times the normal amount of onions. As someone who appreciates what onions do for flavor but is not a huge fan of them as a vegetable, I was really surprised that the waiter wouldn't have clarified what he meant. I didn't really complain but did my best to avoid eating most of them and added more of the complimentary bean sprouts than usual. But I have to say that the broth was delicious, and the portion sizes are very generous. Price-wise, I ended up paying a little over $7, which was fantastic and beat out every other place I've ever eaten pho. But I'm probably not going to return because of how plain my order ended up. I think this place could make their pho a lot healthier and please a lot of customers (for vegetarians and non-vegetarians like) by adding some broccoli, carrots, and snow peas like every other pho restaurant and realizing that ""extra vegetables"" doesn't mean copious amounts of onions.",3.0,1,0

While they have a wide-ranging Japanese menu (no sushi though), I've just tried the sake (they've got a ton to choose from) and the dessert so far.  Liked the sake.  Had the green tea truffles and strawberry truffles - both were very good.  I'd compare them more to bon-bons than traditional truffles since it was ice cream inside instead of nuts/caramel/wafer/etc.  The chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream and raspberry syrup was fantastic.  As Japanese as apple pie - I know - but still really good.

207210,127079,1843,2010-01-28,"Perhaps I should preface this review with the confession that I DESPISE Indian food. I was pushed into Masala Grill against my will (I believe that's illegal in 48 states), but begrudgingly agreed to give it a shot (mainly due to the sworn promise of HaloPub for dessert). To be frank, the decor left much to be desired. The sad attempt at ""romantic lighting"" was an epic fail, and seating next to the windows was met with constant molestation from the shutters. When I ate here, the place was relatively empty (which is fine). However, I did get annoyed when we were seated on the table CLOSEST to the kitchen, whilst all the other 10 tables were free and clear. Maybe they wanted to see my beautiful face. I'll definitely agree with past reviewers on Masala Grill's service. Our waiter wasn't the jolliest guy I've seen. He didn't crack a smile once and seemed inconvenienced whenever we asked him something. Maybe he was having a bad night? We started off with the appetizer sampler; a conglomeration of all sorts of fried items (aloo tikka, samosas, chicken/veggie pakoras, onion/spinach bhaiji). PASS. Save yourself a coronary and pass on this. $15 couldn't justify a pound of fried batter and a measly helping of veggies. Buuuut, my boyfriend did enjoy the samosa (the consistency, the flavor and flaky crust). . . . To each his own. Then for the entrees! As the waiter brought us our food sans a smile, I noticed that the portions looked awfully small. The food was served in authentic Indian-style dishware. Small dishware. I ordered makhani chicken (butter chicken, medium spicy category) and was suprrrrriiiiiiissssssingggllyy impressed! The chicken was tender, juicy and cooked in a peculiar thick, buttery, garlicky sauce. I'd give my entree alone 5 stars (maybe it was because I truly expected the worst). My boyfriend ordered the lamb vindaloo (american-spicy on the Masala Grill spiciness Richter scale), and enjoyed it. He found the lamb a tad too spicy and overcooked, but he did commend its unique flavor and freshness. The naan was great; you could tell that they made it fresh. The rice wasn't anything special - plain white basmati rice with fennel seeds - meh. We ordered Ras Malai for dessert, and I was thoroughly disappointed when the waiter handed us what appeared to be two small previously-frozen imposters of Ras Malai. The texture was grainy and hard; two thumbs down. Overall, my experience at Masala Grill was suprisingly not pitiful, but certainly not the best. Granted it's in Princeton, but Masala Grill's prices are ....pricey. I'd have to compromise a lot just to go back for their butter chicken.

It was perfect and they did not skimp on the cheese.My partner had the Onion soup with TONS and TONS of Gruyere on top. He raved about it. For main courses, he had a grilled trout over a warm spinach, walnut and lentil salad (with prefect crispy skin on the trout). I i had the perfectly-cooked bar steak.with the most perfect frites ever.  (They are famous for a reason.) For dessert we shared a tarte tatin, which was fell executed, but might be the least interesting part of the meal. The food was, indeed, excellently done classic French food. And generous portions of everything. But the service: Amazing. Our waitress was friendly, efficient and helpful. She answered any questions in a non-condescending way, and when i asked for a glass of wine, knowing i was getting the steak, she said ""that's a little bit lighter"" and explained the other reds by the glass and steered me to one that i liked quite a bit.  That was when i was really impressed. Water was refilled constantly, more bread offered... the waitress and her team worked as  well-oiled machine so that i never really noticed them, but i never had to ask for anything either.

After a day of training for a new job, my new co-workers and I ventured into the city with a free bottle of wine and free bottle of cider in hopes of finding a nice BYO to imbibe. We were told Kanella could be hit-or-miss, but we decided to give it a try. Right off the bat, everything was great. It had just opened so we had no problem getting a table sans-reservation, and the hostess gave us a table that was right by a window, albeit next to the kitchen, that gave us a nice place to people-watch. The decor itself is lovely. The banquets are lined with loose pillows, everything is done in light colors and the big windows really complete the whole comfy, relaxed vibe. Our server (I'm totally blanking on the name) was really nice, funny,  and efficient, despite him coming off as a bit spacey. Now, the best part is obviously the food. We shared 4 appetizers and 2 desserts for our meal which definitely left us super full. The dips of the day that we got to try were a garlic-potato, which was pleasantly chunky, a creamy yet somewhat savory lentil spread (my FAVORITE omg), and traditional baba ghanouj. The pita that it was served with was warm and obviously right off the grill. The dolmathes were also great and had an interesting spin in that it was served with raisins, giving it a sweet aspect. I wish it had come with 3 pieces, as opposed to two, but that's just a minor complain. We also had a pastry that had feta cheese and spinach, topped with honey (they even gave that honey thing that is used traditionally...the wooden one? You know? I have no idea what it's called), and it was divine. Our final appetizer was the grilled calamari, which I found delightful for being a bit overdone. Fortunately for us, the chef felt the same way and gave it to us on the house without us even making a comment on it. Finally, the deserts were AWESOME. We got a trio of ice cream which included mint, cardamom, and jasmine. The jasmine wasn't my deal, but the mint was AWESOME. It tasted like actual mint, as opposed to something you would buy out of a carton from Acme. The small pastry tasting I felt was slightly over-priced, but then again they managed to make semolina cake really good so I guess I can't really complain. While Kanella isn't the best Greek/Mediterranean food in the city, it's definitely up there. The chef obviously cares about the product that goes out and the staff seems to genuinely enjoy working there. It's great for all occasions, from business lunches to romantic dates.

Had penne vodka, a salad and chicken sorrentino. Loved the penne - it's in a thick cheesy not so vodka-y sauce. I don't normally order chicken but my husband and I share and he ordered the veal (more on this) and the other option was salmon, which we almost never order unless it's rare/sushi or end up regretting because it's dry. Thumbs up for the chicken! It wasn't dry yay! Now for that veal... Well it never came out! We weren't there when they brought the food so we both got the chicken. When I told them he ordered the veal they didn't just take the chicken and bring out veal. They showed me the slip... Table 51, 3 chicken 1 veal (which was already spoken for). Um okay he ordered the veal. Not one to argue so it is what it is...

When my steak came out, it was steaming and colorful from all the different vegetables that it consisted of. Then I went to the counter to look for a sauce that met my taste requirements.(they had about 10 different sauces). I decided to put the sweet chilli sauce mixed with the spicy dijon sauce on my steak. Every single bite made me take another look at the steak because i was in disbelief that what I was eating were actually vegetables. Best of all, after I ate the steak, I felt good about myself eating something that was as healthy, cheap, and tasteful as Lee's deli's vegetarian cheese steak was.

Not too heavy...not too light. Perfect. (Even the plain cheese pizza is just great--because of the crust, and the cheese he uses. Sauce just the right taste.) And the pepperoni grinder!

523524,240320,3095,2012-02-04,"Unacceptable service My wife and I went to the Spicy Green Bean in Glastonbury last Sunday morning for breakfast.  When we walked in we weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait.  There were no employees in the dining area so we walked to the back in the kitchen area and a waitress told us to seat ourselves and she would be right over.  It looked busy, but there were still tables available.  The waitress came over took our orders and served us some coffee.  This is where it all starts to go downhill. About 15 minutes later, the place filled up.  A table of 4 men came in, and 2 other couples filled the other 2 tables.   It seems that only 1 waitress was handling this whole room.  I did see an employee walk out the front door and across the street.  Another 15 minutes go by and we still didn't get our order.  I walked back to the kitchen where I saw some plates being prepared.  I thought they must be ours.  I was wrong.  The waitress brought that food for the table of 4 men and then brought out breakfast for one of the other couples. I called the waitress over to mention we were in the restaurant and ordered 20 minutes before these other 8 people came in.  The waitress informed me the kitchen ran out of eggs earlier and decided not to tell us.  That employee who walked out the front door was going out to buy some eggs.  I asked ""but how did that table of 4 men get their breakfast?""   The waitress said they are ""Friends of the owner and claimed they were in a hurry and the owner left, so.......I don't know what to say"". ""WHAAAAAT?"" They run out of eggs and have us sit there for almost 45 minutes without an explanation or apology.  On top of that they gave their ""friends"" priority service.  HOW RUDE!  They never even suggested making up for this in any way. We stood up and walked out and said we would never eat here again.  We would make sure all of our friends would know of this experience along with restaurant ratings sites on the web. We drove down the street to Ken's Corner restaurant and they were fantastic and sympathetic to our bad morning.  I heard patrons of that restaurant sharing similar stories of Spicy Green Bean's bad service.  Good to know I wasn't the only one.  After reading other bad reviews of Spicy Green Bean, I am surprised they are still in business.  It's only a matter of time when all this word of mouth will catch up with them.",1.0,-1,1

Once you enter, it has a very cozy feel. The hostess was incredibly polite and although we showed 30 minutes before they could seat us, the staff was incredibly polite and courteous to us. Once we sat down, my girlfriend and I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and Amish Farm Raised Chicken. While we waited, our incredibly kind and sweet waitress brought us complimentary Focaccia bread with butter that was made with sea salt and fresh honey. They then presented us with a complimentary pair of garlic toasted crackers with Chicken liver mousse. It was so delicious...it's hard to believe they were complimentary! Once we got our orders, my girlfriend and I were amazed at the aesthetic presentation of our food. Once we took our first bite, it was clear that this was going to be a great night.

Type of Eats: Take-out or Casual cafe Location: Busy Broadway, Elmhurst Ambiance: So far I would say the place is like any other small cafe but this is the only ""cafe"" that has plenty of tables and seating as well as wifi. I would say the ambiance is ""chill."" You can take your food to go or sit down and just enjoy your meal. You can bring in your laptop and find your corner to study or check emails or just relax with some friends. Broadway's not really a college student area so I would guess, eventually, their customers would be mostly local preteens/teens hanging out or local businessmen looking for a quick lunch spot. Flan: Asian-style... it has a light egg custard taste and it's not overwhelmingly sweet. Spanish flan is usually heavier - this is very easy to eat and not too filling. I like that it's not another dessert that kills my appetite from sugar overload but it's rather light on the taste.[B-] Iced Vietnamese Coffee with Coffee Jelly: They cater to the Bubble-Tea craze fad here in Elmhurst. I love Vietnamese coffee 'cause it's strong, flavorful and smooth. I know condensed milk is supposed to be sweet but I don't want the sweetness to overpower my coffee. Espresso wasn't as strong as I expected... maybe 'cause it was 100 degrees and the ice was melting... but this was just about right even with the added sweetness of the coffee jelly. [A-] the Classic Banh Mi: Definitely classic French style - crisp crust is important. It's not the most meat in a Banh Mi I've ever seen... very average but at least it wasn't soggy. Did the job - I'm happy. My fave places are in Brooklyn. [B-] Would I go back? Yes. Most Vietnamese places here are more like a dining/ family experience. All the cafes in this neighborhood are cramp, very on-the-go and very Taiwanese or Hong Kong. The Kung Fu Tea in Flushing is great but the one in Elmhurst is terrible. I don't understand why there's more syrup and powder than tea. The Quickly's a block down and across the street also used to put in too much sugar - it's gotten better but hardly any seating... This was a nice alternative. Entire Meal Cost: $9.25 Overall: Mediocre but enjoyable. I'm not saying this place is spectacular but it's good for what it is.

The food overall is good.  Nothing amazing--burgers are pretty average tasting, although you have to give PYT points for being creative.   I won't be going back to PYT- the service sucks and the burgers are nothing special.",2.0,-1,1

Honestly, $3.75 is the most I've ever paid for banh mi, but really, that's still a steal. For me, the bread is the absolute foundation and I immediately noted that the baguette was subpar. The quintessential baguette for banh mi needs to be warmly crisped on the outside, have just a touch of butter, and have a spongy softness on the inside. The bread was rather generic, dry, and .... American? The actual sandwich (#1) once I took a bite was better. The vegetables had lost some of their crispness. I did like the fact that the meat and pate were quite good, flavorful, moist with its inherent pork fat, and without overuse of mayonaise. Everything was in correct proportion. The overall portions were generous for banh mi and I killed it without much thought. So overall taste was okay, texture was disappointing.   The shredded pork (#3) was forgettable and the bi didn't taste particularly flavorful like it should. Needs more of a burnt-y, bitter, sesame quality. This sandwich's contents was kinda of an amalgamated flavor clump. Meh. I tossed the second half of this sandwich. I want to give this joint another shot. Perhaps the veggies are fresher in the morning. But I can't really excuse the bread .... eh. I'm not going out of my way for this.

Unfortunately, the wait staff ruined my experience and I don't plan on returning. The food was fine, but the service stinks. The first mistake was asking where the sea bass was from...I don't buy certain kinds of fish that are not sustainable because of overfishing practices (I would avoid Chilean sea bass, but would purchase black sea bass). Obviously this is not a question that is ever asked at Rita and Joe's. The busboy and the waiter were mocking my husband and I in plain sight, then the waiter came over to the table and told us the sea bass was from the sea. Thanks a lot for that information buddy. So we ordered basic food: stuffed mushrooms, house salad, baked ziti and side orders of meatballs. The sauce was not so good and tasted sweet like it was from a jar. The food was fine, but not anything to write home about. The second mistake was that the busboy interrupted us as we were ordering our entrée and insisted on taking my appetizer plate when I still had food on it. I told him I was still working on it, and he was annoying. He lacked follow through and didn't come over to take my plate after it was empty. The last straw was the busgirl who was spraying cleaner on the table next to us as we were eating. The spray was going in our direction and you could smell it and taste it as we were eating our dinner. I asked her to stop spraying while we were eating. She said sure, but still sprayed the chair seats. At that point I lost my appetite and didn't want to stay for dessert. A thoroughly disappointing dining experience and I won't be back.",2.0,1,0

After finishing dinner, I came away pretty surprised at how good the tapas dishes were! Graffiti is a very small restaurant and really only takes reservations. There are a handful of tables squeezed into this tiny piece of real estate. Anyone who arrives without a reservation will likely be turned away. All of the food on the menu is served tapas style so if you come with a few friends, you will probably only get 1 or 2 bites of each dish, unless you order multiples of it. I won't comment on every dish, but I found the dishes to be very creative. The style of cooking was definitely an asian fusion, with a bit of each culture taken into account on different dishes. I've also visited Mehta's other restaurant Mehtaphor, but it's not as highly touted as Graffiti. I did wish Graffiti was a bit bigger, but I guess that's what adds to the uniqueness of the dining experience here. Despite the small size of the restaurant, I loved the uniqueness of the dishes, variety of cultures blended into the food and all of the different flavors.

If you go during the day their prix fixe is less than $50 per person for five official courses (but it ended up being more like 7 courses including a couple gifts from chef). If you and your companion order different choices for each course and share, you end up tasting countless items. Their wine by the glass actually has a lot of relatively affordable (less than $20 or even $15) choices so you can get various glasses for the same price of a bottle. I recommend letting the waiter know your price range and desired number of glasses and having them choose the wine to match the courses.

For entrees, my friend got the Dancing Queen and Banana Tempura rolls and enjoyed.  I got a Chicken Tempura roll and Alaskan roll and requested the Alaskan roll to be cooked, like I always do.  Our server didn't mind fulfilling my request (some places flat out say ""no"").  Loved both my rolls.  The Chicken Tempura was freshly cooked - lightly battered chicken breast with, I believe, a panko crust.  The Alaskan roll was perfect and delicious.  Not too much rice on the rolls AND the rice stayed perfectly in tact when picking up your rolls with your chopsticks.  Last but not least, everything we ordered was truly pretty to look at. My friend and I have these dinners only once every other month, so when we see each other, we talk for hours.  Our server was super patient and did not bat an eyelash when we were the last patrons in the place.  We didn't realize everyone had left until it got really, really quiet lol.  We appreciated this so much since you know very well, other places are happy to let you know when it's time to go home.

(completely indiscernible to the taste).   An hour later, I'm feeling sick to my stomach.  I can only imagine the gooey mess of raw egg that the french toast must be.  My sister's frittata was ""uninspired"" and my and my bro-in-law's uovo modena (poached eggs with hollendaise sauce) and pork hash was tasty but ""nothing special and pretty hard to screw up.""  The tab for the three of us with coffee but no alcohol was $75 before tip.  The fam, who as I mention had eaten there before say two times was enough, this place is not worth returning to, no matter what hype or PR DeNiro has bought for it.

Prior to seating us she, in front of us, bawled out the  'assistant hostess' who actually performs the act of seating guests for not following her instructions in seating the prior party (apparently this prior party also balked when they were thrown in the back corner and the assistant hostess seated them elsewhere without first receiving permission from her royal bitchiness.)  Our waiter was nice but I should have known when he steered me away from the french toast that he was in on the hustle and that we would have been better off just about anywhere else.   Conclusion: go elsewhere.",1.0,-1,1

We generally start with a meat and cheese plate (a little pricy but good) and some focaccia, and maybe a salad to round things off.  That is already pretty feeling, but the pizza is good enough where you'll definitely be eating until you burst.  This is true wood burning oven pizza. As a matter of fact, that is the only thing they cook anything with -- the wood-buring oven. The pizza goes in for like a minute or so, and them comes out perfectly charred -- a little chewy (in a good way) with that nice burnt flavor on the end of the crust. The cheese and sauce are top notch too. Because the cheese has a lot of moisture in it you tend to get a soupier/wetter pizza, like Keste, but that is a type of pizza that a I really like. It turns into a big, delicious sauce and cheese mess that's darn good. If you're up for something a little different, try the calzone.  It has ricotta cheese, which seems to be atypical, but it gives the calzone a really unique flavor (ie, different from Roberta's etc).  Of course the calzone crust is the same as the wonderful pizza crust, so you really can't go wrong.

Brussel Sprouts - ohhh yaaaa My father had the duck, as is his custom. It was good, but I'm no canard-connoisseur. He was especially delighted by the charcoal flavor imparted on the meat.

Lombardi's pizza has a perfectly thin crust that is crispy on the exterior and chewy on the interior; well-balanced sauce; and generous toppings. I made a mistake by opting for meatballs because I found the meatballs to be a tad stale-tasting, so I would suggest crumbled Italian sausage instead if you're a carnivore. Prices are a tad steep, but that's predictable for a NYC pizzeria that boasts about being the first establishment, ever, of its kind. This pizza tastes excellent the morning after as well.

My wife sat at the table and were not attended to for about 10-15 minutes much to my dissapointment. Finally, a waitress came around to attend to us. She informed us that they were out of ice and bread however we were served warm water. How does a restaurant run out of ice and bread? I ordered a salmon dish with spinach and potatoes. The salmon was lacking flavor as were the potatoes. The spinach was disappointing. The place itself needs to be maintained better. There were tissues, napkins and straw papers scattered throught the dining room floor. The bathroom was horrendous. If they aren't maintaining the floor and the bathroom in a cleanly manner which is visible to customers what about the cleanliness of the kitchen? The signs were there and I should have gone with my gut and left. Dirty floor, staff members visibly bickering with each other and a manager foldking napkins instead of attending to a restaurant.

This place is small. Can only seat about 20-25 people at a time. You will get seated faster, if you have a small group. I ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu pork, and for an extra $3.50 got 2 smoked salmon onigilly (rice balls). Sitting at the counter, I got to watch the 2 guys behind the counter preparing all the food. There is no kitchen. Just 2 guys that probably speak very little english making your food right there. I was very amused by them singing to the american hip hop music they had playing in the background. What is also amazing is how they prepare the pork. Thin slices that they char with with a small torch, right before it is served to you. The broth in my ramen was delicious. I drank ever last drop. The pork was so flavorful, I almost wish I ordered more. The onigilly was ok. Not enough salmon in it for my liking. The reason why I only gave them 4 stars is because the noodles were a little bit more al dente then my liking. I'm sure if i just let it sit in my bowl of steaming hot broth a few minutes, it would have been fine, but I ate that ramen so fast, it didn't have a chance.

I would recommend it to others for sure, but I'd never say it was the best or a must-eat-there kinda place.  We ordered bruchetta & mussels for appetizers (both really good), followed by two small pasta dishes (I had whatever pasta comes with zucchini.. it was really mellow/light and an excellent small portion, just enough to get me ready for the main course. He ordered something with a red sauce... it was clearly a little bit forgettable). We had chicken & tilapia for entrees... both very good but not excellent. They were cooked well and neither was dry but they both had this same tangy flavor.. maybe it was a similar sauce? Too much tangy-ness, anyway, not enough of a variety of tastes.

The restaurant was located in the South of Williamsburg, right across the Williamsburg bridge. The atmosphere was perfect- intimate, romantic, and casual. There was an open kitchen (fragrant aromas traveling around) , indoor seating, and an indoor garden patio. We were seated in the indoor garden patio, which was decorated with shimmering lights. Our waitress was very friendly and explicitly explained what each of the mouth-watering items on the menu entailed. We ordered several of the tapas, the local mozzarella with pomegranate and yogurt, crispy pork belly, seared scallops with butternut squash, crispy glazed confit wings,sweet potato fries with sliders and the amazing bacon donuts. Let's say all these dishes are to die for. The mozzarella infused with pomegranate and yogurt was a delicious twist on the conventional fruit and cheese dish, the seared scallops were tender and greatly accompanied by the sweet and subtle tastes of the squash. My boyfriend had the bacon donuts as his birthday cake. He loves bacon, so the thought of bacon and donuts harmoniously concocted into what's called the bacon donut was exciting enough. I recommend that those who are heavier eaters should eat something before or you might be still hungry. We ordered around 7 dishes and we still left a bit hungry, hence unless you're willing to pay the price, be prepared. It is on the expensive side, tapas ranging up to $17.

This tourist trap is not exactly authentic but what can you expect in the heart of the theater district? Not good pizza, that's for sure.

I decided to come back later in the day to sample this four star pizza. Good things come to those who wait. Nope. Not here. I ordered a regular cheese slice, which they had to toss back into the oven. I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something not right about the cheese quality. It didn't really taste like mozzarella at all but rather a cheaper substitute. Que lastima! I'm not surprised. One thing tourists may not like is that ample seating, bathrooms, and climate control are pretty much non-existent in this tiny place.

The side of spinach (or swamp goop)  tasted like I swallowed an entire pepper shaker. For dessert, I chose the chocolate ""lava"" cake which was more like an overcooked chocolate cookie. It was a mystery to all of us where the ""lava"" went. As previously mentioned by other reviewers, the owner was more concerned about his scarf rather than the satisfaction of his customers.

I ordered the chicken biscuit, hush puppies, and a mimosa.  My friend ordered fried chicken with mac & cheese and beer. The chicken biscuit was divine, mostly due to the generous amounts of honey-butter and hot sauce that dressed the sandwich.  I am a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but the honey butter made everything better.  The hush puppies were good, but the dipping sauce--a tartar  sauce, I think--was kind of carelessly splattered in one corner of the greasy basket instead of having its own dish, and the hushpuppies were kind of plain without it.  (They made an amazing drunk leftover later though).   I order the smores pie for dessert.  The taste was great, but it was very dense and very cold--as if it had just come out of the back of the fridge.  I would have enjoyed it much more if it had been room temperature or warmed up. Lastly, our server seemed very out of it.  She took our orders kind of lazily.  When she took the order of some people next to us, she sat down at the table with them to take the order.  Then she disappeared for a while and another server brought us our food and, later, the check.  Then our original server came back and gave us the check a second time.  Then we got up to pay at the register, and she came and gave us the check a third time.  Not sure what was going on with her but she seemed like she was either sick or high.   Overall, the food was pretty good but I think they need to focus a little bit more on service and presentation.",3.0,-1,1

We were hungry and not really there for cocktails. After a while I stopped someone to ask for a menu. We ordered wine with dinner. We went with the chef's meal for $65 per person.

It's not a basket but a presented plate with interesting butters like birch beer butter with the pumpernickel. Also excellent was the smoked pumpkin tortelloni. I could have curled up and purred. The food presentation on our appetizer and my companion's main course were questionable. The seafood salad looked like a picked over mess. Her  pork dish looked like an unappetizing heap of pink pork meat. She is pregnant so they were gracious and offered her the steak. Another highlight of excellence. Though another thing that was odd was when she voiced concern about the pork, they talked to us about how the creativity and inventive favors aren't for everyone. I was a little offended. We are all very experienced foodies. Bad presentation is bad. The skate was good, the Bronzino en croute was good though a little too heavy on the tarragon. And they brought out a kale salad so we had something to pick on while the late steak was served. It was nice though a little too heavy on the vinegar. Desserts? Also mixed. The chocolate cake and spicy fig ice cream was good. The apple pie was like potpourri. And the grape thing was like a melted grape Popsicle. The end thoughts are, I would go again for the pastas and a salad, but no chefs tasting. Way too much food that was also too random in taste and too expensive.   I miss Noble.",2.0,1,0

The idea of american tapas was very interesting. Between four people we had 10 dishes, even though the waiter recommended 4 for each person. I truly enjoyed how each dish came out by itself so that you could truly experience each dish at your own pace. I was not as impressed with some dishes as some others were (fondue, lobster cappuccino). But everything was interesting and quite enjoyable. Though it was a good thing they kept refllling the water glasses because the dished could be a bit salty. My palatte was really tired towards the end, but thats a good thing!

The only detractor was the proximity of other patrons. For example, when my meal was delivered my neighbor remarked on how good it looked. Friendly, yes, but not what I was hoping for during an intimate evening. If your goal is an intimate environment, I would look elsewhere. We ordered the fig pizza which was delicious. I read a previous review saying the pizza was sparsely topped, but I thought it still delivered on flavor. We shared an app of octopus which was very good and probably the best I've had in Philadelphia. For my main course, I ordered the roast suckling pig. It was very tender and juicy. On the whole the food was very good and what you would expect given the prices which are little on the pricier side. Another plus was the service. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in the mood for something a little different and isn't afraid of going to north Philly to get it.",4.0,-1,1
591716,260597,4906,2014-08-17,"The food here is definitely fresh and delicious and while the service could have been better, it wasn't really bad.  We had to signal for the server's attention a bit, rather than being approached but when we signaled, the response was immediate. But what gives this place just two stars is that they don't turn on the AC.  I'm sorry, it's the dead of summer in NYC, the AC needs to be on.  They had the front windows open with two small fans on the sill blowing in.  The fans are the type you'd use at home.  All that did was blow the hot air into the restaurant and not even much of it.  There was another fan of the same type in the back facing the front.  If they are trying to save money by not using AC then they should at least have ceiling fans installed.  It was not even the hottest of evenings when we were there and it was still extremely uncomfortable.  Really blows the experience. We won't go back until the weather cools or perhaps if the front windows are closed we might step in to see if AC is on then.  The place only has the one exposure, the front, so there's no cross breeze.  Dog and Duck and Claret also open their windows and don't always use AC but at least they both have double exposures so if there's any breeze at all, it will be a bit better.  But even those places close up and run AC when it's very hot and humid. It's a shame about the heat because otherwise Venturo really is a unique little spot in the 'hood, nicer than most.  But being comfortable and not feeling like you're about to pass out in the NYC summer should be a no brainer.",2.0,-1,1

75728,60237,682,2011-10-21,"Best of Philly is well deserved.  I'm going to cut right to the chase about other people's misdealings with this place as unfairly over-assessed.  Just because they can't take a credit card and the wait is a little long, doesn't mean the food, the staff, or the charm should be cast in a sub-4-star light. As some folks have very accurately described, weekends are tough on the hurried or ravenously hungry.  A 30-45 minute wait to sit at a table is perfectly possible, but in my opinion the spoils are worth the journey.  I suppose some folks show up without a smart phone, or without interesting enough company  to pass a short wait, and then flame the reviews without consideration for what it is that makes this place Philly's Best breakfast/brunch spot. The regular menu contains all your breakfast classics and a regular selection of frittata's that are loaded with fresh ingredients (and quite an untaking for even the hungriest patron).  The ketchup is a house recipe, so be sure to order a side of potatoes so you have something to put it on.  The biscuits and jam are a mainstay and we generally order 1 or 2 to go for the following morning. The specials change quite often, so its always worth swinging by to see what's new.  This past weekend I jumped on the Mango and Pineapple Belgian waffle with homemade  whip cream; it didn't even need syrup. A+ Jenny, who is the manager and responsible for most of the menu and specials assured me upon my request that she'd bring back the Pumpkin Brulee French Toast in the coming weeks.  I hadn't known the meaning of a good breakfast until I had it last year. Steak and Eggs is a good fall-back and their stuffed pancakes are heavenly.  The coffee is certainly worth a third cup ;) The lengthy wait is a function of the quality of the food.  The wait represents continued excellence and a very loyal and satisfied clientelle.",5.0,1,0

We were excited to have the cafe come to the neighborhood, and I think they will be a great new addition to the street. The waitstaff was nice and helpful. However, it was initially a little confusing to figure out how to place an order (the waiters bring your food out to your table after you order it at the counter). There is some room for improvement particularly with some of the dishes. Breakfast foods are either hit or miss. My husband's french toast was okay but not fantastic. I had an omelet, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't more seasoned and flavorful.

Service was friendly but a tad slow; we were looking for our server several times throughout the meal. One other small complaint, partially our fault, was bringing all the food we ordered (apps and entrees) out at the same time. I guess we should have specified bring the first round of food and then the second. The beer and bacon flight should be tried. The beers were a diverse tasty mix and the bacon was outstanding (peppercorn, maple, applewood smoked and jalapeno). It seems everyone gets a different experience with how the bacon is served, but ours at least was cooked perfectly (chewy-crisp - not burnt-crisp if you know what I mean). Burger sliders were delicious, as were special pork belly buns. Mussels were a special app and were kind of a miss (no bacon and they were cold when we finally got a chance to dig in). Not assertively seasoned enough. Thumbs up on the bacon, lobster mac n cheese (could have been a little more gooey for my tastes, but still solid). Corn arepa with bacon and guac was on point, as was the loaded bacon lobster roll. Bacon steak and sausage was not as much of a hit. The desserts were interesting -- a small sundae in a mason jar with bacon infused whipped cream and bread pudding with ice cream and bacon peanut brittle. I'll be back because it is a fun menu and a good overall vibe. If they can kick up the service a notch and maybe tighten up a couple of dishes, they'll move a star for sure. Definitely try it out and make up your own mind. Only 36 2 and 1 star reviews out of 221 - the odds are in your favor :)",3.0,1,0

When in season, the fresh tomato pie with pesto is KILLER!  Best white clam in CT hands down.  Pane cotta is the way I like it, crisp not soggy.

Had I not been hungover or in heels, I would have run to Jimmy's Diner after my man showed me the menu. Eggy, cheesey, bacony cornbready goodness is all my body needed!! But alas, a 45 minute wait is not an option when you're on the verge of puking and/or death. So we brunched nearby, but I could not get visions of grits and tater tots out of my head. I was GOING to get Jimmy's Diner, and I was going to get it soon. As in, the following weekend. Last night I had fantasies of dragging my beau to Meatball Shop at 2AM, but NO. I stayed strong. And woke promptly at 9AM and tossed and turned until I was sure he was (slightly) awake and (somewhat) conscious before I asked, ""Do youuuuu wanna go to Jimmy's Diner or get breakfast?"" ""Yeah,"" he muttered. VICTORY. I allowed about 30 minutes more of spoonage before announcing it was time to eat and rolled out of bed. Luckily, with the gross weather the wait was only five minutes, but now having experienced the gloriousness of their breakfast bowls, I will happily shrivel to death waiting for a table the next time I'm hungover. Once seated, after confirming with the waitress that the cornbread was not gluten-free, I opted for the grits and eggs bowl per the waitress's recommendation while my man went with chicken and waffles. We didn't have any issues with the server- she was as attentive as can be expected at a busy diner and perfectly pleasant. And then our food arrived, and angel's sang and then I realized I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ASK FOR HOT SAUCE, THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF FRANK'S SITTING ON THE TABLE ALREADY and there were rainbows and dolphins. Thank god I'm g-free, otherwise I would've pounded into those chicken and waffles because they were so goddamn beautiful. And delicious, apparently. Naturally, I subbed bacon for the sausage in my own breakfast bowl, and it was a bowl of heaven, a heaven I will dream of until I have it again. It didn't need Frank's, but I doused each bite and it was breakfast ecstasy. It was beautiful. It was magic. Next time, I'm going for the pulled pork hash.

The space is intriguing, peaceful, and lovely - tables, chairs and art from Material Culture create a unique and charming room.  Combined with the high ceilings, there is an Old World feel. And the food is special, the kind that delights your palate while making your body happy with all the goodness it's getting.  I had the San Francisco Cobb salad once, and the Mezze Plate another time (so much more than just a hummus plate!), both of which I've tried all over, and these were probably the best ever. Their gluten-free bread is also the best I've tried.

391735,198496,3314,2011-10-24,"Don't really understand what all the hype is about this place. Stopped by here for dinner with the gf and that was my first mistake.  Definitely not a good place to go if you want to have a conversation over a meal.  The seating is cramped and the acoustics leave you shouting across the table.  The decor is interesting, as they have a whole chair, desk and lamp hanging on the ceiling as if the whole room had been turned upside down.  Usually that's a warning in my book when restaurants try to get clever with the atmosphere instead of focusing on the food.  Given the homey feel and word of mouth, I was hoping the food would change my mind.   First the appetizers.  We ordered Arancini Di Carne (Rice balls) and the Mozzarella Pizzaiola and my were they disappointing.  The Rice balls were flavorless and crumbled on impact - its impossible to pick them up with a fork.  There wasn't much meat inside and the sauce around it added nothing but an oily mess.  The mozzarella fared a tad better, but was ultimately nothing to write home about. On to the main course, I ordered the Michele pizza while the gf ordered the special seafood pasta entree of the day.  Since I don't eat much seafood I can't comment much on the dish, but the gf was unimpressed.  My pizza was similarly blah.  I'd gotten rave reviews from friends about the pizza and was excited to try it, but it was altogether ho-hum.  When it came out, the heat of pizza along with the toppings I chose left the center of the pie very moist and flimsy.  It tasted okay, but the mushy-ness of the first bite wasn't too pleasant. The place gets packed, so you need to continually flag down your waiter.  We had to wait for menus, utensils, the bill, etc. and my water glass was continually empty.  -1 star.  So much for the hype - there are better options out there!",2.0,-1,1

When I asked when is the best time to come without too much of a wait, he suggested 7pm. So, when my date and I arrived at 6:50p, it was quite a surprise to be given the time wait of '1 hr and 45 minutes'. We were shocked! They took my number & we decided to go somewhere else to have an appetizer while waiting for our reservation. As the time got closer, nobody called us.  I called the number on their website several times, it rang but went to an annoying fax machine. So we just decided to walk over & see about our table--almost two hours later. When we arrived, our table still wasn't ready, in fact, it the hostess quoted us an additional 25 minutes. And when I told her their business phone  number went straight to their fax machine, she chucked a little to herself and said 'really, I didn't know it did that....are you sure your calling the right number'. Finally, after all that, we decided to go somewhere else. I would love to try this place eventually.... a little more honesty would be appreciated though.",1.0,-1,1

I got the Mekanek Egg Manouche (forgive me if I spelled it wrong) and it resembled a pizza but with lamb pieces and three eggs on top.

On the other hand, the lamb dip and lamb shank that my parents ordered felt easier on the mouth and stomach. They were delicious! The hummus and Batata Harra were pretty scrumptious as well but I couldn't handle the Rosti. It was too hard, which made it nearly impossible to eat.

The staff at the door were nice and polite and directed me to the bar where I ordered a Margarita while waiting for my order.  I received my drink and it wasn't bad. In fact, my food came out rather quickly and I decided to have another margarita -- that's when things took a turn for the worst. One of 2 bartenders - her name was ""Jaz"" made my drink, and after having finished my drink-- at least 10 minutes passed and no one bothered to come by to ask how was my drink, suggest another, or offer desert.  Neither bartender did.  If you're sitting at the bar, one would think, they would be more attentive to ensure drinks were filled. -- Boy was I wrong for thinking such a thing! So I waited until I could catch ""jaz"" walking by, and I sated,,, ""Miss, I I've been waiting here for at least 10-15 minutes after my drink was finished, and no one came by to ask me if I wanted another or anything.""  ""Jaz"" didn't say a word, she reached over, grabbed my signed check, balled it up and stormed away. I mean, she actually STORMED away, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD!  She moved from behind the bar and as she went through the kitchen door,,, stated to me, ""I don't like how you're treating me!""  (Since when did wanting a bartender to ask a patron for another drink equal mistreatment?) It gets better -- I asked for the manager.  Her name is Erin and , I explained what happened and simply asked for an apology from her bartender....  Her reply to me was,,, ""let's just call it a draw.""  What??  Erin attempted to apologize and I interjected... ""it was not your fault, and the apology should come from her (Jaz)"". I have never seen a bartender or server IN ANY RESTAURANT act like that, when a request for a  second drink was overlooked. Erin stated that she didn't feel comfortable asking ""jaz"" to apologize.  I'm thinking, WHAT??!! After I mentioned to her, that's a manager, she must know that she has an obligation to try to find out what happened, by getting both sides of the story -- But that was not an option with Erin. I then  asked Erin, what would she have done if ""Jaz"" threw a glass and hit me with it?"" Erin told me, she would only reprimand her.  That was a very good indication to me that ,,customers visiting and having a small problem at the Mexicali, should not feel confident that management will at least attempt to get both sides of a conflict... and settle the matter professionally and equitably.  Poor training of employees and and even worse managerial skills are running rampat from these two employees at the Mexicali. Bottom Line, I returned my  food, asked for my money back ,and recommend that patrons choose another place that knows how to treat their customers. The bartender, could have simply said"" I didn't realize you needed another drink, what can I get you?"" Instead of making a dramatic scene like a SPOILED BRAT and having her manager ""friend"" protect her when she was clearly out of order and overreacted to a simple customer comment/request. To make matters worst, I asked for the restaurant's website to provide some feedback..  They have the small ""contact us"" envelope on the main page, but if you ""click"" on it, it won't forward you to any page to leave comments. In fact, it says, the email function doesn't work.  (I'm not surprised) If the owner Nick reads this.... I hear you only come in on Thursdays.... Nick, you may want to read Yelp more often -- Or why not drive by or visit sometime to see in-person your restaurant staff chase customers away. Mexicali Grill and Cantina -- NEVER AGAIN!",1.0,-1,1

I ordered the sausage, pasta and broccoli rabe.  My wife ordered the Vodka rigatoni. Prior to the ""food"" being delivered, ""bread"" was placed before us.  In all my days of dining out I have never been presented with such an  carb loaded abomination, referred to as ""bread""  A stale hamburger bun would be far superior.  I asked my wife, is it me or does this ""bread"" have the texture and taste of 6 week old manure? She agreed and we shoved the ""bread"" to the far end of the table.   After about 15 minutes the food arrived.  After tasting the tasteless broccoli rabe, combined with what appeared to be steamed sausage of the lowest caliber, I began to eat the over done pasta.  All and all a total waste of time.  I reached over to sample what my wife had before her.  I looked like vodka rigatoni but tasted like Campbell's tomato soup with milk added instead of water.  I could not believe my eyes and taste buds.  It tasted EXACTLY like campbell's soup poured over pasta.  And I thought Honey Boo Boo's ketchup over pasta was insane.

182428,10865,1621,2011-08-22,"The sole reason I've heard of/tried this place is because of my $50 eversave certificate that I got for a pretty small amount of money. By reading the other reviews for this place it seems to be a trend. Even though the certificate said you couldn't use it with any other specials like happy hour, it seemed that other people had done it so I decided to give it a try. I took a friend out for a birthday/new job celebration and we arrived around 6 to sit outside. The booths are deep as other people pointed out. This was awkward bc you feel very far away from the table and if you scooch closer then it's hard to get out. We ordered two glasses of wine to start (they have a red, white, rose and sparkling for $5 during hh) and the pork nachos off the $5 snack menu. The wine was delicious  but the nachos not so much. When it came out, it was three separate chips, each with some pulled pork and sour cream on top, but no cheese! What kind of nachos don't have cheese?! They also listed sriracha, which was decoratively swiped onto the plate, but it was very difficult to get this on the nacho itself.  They were just ok and for $5 I expected more. Since our cheese craving was not satisfied we ordered the cheese plate (5 cheeses for $20). I thought the price was once again a little steep for the amount of cheese you got, but it was served with candied cashews, sliced apple, toasted bread, and this amazing (strawberry rhubarb?) jam. We ordered two glasses of sparking to go with the cheese and it was once again very good for the price. For dessert we got the fried oreos (3)  with cookies n cream ice cream. I thought they were ok, and my friend really liked them. I think I just prefer my oreos plain. Even though the food was just so so, our waitress was wonderful and attentive. My total bill came to about $51, so I only owed $1 plus tip!

Back then they had one small room with a door that let all the elements in. You could get a table any night of the week with no wait. And their pizzas cost about ten bucks. Today it's always jam packed in all of their many rooms and a pizza with one or two toppings on it is going to cost more like $35. But the pizza itself tastes the same. This is the real thing, folks - don't let anyone tell you different. If you don't like Lombardi's, you don't like New York pizza - simple as that. Lombardi's defined it in the first place. Coal oven for that crispy yet soft mouth feel and charcoal flavor, sliced mozzarella (never accept grated mozzarella!), fresh ingredients, and a sauce that's to die for. Seriously, it is the sauce that really sets Lombardi's apart, because it's the one part of a pizza most pizzerias completely ignore. It's Grimaldi's' biggest failing, for example - lots of people swear Grimaldi's is better but their sauce is like water. Lombardi's' sauce is just bursting with fresh tomato flavor. I'm dinging them one star because no way any pizza should ever cost $35, and the price increase from just a few years ago cannot be justified. It makes it basically impossible for real New Yorkers to consider Lombardi's their go-to pizzeria. There are so many pizza places at less than half the price that are 80% as good, the value proposition just isn't there. But I still go once in a while for a real treat.",4.0,1,0

I was amazed at how fast my food came out, seemed like it was less than 5 minutes. Not only was it served fast but it was fresh out of the fryer. - The collard Greens were surprisingly solid. They were cooked perfectly.. Not under or over cooked. The flavor was good, could have used a little more salt or perhaps more pork in the pot when they boil it but they are defiantly working with something when it comes to their greens. - The Chicken exceeded every expectation I had. Simply put, PERFECTION. I repeat, this chicken was perfect. The skin was so crisp you can hear the crunch from 3 tables away and the inside was surprisingly moist. Taste wise it was like the skin and the inside of the chicken had two unique flavors. The skin was perfectly seasoned, the salt was JUST right. This chicken is a 10 in the flavor and texture department.  Arguably the best fried chicken I've had in any restaurant, Samantha's in bed stuy is the only competition. -The biscuit was also good. The honey butter they offer goes perfectly with it. I Probably wouldn't come here with out getting a biscuit. Overall Pies n thighs is a solid 4 to 4.5.

Still, she's cute and she knew what she was getting herself into by coming to this Williamsburg eatery near an apartment I had when I was 24. So we went. This neighborhood has come up in the world in the past eight years, though I kind of miss the crack dealers. There's no sign on the door, so when you walk into Rye and see the speakeasy design that is out-of-control in New York City now, you breathe a bored sigh. Then you look at the drink list and its a carbon copy of every other signless speakeasy style bar in Williamsburg and you wonder why you braved the L train-- and the hairstyles and attitude found on it-- to come to Rye. The beet salad was tasty, the endive salad was original and refreshing (even if the server pronounced it en-dive rather than ahn-deev as they would across the river and wide cultural divide), and the mushroom lasagna was quite filling, though they could have lightened up on the ricotta. We may have ordered more, but that was the extent of every vegetarian dish on the menu. My companion's ""Old Fashioned"" was a smokey/citrusy whiskey beverage, much like many other similarly named drinks I've had in Brooklyn in the past 5 years. My Sangiovese was quite tasty, though any wine snob with a half a brain knows to air out the red before serving it. Duh, guys. Where do you think we are, Queens?",3.0,1,0

Furthermore, when one of the dishes is paella, then 6 minutes is entirely unacceptable. The ""sweet & green plantains"" were fried plantain chips that were neither sweet or even warm. The Camarones were sweet shrimp on top of a nasty tasting, seemingly asian inspired avocado ""salad."" I love avocado, but this was bordering on disgusting. The Paella tasted like Uncle Ben's rice that seafood was thrown on top of at the end. The rice had no flavor at all from the seafood, no toasted bottom, and THE SEAFOOD WAS COLD. You can't even pretend the seafood was cooked in the rice if it's COLD!

I had high hopes for Westville as it seemed like they had a lot of veggie options,  but I had such an awful eating experience when i ordered two weekends ago.  They disappointed in so many way. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich (I said no bacon, as it's an option available for add-on) and also ordered 4 market sides.   The food arrived.  I bit into the grilled cheese sandwich and immediately knew something was wrong.  I tasted bacon.  I took a closer look, opened the sandwich and found pink pieces of meat in my sandwich.   At this point, I called Westville and told the person on the phone what had happened.  He tried to convince me that what i was tasting was gouda and that it was impossible for their to be smaller pieces of bacon in my sandwich because they only used GIANT pieces.  I told him that i knew what gouda tasted like and that what i was tasting was definitely pork and that i could see it!  He then passed the phone to a haughty English man who continued to try to make excuses as to why there couldn't possibly be bacon in my sandwich.  He asked me to describe what i saw in my sandwich in as much detail as possible.  I was becomingly increasingly irked, but described it to him. ""Pink, brown, wavy lines, used to have a snout.""  He asked if he could send someone to pick up the sandwich so that his chef could inspect it (seriously?).  But i was in a rush (which was why i ordered in the first place), was heading out of my apartment and did not have time to partake in a sandwich autopsy.  He asked me what i wanted to do then.  I said that I didn't want to pay for the grilled cheese since I couldn't eat it.  He said he ""would discount it.""  I wasn't sure exactly what the meant, but as i was in a rush, i didn't have time to argue. I chucked the sandwich and left. When i got back to my apartment later in the evening, I decided to try the sides.  They were ok pretty bland but eatable...until i bit into something hard! I pulled this weird thing out of my mouth and ""ta-da"" it was a PIECE OF METAL!  It was in the kale and i looked like it had melted plastic around it.  Maybe metal adds a certain je nais se quoi to the preparation of kale.  As a commoner, I am unacquainted with this exotic practice.  I did not call them again for fear of being told that I must be mistaken -  ""Oh no, madam, what you thought was metal was actually the Kale's penis.""

You can get a cheeseburger (with Pepsi, of course, no Coke), or gyro, eggs over easy or baklava. I don't think any of the wait staff aren't related somehow to Gus and his family, but the result is solid service. What would I recommend? Hearty fare.

203249,125255,1812,2013-05-08,"Wedding Reception Catered with Spot Burgers The SpOt truck (along with Pitruco Pizza) catered my wife and my wedding party at our home near Media, PA last weekend.  We and our 150 or so guests could not have been happier with SpOt.  Josh's gourmet burgers and hand made hotdogs were simply amazing and most guests went back for two, if only to try a different kind.  There are plenty of reviews on here about how great the burgers and hotdogs are. My purpose is to recommend SpOt for private events.     My wife and I first joked about having food trucks cater our wedding after looking at all sorts of caterers, food ideas, and prices and not liking any of them.  We didn't even know if Philly trucks would do private events when we googled ""food truck catering Philadelphia.""  We quickly found Josh at SpOt and came to a price (very reasonable), time, and options for burgers, hotdogs and sides over a few easy emails.  SpOt was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  And when Saturday arrived, Josh got to our party ahead of schedule, set up his truck in our yard, and immediately got to work. SpOt and Pitruco Pizza easily handled the 150 or so guests who raved about the food.  Together, they could have served 250 without a problem.  People loved the burgers and dogs.  The trucks enabled guests to get up and mix more than they would have otherwise.  Our guests had more fun becuase of the trucks.   While not black tie, this was not a casual event and there were very few children.  Our guests were in suits or jackets.  Yet SpOT and Pitruco were a perfect fit.  They were professional, courteous and skilled.  Guests (especially those from out of town) said things like: ""Those people are serious about their food"", ""Josh is a true chef"" and ""This is so much better than a regular caterer"".     Thanks again for helping us make Saturday a great day!  I hope that you found many new customers among our guests.  We are already thinking about another party with SpOt this summer or next year.

Sicilian (top-rate sicilian, stronger tomato presence than the other pies) 3. Crab (cheese buries crab flavor; stiff on recent tasting; still OK, but only less-than-essential pie they make) Look.

There's no seating, but when the weather's nice, who cares? Find a bench (there are plenty), or take your lunch somewhere else (umbrellas outside of Panera, maybe).

The salmon quality isn't superb but you get what you pay for I guess. I'm from London, Ontario and I'm still looking for a sushi place here that can match the level of Gozen.

For New York, and Chelsea in particular, the pricing was decent and the portions were more than satisfactory. There are no reservations needed for lunch. The staff seated me and despite my friend getting lost and turning up 40 minutes later they never pressured me to order anything or bothered me much at all. I just had one drink while I waited. The staff was very friendly which is something I find is missing at a lot of places in NYC these days. You never felt ignored but you never felt smothered either. The only real downside to the place was it was a tad loud but it didn't interfere with having a conversation at normal volume at your table. Overall the place was nicely decorated and with the open doors and outdoor seating it was very light. Now, onto the food. I heard the mac and cheese was unmissable and when I realized they had three kinds (Chedder and Fontina, Smoked Gouda and Bacon and Truffle Oil) I was excited to see they had the ""Mac Attack!"" which was a sample of all three. There was enough to share for the two of us but I could have eaten it all myself it was so good. If you only pick one I recommend the Truffle Oil. After this I had the Watermelon Salad and my friend had the Shaved Artichoke Salad. Even though they were not an ""Entree Salad"" they were more than happy to size them up for an entree. They also added chicken breast to my friends with no problem and only a very small additional cost. For dessert we split the Deep Fried Oreos and Peanut Butter Cheesecake Pops. Both were great and again in fairly large portions yet not too filling. The end cost for two of us ordering an appetizer, two salads sized up to entrees and two desserts came to a little under 100 bucks. Depending on what you order I would say it's great for a quick lunch out or taking someone special someWHERE special. Will definitely go again.",4.0,-1,1

I had a glass of their pino grigio house wine (OK, nothing to rave over), and hubby had his standard Bombay Saphire + Gin.  (We're not tequila lovers!).  The chips + salsa that are complimentary are excellent.  You actually don't need to order an appetizer, but we did.  I don't recall the name of it, but it was a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken and cheese and covered in a red sauce.   It wasn't that good (it wasn't terrible either), but I think next time I'll go with the quacamoles!~ I had the ""Camarones Rellenus"" which are large shrimp stuffed with mexican cheese and wrapped in bacon.  They were done perfectly and were served piping hot with a side of rice and veggies.  The dish was very good and well-prepared, my only suggestion would be to serve a sauce with the shrimp as they needed a little extra ""somethin'-somethin"" that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Hubby had a special, which was grilled shrimp, served with crab-stuffed calamari in some kind of sauce with the side of rice.  He liked the taste of the dish, but said it wasn't served hot enough. We ended the meal with dessert - the crepes with french vanilla ice cream covered in a lucious carmel sauce.  Really delicious, but it was small - too small to share.  I hate a taste and sweet-tooth-hubby ate the bulk of it.  The coffee was excellent, smooth and robust without the tart aftertaste a strong coffee often has.

Then I put in my order for food and a drink with him, during which he seemed, to say the least, indifferent if not inconvenienced.  After the minimal attention he gave me and my order, he of course went back to his conversation with his pal. This all makes me think of the beer that they drink on Futurama, LoBrau, except it seems as though the bartender think they serve HiBrau beer, which I suppose is their right seeing as they serve $13 sausages with it.  The sausage by the way was ""aite.""  The pretzel bun was way too small.  It was good enough for the sausage, but had no hope of holding the accompanying toppings together with it for a complete bite.  I would have expected more for $13. Finally, I asked for the check and the bartender literally, tossed the card on the bar, again, indifferently.   When I expressed my thoughts on this place to my friends who met me there, she also seemed to think the waiters were rude and snobbish, but I wouldn't take her seriously - she's a bit nutty. Well, now that I think about it, maybe it was my fault.  Maybe I hesitated in my selection.  Maybe I didn't wear the right clothes.  Maybe I'm not his friend.  Maybe I wasn't grateful or humble enough.  Maybe I'm Chinese and he's not.  Maybe I reminded him of his... dad?   To be fair, we only had the two bartenders at our bar - there are two bars - which was nearly empty compared to the bar on the other side.  The other bartenders might be angels, which would explain why the other one was full.  It could be that it was just our bald, hipster glasses wearing bartender that was unsavory. Wow, this review is getting long.  Anyway, I'll leave with this: I'm giving it two stars because of it's saving grace, the atmosphere.  I'm also giving the other bartenders the benefit of the doubt, otherwise I'd give it one star and steer you guys clear of it.  I also didn't come here with any expectations.

So yay, for that since its always a disappointment  to get a weak mixed drink.  We started things off with a very tasty salad, I believe it was their house salad and it was very good. We followed it up with a small sized 1/2 margherita, 1/2 vodka pie.....very, very good.  Their pies are thin crust, and I think this was one of the thinnest i've come by, which I like because you get to really taste and enjoy the sause and toppings. They did not disappoint.  Both were good, but the vodka sauce half was definitely the winner for me.  The boyfriend, always hard to impress, thought the margherita was better.

They tried to be polite and apologized and explained to us that because they are a small operation, they were all 'booked"" for the night and they needed us to leave so that any of the arriving parties would have a table. I asked if this was a policy of theirs, and they never said ""yes"".  They only said that because they are small, people make reservations.  I recommended to them they should make that VERY CLEAR on their website--that reservations are highly recommended and that parties with reservations take priority over walk-ins NO MATTER WHAT.

For I our main courses she got the hibachi (shrimp and scallops), her ""strip and scallops"" was misheard.  That being said,  they're was plenty of food and she enjoyed it all.   I got the filet off of the ""from the kitchen"" menu.  It was slightly underdone ""I ordered med rare"", but not too rate for my taste.   It was a very tender and flavorful cut of meat.   I'm picky when it comes to steak and I would give that 5 stars. For dessert we were hoping for the mochi green tea and red bean ice cream but had to settle for the regular style of those flavors.   The green tea was pretty good but was more like a chocolate green tea.   The red bean was pretty chunky and did not have much sweetness to it.

I think it's better than Nom Nom Ramen and Yakitori Boy. I had the Tonkatsu Ramen. It wasn't the type of harder stringy noodle that I liked more. We also ordered the agedashi tofu and gyoza. The adegashi tofu was piping hot, pretty sure I burnt my tongue. I don't know whether they were trying to compensate for the hotness, but the gyoza was kind of cold. Taste for both appetizers wasn't flavorful enough for me. Other people in my party had the tonkatsu chashumen and shoyu.They thought it was okay for Philly.

Well I USED to dig it.  But David Change has changed the lunch menu for like the umpteenth time - going from 'make your own Ssam' (think Chipotle with Korean ingredients) to 'we make your Ssam' to 'no Ssam lunch deals'. As of my last visit, the lunch deals are around $12 and consist of (inc. a side and a soda): 1) Two steamed Berkshire pork buns -  These aren't very big but wow is the pork amazing.  Really, what are they doing to those pigs in the Berkshires? 2) Bahn Mi sandwich - Tasty but way too expensive and small for a Bahn Mi Sandwich.  Not recommended. 3) Rice bowl with Berkshire Pork, Organic Chicken, or Tofu - This is the recommended lunch deal as it packs the most value.  Good amount of delicious pork.  Tasty vegetables. The Ssams are still on the menu but are all north of $15 each (vs. the previous ~ $9).  I'm not sure if you can even get Berkshire Pork anymore.  Hangar Steak, Lemongrass Pork Sausage, and Organic Chicken are all I see on their online menu.  These Ssam wraps also include tasty Momofuku-selected fillings like pickled shitake and kimchi puree. There are some lunch menu additions - including some Country Ham sandwiches - but they are also north of $15.  Haven't tried them but imagine they are very tasty. For the 'sides', I've found the Kimchi Granny Smith Apples and the cold noodles to be just okay.  I like the cauliflower side dish best. Definitely try the spicy Korean sauce (Srichacha) that's at the tables - just add it in small doses so you don't overheat your meal.

279887,157001,1856,2010-11-27,"Sadly, this once great place is going downhill.  I've been a long time patron now after having brunch with friends their over 8 years ago.  I have even had the pleasure of seeing a few famous faces every so often when I dine there.  Each time I return, the service seems to go down a notch, the prices go up little, and the food stays about the same.  Now, I have no problem paying for overpriced pancakes and eggs as long as the service is decent, the food is up to par, and my overall experience is enjoyable. However, on my most recent experience, I had the unfortunate experience of having a server who had a ""could give a crap less"" attitude, which didn't make for the greatest start to the meal.  But that's fine, I was still going to enjoy my meal there. Luckily on this occasion I only had to wait 5-10 minutes for our table.  In the past, depending on how late you got there, a wait for a table of 2 could be over an hour. But I digress, I thought I made my order pretty clear asking for one of their signature dishes - my usual (Banana Walnut Pancakes) - without one main ingredient - nuts.  I'm deathly allergic and just ask for the order without walnuts.  Pretty simple, right?  Unfortunately not if your server isn't really paying attention.   After getting our food and knowing what the order is supposed to look like, I knew that the server had gotten my order wrong.  We tried to find the server, who seemed to have disappeared.  We finally tracked him down and waved him over, to which he assumed we wanted our check, since this was the first time he came in the vicinity of our table after taking our order.  Apparently, it would be too much to expect that he check-in to see how everything was after we received our food.   I explained to him that I wanted the Banana Walnut Pancakes, without walnuts.  To which he responded ""So you just want sautéed bananas.""  I agreed, not realizing what he actually entered my order as.  He was kind enough to come over after returning my order to the kitchen and said it would be out in about 3 minutes.   My order reappeared in about 1.  It seemed right, not taking a bite out of it initially.  However, it seemed that the raw, fully sliced banana that was sitting on my pancakes a few minutes ago had merely been replaced with sautéed bananas, about 3 slices to be exact - it usually comes with about 6 slices, as I could tell from the indentation made by the initial banana.  As a patron (and past employee) of any good restaurant, returned food should NEVER be merely replaced, if not thrown out all together.  It should be completely re-done and made to order as requested by a customer.  This would have been something that the server realized had he ever come over to actually see how our food was, especially after being returned to the kitchen.   I ate about half of my meal, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as I usually did, but I couldn't completely put my figure on why.  The pancakes just seemed different.  After receiving our check, I finally realized why my usual delicious order of Sautéed Banana Walnut Pancakes just didn't taste as good.  Instead of getting the Sautéed Banana Walnut Pancakes, I instead received sour dough pancakes with bananas added.  Interesting, since I didn't even know I could add-on fruit. My husband found the eggs to be a bit runny and the food overall just OK.  The biscuits were delicious as always, although smaller than they have been in the past. To say the least, we won't be returning to Bubby's any time soon, if ever.  I would love to give this place I once used to love another chance, but I find it difficult when it just seems like too much to ask for your food to be what you ordered and actually have servers who care and work for the gratuity that they are getting.  There are WAY too many good restaurants in this city to waste our time waiting in line for overpriced, mediocre food here.  Especially when our brunch for two of pancakes, eggs, juice, and soda, not one ounce of alcohol drank, ran us $65.  I can get much more bang for my buck somewhere else.  And their cash only policy seems quite shady.",1.0,-1,1

The takoyaki was smaller than others I've had (they do give you 6 to compensate for the smaller size) but the flavor was right. The shoyu ramen was great the first time I had it, but was slightly off at my most recent visit. My friends really enjoyed their gyoza (I didn't try it so I can't judge for myself).

And our appetizers came before our drinks. Getting attention was next to impossible for most of the meal. The food was excellent though. The poached egg with creme fraiche appetizer and miso cod entree rocked. The drinks were delightful, when they arrived. My friend said it was the best goat cheese omelette ever. The dessert was supposed to be a molten lava cake. However it was overcooked so there was nothing molten or lava like about it.  The center was barely moist and the outside was crisp.  the prices were great but I would be willing to pay more for better service. Given the location on the west side highway and the hike from the subway, I probably wouldn't venture back anytime soon. PS---The bathrooms felt unfinished like they were thrown together on a budget.

My friends and I all got the same thing: Viennese hot cocoa and the Bratwurst with potatoes and mustard. While we waited for our food we took in the opulent setting. It's all dark wood paneling and crystal light fixtures and the room is littered with tiny tables and booths shoved up against the wall. I think I even had a non-celebrity sighting here and saw one of the artists from that Bravo Project-Runway-knockoff-art-show. There was also a very adorable waiter that I kept having awkward eye contact with. He had very blonde hair and an innocent looking face so my table thusly dubbed him ""sexy hitler youth boy,"" which may or may not be appropriate to write here, but whatever. The cocoa? Delicious! It was cocoa for adults for sure, not too sweet, very strongly cocoa-y, and pungent in a great way. After we'd finished eating a little girl at a nearby table had a cup of it delivered to her and she had to mellow it out with some of her water because it was too rough on her baby palate. This is yet another reason not to like kids. The Brats came and when I cut into mine for the first time I thought I heard angels sing. These were natural casings and they had that ""pop"" that only good old fashioned intestines impart. The meat inside had perfect texture and spice that was only made better with some of their killer mustard. This was seriously the best mustard of my life. I ate it on it's own until tears came to my eyes because it was so strong, which was a small price to pay for such condiment greatness. The bread that came in the little basket was also tasty, but I hope I didn't offend them by adding salt on top of the unsalted butter that they provided. Unsalted butter makes me really sad. They didn't rush us out at all either, which was nice on the back end of our meal, but we had to wait a while to get a table. I get that it's a fancy place and they don't want to rush you and that it's supposed to be a little cafe where you can hang out and all, but when you've got a line 12 people deep, maybe you can speed it up a little.

Yes, I know what you are thinking - I was being picky and demanding and probably ate half the thing and sent it back expecting it wiped from my check - but no, that's not at all what happened. I arrived mid afternoon on a Thursday and they were having a rare slow moment (which is a treat) - My servers as well as the manager all recognized me as I am a regular and everyone smiled and welcomed me (I'm gonna miss this place!). I ordered a papaya salad along with an entrée of string beans and chicken in chili paste (I forget the name of the entree) and sticky rice.  I got my salad and a few bites in noticed a bad grittiness - I tried to continue as overall it was delicious as usual but the grit continued.  I sent it back requesting my entrée only.  Both the servers apologized and I replied that it was ""no big deal"" and continued my lunch. When it was time for the check, instead of one of the servers, the manager (who I recognized and who recognized me) came over with the check - she placed it in front of me with everything listed including my $7 salad.  She immediately began to explain (she's apparently been down this road before) that because the papaya salad has little shrimp it is impossible to clean them thoroughly and occasionally there is a little grit - while this is, of course, plausible I found it remarkably rude that this explanation came AFTER my meal along with a full check.  I replied that I have had hundreds of papaya salads and dozens at SriPraPhai, adding that they are usually delicious but this one was inedible and that's why I returned it.  She just shook her head and stubbornly explained the same thing again (not for a second realizing that it wasn't a debate worth having).  I then found myself defending myself as a good and regular customer who has NEVER sent anything back and finally she agreed to take ""50%"" off the price of the salad. Well, I found this even more offensive because now we are in a negotiation rather than her simply showing difference to me as a good customer - it was ALL about getting paid and my years of loyalty, my praise of their food and my 20% tips meant NOTHING. I told her that I would gladly pay full price and would never return.  She ignored this, shook her head again, took my money and came back with change less a 50% discount for my salad.  I couldn't even look at her. While the food is certainly delicious, the management at SriPraPhai clearly see their customers as cattle to be herded in, fed and herded back out - and are not aware that they are in a ""service business"".  Such a shame.  I almost gave them one star but Ive had too many good meals there over the years!",2.0,1,0

As I'm a complete newbie to the sandwich side of Vietnamese cuisine, I thought I should probably go with the classic.  The classic consists of Vietnamese ham, bacon, pate, pickled carrots, cucumber, mayo and cilantro (not a cilantro fan so I removed that**) on a crusty roll for only $5, and it's pretty darn tasty. My only issue with the sandwich was that, when the waitress asked if I wanted it spicy or non-spicy, I asked if I could go with medium spice; she said yes, but when the sandwich came out, there was absolutely no spiciness to it whatsoever. Don't make the same mistake that I did if you want your sandwich to be spicy at all because apparently not spicy, medium spicy and spicy actually means: not at all spicy, not at all spicy, and spicy. Anyway, my bf got the Peking Duck banh mi, and it was soooo good: Tender, juicy duck with a complementary sweet sauce. $5 more than my classic but totally worth it. We also had the sesame cold noodle salad, which was a tasty appetizer. The place itself is small, but on a Wednesday evening in November we only had about a 3 minute wait.

190725,21344,1673,2011-08-31,"3 and a half stars is right.. a little too generous, for me. Like many of the other tourist-wrenching joins down in the historic fidi, this place is about the scenery, not the food. So, be sure you order the basics...but even then, you may be disappointed. I just heard about Fraunces Tavern today but it is the oldest structure in the area- it was George Washington's go-to joint back in his day. And the decor certainly shows that- lots of creeky wood, tavern-esque furniture (well the side I saw on had a modern twist, you count cow printed, mildly uncomfortable banquettes- there are two entrances.). The upstairs is a musuem, and the bar seems big so there's something for everyone. I came here for a business lunch. My host made a reservation for three at 12 on a Wed and NO ONE was there. Firstly, the first rule of thumb is that these touristy places are mad expensive. That rings very true here. FT offers lunch, brunch and dinner. For lunch, you can expect apps at $12, and entrees at 16-25. Wowza for lunch. Despite being a red blooded American place (after all, the place salutes GW!), there are sure lots of British things on the menu. So if you like gasto-pub fare, never fear.  They got bangers and mashed. My two lunch buddies got the shepard's pie. It looks pretty- nice presentation and gourmet. A medium portion. It was made of lamb, which I don't eat. The mashed p atop did actually look kind of perfect. I was sure to order pub fare, so I got the fish and chips. There are very few things on the menu that come wtih sides, and this is one of them- the chips! Unfortunately, my favorite thing about fish and chips are the chips (fries) and these sucked. They were borderline...stale? There did not have any good fry quality.. not crispy, not seasoned, not even greasy... just very frozen tasting. Boo for no handmade chips. For $16,  I expected more. The fries were better than the fish though. The fish meat itself was a bit.. fishy. I'm not sure what they used; probably haddock or cod? It was a bit flavorless. I will say that I liked how the fish batter was not very greasy at all, but it was a flavorless shell- there was no beer in the batter. The tartar sauce was even a bit mild.. but this I didn't mind because I'm a huge fan of tartar. I got my standard store bought malt vinegar (the menu suggests it's not generic) and tabasco. The service is fine- nothing overbearing, but the food came out fast enough and the waitress may have checked up once. She was a little hard to get a hold of, so we instead, got someone else to take care of the bill Very blah. Would only return for the museum; the brunch menu is pretty much the same as lunch with the exception of perhaps oatmeal, and pancakes. The dinner items somewhat expand on the lunch- i.e. a bigger portion of the duck confit, etc.. some of the fancier dishes (duck, skate) actually sounded good so maybe this isn't a pub place after all. Guess I won't find out..",3.0,1,0

For an appetizer, we ordered the sweet potato eggrolls. They were fantastic! We both agreed that they were unique, tasty, and some of the best eggrolls we'd ever had. I ordered the salmon for dinner. It was well cooked, and while there was not enough sauce for my taste, it was very good. My favorite part was the crab and apple risotto that it was served with- outstanding! My boyfriend had the filet which was perfectly cooked and very tender. He was a big fan of the mashed potatoes. We did not stay for dessert - I would like to go back and try some.

So to have a restaurant where the food is prepared with such great care yet offered so affordably is such a relief! kudo's momo! 3) AMBIANCE!!! - the most illusive prong of all. Usually in new york, you can find the first two, but the third suffers. but my friend and i opened the sturdy door to MOMO's on a quiet, chilly night in this partially industrial-wastelandish neighborhood (which still has a hunger for these little oases) to find bob dylan greeting us over the speakers in a warmly lit cozy-but-not-cramped mountain cabin of sushi. who knew bbq eel would taste better while listening to don't think twice, it's alright.

363958,14321,3176,2008-01-25,"I have been to this special Thai restaurant twice, and the only reason I'm giving it four stars is because of my relative disappointment with the first dish I ordered. The first time around, I ordered tilapia sauteed in a spicy (hell yes!) chili sauce with eggplant. Though overal it was ok, I was disappointed at the excessive oiliness with this particular dish, as well as what ended up being a rather tough bunch of eggplant half the time. The second time (a.k.a today), I ordered Chinese broccoli sauteed with saltfish with a side of brown rice. At $8.50 all together, I found this to be a filling financial freebee, with plenty of spice (and saltiness) to make me finish the whole damn thing! Needless to say, it was one of the best things I'd had in awhile despite its rather simple-sounding name. On both occasions, a friend ordered sauteed drunken noodles with chicken. One loved them, while the other was not impressed with what she believed would be ""Thai spiciness,"" nor was she impressed with the $9 price tag. For dessert-to-go, I indulged in a $3 ""Kao Neo Tad."" With coconut cream, custard, salty sticky rice, and a bean topping, it was truly fabulous and very unusual to me. The rice, dense as a cheerleader, was topped with a snow white coconut paste that melted in the mouth. Right next to it, nestled in the container, was a tan-colored, coconut-y and gelatinous custard with a slight egginess that tasted even better when paired with the slightly salty rice. I must try their other desserts, and you should too! With most of them at $2.50 for ample portions, it's impossible to go wrong with their endless variety of custards, jellies, and confections. As far as the service and atmosphere are concerned, they couldn't be better. The servers can speak English and are attentive, pouring water as if their own arms were faucets. Knowledgable of what's on the menu, they're great at giving recommendations (and warnings) for those unsure of what to get. Despite the huge flat screen tv, the place has a cool, clean vibe that is spacious but never feels entirely empty. Luckily for me, I've only come when it isn't crowded, and haven't dealt with what I heard are interminable waits. I cannot wait to come back and try the plethora of desserts, as well as some of the more unusual dishes on the menu. The Cha-om omelet seems fascinating (at least the extremely helpful picture menu makes it seem so). An update as of 2/8/08: I purchased three more desserts. One was sweet sticky rice topped with a magenta-colored, garlic and parsley-zinged bushel of shredded coconut: divine and assertive. Fried onion atop a coconut cream custard proved indistinguishable, but I still enjoyed this treat warmed up for breakfast.

He regretted getting his burger crunchified (i.e. with the standard Lay potato chip on top). Really, crunchifying isn't all that and a bag of chips (pun intended). The condiments are great. I'm a huge fan of the chipotle ketchup. The burgers aren't really that big either - you get more toppings than you get actual meat. The fries are mediocre and a la carte. So while the price of the burger seems reasonable (around $7/8 a burger) that includes ONLY the burger, so it's not really a deal. Then, an order of fries includes only a few of them, and they really aren't all that good. To me, they didn't seem fresh, neither did the buns (However, Jeff says his bun was delicious). The sauce that comes with the fries was not very flavorful at all. Overall, go for the burgers, not the fries. We also got a black and white milkshake - also not extremely impressive. It was a little too sweet and it's a pretty small milkshake for the (roughly) $5 price. In sum, we were happy when we left.",2.0,-1,1

This place is slightly off of the beaten path (read: the cacophony of 2nd Avenue, its shenannigans, and the dreadful omnipresent subway construction), and that works to its advantage. At 5:30 on a Friday afternoon, it was already pretty full but some co-workers and I, much in need of a Friday Happy hour, were able to grab two tables in the rear near the bathrooms. The completely opened front allowed a lovely breeze and light to come through and illuminate the dark wood interior. The list of beers and whiskeys was more than impressive, with 24 rotating beers on tap. The cocktail list was small yet extremely interesting; while a drink with saffron-infused gin did sound tempting on a warm summer afternoon, I could not deny the call of the Hopped Apple from Woodchuck! (A wise choice, the the way...) The food here is great and there wasn't a single item I even thought was mediocre. Between the group, we split IPA Fries, fried pickle spears, and fried green tomatoes. The two later items came with a sriracha-infused aioli; I'm not a spicy foods lover, but it had a nice low and pleasant burn to it that complimented each item rather than burn your tastebuds off. Separately, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. The waiter came out and apologized that it was not plated better; one sandwich slice slipped. No matter to me! The beau, who showed up for a drink as well, jokingly commented to me, we thought out of earshot of the waiter, ""How is this going to affect your Yelp review?"" About thirty seconds later, the waiter came back with napkins and said, ""Those are the scariest words a person working in a restaurant can here."" Haha! We all had a good laugh. Clearly, the slipped slice of grilled cheese did not affect this review in any way, because it was damn delicious with its three kinds of cheese sandwiched between thick and well-buttered slices of white bread. I absolutely adore this place! It's a nice and stress-free post-work option on the Upper East Side with great food and drink. Total winner!",4.0,1,0

Shovel the meat down and move on cause people will be waiting for yout able. Oh, and the service is less than bare bones (I guess the wait staff isn't eating at Delaney).

The woman said if we come over now we could get in before the reservations they had. Since we live down the street we were there in 5 minutes. When we arrived she told us it would be a half hour wait. Apparently things changed in 5 minutes?!? We mentioned the call and she made up some story of how it all of a sudden got packed and a lot of reservations were coming in. She said we can have a drink at the bar - we don't  drink so we stood in the front and waited, slightly annoyed with her. This man, who seemed to be her boss, came in and greeted us and talked to her quietly. She then seated quickly; seemed like her authority was quickly taken away. Once we were seated we were treated like kings. It's a lively place with an artsy Mexican decor, cute masks on the wall, beautiful sconces throughout, dimly lit - very attractive space that made it a comfortable place to have a meal in. We had two waiters who obviously know how to take care of their customers. I was introduced to Manuel - he was awesome! I'll always remember how he carried a bear bottle and wine bottle on his head to his tables - the balance he has is truly amazing. He made us feel like we were having a meal in his family's kitchen and it was a pleasure to serve us, what a nice change, hardly ever seen in the restaurant world anymore! The food was spectacular! We had guacamole and queso fondio con chorizo served with the best homemade chips and corn tortillas - very tasty starters! For our meal I had a chicken dish with refried beans and cheese and a green tomato sauce, superb - can't wait to have it again! My companion had the special - shorts ribs in a red sauce, twice baked potato and veggies. We split a tres leches with chocolate dessert that melted in my mouth.

We were pleasantly surprised. The wait was 45 minutes.. But after spending hours getting pelted with ice, it was a nice environment to be in. It is a family- style restaurant and everything was delicious. On an extremely crowded evening, the only down side is it's loud and you're sitting elbow to elbow with other tables.. but it seems to go along with the italian family style of the restaurant. I can't recall the exact dish we ordered but it is a great place for groups, families, birthdays, etc.. wonderful environment & very fun. It was just two of us so we decided on a meal, everything else was a la carte. The dish was something like chicken in a tomato bisque with shrimp.. delicious. I was surprised how affordable it was. The pitcher of sangria was also great along with the dessert. We were even more pleased with seeing the bill which was very reasonable. They haven't taken advantage of their location right off Times Square, an area obviously bustling with tourists.. even chain restaurants like TGI Friday's & Red Lobster practically double their prices due to their location. I would highly suggest to anyone looking for a pleasant experience in NYC. It even seemed as though there were plenty of locals and repeated, recognized customers which also goes to say how consistently appeasing this place must be. (I do have to mention I did not feel well after dinner but I think it was a combination of our meal and it was so good I'm hoping that's all it was.. hopefully no one else had the same experience!

The bento's four medium-sized scallops were perfectly cooked, tender, and seasoned well. The salad and its spunky ginger dressing were also very good. The California rolls were just typical. The steamed rice was de-lish and intriguing to the palate with Zento's addition of fish flakes on top. Me likey! I heard that the thing to try here is the Zento signature roll so I had that as well. The Zento square sushi roll consists of eel, avocado, and plum paste on the inside, topped with tuna or salmon and spicy mayo and unagi sauce. Very good but not worth all the hype because, while it was visually appealing and tasty, it was lacking texturally...like it would've been nice if it had had some tobiko on top or a piece of shrimp tempura in the middle. All in all, I had a very enjoyable dining experience here. Service was good but a tinge over-attentive. Zento's located in the heart of Old City so parking is a bit of a hassle. Zento's also small space-wise (place only seats about 20) so don't come here squad deep. Also, don't come here if you're on a tight budget because it can get pricey. Major point score: Zento is BYOB so I also brought a bottle of sake that they gladly warmed (don't judge me...I know it was only lunch :p).",4.0,1,0

One of the first places we went to was the Oyster House just after it had reopened. Back then I hadn't started earning a decent paycheck and I remember calculating everything in my head as we ordered tray upon tray of oysters. That's no way to dine. My mom is a huge oyster fan (as am I) and this past year has been a tough one for my fam so I wanted to go with a sure thing for dinner, back to the O H. We came the day after Christmas and with mom running a little late I was worried we wouldn't get a seat for the buck a shuck happy hour. Uber dropped us off right at 6:00 and the place was jumping but we were sat right away at the corner of the raw bar. With money less of an issue this time around I was ready to burn this mother down. Right off the bat we started with the oyster shooters. Gin / Cucumber / Dill was on special so we knocked those back, put in our beer orders, and were ready to receive our oysters. The buck a shuck oysters were Delaware Bay and we banged out 36 right out the gate. In all honesty I would have been fine getting another 36 or 72 and not worry about the other food but we had plans to go to Dandelion after wards and bar hopping with your mom with nothing but raw oysters in the belly seemed like the makings of a hilarious albeit embarrassing story. I got the roasted oysters chimichurri and mom got the fried oysters with chicken salad. Mine only came with 4 oysters but God bless were they good. The flavor was just about perfect, savory with a tiny bit of spice and I found myself desperately scraping the shell for any last morsels I could get. I didn't try mom's fried oysters but I know she loved them and the chicken salad was delicious. We also split a side of roasted brussel sprouts with bacon, boo-ya-ka! They were the perfect compliment to the meal. It was a great experience all around. The workers were fantastic, the shuckers shucked their shucking hearts out, and the other diners were really friendly as well.

After that, and on weekends, all hell breaks loose with all the families coming in to eat - kids running around, hassled parents trying to rein them in, you can imagine the scene. 3) Decent chaat. Not as good as a few other places (some of which are right down the road - Dimple's Bombay Talk and Rajbhog to name two), but not too shabby either. Word of caution though: Don't compare it to the chaat you get back home in India, else you'll hate it. The chaat here, especially the bhel puri, is different in taste from what you'd get at other places here and in India. They put a different twist on it, that not all people would like, but I can't put my finger on what's different (maybe it's the amchoor or something, I don't know). Cons: 1) Home to the very worst Paneer Kathi Roll I've ever had. This was today, when I kipped in for lunch and decided to order the aforementioned roll. First, they took a whole 25 minutes to bring out one roll. Next, the roll is not even worth the price, any way you look at it, quantity or quality. The ""roll"" was nothing but 2 halves which were barely an inch and a half in size each. The diameter would've been somewhere about an inch to an inch-and-a-quarter. OK, you'd tell me to judge the item not from how it looks, but from how it tastes. Well, coming to that, one word: bleh. What constitutes a paneer kathi roll here is (1) mashed potatoes, (2) mashed cottage cheese (paneer), (3) both the above items mixed up together, and not too well at that, (4) a sprinkling of diced onions and (5) tomato ketchup, all rolled up inside a thin roti. No spices, cilantro, lemon juice, nothing. Not even on the side, so the item ends up tasting very bland. Now, I know we Indians eat food that's sometimes a lot spicy, but this is actually so far out at the other end of the spectrum, that a Westerner not used to eating spicy food would find it tasteless as well. 2) Horrible service, unfortunately, is the only thing they are consistent in. 3) The portions in general are ridiculously small. I had ordered a samosa chaat in one of my previous trips here, and it came in a styrofoam dessert-sized bowl. Yes, no kidding, a bowl. And this wasn't just a samosa, but a samosa chaat, so you can imagine how much chaat would've been served. 4) I tried paying by credit card and was told they don't accept cards for amounts less than $15. This was after I had waited half an hour for a crappy kathi roll, which was not at all worth what they charged me, so as you can imagine, I was pretty pissed off about it. Also, the service was so crappy that I had to wait 10 minutes to get the check after I'd asked for it, and when the waitress gave me the check, I again had to wait a further 5 minutes for her to collect the check and my payment. Finally, I was so annoyed that I decided to walk up to the front counter to pay, and this is where I was told about the $15 threshold (which, by the way, is mentioned nowhere in the store or on the menu). So at this point of time, I raised a stink and she finally swiped my card and I got out of there as fast as I could. OK, this review ended up being more critical than I started out wanting it to be. I admit, I haven't tried out their CA locations or their catering so I don't know how those are, but my experience with their Chicago, IL (Devon Street) location was disappointing too. Try these guys at your own risk.",2.0,-1,1
137881,43504,1276,2012-01-09,"The sushi here is delicious and fresh, and the 3-roll special is perfect for dinner. But the reason I'm reviewing is because the service is excellent. Prime example - they have a $10 credit card minimum, and I was two dollars short of that the other day and didn't have enough cash. Rather than making me go get cash or buy enough to get up to $10, they said I could give them the difference next time. Not too many businesses, especially in a city, are that good to their customers. I made sure to come back the next week and give them the $2!",5.0,1,0

The seating space is a little small, but luckily they had room for us. We ordered the zaatar pita, which was WAY too strong with the zaatar. The reason why I got it was because my dad used to make his own olive oil/zaatar mix as I was growing up, but this stuff was way too intense. We also had the chicken kebab, which was slammin. It was so good, the chicken was spiced well and moist and the techina was really fresh and tasty. We also had the lambajin, or lamb pizza, which was also really delicious.

We came by today (Saturday, September 14) at 11:30am for brunch. The door was locked. There were several people inside. We were confused, especially since their website states that they open at 11am. After a couple of moments of deciding what to do, we decided to move on and as we started to walk off, we heard someone calling us back. We asked what time they were supposed to open and the response was ""11"". My wife and I looked at each other and with some hesitation decided to give this restaurant a try. Our servers were very nice and attentive. However the menu does not offer any weekend brunch options, only the standard restaurant menu.  We debated and decided to stay since the staff was nice and while still under construction the space was nice (but loud, please consider adding some sound dampening.) My wife ordered curry chicken and a hot water. I had a lamb meatloaf, a bloody mary and a hot water. Lamb Meatloaf - $13 This was a good dish. I liked the meatloaf, the sauce, roasted potatoes and asparagus. For what it was and the neighborhood, this dish was appropriately priced. Curry Chicken - $12 All white meat chicken over rice. And that's it. Chicken was flavorless, very overcooked and tough. All the flavor of the dish resides in the sauce which was little more than coconut milk with curry powder.  For both presentation and consumption, this dish needs some variety. Also there was way too much sauce. And it would be nice if the rice was not already under chicken and curry, but separated on the plate. Bloody Mary - $6, refills $3 The drink was good and a good value. One is enough for me, but I appreciate that they offer the option of additional rounds at a reduced price. Hot Water - Free Each mug contained yellow water, with stuff in the bottom of the mug (coffee grounds maybe?) We decided to stick with the cold water. A person who appeared to be the owner was in the back talking to a patron later in our meal. We had hoped he would come our way so we could let him know about the rough spots. It would be in his best interest to find out what his patrons think by wandering through the restaurant and asking them about their experience.

She made advance reservations, so we didn't have to wait long for seats.  The decor at Jane is unlike any other brunch spot I've been to. Chic decor and great, cozy ambiance There's two floors of seating and both floors are spacious and cozy. For my complimentary cocktail I ordered the White Peach Bellini which was light, refreshing, a little bubbly from the sparkling wine. I enjoyed it very much. My boyfriend ordered the Benedict Jane. The Benedict Jane is poached egg covered with a rich tarragon Hollandaise sauce, sitting on top of a moist and delicious crab and crawfish cakes and home fries on the side, This was really a beautiful dish! I tried one of the Benedict Jane and it was great. I really enjoyed the meatiness of the crab and crawfish cake. It's very different from most eggs Benedict I have had. I ordered the Benedict Johnny which is similar to a regular eggs Benedict. Poached eggs topped with a rich, creamy, roasted tomato Hollandaise sauce sitting on top of a maple chicken sausage, and corn pancakes with home fries on the side, I really liked the home fries because they were crispy and crunchy and possibly the BEST home fries I've had!  Another thing I loved the most about my eggs Benedict is the yolk was oozing out and it was a runny yolk. Apparently, we all had room for dessert and had the Pumpkin Chai Profiteroles which was seriously pumpkin heaven! There was pumpkin ice cream, candied pumpkin seeds, pumpkin paper, and chai sauce. I really liked this dessert because you can taste pumpkin in different textures, shapes, and sizes. My favorite was the pumpkin ice cream - seriously delicious! The next dessert was the Seven Layer Chocolate Cake. Absolutely Chocolate heaven! The seven layer chocolate cake consists of chantilly cream, whipped gananche, and a chocolate sauce.

The ceiling was covered with clay pots, precariously suspended; the room was the typical New York restaurant, dimly lit and with strangers dangerously close to you (stranger danger! Okay, maybe I just don't like people). Apparently, there's a big table in the back where people just sit with strangers. How horrifying. We were lucky to get our own table without a reservation or a wait but, granted, it was also 10:30 at night and we still only got the second-to-last table. Now, for the service. Our waitress was not overly friendly and seemed to just cease paying attention at times. That's not so bad though because she could have been Russian or some sort of Eastern European and that's just her culture (Is ADD part of any culture?). She was clearly inattentive, except with the check. The worst part, though, was that we asked her for recommendations on the menu and she basically went through the menu and pointed out the most expensive dishes in each category. What. The. Hell. I, too, have the ability to identify which numbers are highest. It was very blatant and very annoying. We ended up tracking down and asking another server for recommendations which were, by the way, completely different and completely delicious. We started with the anginares moussaka (something involve artichoke hearts and cheese). It was decadent and delicious. My boyfriend thought it was a little too rich for his taste, but I loved it. I had the cod which was delicious but I think the real winner was the pastitso that my boyfriend got. I call it the winner because the tables on both sides of us got the same dish so it was apparently very popular. It tasted a little like lasagna (bleh) gone Greek to me, but everyone else seemed to love it so I guess it should be highly recommended. i would also suggest wine with dinner (would have been perfect but I supposed to be studious right now) and dessert because they looked fabulous -- I was just too stuffed to order any :( Overall, I gave it a 4 because the food was great; we just got stuck with a crappy server.

It's a hot spot that has been touted as one of the best cheesesteak experiences in the city so people are going to come to see for themselves. The clerks and workers are somewhat rude- if they smell tourist on you and you ask questions about the menu or options, you are getting attitude. A gentleman in front of me was scolded- hurried, and embarrassed by the old woman working for asking the difference in cheese. Poor guy.

407421,203708,3489,2014-10-17,"I passed by this place a few weeks ago and finally decided to give it a try. The ambiance is very nice. They have a very limited menu with only a few drinks (It's BYOB but the Watermelon Mint drink is super refreshing!). As for the food, that too is limited and cannot be customized in any way. As a vegetarian, this was a bit of a problem. All of the ingredients seem really fresh and healthy. The fillings aren't your normal vegetables. They had a special when I went that was blue corn tortilla quesadillas with a corn fungus filling - not something I would recommend. I hope that they work on being less trendy with the food and better the taste of the actual dishes. The portions are REALLY small and you have to pay extra for salsa and guac - ridiculous right? I also had the verduras tacos and it was not good. The best part about this place and the only thing that will probably keep me going back forever are the CHURROS! They are absolutely, hands down, the best churros i've ever had in my entire lifetime. Perfectly crisp, loaded with cinnamon and sugar.

I was pleasantly surprised when we came to dinner on a Sunday night, of their Sunday dinners - 3 course meal for $44.  And you choose from their regular menu (some app's/entrees cost a few extra, but the menu informed you of this right off the bat) The dinner rolls were amazing.  they're warm and soft; the way they should be when you go out to dinner.  And the ""chef's tastings"" were really good too.  a chip and dip, and then something else, I couldn't even remember by the end of the night. For dinner, I had the quail and waffle for an appetizer.  For one, I've never had quail, so I really didn't have any idea how to break it apart to eat it correctly in a restaurant.  I might have done better with a sharper knife, but I was able to get by.  But no matter how difficult it was to eat, it was absolutely amazing!  For dinner, I had the pork, which was so perfectly cooked, and well presented.  For me, I always need a texture difference within the main course, otherwise I get tired of eating, despite being hungry.  This entree was perfect, because it came with potato puree and then some crispy things on top (I can't recall what they were...we went a few weeks ago), which was perfect for me. And of course, for dessert, I had the ice cream sandwich, which was a fudge brownie, coffee hazelnut ice cream, nutella and other things, and I loved it. My boyfriend's entire meal was absolutely amazing too.  The skirt steak was so tender and just to die for.  I forget what his appetizer was, and he had the banana souffle, which was perfect. For brunch, it was okay.  We didn't really think it was spectacular.  I mean the food was really good, don't get me wrong, but for a brunch, I would have liked a dessert (since we came in around 11:30), but they do not offer them.   We will definitely continue to go back there, but most likely only for dinner.

The regular menu is decent.  I have probably been to Noodle Pudding over 200 times, and therefore have no qualms about occasionally ordering the chicken with leeks and pancetta, or one of the pastas.  But whenever I have been away from Brooklyn for a long time (as, increasingly, I am these days) my return visit to Noodle Pudding finds me on the specials side. I have always regretted that the beer selection is not the menu's equal.  And the desserts aren't all terrific (notably the namesake).  Go often and you might get a fruit plate.

Unfortunately, it was Restaurant Week, and most places I've been during that week, you don't really get the best feel for a place with the limited menu and desire for quick table turnover. My friend and I got almost everything offered on the Restaurant Week menu to share. Most of it I did not like. The pumpkin croquettes tasted like fried mozzarella sticks from Cheesecake Factory. The 2 desserts - a honey cake a la mode and some sort of biscuits with sheep's milk spread - were awful. My friend and I were like, what is this stuff, and why are desserts so salty? Maybe it's just me, but I like my dessert to be sweet. The worst part was when we asked for more bread with the foie gras. They had given us 3 very thin slices of baguette to eat with the foie gras, which was not enough. When we asked for more bread, we were told that it only came with the dish, and if we wanted, he could ""put in an order"" for us (meaning, he could charge us for bread). Are you kidding me?? With all the money people spend at your restaurants and shops, and the fact that this place is brand new - I would think the owners wouldn't want another Bindi situation.

30964,13835,244,2014-10-11,"HM.  This was one of those reviews that I wanted to process thoroughly before writing. I had decided on The Saint Austere for my birthday dinner way in advance, just a nice and small gathering of good friends.  I contacted the business via Yelp, and immediately got a response from Jacqueline.  She was very accommodating with my party size and dietary restrictions, 3 in my party are lactose intolerant.  We worked on a menu; I pretty much chose whatever fellow Yelpers had tried and recommended in their reviews.  I had been abroad for close to a month, and when I returned, I also received a follow-up on my reservation.  I was pleased with the attention paid to my reservation. The night I arrived at the restaurant, I was a bit shocked to discover that 9 of us would end up on one table with 4 on the other, whilst sharing a table with another party.  This was a major miscommunication error.  When I was informed that there would be tables next to each other via email, I was not aware the tables would be parallel to each other, and not adjacent.  I have had other restaurants warn me of separate tables, but they would be in the same line of sight, just separated by a gap.  Because of this, a few of my guests were immediately put off and didn't feel like they were part of the celebration.  This made my night of hosting a little more difficult as I was constantly maneuvering between the tables to make sure my guests felt welcomed; it was a small restaurant, and at times, I got in the way of the serving staff. Moving on to the food, as I had mentioned, was an 'All-Stars' $40 prix fixe menu based on reviews: Broccoli Rabe Creamy Polenta Grilled Octopus Steamed Mussels Pappardelle with meat sauce Roasted Organic Chicken Tiramisu I added the meat & cheese boards for an additional $9/person.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the various cuts of meat and pate.  I disliked almost all of the cheese selection, which I was very surprised by since I am an avid fan of cheese. We also decided on 3 dozen oysters- I thought the oysters were small, but passable. Based on my own personal preferences and my guests', I found that the food was a mixed bag.  Some people liked items that I thought were poor executions, others disliked the dishes I preferred.  Only a few thought all the dishes were pretty decent.  The ones I liked included the polenta, broccoli rabe, and organic chicken.  The octopus was tender, but tiny- we had to split 2 tentacles between 4 people.  I did not like the fennel and onion sauce that accompanied the mussels, which were also small.  The pappardelle meat sauce was too subtle- I needed more of the veal & pork to come through.  The chicken was where we had issues.  The chicken I had was tender and juicy; I typically don't order chicken at restaurants because they err on the dry side.  I took a chance on it because of its rave reviews.  I was not disappointed in its texture.   I was then told by guests on the other end of my table that their chicken was still alive and ""bucking away.""  One of my guests was pretty disgusted by the fact that it was bleeding onto her plate.  Jacqueline took my friend's dish away.  Since I didn't see the chicken with my own eyes, I wasn't going to review it here.  However, because I don't waste food, I brought the leftover pasta and chicken home.  While I was reheating the chicken, the bones were revealed to be almost ENTIRELY red. This really got me annoyed.  I was annoyed that my guests were unable to eat it, and annoyed that the whole chicken was not removed and recooked to the proper temperature.  In this day and age of food-borne illnesses, I don't see how any restaurant can afford to serve under-cooked chicken.   Lastly was the dessert- I cannot even tell you how many tiramisus I've had in my life- from small bakeries to homemade to various Italian restaurants to places that offered a twist.  The tiramisu I had here ranked the lowest on my list.  And I will explain why.  It's made with a dulce de leche and fit into a mason jar with espresso granita sprinkled on top.  I didn't mind the mixture so much, but it did lack a balance between the cream and pastry.  The granita was poorly done; since the chef chose to make the granita more on the icy side, they really had to highlight a stronger espresso taste.  It didn't happen because it wasn't consistent; some icy bits had a slight espresso taste, while others were just comprised of plain water.  It was quite the disappointment. This was the most controversial dining experience of my life- I have never had so many people disagree on the quality of food here.  If I judged solely based on service, I would probably give it a 4.5 rating.  I never saw any of the waitstaff slacking; they worked extremely hard the whole night. And so these 3 stars are really for their effort to provide for our tables.  The rating really suffered in the food department; I can see the potential, but the food definitely needs more TLC.",3.0,1,0

I ordered the totto miso, and there was too much sake in my ground pork, almost overpowering the soup after mixed in.  It nearly turned into an oversalted wine broth.  My aunt may have put it accurately when she said ""It was really good at first, but I think it's because I was waiting 1.5 hours and felt like I was dying of hunger.""  I much prefer Ippudo, or momofuku noodle.  Ippudo is no fuss, enjoyable to eat at, and simple and momofuku is unique in both broth and having the best bacon.  AND if you've ever been to San Mateo's ramen dojo, it totally kicks nyc ramen's ass.

Not overpriced in comparison with the prices we can find in any regular restaurant in France. The interior design is like in a french bistrot, I felt in France being there!

We ordered the Mac n cheese, salmon, watermelon/goat cheese salad, and lemon Parmesan cauliflower. Everything on the menu sounded fun and vibrant, but we were very disappointed. Everything was bland. Except the salmon, it tasted like they seasoned it. The ratio of watermelon and goat cheese compared to arugula in the salad was completely off. Couldn't taste lemon or Parmesan on the cauliflower. The Mac n cheese was decent. Had to call the waiter over for bread. For the price, I wouldn't go back. But it was nice for a date night :)",3.0,1,0

396623,29084,3318,2010-10-21,"There is something special about eating with strangers in such close quarters. Only in New York would people know how to cram into a literal hole in the wall, get their lunch, slurp it down, and get out of there without getting hurt. I did bump into a few people while I was packed inside Prosperity Dumpling. Nobody got hurt and everybody was understanding. And while most people eat their dumplings and mind their own business, the guy sitting next to me asked me about cameras, which I admitted I knew nothing about (have you seen my overexposed pictures?) And all these experiences for just a dollar! Prosperity is probably the most popular of the dollar dumpling shops in Chinatown (there's also a location in Sunset Park). You get five fried dumplings for a dollar. One single dollar! That's crazy! They're pretty filling, but if you're still hungry you can always get 10 boiled dumplings for two dollars. That's 15 dumplings for $3!!! I'm not even going to have to collect these receipts for tax purposes. Since it was in my budget, I ordered both boiled and fried dumplings. The boiled took about ten minutes because they were made fresh, but I was able to start with the fried ones. The fried dumplings had a very crispy skin that gave way to quite a bit of steam which eventually gave way to the ground pork and chive mixture. The exterior had an awesome crunch and flavor without being greasy. I used the soy vinegar and sriracha sauce from the communal bottle to drown my dumplings. The soy gave it a nice sharp balance and the sriracha heated things up just a bit. The boiled versions shared the same meaty, flavorful pork and chive mixture. It was a bit generic and tasted like all the other dumpling fillers I've had before but there was a generous portion of it and it was fresh and tender. When I burst open this wrapper, the hot juices exploded everywhere. I was worried my camera friend was going to turn against me. And the crunch of the scallions stood out more with the boiled ones. Although, of course, they needed more sauce to give them some flavor. But the wrapper was soft and tender and you could really taste the freshness and homemade quality of the dumpling itself. Still, I was a bit partial to the crunchy fried versions. I couldn't get over the perfect light crispy texture. And at 20 cents each, I was tempted to go crazy and just keep ordering. -eatthisny",4.0,1,0

69802,56873,615,2013-07-19,"Talk about gems, and definitely not hidden, with the cool bouncer in the front, just be prepared for a party inside! I knew on this night, both me and my dear wanted a 'happening' place to drink and enjoy the night, it is New York afterall, and there should be a ton of places we could just walk into, but someone decided to do her homework on this one and we came here. I didn't even see the words ""Employees Only"", I only saw in a fashionable font EO on the front of this place. We got to the door, didn't see much except a charming funny bouncer as we ended up chatting with him and he said he couldn't let us in just yet.... until he saw our ID. His name was Robert and he was chatting with my dear and also two more ladies that just happen to want in on the action of this place. You know there is some love of this place when the guy has the EO font logo tattooed to his arm, ok, what are we walking into here? We had some jokes outside, some pictures taken, we were ready now for some drinks! There are no windows that show you the party that is going on inside, it's all covered and like a private club, the feel gets intense before you walk in. As Robert lets you pass to the set of doors wishing you a great time, you come across a fortune teller before you go through the veil covering the main room. You don't need a foturne teller to tell you that your going to have an awesome time in here, so we decided to walk in, and like turning on a tv and seeing a picture, this was a whole uncovered party. The sight of a sea of people cramming this small narrow space trying to get their money down to get another drink was the scene. I was able to at least see right to the bar, and the bartenders there were wearing white coats (sort of like doctors prescribing the right brew to you!) and dishing their magic, playing up to the crowd with their Tom Cruise cocktail tricks, one even posed for me as he saw me snapping up shots of the bar! Now these guys know what is going around, and have total control of the racks and racks of booze that is behind them and to keep the crowd wanting more! It was only 10pm, obviously people who come here like to let loose early, it was hard to get from one place to another, let alone the back wall right to the bar. Somehow my sweetie was able to squeeze her small frame through all the people, get to the bar, and carry some drinks back to the little section I was occupying. She brought back a Mai Tai and something called a Fraise Sauvage. I thought we were just going to take in the crowd and drink with the masses, but my dear had other plans, and that was to try their eats! On the back side of this place there actually are some tables, how you get to those tables is by wanting food, so she found one of the people working here and we got a table for two. This backroom was packed with couples, groups and people all eating.. but also noticing that everyone had a drink not too far from their hands, you are away from the crowd... but you still see them and feel that vibe eminating from it. We ended up ordering more booze (YES!) and a braised octopus salad and bone marrow poppers (whoa, what is that). The menu had a bunch of cool items, like beef tatare, gnocchi, hen, let's just say when I come back to NYC, I'm going to be back to try some other dishes, but let's get to what was devoured. We were given some rye bread to start, with some butter, beside a small candlelight awaiting our next plate. The octopus was nice, bouncy tender, fresh, not overly cooked and rubbery like some cheap ass Japanese restaurant serving something that has been in the fridge a little too long. How can I describe it, like some (it taste like chicken) fresh, just cooked to perfection meat alongside some beautiful greens, lightly sauced, for a little shine. Coming from a dinner already, we were full, but we kept on eating, and then the bone marrow poppers came out. We ordered one extra one, cause the normal dish has only 3 (recommended by the server, nice job!). These things came out, small, circular, pastry like, delicate, pure evil. They were light in weight put packed a punch, from the pastry itself sheilding the caramilized onions on the bottom, to raising the bone marrow like a crown on top, somehow this combination worked and I was already worried about finishing the last one cause I wanted to savour it. This place has some wicked cocktails, with more than 3 shelves worth of excellent booze that these master of mix can work with, they were crafted at perfection. The three we had were tasty in all it's essence, and packed a punch that creeps on you when you least expect it, not for me... but for my dear you could tell it was affecting her.. ahem... walking straight abilities!

The place is also super dark and there isn't ample waiting area in the front entrance. it's definetly worth trying out.,3.0,-1,1

396027,14234,3318,2012-06-18,"My first impression was dim:  Despite the ""Grade A"" sign proudly displayed for their sanitation practices, the muck and grime of Chinatown still pervades throughout this tiny hole-in-the-wall.  The perpetual line folds in on itself as queuers awkwardly brush against each other in attempts to place orders and grab plastic utensils from the corner.  The exposed kitchen is bustling with sweaty dumpling makers and a cashier playing double duty as head chef.  TIP:  Be sure to order LOUDLY and CLEARLY, as we temporarily lost a chunk of our order to the slender language barrier.  For a mere $7, SEVEN DOLLARS?!?!, we purchased a Hot & Sour Soup along with the following feast... Chives & Pork Fried Dumplings:  Delicious!  The pork was fatty and flavorful, the dough was tender with an excellently crunchy exterior. Pork Fried Buns:  Tasted almost identical to the above except they had a much larger dough to meat ratio.  I thought the dumplings had a better balance of texture. Vegetable Boiled Dumplings:  Incredible vegetable filling...I could taste everything in the bite --  the mushrooms, the cabbage, the ginger.  They all contributed to a refreshing and flavorful experience.  However, I would NOT recommend getting these boiled...the resulting dough was limp and bland. Sesame Pancake w/ Vegetables:  WOW, WOW, WOW...it was like a savory, flat, asian-inspired funnel cake jam packed with fresh and flavorful carrots and cilantro.  Not greasy nor dense, it was an absolute treat.  The hands-down winner of our expedition to Prosperity. Prosperity is a bit too heavy to be a regular stand-by, but I will surely be bringing my dumpling aficionado friends here in the future.",4.0,1,0

So I asked if a manager or the owner could be asked and then get back to me.   This is where is get's unusual, the woman on the phone laughed.  This I don't get and this was definately a first.  I have some theories as to why this caused a chuckle, but will leave them out of this.  So, I sent a note to the info email address detailing the able, but have yet to hear back.   I think the rub is that a place like Stone Park is for me a restaurant that is striving to be sensitive to the environment, sensitive to supporting local farmers, and to being sensitive to the needs of the needs of its customers.  It's a big part of the draw for me and it's why I am able to enjoy not only the food, but to be able to feel as though I am also supporting a philosophy of mindfullness, compassion and kindness.  Again, don't expect much from the person on the phone, but it is surprising that a I didn't get quick note back from a manager/owner saying, ""Sorry, we don't condone the laugh, but please understand our policy is one that we can't change, hopefully you can still join us"" would have been great .... but unfortunately did not get any response.",1.0,-1,1

My friend whose been to this restaurant several times recommended this place for our lunch date. But she will not be returning again because of the staffs action during our lunch. We ordered 6 oysters, clam chowder, fish and chips and a salmon burger. Oysters were warm when we received them, clam chowder was watery, and salmons burger was dry and plain. We were next to a family ( parents and a toddler). The waitress came up to the table and yelled at the family for not leaving enough tip on the bill and that they should not eat at the restaurant again if they do not have enough money for tip. I could not believe it. I was looking around the restaurant for a staff member to intervene. There was one staff member who was watching close by but did not intervene. I later found out that was the manager. He did not do anything to stop the waitress he just let the waitress yell at the customer in front of the whole restaurant. The couple did not argue but kept calm and left the restaurant. I don't understand a business who think it's acceptable to yell at a paying customers in front of other customers! There's other ways to handle the situation. At least they left her a tip after that display. The waitress should be happy she received a tip and move on instead of causing a scene in front of the entire restaurant. This same waitress was our waitress too. She was also snappy when we ordered and rude. I looked at yelp after leaving the restaurant because I had assume the waitress and the manager were just having a bad day. But apparently it looks like they're already establishing a bad reputations by themselves with their actions towards customers and lack of action from the manager.

We ordered 4 dishes to share: a raw fish app, burrata and heirloom tomatoes app, the black tagliolini, and a fish dish (I believe It was Cod).   Both the raw fish dish and cooked fish were completely unmemorable.  Not great, not terrible. However, I have possibly never been more disappointed in two dishes than I was in the burrata app and the black tagliolini. The burrata app was fine, except that the menu did not state that there were anchovies in the dish and the server never informed us of this when we ordered.  When it arrived the entire serving was covered in anchovies and that was the only thing we could taste.  Since there are so many who dislike anchovies, I think this is something they should tell diners before/when ordering.   The black tagliolini was HORRIBLE!  My friend (who eats fish ALL the time) and I both found it to be completely inedible.  I have never sent a dish back before, but there was a serious concern that something was wrong with the seafood in this dish.  Judging by the waiters reaction, it seemed this happens a lot, so I now think it must be the actual recipe that is so foul.  Instead we asked for the 'famous' spaghetti dish. This was certainly edible (it is hard to screw it spaghetti), but coming from an Italian home I feel confident in saying that it does not deserve the rave reviews it has gotten.   For this amount of money I expect MUCH better food and I have almost always been satisfied at higher end restaurants, so I am genuinely shocked Scarpetta continues to do well.",2.0,1,0

54994,47778,495,2011-02-15,"Last night was my third time at Tinto and likely my last.  The two stars both go toward the food.  It was good, but not great.  This review, however, will focus on the restaurant's two weakest assets - the service and cleanliness. The service:  We had reservations for 9, got there at 9, got seated at 9:15.  Typically, I would not have a problem with waiting at the bar for 15 minutes while the table was prepared.  The hostess sat us in some quasi-basement with couches and dark corners (more on those later).  This basement was almost completely empty, leaving us baffled as to the 15 minute wait.  I will tell you this:  They did not spend that 15 minutes cleaning up before we were seated.  There were crumbs covering my seat.  Not a huge deal; I'm not snob, but that was simply the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  Once seated, our waiter, Nathan, approached us and immediately turned on the charm.  By ""turned on the charm"" I mean condescendingly explained the tapas menu to my girlfriend, who had yet to experience the pleasure of dining at Tinto.  Nathan did not take drink orders.  Nathan darted away and back again in two minutes or so and asked ""Have you decided on your meal?""  We had yet to even pick up the expansive menu, attempting instead to enjoy each other's company for a moment or two on our Valentine's Day date.  Shame on us.  So Nathan gave us some time, and I coerced him into taking my drink order.  He was clearly so excited that I reminded him about the whole drinks thing that he later brought me an extra beer without me even asking!  Don't worry, Nathan charged us for that.  So, we ordered our food, received some dishes twice, some not at all, but for the most part we enjoyed the food.  We mistakenly ordered dessert, only to wait nearly 20 minutes for it to arrive at the table.  By this point, it was after 11pm and the restaurant was nearly empty.  Had we known the ordering of dessert would extend our experience by 30 minutes, we certainly would have passed.  It wasn't even that good.  On our way out, Nathan walked right by us without a ""thank you"" or even an acknowledgment of our presence or that we just dropped 132 bones at his restaurant.  You're welcome, Nathan.   Cleanliness:  Well, really lack thereof.  Like I said, crumbs on the seat, etc.  As you know, when you do the whole tapas thing, you do a lot of sharing and plates need to be changed a lot.  Nathan changed my plate after the first course but failed to extend the same courtesy to my girlfriend.  Not really sure what that was all about but it was kind of gross.  The silverware was spotted.  Again, I'm not a snob, or a germaphobe, so if I notice these shortcomings, I'm sure a more refined guest would be disgusted; I was merely annoyed.   Dark Corners:  We were seated in a fairly empty quasi-basement on couches that sunk so low that my chin was near table-level (I'm not even short).  It was part basement, part sex den.  Our fellow diners were all over each other like horned up middle schoolers at their first school dance.  Problem was, these diners were in their mid-50's.  Well, at least one was.  His date was probably not too far removed from middle school.  I felt like an extra on the set of a filming of Millionaire Matchmaker.  It was all very uncomfortable.  Another set of diners were literally screaming into their cell phone wishing ""!Feliz Dia de Los Enamorados!"" (happy Valentine's Day) to their entire familia, while another followed each other to the bathroom...entered together, only to exit after the unmistakable sound of puking.  In all fairness to Tinto, the restaurant cannot be expected to screen its guests for class.  The clientele was simply a wonderful reflection of the lack of class the entire place exhibited throughout the night.   I do not consider myself to be some sort of perfection-seeking foodie elitist  I do, however, expect a bit more from a $132 meal.",2.0,-1,1

I have had many a falafel in my life (some from Israel, mind you!) and I have to say it's one of the bests out there. I am shamelessly agreeing with the rest of New York when I say, look no further for the perfect falafel. The falafel is an all-in-one meal. You've got your variety of salads, some protein from the chick peas in the falafel balls, and a great toasty pita to enclose all of the yummy goodness. Add some Hummus and Tahini and you're all set for a mind blowing Middle Eastern delight. I had the Harissa flavored Falafel and it was just the right amount of spicy, which is edible at the same time as having a kick. I've had some falafels that were inedible due to the amounts of Chariff (spicy sauce) added to it. Good job you guys! I also had the Pomegranete Iced Tea which was tangy and refreshing, mmm mmm mmm. My only hangup may have been the lack of room/ general seating area, but one bite of that falafel and all was forgiven!! Definitely worth a try, especially if you're in the area!!",5.0,1,0

As previously mentioned by some, the service was slow and fairly inattentive-15 minutes before water was served and wine was uncorked. The waiter was clearly inexperienced and said more than once that he was not Italian, and that the menu was hard to understand and he couldn't pronounce most of the dish names. Nevertheless, the food was pretty good and that alone would bring me back. A pretty interesting variety of items to chose from, especially for Yardley, which isn't exactly known for imaginative cuisine.

They had a special: potato, wrapped with applewood smoked bacon -- and I'm still dreaming about it. I hope they consider making this dish a staple on the menu.  The oysters: fabulous. The porterhouse, lamb chops and pork shank were brilliantly cooked.  For people like me, who gorge themselves on the appetizers, the menu gives you plenty of options on the cut and size of your meat, and the wait staff helps you decide on the best temperature to suit your liking.  The flavor and crust on the porterhouse - seriously perfect.  The steaks are accompanied by a variety of sauces, but the chimichurri and horseradish cream stand-out.  The quality and variety of the meats and fish on the menu are top shelf and you can tell the chef knows what he's doing.   As far as ambiance is concerned, it is warm, modern and inviting, and a place you can sit and enjoy company for a while.",5.0,-1,1

In a frantic search for a perfect place for my husband's birthday dinner, I found Degustation.  I was looking for a place with excellent food, but cool, current, and relaxed - nothing too formal or stuffy.  Degustation was exactly that! The space is very cool - dark and narrow, with one counter, and all the cooking done right in front of the diners.  Definitely a date spot. Extra points for hospitality.  Not only was the waitstaff extremely nice and helpful throughout the meal, but we were offered a free glass of wine because we had to wait for our seats for a bit.  Also, we got the prime spots right by the chefs, because I mentioned when making the reservation that it was for a birthday. The 10-course menu was phenomenal, with each dish better than the next.  Spaghetti and quail were the only courses that were just ok and I could have done without.   My one complaint is, I am getting soooo tired of 3-hour-long 10-course menus.  If only it were reduced to 7 or 8 courses at most, it would have been perfect.   Watching the food being prepared was super fun.  The chef was really sweet and chatted with us a bit toward the end of the meal.

When my wife & I 1st started dating & she told me about New Haven pizza 20 yrs ago (I was living in NYC at the time), I thought she was nuts. Then we went to visit her family & I was hooked. We have eaten at them all several times, but we are hooked on Ernie's. Pat (who owns Ernie's) & his staff/family are fantastic; as accommodating & friendly as can be. My family has  lived in NJ for the past 17 yrs & will take a special road trip up to Ernie's a few times a yr for a pizza fix. When we do, we make sure to clear out our freezer to bring home some extra pies, (they reheat GREAT). We also get several orders from neighbors that we have gotten hooked, often bringing home 10+ pies (remember they only take cash if you plan to order extras). My wife & I  have to travel to Boston a few times a yr for business & will call a day or 2 ahead to order pies for on our way home. Since Ernie's is just off the Merritt, it is a simple & easy to get off the highway, grab the pies, get back on the road & have a very happy family when we get home. Once the restaurant was closed for a death in family, & I picked up pies at Pepe's. upon getting home I wrapped up 3 pies to put in the freezer & put 2 more in the oven to warm up.

Arrived on a recent Saturday evening to find the place empty, despite the Saturday Night ribs special. Problem was you had to order a full rack, enough to feed a family of four, for $50. Apparently the kitchen lacks knives sharp enough to cut the ribs into human-sized portions. So much for the special. So I ordered a burger and shortly received a glistening slab of ground beef with melted cheese, a bun, and some pickles. No lettuce or tomato. I asked the waitress whether they might happen to have a tomato in the kitchen, whereupon she flushed and said, No, we have no tomatoes in the kitchen. That's a shame, I said. Might they have a bit of lettuce to liven up the extra boring burger? No, no lettuce. But wait, I countered, you serve salads don't you? And didn't you just describe the beautiful local bib lettuce purchased from the farmers market that very morning? Would you mind asking the chef if he could spare a single piece of lettuce, pretty please? She flushed a bit more and said she would ask, but she wasn't promising success. A short time later she returned and said that the chef would consent to give me some lettuce, but that he was going to have to cut it for me. Hurray, he does have a knife after all! Seconds later, a plate appeared bearing four stately leaves. Joy! After we had finished eating, a fellow at the next table asked if he might also have some lettuce on his burger. No, the waitress said, we don't put lettuce on our burgers. But _they_ got lettuce, he pointed out, as she tried to justify the refusal of basic burger garnish. Eager to help, we passed the remaining two leaves across the table. Don't worry dude, we've got you covered. Nothing worse than a badly dressed burger.",1.0,-1,1

Good thing we love goat cheese but we were also glad that we decided to share our entree after we ordered this! As if these two apps. weren't enough the waiter was nice enough to bring us out a sample of the scallop special and a taste of the meatball appetizer. The hash which came under the scallop was delicious and the pine nuts mixed in with the meatballs were a nice touch. While these were great, the goat cheese flat bread and gnocchi appetizers still stole the show. For our entree, we shared the Jane Burger. The burger was done just right with a crusty bun and absolutely delicious crispy fries. Once again the portion size was very nice and we really enjoyed the rosemary that was mixed in with the fries. While everything was delicious, make sure you save room for dessert! The milk and cookies was by far the best thing of the night. We were served  3 LARGE warm chocolate chip cookies which were sweet and perfect. Next to the cookies was a tall glass of cold milk with a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside.

My first issue - they don't serve true Singapore laksa here.  That's just heresy!  Asam laksa is okay, but unless you like a sour/fish-based broth, Singapore laksa is just better.  They have a similar substitute in the form of Curry Mee, but it's just not the same.  However, at least the CM has good flavor and will satisfy most folks looking for a rich, savory broth to go with their noodles. The Hainan chicken rice here is fine, but note the portions aren't that big.  You'll probably need to add another side like their solid roti, statay tofu or satay chicken/beef skewers to feel satisfied.  Other notables include the beef rendang, which is fairly good.  Their nasi lemak is also pretty good, and does remind me of the ones I used to eat when I was living in SE Asia.   If you're in the city, this is a great place to consider.  But if you're serious about Singaporean/Malaysian food, definitely consider Taste Good in Elmhurst.",4.0,1,0

I much prefer Mistral because of the atmosphere, price and small plates options.

This had me pretty thrilled as it is usually not the case at Katja. We started by sharing the beet salad with caraway, goat cheese, and pumpkinseed oil--all in all it was pretty fantastic though I wished the taste of the pumpkinseed oil came through a little more, and that the caraway seeds were integrated a little better. They were just sprinkled raw on a hunk of goat cheese. We both had a liptauer sandwich (my favorite, and ridiculously inexpensive at $6), which is a fresh cream-like cheese with paprika over a slice of toasted bread, sprinkled with fresh diced radish and served with a pickled veggie garnish. We lingered with a glass of wine for a while and eventually settled on the warm chocolate cake with cherry compote. This was not really the highlight of the meal. The cake was too densely chocolate for my taste, not very hot, the accompanying whipped cream was kind of sour (?) and the cherry compote was also a little sour and didn't seem very fresh. I wish we would've tried the fig and almond tart. If I come back soon, I'll definitely give that a whirl. We payed a little over $30 a piece and stayed for over 3 hours.

It was delicious, and i love the fact they use flour tortillas for their chips! The lump of crabs in every bite with a tad bit of salsa roja was a nice balance and good way to play up your everyday guacamole. There is probably not enough taco for me on this earth. We split the Shrimp taco and the Mahi Mahi Tacos. They looked adorable, the Mahi Mahi tacos look like little bundles of joy tied like a gift. Never thought breaded fish would work inside a taco, sounds redundant since its sitting inside a tortilla, but it was SUPERB with the little slaw inside.

My friend and I were blessed with a fantastic server that enlightened us on the Greek wine list and provided friendly recommendations on the food menu as well.  We placed our order and chatted over a large complimentary plate stacked high with warm pita points and a savory red pepper hummus spread. We began our meal with the Htapothi Scharas - slices of grilled, marinated octopus with capers and a balsamic reduction glaze.  The octopus was expertly crisp and devoid of any chewiness, but the balsamic reduction had sadly been over-cooked, giving the dish a subtly charred flavor. My entree of Poached Salmon was perfectly cooked.  As is typical with poached preparations, my fish was on the bland side, but I knew that would be the case when I ordered it.  However, it was served over an unbelievable spinach-rice pilaf.  The topping sauce of sun-dried tomatoes and olives was briny, tart, and hearty all at once.  The dish was very rustic and possessed a Mediterranean flare. My friend's Organic, Boned Chicken Farci was beyond tender.  A lightly crisped skin added texture to the juicy meat within.  The chicken was stuffed with sweet raisins, rosemary, thyme and Kasseri cheese.  It was served with Briam, which was a marinaded mixture of zucchini, eggplant, and potatoes.  The large portion was comforting and fantastic.   Pylos provided us with a complete meal in a dazzling environment.  It was a great way to begin our evening out on the town.",4.0,1,0

The problem is that none of my friends like you. Every time I bring my friends around, you make them mad. You sometimes serve a sub par piece of fish or kill your tuna lettuce wrap appetizer with salad dressing. Every once in a while you run out of an entree. You are always so friendly and they expect things to be great, but then something goes awry and I have to defend you. They tell me I should be spending my time somewhere else. They say there are better places in the West Village to spend my money. They say I am too good for you. I know I should just take their advice and walk away, but you have such a sweet, sweet pork chop.

Out total was only $12 for the entire meal including two cans of soda. I love that the food here does not have much oil or preservatives, my stomach thanks them.  Much better than my past experience at Tasty Hand Pulled Noodle in Manhattan Chinatown, that place made me sick immediately.  If I lived in the area, I would be getting take-out from here daily.

448580,217052,4843,2011-08-04,"I had the wonderful pleasure of hosting my future sister-in-law's bridal shower at Luca's Ristorante in Somerset, NJ.  If I could give the restaurant 100+ stars I would.  It was impeccable service and attention from start to finish. I booked this bridal shower in advance two months ago from Florida.  Yes, I live in Florida.  This restaurant was suggested by my brother, the future groom.  When I called for information one evening they were very busy but Candice spent over half an hour with me on the phone giving me detailed information about the packages/prices they offered for private parties.  I called back a few days later and spoke to the owner, Chef Andrea DiMeglio and we were able to come to a menu and package that suited our needs and budget. Planning this bridal shower from Florida was quite stressful but Chef Andea was exceptionally accommodating and he knew the vision I wanted to create! I visited Luca's the day before the shower and Chef Andrea was there to show me the private room and go over the setup and menu.  I walked in the restaurant and my jaw dropped.  I felt like I was transported to Italy.  The décor in the restaurant is stunning.  The hand made ceramics from Italy were breathtaking. I knew in my heart that this was the place for the bridal shower.  Chef Andrea opened the restaurant an hour early for me the day of the shower.  Nick was my server and he was so attentive to the details from the lighting, the music, the temperature of the room, etc.  Everything was carefully planned.  I was calm because I knew that my party was in good hands. As the guests arrived I can see their expression and look of awe at the restaurant.  They could not believe their eyes!  Many of them said, ""I feel like I am in Italy""!  There were 28 women at this bridal shower.  The guests arrived at 12:30pm and warm bread was immediately offered to them.  Luca's is a BYOB and the guests had their wine poured for them.  There is no drink table- very nice touch.  (Unless you want a drink table).  Each of the guests felt so important.  The bread alone was a meal in itself.  There were several different types of bread that just melted in your mouth.  The Rosemary bread was my favorite.  All the bread was served with seasonings drenched in extra virgin olive oil. The guest of honor arrived at 1pm and I could tell she was just amazed.  The tears in her eyes were enough that I knew that Luca's was the place!  We had a champagne toast.  Appetizers and salads came out promptly.  Food was generous.  Salad was fresh and plentiful and the Italian dressing was delightful.  We had fried calamari and fried zucchini as appetizers.  There was so much on the plate!  These were prepared fresh.  The zucchini was divine!  The best fried zucchini I have ever had.  My niece commented that it was the best fried calamari she has ever eaten! Our server Nick as well as the other servers who helped were so professional.  They dressed profession and addressed everyone by their names.  They were attentive to everyone's needs from drinks to simple things like food allergies.  They knew who were the vegetarians in the group, as well as paying special attention the children in the party.  I cannot say enough about them!!!! They are wonderful!!!  They kept eye contact with me and knew what I was thinking.  Everything was perfect.  Just perfect. Our entrees consisted of a choice of chicken marsala, chicken monte bianco or eggplant rollatini.  The presentation of each entrée was a work of art.  The guest of honor commented that the Chicken Marsala was ""amazing"" and ""the best"" she has had!  Chef Andrea made a special meal for my two nieces and my little 5 year old niece commented ""these chicken fingers are the best ever""!  They were fresh chicken strips made from chicken breasts.  Truly impressive! After the main meal we opened presents.  We brought our own cake and Luca's did not charge a cutting or plate fee.  Dessert and coffee was served.  The coffee was so smooth....love it! The staff coffee was so smooth....love it! The staff at Luca's helped us carry all the heavy gifts out to our car.  They also wrapped up the food that the guests could not finish.  They provided these extraordinary heavy duty take out brown bags with handles for the guests.  Their take out containers were so fancy! This place is heaven.  It is a gem!  I highly highly, highly recommend this restaurant.  The food is incredible.  I visit Las Vegas 2-3 times a year for conferences and this restaurant and their food surpasses the quality of food at the high end Italian restaurants in Vegas. I will definitely return every time I am in NJ.  Chef Andrea does what he does best....creating wonderful food and atmosphere with love and passion.  The prices are reasonable and fair.  It is family here.  I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Chef Andrea's father and brother.  It is a piece of heaven!",5.0,-1,1

My husband ordered the ceviche which had a strange mealy texture that made us wonder how old the fish was.  Our friends ordered the empanadas, which they liked, and may have been the only positive element to our meal.  The puerco I ordered for my entree tasted like airplane food, hardly any flavor and lukewarm. The rest of the group ordered steak, all cooked to medium.  When my husband cut into his, it was raw on the inside. The others cut theirs and it turns out that none of them were even cooked to rare. The server took them all back to have them cooked further. They were returned still undercooked.  Beyond that, they were doused on an A1-like steak sauce. Even the vegetables they came with were all covered in the sauce to a point that everything on the plate was unappetizing.  For dessert, we had the apple tart and the flan.  Flan is supposed to be light and delicate, this flan was overcooked and dense with a gel-like consistency. The apple tart was served cold with ice cream on top. The $1 apple pies at McDonalds are WAY better than this tart from Calle Ocho.  Our bill was $240 with drinks., which I felt really bad about considering how terrible the meal was.  I am at a loss as to how this restaurant could receive such great reviews.

I was traveling by myself and really wanted to sit down and have a meal while I waited the hour for my last flight. I've been to two other Earl of Sandwiches, Vegas and Orlando, at each of these locations you order at the Counter then grab a seat until your pager lets you know your sandwich is ready and grab the sandwich at the pick-up counter and return to your seat.

I had already paid for my sandwich, and did not want to ask for a refund. If any of my friends or family had been with me, they would have made me throw out the sandwich, but I guess it was all the stress of traveling and the smell of the hot sandwich that made me eat some of the sandwich. (I've eaten street food in the Caribbean that had flies buzzing all around the stall and survived, which makes me take some risks with food) The sandwich was still good, but I really couldn't enjoy it or finish it after seeing the conditions it was made in.

155836,10252,1398,2008-07-29,"It's times like these that I wonder how I managed to score my boyfriend. For my birthday gift, he planned out an entire weekend just for the two of us, and Saturday began with lunch at Alma de Cuba. His family are fans of the Starr restaurants, and after my birthday dinner last year at Morimoto, I too have become a convert and the two of us are determined to try each and every Starr restaurant. A birthday lunch at Alma was therefore the perfect way to begin our day. The interior is really nice, modern decor with clean lines. My boyfriend preferred the warm lounge on the first floor, but I enjoyed the second floor's more light and airy feel. Our waiter was clearly new, but he was very nice and extremely attentive. The menu is fusion Cuban cuisine, and damn is it good! We didn't have drinks, but their mojito seems to be popular. We shared their ceviche sampler (which everyone should definitely try), that was a tasting of each of their ceviches: Vuelve La Vida: shrimp, scallops and calamari tossed in a an aji amarillo sauce with cherry tomatoes; Hamachi Tiradito: yellowtail with red onion, cilantro, lime juice and a touch of aji; and Ecuadorian Shrimp: shrimp with roasted tomatoes, chives, avocado and corn nuts. The ceviches were incredible, each one spiced perfectly to accompany the seafood, although I wish that the hamachi had a lighter sauce because I really couldn't taste the fish (which I personally prefer), only the lime juice. We also shared two entrees, a special halibut one with both smoked and grilled halibut over a salad of mesclun, yellow beets and cherry tomatoes, and a cuban-sounding dish that was spinach and cheese layered with plantains and wrapped with zucchini with tomato sauce on top, served over a black bean and pesto spread with an onion-jicama slaw. Damn, damn good, but the plantain dish was waaaay too heavy for me. The halibut was perfect (except for the fact that I don't care for smoked fish EVER), a nice light dish for the hot summer. We both loved the food, but unfortunately didn't have enough (or any) room for dessert, which just means that we'll have to go back again in the near future!!",5.0,1,0

176335,112929,4864,2013-11-26,"For the longest time I've had people tell me about how great the Black label burger is so a couple of friends and I finally decided to make a reservation. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a snooty hostess who did not seem like she cared for our business. We were told to come back when all of our party has arrived without even asking if we would like to wait at the bar for a drink but instead kicking us out into the cold weather. The seating for a 6 person group was less than ideal. My arms have never been bumped so many times and a friend of my had butter spilled on her hair due to the clashing waiters and patrons squeezing through behind us. Our waitress was  very judgmental of the things we ordered. She made some jokes of drink choices I made but I took it as a joke but when we all ordered the burger her attitude became a little pompous. Her words exactly ""While I understand everyone wants the burger I want to let everyone know that we are a Michelin starred restaurant and I'd recommend you to try other things such as our steak."" It took a second for me to realize that the waitress had just dropped the almighty michelin star on us but luckily for us we couldn't care less if the restaurant had 3 stars. We were there for a burger and that is what we ordered. Following the order I did notice the waitresses whispering in the corner and looking in our direction but I'll give them benefit of the doubt and think that they were trying to see how they can make our experience better. Finally, the burger was delicious but not as much as most made it out to be. The fries were some of the best I've tasted but I guess all this hyping up just brought the expectation so high that the reality could never attain hype. The burger meat was one of the best I've ever had but I'm not a fan of the bun and for $28 I was hoping for a lot more justification compared to other burgers in NYC. The foie gras and bone marrow  were amazing and the souffle was perfect as well. All in all i think the burger and food is great at Minetta Tavern but the service and the high price of a marginally better burger puts the rating low for me.

87679,41177,815,2013-11-01,"Wonderful, amazing, incredible... every positive descriptor imaginable belongs in this spot. We got there just as they were opening at 5:30pm on a Thursday, which was good because this place fills up really quickly.  We sat at the counter so we could chat and watch the chefs in action.  I think this should be pretty obvious, but either way, I'll say it: the centerpiece here is clearly the grilled meats, especially the chicken, and more specifically, the unusual cuts, and if you skip that you're probably cheating yourself out of a great meal. We started off the meal with an icy cold Sapporo Draft, good compliment to the grilled chicken, and watched as the chef tended the skewers on the grill.  We got a really incredible variety, bonchiri/bonjiri (chicken 'butt'/'tail', delicious and hard to describe,) seseri (neck), sori (chicken oyster), kawa (skin), tebasaki (wing), negima (breast meat with scallions), hiza nankotsu (cartilage) and nankotsu tsukune (a chicken meatball with scallions and cartilage interspersed), liver, ton toro (pork neck with onion, I think), grilled eggplant miso dengaku and grilled onigiri (rice balls.)   Absolutely everything was delicious.  Out of all those items, the only one I don't think I'd order again was the onigiri, because I prefer the sauce-coated kind and this had a dipping sauce instead.  That said, I liked that most everything was only really salt grilled because it let the delicious fats of the meat speak for itself.  Everything was so good but the things I would absolutely want to get again right away were the bonchiri, ton toro and the nankotsu tsukune.  Those were my surprise favorites, while the kawa, tebasaki, liver, chicken oyster, and negima were all reliably delicious. For the amount we ate, the bill was certainly large but not crazy, I didn't think at least.  The service was good.  Due to the bottleneck being the fact that each skewer needs a specific time to cook, I could see this place not being as great during either the middle of dinner rush/on weekends and such.  However, when you get there right away, not only do they still have the rarer cuts left but they also they are able to take the fully appropriate amount of time on each.",5.0,1,0

Everest on a plate, just unnecessarily massive, yet utterly outstanding.  These fries were thin and crispy, salty and the perfect crunchy accessory to that amazing burger.  The Chicken Stew was quite sophisticated as well, and definitely very hearty.  The chicken was really tender and we really enjoyed the flavor profile of the dish.   Dessert was The Flourless Chocolate Cake as well as the Hazelnut Ice Cream with Shortbread cookies.  I wouldn't recommend the cake, it was extremely dense and rich, and way too much dessert after such a heavy meal.  On the other hand, the delectable ice cream along with the crunchy shortbread cookies, was a nice way to cap off our impressive meal. Too bad our friends visiting from Cali couldn't hack another burger night since that's all they had been eating before coming to New York, because I was planning to take them here.  Instead they went with pizza (which is never a bad idea in NYC), but I tell you, I really wanted them to try The Spotted Pig and have something else to really brag about when they made their way back to the west coast.  Next time, I'll get them and so will TSP.   The Spotted Pig delivers incredibly hearty, and tasty food, in a cozy and chilled out setting.  One dinner here is a meal you will not likely forget, and for all the best reasons imaginable.  Amazing food, great service, fun atmosphere... did I mention amazing food?  Mmm that burger, Lord have mercy!!!",5.0,1,0

I've been to this place many times so far and I love the food.  Plus it is extremely inexpensive in relation to its competition. When I arrive at 7:00 PM I am surprised by the number of available parking spots.  When I walk into the bar, it's practically empty.  Now I do not care since I am at Red Stone to eat dinner, but I was a little depressed by the lack of energy this place has on a saturday night. By the end my meal I felt the same as I did the first time I ate dinner at this establishment.  Because I love the food and think the bar is extremely nice I wanted to provide this feedback. 1) If this place does not do something quick to differentiate itself from Houlihans or other standard fare places, it will fail.   2) The bar is boring and has no energy or pizzazz. 3) The beer choices have barely changed in a year.  Even though I have suggested some new beers to this place, my requests have been ignored. (See below) 4) The staff, while very nice, is slow and dull.  No one smiles and most staff seem depressed to be working on a Saturday night because they are not making money. Here is my first thought: A dedicated, creative, Craft beer bar is what's drawing the crowds these days.  Red Stone is well positioned in-between two, known, Craft Beer Bars (Poor Henry's and Nicole's 10).   Red Stone has more of an upscale feel to it than a ""local pub.""  Between craft beer and the beautiful bar, this place should attract a decent clientele on a Saturday night. IMHO Red Stone cannot compete on food alone.  Nor is it a food factory like Houlihans, Buffalo Wild Wings or Tiffany's.  Maybe Red Stone can create a niche by adding more beer taps and more craft beers or by running more drink specials or even adding live music on the weekends. Whatever Red Stone does, it can only be an improvement over the drab, boring product it is currently offering.  Of course this is just one man's opinion.  However, this is one man who actually took the time to write this review.",3.0,-1,1

215113,130462,1882,2009-12-28,"Having worked in restaurants in Philadelphia and knowing some of the crew responsible for this restaurant I will try to be as objective as possible, and in turn knowing that you shouldn't visit a restaurant in it's first week before they've gotten all the kinks worked out, my wife and I couldn't resist checking it out on day 4.  We'll of course go back and see the progression in a few weeks if not sooner, especially when we can go back for lunch in the future (inevitable), but I have to say that we thought this restaurant was solid from the minute we walked in the door.  To be totally honest this is not a 5 star restaurant, the five stars are there because it wildly exceeded my expectations for the place 4 days in and for the concept as a whole.  Host staff was on it from the get go getting us seated right away and most importantly acknowledging our existence before we even crossed the doorway.  The decor is somewhat of a cross between a futuristic diner and a starkly minimal Momofuku-esque food bar.  Not sure why there aren't more restaurants with open kitchen bars, seeing as in this world full of new ""foodies"" stuck to their tv sets watching every cooking show in existence, wouldn't they want to recreate that experience live in the restaurants they actually eat in? Maybe this is the future? While we didn't sit at the bar we will in the future and were disappointed that we didn't make that decision this time.  Michael Shulson was on hand in the kitchen and despite the place being somewhat empty at 6:30 when we arrived, by 7pm the place was getting packed and the open kitchen was bustling. The LED backlit forest is a very inviting sight from the sidewalk and surely an ""open"" sign for all those passing by.  Anyway, we noticed many familiar staff from stalwart restaurants such as Buddakan and Morimoto surely attributing to the casual, efficient and unobtrusive service style.  The menu is set up in an approachable small plate style with great pricing.  You could probably get out of here for $25 a person, but it's hard to resist (especially on a first visit) not ordering everything to try and walk out having spent much more(but isn't that the point of the small plate movement:).  First things first, Michael Shulson is famous for his edamame dumplings to which he made famous at Buddakan but you won't find the same delicate petite dumplings here but more of a authentic chinese style soft dumpling (read: thicker doughier skin, and in my experience working with Chinese chefs this is the real thing).  Many people may dismiss the dumplings as less refined than those of the style he created at Buddakan but it certainly pleased my wife and I to see this style in such a restaurant in Philadelphia and we hope others can appreciate it as well. I also hate to say it but the Philly cheese steak (yet another restaurant twisting Philly's namesake food) with Sriracha was fantastic.  AND the Pork Bahn Mi.  At $9 I predict this being my lunch on many days headed to work.  For what you would pay to eat a sandwich (and I mean this is a cheesesteak sized roll) for almost the same price anywhere in Center City, you can have this instead.  We had the lobster gyoza, which wasn't our favorite but was solid with a great presentation and the inclusion of what looked like some sort of dehydrated chili balanced with the sweet and acidic 1-2 combo of apples and miso.  Finally we had the shrimp & egg fried rice with Virginia ham, and I have to say that Shulson wins the prize of having the most delicate but fully seasoned fried rice in town.  Light but full of flavor!  The wine prices are approachable and we had the Jovly Vouvray at $40 (a deal considering it is real Loire Chenin), perfect for the food we had.  It arrived less than cold, but possibly had just arrived that day considering how soon after the open we came. Overall a great experience for a concept which we had our eyes on because we are fans of David Chang's Momofuku restaurants in the East Village and wanted something similar in our neighborhood.  Next time we'll be hitting up the Ramen and making the comparison. Great new restaurant for Center City.",5.0,-1,1

352328,184616,3078,2012-11-12,"The quintessential neighborhood bar for this part of Brooklyn. All the bartenders live around the area and are super accommodating. Sometimes the bar is a bit understaffed. In my book, this is all the more reason to tip well and be polite, because, like most locals in the area, they are trying their hardest to pursue a career in the arts while working another job. The drink selection is excellent: they rotate it out on a pretty regular basis, and can always boast 1-2 seasonal brews and at least one interesting, more specialized ale. They also have a good happy hour and good shot-and-beer specials. The cocktails, with names ranging from the Pearl Necklace to the Morning After Pill, are like their names: strong and unique. They also have growlers. The burgers--I can't stress this enough--are excellent. They are maybe the best bar burger I've had in New York. All the other food is good too, but if you are going to try one thing, get the burger: especially considering that during Happy Hour, you get a burger with fries and a beer for $12. A really good deal. As for the ambience: I love it, personally. The paintings on the walls are all from the personal collection of the owner's wife, and they have a full diving suit suspended from the ceiling. Heavy metal/loud music has been playing every time I go there. There's a venue that specializes in heavy metal bands right next door, so this choice makes sense. Personally, I like this about this place: I like knowing what to expect, and I like being able to unwind to music that's harder than the day I had. Overall, just an awesome place that locals love, and lacks all the pretense, but none of the quality, of other Brooklyn bars.",5.0,1,0

235268,9416,2052,2015-01-04,"Before reading up on Montclair, I had no clue there were any Ethiopian restaurants anywhere in New Jersey within an hour of my home.  It's been about a year since I last had Ethiopian food, so when the time came to choose a dinner spot during my recent visit Mesob won hands down.  It also helped that it was mentioned in a couple online articles I had read about the town. When you walk into Mesob, you feel transported.  You're not on busy Bloomfield avenue.  You're inside a comfortable, warm (and well decorated) zone.  The furniture and seats are all nice wood colors.  The walls have a warm white and orange color combination.  Paintings hang on the walls and in the center host island are tall lambs with (what I was told) a foreign alphabet printed onto them.  The appearance is striking and it immediately draws you in.  The smell of delicious spices and food help too! The staff was super nice.  Every server was fast, efficient and sweet.  They genuinely want to please and they do a great job.  We were seated, our orders taken, water provided and food on the table within a twenty minute stretch.  It helped that we knew what we wanted, but keep in mind some dishes require about 15 minutes to prepare since they're made fresh. All the food is served on Injera bread, a spongy, slightly sour bread served in a round shape on a round platter.  The foods you order are generally scooped on top of this bread when you are served, making for a delicious and dramatic presentation!  So here's the verdict on the food I had with my girlfriend: INJERA BREAD Let's start with the basics.  The Injera bread was soft, spongy and had the slightly sour taste you want with this bread.  This also serves as your ""utensil"" to eat with (you rip pieces off and scoop the food up in it) and it held together perfectly. LEGA TIBS Cubed boneless leg of lamb marinated & sautéed with onions, garlic, jalapenos, fresh tomato, herbs & spices.  This can be spicy, but we had it at ""medium"".  It was very tasty and all the spices were just right, not too heavy, not too light.  A couple of meat chunks were tougher than I would've liked, but that was only a couple and not a majority of them. DORO TIBS Scalloped chicken breast marinated & sautéed with red onions, garlic, jalapeno pepper, fresh tomato, herbs & spices.  We also had this medium, but it wound up coming out a bit spicier than the Lega Tibs, but that was fine by me since I like spicy!  The chicken had a nice texture and tasted wonderful. TIKIL GOMEN (Side) Cabbage and potatoes simmered in mild sauce.  I've had this dish in other restaurants before, and it was generally mild.  This version however was packed with flavor and hit me with an unexpected (but pleasant) punch of flavor.  It was also wonderfully tender. KIK ALETCH (Side) Yellow split peas simmered in a mild and flavorful onion and herb sauce.  This is normally a very mild dish, but this version had a sweetness that I really appreciated given the sea of spicy foods on the platter. GOMEN (Side) Fresh collard green simmered in mild sauce seasoned with spice and herbs.  This had a mild flavor.  The greens had a nice chew and I recommend it as a good palette balancer for all the spicy food you might get. MISIR WAT (Side) Split lentils simmered in spicy hot sauce.  This was a lentil dish with some fire!  It didn't burn but it definitely had a flavor that will wake up your taste buds!

The worst service I experienced since eating in Communist China in the 1980s. I order four items: hiya yako (cold tofu with a sauce), oshinko maki (pickled radish roll) , kampyo maki and kappa maki (cucumber roll). These are all standard dishes. I lived in Japan, they are always, ALWAYS made the exact same way. They are one of the most predictable dishes ever. When they arrived, the kappa maki (the cucumber) had some really awful disgusting plum paste smeared all over the inside of the roll moreover, it was rolled inside out. No idea why for either of these. That it was inside out was not so bad, but the vile plum paste made it inedible. I took one bite and had to spit it out, it was absolutely awful. I wondered what would possess the chef to create such an abomination. The waiter came over and ask ""how is everything?"" I told him, and asked him to change the cucumber. He said he could not, I asked ""well why then did you come over to ask how everything was?"" He seemed confused by the question. I called a second waiter over, asked if he could change it as it was terrible and bore no resemblance to the thousands of other cucumber rolls I'd eaten in the past in Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, New York and Los Angeles. He said ""ok, i'll see what I can do."" He returned to say ""the manager says you ordered it, so you can't change it."" I explained I ordered cucumber roll, not this abomination, and insisted he change it. The second waiter came over, bleating that if a customer complains, he gets into trouble, etc etc. I asked to speak to the manager. Suddenly, she was not there, although the woman who greeted us at the door seemed suspiciously like the manager. The first waiter returned and said he took it off the bill, he would pay for it himself out of his own pocket. I assured him this was not necessary, and asked him not to do that, but he insisted. I could not believe it, any of it!

I've been there for Brunch, Lunch, and Dinner, so I have a very good perception overall of the quality.

The best part about brunch-a free cocktail or fresh squeezed juice with a menu option. We went for dinner the other night, and our server was great. We ordered the fried green beens and the potato chips covered in blue cheese fondue. Holy Happiness. For dinner, I had the special, which was paella. My friend had the chicken pot pie, and I will definitely be trying that next time! Both were large portions, served steaming hot, and delicious. Cocktail recommendations: The Sweet Wilbur made with Berkshire bourbon,  sugar maple, cider, bitters, and vanilla salt. The Tickled Pink was delicious too!

My boyfriend and I had dinner at Miya's tonight to celebrate-- and I have to say, even occasion aside, it was hands down the BEST dinner I've ever had. EVER. Sushi and non-sushi, and for a Californian, that's saying quite a bit. For one, the sushi, though non-traditional, is the epitome of so many things that define our culture today-- it is simultaneously experimental, creative, and diverse, all the while satisfying, surprising, and delightful. The space Bun and his staff have created feels like home, and the hospitality is warm and friendly. Miya's has a wonderfully eclectic environment, from the NYT-mentioned record of Puccini's Madame Butterfly in the women's bathroom to the portraits on the wall and the sushi-themed clock in the main room. The menu is practically a novel of Miya's creation-- and at that, a delight to read. Bun is also incredible company, and I'm constantly amazed by what he creates. Favorites/don't-miss-dishes: Ebibaba roll (the most incredible roll of the night-- an amazing combination of lemon dill sauce, tempura shrimp, potatoes-- OMG), Mighty Mother Earth roll, Zoompa roll, and the Water Piglet roll (probably one of my all-time personal favorites-- tuna, cranberries, goat cheese, yum!)... not to mention the dessert roll, Seven Deadly Sushi (an amazingly flavorful dessert roll with super small scoops of rose ice cream, another OMG).

What I found was a pleasant space with Mexican groceries, bins of dried hot peppers and a radio pumping out Spanish Monster Ballads.  The menu was straightforward and so was my order; I decided to go for the chicken tacos.  I took a seat at one of the five tables, and about ten minutes later I was serenaded with three tacos, two sauces and a grilled jalapeno.   What struck me the most was how fresh and clean the flavors were - starchy corn tortillas cooked perfectly, melted queso fresco, a sprinkling of onions & cilantro, and a delicious avocado-based spicy sauce for dressing.  What this place lacks in frills it makes up for in taste and price ($5.50 for all of that!)

We had pasta of the day and the Vietnamese beef salad which were both excellent.  This is such a teeny tiny negative, but the side salad with the pasta had only greens and a light dressing (quite yummy).  I think a couple bites of fruit on it would have added a lot. Took a long time to get our food, but it didn't matter.  The atmosphere was soooo friendly.  We just enjoyed feeling like we were not in let-us-rip-you-off Manhattan. Big disappointment that the date bread pudding was not available.  Server even apologized (apologized!!) and gave us the chocolate souffle.  Gee, a cold glass of milk would have been good with that. We were concerned we might not get in after reading the reviews of it being so small.  It is, but should that happen, there are many restaurants in the neighborhood.  Worth the wait if you have the time, though.",5.0,1,0
518633,238837,763,2010-01-31,"Very nice atmosphere, interior, Euro-shabby chic dressed waitstaff, etc. Party of three arrived at 9 pm on a Saturday night for dessert and drinks. Were told by Borat the maitre'd we would have to wait 15 minutes for a table. Stood by bar for 45 minutes, watching several parties of better dressed people be seated. Were pitied by bus boy and one waiter, who gave us some nuts to nibble while we waited. Everyone was gracious and nice. Finally seated with our drinks, ready to order. When he discovered we only want to order dessert, Borat informs us that only dinner is being served but we do have the option of ""the sofa,"" saying with a slick smile ""You can stay there all night."" Not being the bitchy type, we blithely followed him over to a small sofa tucked behind the Fooz-ball table, in front of a window so drafty we put our jackets back on. There was no table in front of said sofa so we awkwardly held our drinks or had to turn around to put them on the chilly windowsill. (Did I mention it was cold?) Luckily, Borat came to our rescue and brought us a CHAIR to use as a table. A CHAIR. As in the thing one's derriere touchs, not generally used for food consumption. Laughing at the absurdity of the suddenly terrible service we were receiving, we quickly ordered 2 desserts (which tasted fine), paid our bill, and walked past Borat, who cowardly averted his gaze as we walked past him. The food looked delicious and I'm sure if you were ordering a full meal you will enjoy yourself.

In fact she seemed like it was a huge annoyance to have to seat us. Our waitress didn't come to our table for a good 20 minutes. She forgot to get us waters for almost our entire meal.

Our waiter was nice and casual, there's another star. I just liked the whole area and the vintage cheesy pink and blue look of the place, 3rd star. My sister ordered some sort of egg white omelet that had beets and feta cheese in it. I ordered the eggs Benedict. As for food, I'll say meh. I didn't really liked their hollandise sauce, I much preferred Green Egg's sauce. I did liked the spinach however. The potatoes were just regular tasting. Very dry unless bathed in ketchup. My sister's dish was pretty bland. The beets and feta cheese didn't really do anything for the egg white omelet. I can probably make better egg dishes at home which isn't saying much since I'm not really a cook but I am obsessed with eggs. So in conclusion, I'll go there again if I just feel like getting a quick bite and I happen to be in the area. I won't be standing in any lines for this place. The biggest draw for me though is the set up, cute little neighborhood. Love the outside seating even though we sat inside.",3.0,-1,1

By far the best I have had in Queens or Manhattan. The chicken was flavorful and not dry at all. (my biggest complaint of chicken)  The sauce was very good and the salad and rice were good as well. The guys at the cart were really friendly and they gave me a piece of Falafel while I waited in line which was really nice and unexpected.

Everyone at our table had something different and everyone left satisfied, which was nice. The place is huge and busy, but we were sat rather promptly and attended to rather quickly... at first. I guess my lone complaint would be the service. Our server was forgetful, slow, and tried to rip us off - took us for dumb tourists, evidently. First off, he served us the wrong number of drinks and then it took him forever to correct his mistake. Secondly, he forgot the bacon in my daughter's ""Eggs and Bacon"" dish. None of these mistakes really annoyed me that much. What annoyed me was all of the ""mistakes"" on our check. He overcharged us for two drinks, and he charged us for a side of bacon ($4.50), even though we were still charged the full price of the eggs and bacon dish. What seemed weird was that he deleted the drinks from the check, but didn't delete the side of bacon and simply gave us $5 cash. Oh well, at least the food was tasty.",3.0,1,0

We were in the area and hungry for falafel & shwarama, so based on the Yelp review of someone I trusted (myself) we came here.  Two years has not been kind to Hummus & Pita Co. First, the ordering process.  Right up to the counter, with numerous ordering options and pricing structures, like a combination of a value menu at McDonald's and Chipotle.  Busy place, so I ordered in 5 seconds, regretting my pick quickly enough.  Still, a shwarama pita stuffed with the good stuff should still be good.  Nope. I work down the process, get everything, and watch the ordering process fall apart both in front and behind me, when someone who doesn't know what to do tries to order at checkout and is taken, then others change their order - just not a well-run machine.  The ordering process should be easier, and people who come to the register to order food shouldn't be allowed to do so.  Uy. But the worst was the food.  The meat was unflavored and dry.  Her pita was cold and chalky, not heated or alive - tasted like it had been baked a week ago and put in a box.  The couscous was reminiscent of plastic balls with as much flavor as plastic.  The hummus was okay, nothing special, not anywhere as good as I remember.  Even the soda fountain was super low on carbonation. Things were a mess at the counter and remained so during my time there.  I remember this place being great, but now, not so much.  Two years for a two star decline is no joke, but that's what's happened here.  When the street cart outside has better meat and flavors than the restaurant, two stars is the result.",2.0,1,0

Convenient! They don't take reservations which was fine since we lived so close. I thought the wait would be terrible on a Sunday but they had a table ready for us within 20 minutes. Wonderful!

It was steaming hot and was the perfect way to start the morning before the bubblies came. $4.25 Mimosa---No brunch would be complete without this. I just wish they offered an endless mimosa deal for Sunday brunches. $10 a pop is quite steep, don't you think? Escargot---Served with the shells, the platter was overflowing with garlic butter. It was a popular dip on the table after all the escargot was devoured in seconds. $9.50 yelp.com/biz_photos/le-g… Les Moules Mariniers---Huge pot of mussels.

I ask the guy at the ware house while I was waiting to get loaded if I could find something to eat nearby. He recommended Rutt's Hutt. He said (The best burgers and Dogs you'll ever eat.) Now my wife had taken a week off to ride with me so we walked down a couple of blocks and there before my eyes was a parking lot full of Street Rods, Old Cars and a D.J. playing 50's music. I was in immediate Car heaven! So we went into the back side and a man behind the counter was yelling out (Hotdogs, Hamburgers Pepsi) so we ordered two burgers some Fry's and a couple of Pepsi's. The guy behind the counter said (Do you want gravy on those burgers) Now I had never had gravy on a burger so I thought what the heck, (sure I said.) That was the best burger I'd ever eaten and my wife agreed. We went out sat on the ground and ate with a smile on our faces. Then we strolled the entire parking lot checking out the cars. There were a lot of great people there, and it took me back to a time when I was a kid at the local A&W drive in back home, except the burgers were far better. I was so impressed I bought an R.H. T shirt.  A year later a friend was going to New York on business and I told him if he had some time to kill drive your rental car out to Clifton N.J. and find Rutt's Hutt. I told him the story, so he did and he called me on the phone and his words were ( Dude you were right about that place great burgers and dogs) Now I have not been back since, but in my younger days I was a touring Rock-N Roll musician and I have eaten in every kind of Restaurant and roadhouse you can think of.

553474,44379,4665,2013-08-11,"I come here with friends for quick sushi and I like the conveyor belt idea. It's great for times when you want something convenient but not so much when you want a slow and relaxing dinner. The sushi itself is just about the same as supermarket and the plates are color-coded according to price. I've noticed that they've raised the prices a few times. I remember when the green plate (cheapest) was $1.50 and then they raised it to $1.75, and when I went last week, the price was now at $1.95. I was kind of shocked at this but I guess they want/need to make more $$. For the green plate, one of the selections I pick out often is the salmon roll, which is just six small pieces of sushi with seaweed on the outside and rice and a small cube of salmon in the center. I like to ask for spicy mayo on the side for dipping sauce. As far as the other plates go, they are average at best, nothing very spectacular, very 'staying on the safe side'. I also notice they have a lot of imitation crab meat and chicken meat in their sushi rolls. Not much sashimi or other raw fish options. If you want a wider selection try Sushi House in Rocky Hill. And here is my opinion on their service: pretty awful. They seemed to be understaffed sometimes and I know the restaurant is basically serve yourself from the belt, but when it comes to drink refills, requests for miscellaneous stuff, and the bill--the servers are nowhere to be found. The bartenders are usually on their phones and the sushi 'chefs' ignore everyone else. When I glance into the kitchen I see a couple of kitchen staff but the waitstaff are lacking in quality. One server basically rushed my friend and I out of the restaurant when it was empty in the afternoon and waited for us right next to our table as we got out our money to pay the bill....then he proceeded to swipe the tip I left on the table and put it in his pocket-- just as I had put it down for about 2 seconds. Very appalling and I hope to see better service from waitstaff. One other time I was here, the waitress was very impatient and gave me attitude when I reminded her I asked for my bill 20 minutes ago.

The food was phenomenal and I absolutely loved the space. The decor is lovely and I immediately thought that the back room would be an amazing spot for a party. We spoke to the owner, Pat, and he could not be more gracious. About 2 days later I got the ball rolling and scheduled a halloween costume party for the night of October 30, 2010. 3 hours, open bar (craft beers, wine, well liquor) as well as some great appetizers (we chose: sliders, chicken satay, and veggie potstickers) for $45 a head. Each guest paid at the door and received a bracelet. They have many other options for planning private parties and really help you along the way deciding exactly what will work for you. The staff was very kind and helpful making the party a complete success! They reorganized the furniture in the room, took some out, and made the space exactly how we wanted it. We brought baked goods and party favors that they gladly stored for us and brought out toward the end of the evening. Service was seamless and followed a timeline that we laid out.

For my first stop here, I dined alone at the bar and ordered the 10oz prime rib.  I normally enjoy my steaks mooing, but was informed that the best they could do was medium; I went for it anyway.  The steak came out closer to medium well and was a little tougher than I would like (for which I will absolutely not ding the restaurant; I knew what I was getting into), but it was very flavorful.  Their mashed potatoes were excellent.  Their mixed veggies of summer squash and zucchini were served swimming in butter and also delicious.  I capped the meal off with a snifter of Woodford Reserve for an all-around pleasant experience. My second visit was with my brother who was in town on business.  After our first choice for dinner didn't pan out, we came here.  I again ordered the prime rib, but was informed that the best they could do was well done, which was simply out of the question (to quote my brother: ""The cow already died for us once; why kill it again?"") .  My brother and I each went for the T-Bone, which was amazing.  Perfectly seasoned and a true-rare preparation (harder to find than one would imagine).  One could have cut the filet side of the steak with a butter knife.  Service at the bar was a little spotty, with the bartender disappearing for long periods at a time.  Still, it was Brewfest Friday, so I'm sure he was swamped.  Regardless, he was very friendly and knew his stuff.

The place was smaller than expected and I assume smaller than they would like it to be because the place was PACKED. Every seat and space used allowing one to get friendly with their neighbor especially if you want to be noisy and look at what someone else is eating. Doing it sly is hard to buck up and ask what their eating cause I did and found out about the MAC ATTACK. Three medium servings of different styles that were gooey and intense in flavor. Personally favored the Buffalo Style and Smoked Gouda with Bacon. And not the bits type either. Priced perfect for sharing for 2 but be warned. This serving with the bread and a glass of one of their signature cocktails is enough for a meal which means my dinner went into a doggy bag and didn't even get chance to get to the dessert menu. Entree choice was the Butternut Squash Ravioli which consisted of 6 huge BS. raviolis with roasted butternut squash squares scattered around. Toasted pine nuts and sauteed sage in a Meyer Lemon butter sauce surrounded the yummy confection. Now, one may not think this is anything new, common ingredients but I enjoyed the addition of arugula, garlic slices, stuffing croutons, and large shavings of Parmesan cheese. The bites I had there were really good and hearty and having it for breakfast the next day tasted even better. Definitely going back. The waiter was very nice and did a great job considering the amount of tables he was handling. The missing star is for the fact that I think the restaurant knows how good it is and piles a lot of people in there plus, by serving if I must say, large portions, people can sit there and eat that much so they take the food to go making a normal 1-11/2 hour dinner sit down into 30-40 mins.

Why do the cars that use valet parking need to be parked in the parking closest to the front door?  They have half the parking lot set up for valet and it is the half that is closest to the door.  What is the point of that?  The cars that use valet parking should be parked further away and let the paying customers park in the spots nearest to the restaurant.  I guess that is too logical for this establishment.  They want to make sure that their valets only have to walk a short distance and let their customers walk to the end of the lot.

Not so sure about date night but if your date is OK with casual, still a nice place to eat. Got a bit loud when there was a table pushed together with 5 kids at it but not too loud to hear your dining companion. Looks like it'd be really nice in the summer when the awnings off, unfortunately it was up and the room was rather hot with space heaters placed above each table. Toasty! They brought a bread with some olive oil to the table when we sat down but the bread was just OK. We split two filet of soles, one fried and one grilled, because neither of us have been long in the fish(and meat) eating realm(two long-time vegetarians) so were wary of dropping $20+ on a dish of fish we weren't sure we'd like and thought it'd be nice to compare the two different cooking methods for the sole. Next time, I think I'll go for the snapper as I saw a few people eating it and it looked delicious. The fried sole was basically fish and chips, good white fish fried with tartar sauce. It was OK, good for kids or someone who isn't a fan of fish(as they'll find it hard to eat on this menu) but if you're really looking for something yummy/different and aren't in the mood for fish 'n chips, I'd just steer clear. The grilled sole was delicious(as any grilled filet of sole should be!) and done perfectly. Lemon potatoes were OK, I prefer mine a little crispy but maybe the Greek way is to have them mushier.

I like to think I'm grouped into the former, so I took a trip out to Midwood with my parents to treat everyone to an experience. Dom DeMarco is a living legend in pizza - this man has made the same pies, by hand, himself, for over five decades, and the delicious pies he fusses over day in and day out have been rated the best in New York by Zagat and the ""best of the best"" by Anthony Bourdain. But none of that should matter. Go for the food, brave the lines and the wait, grab a beer at a bodega nearby or get a coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts down the street after you put in your order and wait. Dom will stretch the dough by hand, ladle over some fresh tomatoes, freshly grate some cheese (two types of mozzarella), and pop the pizza in the oven. When it comes out, he'll freshly cut some basil leaves and sprinkle some parmesan cheese over it, pour some great olive oil over, and eventually, your name will be called and your steaming hot pie will be ready to eat. The texture of the pie is amazing. The dough is perfectly cooked, and while many pizzerias will have the cheese, tomatoes, and dough in three separate layers, at Di Fara, it's all in one, flawless piece. The umami flavors from the parmesan add great depth to the slices, as do the freshness from the basil leaves.

276843,155759,76,2014-06-26,"Very disappointed in my visit to Jimmies of Savin Rock today.  My family have a long history of going to that restaurant, back to when it was known more as a drive in for hotdogs than a seafood restaurant.  My parents used to bring us there for hotdogs when we were very young.  Later it was the first ""real"" restaurant that they would bring us to.  It's where we learned how to behave in a restaurant!  Even after all these years, when eating fried food is a very rare treat, Mom and I still like to go there a few times a year for a ""fried clam fix.""   Today we were disappointed by both the food and the service.  Jimmies always served big portions.  Inevitably you would bring some home with you, even if you were there for lunch instead of dinner.  Today we saw that they have drastically reduced their portions.  Now, I wouldn't necessarily mind a restaurant having a more reasonable portion, especially if it had a more reasonable price.  After all, the economy is what it is.  But we were shocked when my fried whole belly clam ""platter"" came on a tiny plate like you would put under a sundae to catch drips.  On that plate was a medium-sized baked potato, a small piece of toast, lemon wedge, tartar sauce, and seven, count 'em, seven fried clams.  Seven.  My mother had a similar plate, hers was a combo...she had seven clams, and nine fried shrimp.  *Blink* The price of these dishes was $16.75 each.   Unpleasantly surprised, we asked to speak with the manager.  When we entered Jimmies the people in front of us at the hostess station expressed surprise that there was a 10 minute wait for a table.  The ""hostess"" snorted and said.  ""Welcome to summer.  Have a seat.""  When we gave our names she also told us to ""have a seat.""  Not, ""why don't you have a seat in the bar?  It's a good day for a cocktail,"" or something pleasant like that.  Just ""Have a seat,"" in a rather bored tone.  This ""hostess"" was apparently the manager, because it was she who came over when we asked.  She proceeded to tell us that what we had received was the ""lunch portion"" that everything was weighed now, and the seven clams on my plate would have amounted to 8 oz....their standard lunch portion.  We said that we were surprised...we had been there for lunch before, and not so long ago, and the portions were much larger, and was told that we were wrong.  I pointed out that my mother's dish had roughly twice the seafood on it as mine, and was the same price.  This manager told us that she could see that my mother had ""way too many shrimp"" on her dish.  I said, ""So, you're saying that the meal that my mother is satisfied with is an error, and the meal that I'm dissatisfied with is correct?""  And she said ""yes.""  She offered to take different orders from us, but we declined.  We had the type of food that we came for...just not as much of it as we wanted.  When we said we would be unlikely to come back again, she shrugged and said ""That's your choice.""     So, Jimmies no longer cares about their customers, and their customers have been faithful to them, as Jimmies menu never changes.  There are no new, inventive dishes.  Few concessions made to healthy eating.  The decor is worn and dated and their restrooms cramped and disgusting.  Their crab meat and corn chowder uses imatation crab, and their rolls are right out of the package and not warm.  We will no longer go there.",1.0,-1,1

She spoke very highly of this establishment and I was hoping that it would make my journey from NYC worthwhile. The atmosphere was fine and the meal started out great. Everything went downhill when I received my food (I ordered the Shrimp and Grits). My friends had no issues with their orders. The menu stated that the grits come with 6 shrimp, beef gravy and toast. Sounds fine, right? When the grits came out, there were only 4 shrimp with the order. I immediately raised it to the attention of the waitress and she said ""I will fix it"". This is when s^&% really hit the fan. The owner, Vonda comes over to the table and is immediately on the defense explaining that they changed the size of the shrimp but kept the price of the dish the same and the price of shrimp in America has increased, blah blah blah. It has been all over the news, you didn't know? So I calmly told her that I only wanted what was listed on the menu and that it was my first time in her establishment. There is no way I could have known that the item I ordered had been altered nor did the waitress let me know upon ordering or when she was made aware. She simply said that she would correct the issue. So then Vonda goes on to break it down again : In Ame-ri-ca, shrimp is expensive and she pays $3.50 per shrimp and she flat out refuses to honor the menu and simply states that she doesn't want to give me the shrimp. 0_0 Next, she abruptly stops addressing me and begins speaking with my friend that is a regular there. Um rude much? She goes on to bad mouth the waitress and say it was her fault for not telling me when it is clear to us that she had no idea that the menu changed. When she sees we aren't buying it, she storms off and begins yelling in front of the entire restaurant and made a scene. This lady was extremely unprofessional and rude. I actually feel sorry for her. Her behavior is the reason why so many black-owned businesses have a bad rep. I hope the waitress finds a job somewhere better because she did not deserve that treatment.

The steak itself was decent meat cooked very well... slightly strong on black pepper and smothered in white american. Finely diced (VERY finely... kudos)  thoroughly cooked onions on a pretty soft/doughy roll (usually not my thing, but it works for this behemoth). next comes a layer of thin (not quite shoestring) fries that are laid to rest under a blanket of cole slaw. It's a pretty outstanding sandwich. Was digging this place so much that I went back today for lunch. I ordered a sardine sandwich ($2) and the pork sandwich ($8). The sardine sandwich was prepared similar to a tuna salad. The ingredients were fresh and the sardine adds a nice but very subtle oily fish funk. The superstar by far was the pork sandwich. Freaking phenomenal... period. Slow-cooked pork (shoulder?) pulled/shredded and crispy at the corners/ends. It's seasoned well (again slightly strong on black pepper). The meat alone is pretty divine... but then there's the white spread... some kind of mayo meets horseradish meets boursin creation. This combined with the perfectly prepared pork is simply divine. ...And then there's the bread. it's served on a ciabatta... a cibatta that is grilled to the point that it's almost a pretzel... but not quite. It's hard & crunchy on the edges but still soft and firm underneath. It's perfect. Cook it any harder and it's a hockey puck... any less and it's just like anywhere else. They brushed it amply with oil before putting it on the heat and the crispy inside face of the roll holds retains good bit of the oil. Makes for the perfect texture to liven up the tender pork & spread mixture it surrounds. Almost forgot about the beer... great prices... like really great prices. Kenzinger is $3.

383326,195575,3254,2010-05-16,"Well... have to admit that the Yelp crowd is quick! Tap House doesn't even have its grand opening until later this week and I appear to be the 6th writer in with an early opinion. In fairness, they've had a week or so now to serve a few hundred patrons and they're still working out some kinks but having tried a couple entrees, I'd like to compliment them on their rock bass and on their efforts on behalf of the vegetarian crowd. Let me say that I'm not a vegetarian, even though I know vegetarian options are frequently better for me. I just like good food and I thought the barbecued seitan was really tasty. Portions were more than adequate. I'll watch to see that they stay that way. Our table shared a number of the apps. I loved the sausage trio, the sweet potato fries, and the cheese plate. The kitchen seemed pretty brave in a ""pre-opening"" sort of way. They served a crowd of at least a hundred on the evening that we were there. The chef still managed to visit with us and the wait staff never got flustered. The atmosphere is outstanding... eat inside... eat outside (above the street traffic, btw). Decor and design are two strengths. The place is visually impressive...  a huge, polished copper bar (as someone else mentioned) then all the slate and reclaimed wood. I like places that feature kitchens, which are open to the dining area. Of course, it is a TAP house. Sixty brews on tap! Is there another place in the region with that many beers on tap? It's a widely and wisely varied selection... the beer steward stopped with us to advise on some of the more exotic brews. He probably had a lot to do with the compilation of the beer menu. The bar appears well stocked but to be honest, unless I'm going the romantic route with a red wine or feeling in a Makers Mark sort of mood, beer is what matters. Tap House doesn't try to be Monk's. They just feature a lot of interesting, fresh beers at prices that are close to or maybe a tad below what I'm accustomed to at other class beer joints around town (Monk's, Eulogy, Belgian Cafe, etc.). Great place for before or after the movies at The Bridge. I'm excited about the Center City expansion into the West Philly / UPenn area. It is early yet so I'm reserving a second opinion for later (like maybe once the place has been open for a month) but I most definitely liked what I saw and tasted.

Plus my (semi-vegetarian) friend was able to check Percy Street off her 50 best Philly Restaurants to-do list (courtesy of Philly Mag). Very productive dinner. The new menu did not disappoint. I would highly recommend (in order of deliciousity): -Pork Belly (crispy tender mapley scrumptiousness w/ crispy potato bread AND yolk) - Mac and cheese (creamy, crusty, cheesy perfection) -Spare Ribs (SO tender, and the pickled watermelon rind was...awesome) -Sliced Brisket Sandwich (a bit small but SO good, tender, and the combo of pickled green tomatoes, sharp cheddar, and horseradish sauce was delectable) -PECAN PIE-(yes, Percy St, I WOULD be proud to partake in your pecan pie) -BBQ fries (fries, with tender brisket, and cheesity cheese. YUM) -Chopped Salad (buttermilk dressing bath later, anyone?) -Brisket Cobb (this was HUGE, really great though) I think I just ran out of synonyms for delicious. Although good, I would skip the avocado salad (just basically avocado), and poached shrimp (good, but not life-altering, the pickled veggies were a nice touch though). My friends also had the deviled eggs (comes with three) and some drinks, because I was late, and really enjoyed them. They also got some pimento cheese from the kitchen while waiting, which was really good. Alright that was all for four girls. Don't judge. There was even a coleslaw side too, and a satisfied kindavegetarian. Ok there was some moaning afterwards. We were stuffed, very satisfied, and departed with leftovers in hand. To the new menu haters: The portions are smaller, yes, and there are only 2 smaller bbq sauces on your table now, but you are getting much more inventive and delicious BBQ options, for still a very decent price.

On Friday evening we stopped in Jacob's for a snack and drinks. We loved the pickled carrots and fried pickles, and the unique beer list. The guy sitting next to us noticed we were enjoying ourselves and struck up a conversation for a few minutes about how much we like the place. Fifteen minutes later a manager stopped by to tell us he had a dessert for us. He pointed to the man we had been talking to and said the dessert was compliments of Jacob. We did not make the connection at first, but soon realized Jacob was the owner. We thanked him for the dessert and made a reservation for Sunday brunch. We came back Sunday and had an amazing breakfast.  The breakfast biscuit sandwiches were like nothing I have ever had before. The cheese was so fresh and delicious, the home made sausage was fantastic, and the biscuit was amazing.  My wife also thoroughly enjoyed the biscuits and gravy, and even my little girl cleaned her plate (if you have a 5 year old, you know that's a rare occurrence). I've read the other reviews, and all I can say is that the service here was outstanding and friendly. We were truly treated like guests, and the entire experience on both occasions was perfect. I read the complaints about the wait times (which we did not experience), and based on the meals and service, I can understand why people wait hours for a table here. If you do not want a wait, there are many other places up and down the block, but none compare to Jacob's.

The fries are the skinny kind that I like, and next time I'll get three sauces because they go great on the fries. I had the bad luck to arrive just after a group of fifteen, but the owner himself noticed that I was getting twitchy waiting for my order and gave me a drink on the house. I ended up waiting about 20 minutes for my order, which unless there is a line out the door is likely a worst-case scenario. I still consider the service to be excellent. The owner helped with the cooking, running the food, and in between came out front to apologize for the wait, offer drinks on the house, and entertain the customers with stories about the restaurant's appearance on the Food Network. All of the staff were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The chicken was entirely worth the wait, and the slightly elevated prices, and I left stuffed and happy.

It was more or less the best brunch omelet I've ever had. I think the key was the seasoning. These guys season everything so there's a lot of 'sweet' and 'salty'. It worked on my omelet and homefries, but might be overkill for more subtle dishes. Coffee was great but orange juice tasted too sugary. Overall the food by itself deserves the 4 stars.

Water glasses were brought over to the table and I went to the counter to place an order for myself and my dining companion, Simone A. I love that the tables have everything you could possibly need - flatware, napkins, salt, pepper, ketchup and Cholula. All my usual staples! Simone ordered the grilled cheese of the day and some tomato soup, which she said were both very good. I opted for the BLT, no mayo, add avocado. We also shared a side of the baked parmesan fries. Both sandwiches came with awesome dill pickles. I was really surprised that the bread for the BLT was not toasted - I would have asked if I had known. Otherwise, the sandwich was nice, but I did have a little regret for not going with my other choice, the Cuban. The fries definitely had that distinct baked texture - not a lot of crispiness to them - but they came with a lot less residual guilt than if they had been fried! No one came around to refill waters so we had to take our cups back to the then-busy counter to ask. Maybe some carafes on the ledge by the window for people to self-serve would be helpful!

Honestly, you'd be better off just daydreaming about eating a cheesesteak rather than ruin it by getting one from Sonny's. Awful. Just awful. **ADDENDUM** Yes, I'm clearly delusional.

She said she went there a few years ok and it wasn't anything special. I did a little research thinking it was just because it had just opened. To my surprise zahav had found it's way on to two very prestigious lists. Philly's top 5 restaurants and a top 101 restaurants nationwide (it was on of three philly restaurants that made the list vetri, and le bed were the other two). With that said I told my girlfriend let's give it another try for my mom's bday. We decided on the 38 prix fixe meal for everyone, thinking it would give us a nice sampling of everything from the menu. Let me first say this: HAVING INTERESTING FOODS ON THE MENU SUCH AS BEEF CHEEKS, DUCK HEARTS, SWEET BREAD, ETC. DOES NOT MAKE A RESTAURANT AN INSTANT GOURMET DE FORCE. Ok back to the review. Being the bold foodie I am, my family and I decided to order some of the more interesting dishes. The first course was the 8 salads and hummus. The salads were nothing special, and the hummus was even more mediocre. I believe I read an earlier review that stated Dmitri's hummus is way better.... I COULDN'T AGREE MORE!!! moving on.... Our next course was the mezze, which included the chicken liver, duck hearts, lamb tar tar, beef kiggle, cauliflower, beet salad, and the haloumi cheese. One would think that out of 7 dishes one would have stood out. Among the 7 all were mediocre at best and left our palettes questioning the rest of the meal. The final course came (chicken, duck kebab, beef cheeks, and eggplant) and yet again a huge disappointment. I would love to rip apart each dish individually but the dishes were so unnoteworthy that I couldn't even begin to recall what each dish consisted of. Finally our waitress failed to mention prior to ordering that their freezer was not operating and there would be no frozen items served with desert. UGH!

As appetizers we had the meatballs and the albondigas skewers - the meatballs were to die for, oozing cheese... and the octopus was grilled to perfection even though it tasted a bit dry. In retrospect, a little lemon juice would have been perfect. For the main dishes, my boyfriend had the grilled shrimp and i had the black bass. His shrimp was good, it had a bean sauce which made it interesting, but my dish was truly amazing. It came with rice mixed with corn, asparagus and crab meat. So incredibly good!

Hopefully you know what pies you want as soon as you sit down without wasting their time. The wait staff are fairly impatient and you better have your shit together if you don't want to wait a long time to get your order. Once seated, you can get your pies anywhere from 15 minutes to 90 minutes, and I think a lot of that has to do with how quickly you can order without acting snooty or needy. The pie itself is going to be the best you have ever tasted. Better than Frank Pepe's, better than Roberta's, better than Grimaldi's and better than anything in Old Forge. The pizza is served in a commercial baking sheet. The shape is not round nor square. More of an oval shape, but some of the edges bleed into the square corner. The crust is ashen and leaves your fingers black. The sauce is thin and spread evenly throughout but packs a punch. The cheese is oily, but layered to perfection, not too heavy, not too light. The pies are sliced up in a kind of obscure pattern, but the slices can kind of be eaten in two to three bites, and each pie usually has 16-20 slices. The taste is going to wreck your pallete, in a good way. The slices kind of melt in your mouth. The sauce is kind of watery and it coats the entire top layer of the slice. The crust has the perfect consistency and the bottom is charred from the brick oven. Well worth the wait.",5.0,-1,1

A few days ago, I left a question on Vietnam Cafe's facebook wall asking if any desserts were vegan (I'm one of THOSE people), and I was informed that they all contain dairy. Oh well. No dessert for me, but I could at least still have a cheap dinner! Upon arriving, our waiter informed me that the 3 pudding desserts were, in fact, vegan. I took the risk!

That said I will give them another go because the service was good and the atmosphere great - even if the music was a bit too loud and rock-like for that hour.",3.0,-1,1

As it is so often said, with great ascension comes great responsibility. I got in the car and was instantly drawn to Boerum Hill. It was as if a voice was quietly whispering directions to the burger promised land. I then realized that Sean M. was with me, and wondered why he was whispering. We walked in. Amongst the ~20 tables, only a party of five was eating, while a brunette with impossibly blue pants was sitting alone at the bar. We looked at the menu, which used a lot of words to essentially ask, ""burger or hot dog?"" We both ordered the Breakfast Burger. 10 minutes later, I was presented with a buttery brioche bun, on which rested the most perfect patty, bacon and fried egg I had ever laid eyes on. I picked up my cholesterol vessel and took a bite. The giant liquid explosion that ruptured forth from the egg could not have been a better metaphor. This burger is the reason people laugh at the Shake Shack lines. This burger is the reason that America won the Cold War. This was the best burger I can ever remember having in this fine city. Why not five stars? The fries were average, they need to offer more sides, and since the restaurant decor is nicer than the menu suggests, it was odd that the waiter appeared to be wearing his ""laundry day"" t-shirt. But 4 out of 5 cardiologists agree that you shouldn't be dissuaded from coming here.",4.0,1,0

The food is always good quality, made fresh, and the servers are great. I have eaten on both sides, the bar and restaurant, and they are equally good. The restaurant menu changes every now and again, but it's all locally grown stuff where it can be. The State Street Sirloin, and the rack of lamb are my two favorites on the restaurant side. Always good to perfection, and the ONE TIME I had to send the lamp back because it was overcooked, there was no issue, and they were super nice about it. On the bar side, I usually get a CM's burger, though the Open Face Steak Sandwich is by far one of the best I've ever had. They have curly, sweet potato, and steak fries, and give you extra pickles at no charge. The pear salad is pretty awesome, but even the regular salad is delicious too.

It's actually ironic, but their authenticity is probably the only thing that's preventing them from being even more successful -- Dim Sum Garden rewrites the definition of a Mom and Pop's restaurant in that unlike most sensible restaurants that portion out each dish and follow some sort of a set recipe in consideration of profits, labor costs and etc., Dim Sum Garden seems to play everything by ear, as no two dishes seem to be absolutely alike here. Whereas most restaurants would streamline labor and ingredients by being more formulaic with the portions/method, it seems that Dim Sum Garden still insists on making absolutely everything by hand and from scratch. (there have been multiple witnesses claiming that they've seen Dim Sum Garden workers prep their dumplings at night after close of business) Nosy meddling aside, the Xiao Long Bao here are absolutely fantastic and full of scalding soup with each bite; I wasn't digging their ""dumpling sauce"" and would have preferred plain old soy sauce and vinegar instead, but the soup filling was satisfying enough that the lack of adequate sauce was negligible. Their Har Gow and Siu Mai offerings were somewhat mediocre: the har gow uses many little shrimp instead of one giant prawn, and the siu mai is about 80% grain and 20% ground pork. Their Ma Po tofu was oily, but unlike most Northern renditions of the dish, carried some kick and tons of flavor. If you want Siu Mai and Har Gow, I suggest you keep on walking down to Joy Tsin Lau/Ocean Harbor, but if you have a XLB itch that needs to be scratched, Dim Sum Garden is your best Philadelphia friend.",4.0,1,0

I normally enjoy these small family owned restaurants for their hidden delights and friendly atmospheres, but boy i was not ready for this. I ordered the Teriyaki Salmon Platter, which at first glance looked like the dinner I was hoping for. However, judging by the time i spent on the toilet the next day you bet I'm more than regretting it! The meal itself was fairly average, the glaze tasted like something from a bottle of Kraft. However I'm less than worried about the meal after the day I spent home purging it from my body. This has to say something about the storage regulations of this restaurant, or maybe the kitchen is filled with out of work college graduates that don't realize the repercussions their poor working habits have on the business of the owner.

First off, you know it's authentic when almost every other patron in the restaurant is speaking to the staff in French. Second, it's not often that you find a completely new ""kind"" of food that is pretty hard to find elsewhere. In this case, it's the Alsatian tartes, which are basically super-thin crust pizzas with creme fraiche and other toppings. The savory ones were addictive, and I probably ate one a half whole tartes myself before realizing it. I would really recommend the traditional one and the mushroom one with goat cheese. The dessert one we got with apples and the flaming brandy was fun, but I vastly preferred the savory ones we got. They have an interesting deal where you can get all you can eat savory tartes for ~$22 per person...I'm not sure if I would go for this, because at that price you could basically get two whole tartes to yourself, which is more than enough food.",5.0,1,0

The service was great, love the simplicity of the decor and it's so refreshing to see a non-ethnic cook behind the dishes.

But if you are looking for real French food, unintimidating and real down to earth atmosphere, you must come here. We enjoyed all the 3 apeptizers that the owner recommended, escargot was served with real shells, duck confit was chunky and done well. I wasn't feeling too well, so I only had a French onion soup, the best onion soup I ever tasted, not salty at all, infact you can taste the sweetness  that came through with tons of sweet onion condensed in the base. My husband had the steak tartar. He said it tasted like what he had in France when he went there on business but bigger portion. My daughter had the Marseilles mussels, she loved it so much that she took the left over brooth home with her. Even the French flies were done to perfection, not greasy, serve up in an aluminum can to keep them warm (brilliant ) and you can taste real hand picked potatoes! For dessert, we absolutely loved the creme brûlée, very creamy and not too sweet at all. A must try! Service was excellent with just the right amount of attentiveness.

351783,60023,3075,2013-07-02,"Stumbled across this place accidentally while surfing on Yelp. I am always looking for new restaurants to try, so I did a little research on it. After some digging around, I discovered that both co-owners worked for Batali restaurants and then branched out. After taking a glance over the menu, I figured it wouldn't be that bad. That Bad? There's a reason this place has as high of a rating as it does on here, it was truly remarkable. The place itself is pretty awesome .. dimly lit, open kitchen, long bar, with a nice vibe that I guess goes hand in hand with the West Village setting. You can sit at the bar or at a table, we chose the bar. I really liked the atmosphere of the place, very swank but it is appropriate for a date or group. Started out with beef carpaccio, bread and olive oil. The carpaccio was great, very fresh and with the bread, it made for a real treat. My gf loves the stuff, I was never the biggest fan .. but this was good, real good. We then both had the roasted quail. Let me tell you a little something about this quail dish ... the best I've ever had. It wasn't just tasty (doesn't do it justice) ... this was succulent. At one point, my girlfriend and I looked at each other and thought out loud .. ""This is blowing our minds."" For a side, we split the special which was polenta coated with Parmesan cheese. Nothing mind blowing about this, but definitely above average if you're a polenta fan (not for everybody). Simple, but a nice touch on a chilly fall night in the city. Espresso to top it off ... and a more than reasonable bill for NYC. Not one bad thing ordered here, and in fact all was stellar. That quail was something special, it has to be repeated. Service at the bar was attentive, informative and we had a great conversation with our bartender. Will definitely be going back to try more. Think I need to have a few more items before I put it at 5 star. FYI .. We left Osteria Morini to come here ... and as a huge Michael White fan, I'm not ashamed to say that ...

We decided to come back on Saturday after the game, and set foot at the same corner table, but this time Jorge (a native Argentinian like us) approached us, taught us a lot more about wines and what foods should be accompanied to. After that, He took us on a food roller-coaster that started with a perfectly cooked octopus and ended with a filet mignon out of this world. If you happen to be around this neighborhood, or even if you live in New York, this is the place for you, it will not disappoint you. Kudos to the staff,  Martin, Juana, Natalia, Josue and Brent for made us feel like at home. Porteno, we will be there soon!!!",5.0,-1,1

They were so flexible with me; I changed the the reservation three times and half of our party was 45 minutes late, yet they patiently waited for us. My friends and I couldn't stop commenting on the simple but stylish decor. We settled on the Karma mix platter, rack of lamb, chicken marsala, chicken madras, chicken wings, and shrimp appetizer. Everything was delicious and colorful (the spices made the food red or even green!). Oh and don't forget about the buttery naan. Once the food came out, there was barely any talking as we chowed down murmuring ""This is soo good..."" Whatever we needed - more water, more dipping sauce, olive oil (which they didn't have lol) - they made sure they took care of it. We expected them to slap on a 20% gratuity to our bill since there was 8 of us but they didn't, which was a pleasant surprise since most Olde City restaurants do. Definitely a place where you can get a great meal for a decent price along with courteous service and even though its a nice place, you be relaxed. Love it!",5.0,1,0

10484,14870,87,2011-11-26,"Located in between a 24 hour bodega and a fried chicken joint, Gandhi Fine Indian might escape your eye when passing by, but they really deliver some great Indian food. My girlfriend and I started off with the Kachoori (which seemed pretty close to Samosa Chaat to me) and some vegetable samosas, which were excellent both in flavor, texture, and spice.  The thing that really makes this place stand out though, is their attention to detail.  Many Indian restaurants are happy to throw out any old Mint Chutney and Tamarind sauce, but this tiny detail can also tell so much about how  a restaurant cares about its process.  When I first sampled the mint chutney, I knew that I was in for a really great meal.  From the spices to the outer dough of the samosas, all of the extra details that make a restaurant truly stand out, were there.  I'm not sure if they make their samosa crust from scratch, but it certainly tastes like it. For dinner I had the Chicken Bhuna and my girlfriend had the Navrattan Korma.  The Chicken was a clear winner for me, a nice blend of curried spices, onions and just enough hotness to make it enjoyable.  The Korma was a little too sweet for my tastes, but might be a great eat for someone looking for that coconut/pineapple vegetable flavor. In addition, the raita and pickled Mango were delicious - the latter being a little more subdued than most places, therefore probably more approachable for a larger audience.  Although, I will warn, it is a strange (yet awesome) taste. I was most excited at the end of the meal when the owner gave me the take out menu, and pointed me to the chef's specials, many of which made me want to keep coming back.",4.0,-1,1

So expect at least a 20 minute wait on your food. -As some others reviews said, the music is BLARING, factor that in with mass conversation around you, and you will be able to sufficiently not hear a word your cashier is saying. -Speaking of cashier, the service was mediocre at best. My order was completely torn apart from what I asked for.  Not sure if it was from their lack of attention to detail or that they couldn't hear a word I was saying either. -If you feel like waiting another 15 minutes, then you will have the wonderful oppurtunity of actually being able to eat in the resaturant.  Otherwise, you will get kicked out for trying to eat in the restaraunt and you get the option of finding other great eating areas in the terminal (the floor!)

I have to give credit where credit is due. They're fantastic... in every way, drinks, food, service. Everything I've had there has been delicious. The food always tastes fresh, the drinks are always perfectly concocted and the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive. My personal recommendations... their hangar steak has never disappointed for an entree, as well as their burger. Their cheese plate is a fantastic starter and can easily fill you up for the night, if that's what you're looking for. Their truffle fries are also heavenly (even if they make the fat rolls on your stomach budge right out). Get their gelato as a finishing touch to the meal. The flavours change daily, but they've always been quite tasty. Just be warned: Unless you go super early or super late, you will likely be waiting for a table. Avoid on the weekends, because you can be waiting for an hour or two if you come in the middle of the afternoon. They seem to have everything working for them.",5.0,1,0

I have been to Thailand multiple times and, although it may seem harsh to compare the food, I believe they can definitely improve the quality of the dishes easily. Pad Thai- I've had this multiple times and would suggest you go down the road to Penang. The pad thai is okay... too many noodles and the flavor is quite bland to what I've grown accustomed to. However, if you're super hungry it will probably taste good nonetheless. Tom Yum- Does not look at all appetizing and comes in a TINY bowl. Seriously, this was an entree in an appetizer bowl! The soup did not look at all like Tom Yum and the ingredients did not look appetizing Curry Noodles- I ordered this expecting Kao Soi but got a nice size bowl with egg noodles and chicken. The soup did not look delicious though it was tasty enough to eat. Egg noodles: why would you ever serve thick egg noodles? The hard boiled egg in the soup also tasted like it's been in the refrigerator for a while and wasn't completely heated when they put it in the soup. Overall after about 5 visits I'll say the place has a good atmosphere and friendly staff with mediocre food.

The girl then comes over and asked me ""how mad would I be if She said we don't have anymore lobster?""- (WTF?) this is where a smart business owner would come to the table and say sorry and offer something else at a discount or do something for the customer. It's called customer service. So I just suck it up because I'm thinking maybe the service will pick up and we will get everything fast. I order the ribs instead Finally I get my drink but no oysters. -Now I don't have a degree in resteruant managent but I think the oysters and the drinks come way before the meal right? My meal comes out with no sign of any oysters coming out. At this point I'm so hungry I didn't even care. Me and my gf finally finshed our meals which was ok but still no sign of oysters coming out.- at this point I want to tell the world this place sucks. I asked for the check and found that they charged me for the oysters.? -Was the sever on something? The sever did take the oysters and one drink off the bill but it was not enough.

These days the food is very inconsistent - it's never bad- just some days much more rice then meat or different size burritos one day nice and big and one day much smaller. I can agree with Lucy about the counter guy Mauricio- as he acts like he is doing you a favor and not very hospitable. My main issue is the prices with no substitutions- very expensive and they will not let you substitute anything unless they charge you- example : I order a Burrito which comes with cheese, sour cream, beans rice pico lettuce- I ask for no beans, no cheese, no sour cream but jalapeños instead - and I got up charged.  What is that about?",3.0,-1,1

The floor to ceiling windows, brick walls, WOOD walls, perfect mood lighting, mason jars, metal baskets. They really did their homework and paid attention to detail here. I wish this was my home. Service- Everyone here is so friendly. The servers are attentive and the guy who kept bringing out our food actually stopped to look at us in the eye and ask if there was anything he could get us. They have a 5 star restaurant staff and I was so pleased that we tipped well over 20%. Food- Im beyond obsessed with pickles and I guess I was just a little disappointed in this area. The fried pickles are not worth getting. I wasn't a fan of the batter at all..The boyfriend enjoyed it however, so I guess to each his own. I got the chicken BLT, he the pickle burger. They really know what they're doing when it comes to fried chicken. So flavorful and juicy. The biscuit was fluffy and sweet. The coleslaw!! I hate coleslaw but I could eat this by the bowl full. The pickle burger comes piled high with pickles. An almost overwhelming amount that was taken off immediately.  The cheese was good but for me a little too over powering and the burger didn't have much flavor. The fries were out of this world. Overall- I'm in love with this place and I wish I lived next door to come have a drink and chat with friends here. The food was good but not much to write home about.

Panorama is by far the best.  Tria is third best.  Tria gets a lot of points for being hip and a clever menu.  Tria loses a lot of points for serving stale wine because they lack a proper wine preservation system.  Tria also loses because it does not have any dinner entrees, it's just a before or after dinner kind of place. The staff can be stand offish but insist they open a fresh bottle of wine for your glass or send it back until they do, the wines sit open for days .

They take a while to take your order here, but Di Fara's daughter is very pleasant and there are plenty of neighborhood characters to entertain you.  But I also got a laugh watching the pained expressions of the Blackberried classes eager to just get their slice and check this place off their to do list. I was incredibly hungry myself, but a nice guy shared some zucchini flowers with me, which were quite tatsy and can tide you over while waiting for pizza.  As the wait went on, one regular joked about two pictures of Dominick Di Fara hanging on the wall, one of a younger Dom from the 50's, and another from the 80s.  ""That first one's of Dom when he opened the restaurant, and the other one is when he finished his first pie!""  Even Dom's daughter laughed heartily.  Minutes later a little girl from the neighborhood brought in a crayon drawing of dom holding a big wood peel pizza turner, and presented it to a smiling Dom.  I was glad I had the time to see it all. After an hour of ""theater"", my mushroom slice was ready and it was the most delicious slice I had ever eaten, until I started eating my plain cheese square, which had just a bit more of Di Fara's delicious cheese and sauce, and a bit more charred flavor from the oven.   I hope Di Fara passes on his skills, so this place will be here for years to come, but I suspect that even though he doesn't allow his kids to touch the pies, they have seen his painstaking process so many times that they could do it in their sleep.

472898,10640,3904,2010-05-09,"Between our parking spot and the entrance of Lao Sze Chuan, we passed at least three different Asians smoking cigarettes like they were on the clock.  This was going to be a good dinner. The restaurant was very casual with big tables set up for family style dining.  The service was matter-of-fact but not unfriendly.  We did have problems getting water because all the cups were being washed for something like twenty minutes.  Here's a free tip for those in the restaurant business - if you want to feed Szechuan food to Americans, have plenty of cups.  That said, neither the atmosphere nor the service were worse than anticipated. I came with a big group of friends and most of us opted in for family style.  The food ranged from mediocre to truly delicious, with enough good dishes to warrant a return trip. On the whole, the appetizers were stronger than the mains.  The ox tongue and tripe with hot sauce was one of the best dishes of the night.  It was, sadly, the only thing that was truly spicy, with chili oil that really coated and numbed the tongue.  It wasn't just hot, though, it was delicious.  This may have been the best tripe I've ever had, with just the right amount of chew, and the tongue was thinly sliced and lean.  The stuffed tofu crepe with black mushrooms and bamboo shoots was another winner, fall-apart purses of tofu skin with mellow, well-textured insides.  I would also recommend the Szechuan dumplings in red chili sauce.  They boasted nice thin skins and lovely porky fillings, and the sauce was a balanced mix of sweet and spicy.  The only appetizer I wouldn't order again were the scallion pancakes.  These were very deep-fried and not that flavorful.  The texture was good, with a little bit of pull, but the soy sauce on the side was far from optional. The best main dish by far was the house special duck with beer sauce in casserole.  This was a sort of soupy goopy stew, fragrant with beer.  It was hearty and tangy and just kind of incredible.  The duck meat was tender and falling off the bones.  There were also some delicious mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and pieces of sliced garlic mixed in, and every bite was awesome. Also good was the sauteed fillet mignon in peppercorn sauce with onions and broccoli.  It came with nice tender chunks of beef and plenty of tasty broccoli, and I liked the kicky sauce.  The dried and sauteed asparagus with minced pork was another winner, with giant stalks of asparagus coupled with a little bit of minced meat.  The asparagus could have been a touch more tender at points, but overall this was a great vegetable dish.  Lao Sze Chuan's tofu with crabmeat, prawns, scallops, and bok choy was a tasty soupy dish with very mild but good flavors.  The crabmeat was imitation, but imitation crab is tasty, and the tofu was super soft and sweet.  The dish was loaded with seafood and vegetables, and all the components were well-balanced with soothing, lip-smacking results.  I also enjoyed the breaded sole fillets with Thai sauce, although at $19 it was one of the most expensive dishes and didn't taste particularly inventive.  The sauce was nice, though, and the breading was thin and crispy. While most of the food was good, there were a couple dishes I didn't like.  I didn't care for the sauteed shredded beef with Szechuan jalapeno.  It was less hot than it sounds, and the shreds of beef were tough and yielded very little in the way of good meaty flavor.  The weakest dish of the night, though, was the shredded pork with five spiced tofu, green and red peppers, and celery.  The pork was far too shredded to yield good texture or flavor, and the tofu was weird and rubbery. After many rotations of the lazy Susan, our meal was done, and we were happily full.  We received fortune cookies and mints to round out the feast.  One of the fortunes was the best I've ever seen, and I'll leave you with its ominous message: ""First they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.""",4.0,1,0

Which probably will not happen to you because the reservations for brunch on the weekends literally takes two months. I came here with 5 others on a triple date, so maybe smaller tables will have faster reservations. But in any case, PLAN AHEAD! +1 Atmosphere and decor: very nice place here! not too loud, but loud enough for small groups to get together and have comfortable conversations. For a place with unlimited alcohol, I was surprised there weren't any obnoxious drunk people here. The lighting was good and the place was spacious. Decorations gave it a somewhat upscale feel, which surprises you when you take a look at the prices. I also love the colorfulness of everything they had, from wall decorations to the plates on your table. Bathroom was clean also! Great place to have fun without burning your wallet. +1 Service: I know some people mentioned that service can get a little crappy or slow if it's packed, but I went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and my experience was great. The waiter was timely and took our orders with no confusion or mistakes. We ordered at least three rounds of drinks and even an additional bread basket. He was always very friendly and accommodating. No complaints here! +1 Food: UNLIMITED SANGRIA! Ahem. UNLIMITED FREE SANGRIA! They serve these in 20 oz glasses one at the time and they are SO GOOD. Such a refreshing and fruity taste to them. They had 8 choices when I went, 4 White and 4 Red. I didn't get to try all of them of course, but the three that I had were awesome. Definitely try the Havana Banana. It comes with lychee and coconut slices. I also had the Tropical (?) and the Blanca (?), which I recommend as well. The bread was delicious (I love bread) and came with strawberry butter. I ended up eating this most of the brunch cause my entree wasn't awesome, which I didn't mind cause the bread was just that good. For the entree, I got salmon crepes, but the egg taste was overwhelming and I didn't taste salmon at all. I'd recommend you NOT to get this if you do go to brunch. I tried some of my neighbors dishes, and they were actually really delicious. i.e. the steak entree was really good, and also the fries that came with the cuban sandwich were also delectable. The desserts we ordered (dark chocolate cake and flan) were also pretty good, and worth a try if you're not stuffed already. +1 Price: For what you get, the prices are great. At first, I thought the sangrias would be free refills, but it is in fact ALL free. Entrees came out to 15-20 a dish, which may be expensive for brunch, but it's definitely worth it if you think about all the drinks you are not paying for. Our bills came out to around 25 a person, which is not bad at all. Great stuff for the price. +1 Overall: I had a great experience here! My brunch was at 2:00 so it wasn't extremely packed, since they close at 3PM to prepare for dinner customers. But the service and food were still great and I was amongst good company.

My date and I ordered the Asparagus Terrine, Gnocchi appetizer, french fries, and Lamb Tatsoi w/ apricot. The ingredients were definitely fresh, but needed a lot more seasoning. Overall the meal tasted very bland and we had to rely on the black pepper to liven up the dishes a bit.

If this was the bland Midwest, I would have understood the lack of spices and flavor, but not NYC of all places. Also, from the pictures that I saw here on Yelp, the lamb dish used to come with brussel sprouts and parsney chips... Other times kale and a ragu. What I had last night was braised (more like pulled lamb) on a bed of fresh spinach with ONLY ONE pickled onion and a dab of apricot puree. Pretty boring.

171987,111060,1534,2011-08-17,"Rating: 3.0, Date Dined: 7/29/2011 Café Katja is a snug and dependable place for Austrian food, further enhanced by an affable hostess who is obviously passionate about her restaurant. Service and Atmosphere The restaurant and its bar are tiny. There is a lot of squeezing by people to get around in this narrow16-20-seater but I guess that adds to the hole-in-the-wall, tucked-away vibe. Café Katja is appointed with functional wooden tables, chairs, stools, ledges. The waitress was very engaging and said that our wait would be shorter if we'd be willing to share a table for four with another couple. She called it ""European style"", so when in Rome, why not? The seating is not particularly comfortable. My friend sat on the banquette with a water pipe pressed against his back. But I guess this is how they prevent people from lounging around forever. Once again, the service was very pleasant and our waitress took great care in selling the dishes and explaining them to us. At the end of the meal, when she accidentally dropped another table's fork into our spatzle that we wanted to take home, she had the kitchen make us another to go without any hesitation. Perhaps the most charming aspect is that our waitress was all smiles, all of the time. Food & Drink My friend and I shared 4 dishes. The emmentaler sausage was very cheesy. It was accompanied by quark dumplings (fluffy but bland) and a creamy savoy cabbage. We also had the bratwurst with a traditional pickled red cabbage sauerkraut. Of the two sausages, I preferred the emmentaler. The soft pretzel was addictive. Its smooth crust on the outside encased a chewy, doughy interior. The dipping spread was a quark cheese blended with paprika, cornichons and onions - I loved this. Having just come back from a trip to Germany, I liked Café Katja's version better than the 3 other versions I sampled in Berlin. As a ""side"" we had the cheese spatzle with caramelized onions and chives main course. Anything covered with this much cheese is guaranteed to be tasty, but once it lost temperature, it was less exciting. We sampled a few of the beers on tap. They come in multiple sizes for sampling. The beers stand up to the restaurant's meaty-carby fare. Hearty Austrian food (enough for three people, really) and 3-5 beers came to around $73 for a dinner for two. Perhaps the mystique of this place was a bit lost on a sweltering Friday night in July, but I could see this as a go-to LES dinner spot on a chilly Fall or Winter evening.",3.0,1,0

502193,233892,3582,2011-06-11,"As you can see, my tender Yelping morsels, I'm chopping an awful lotta wood these days.  After all, there's not much surf IN NYC so what's a brutha supposed to do with all his free time? Get my grind on. So, we met a couple of the homies here last night for dinner - they were kind and cool enough to roll in from Jersey and set us up at this spot.  It's located on restaurant row right off Broadway.  We'd been asked three times if we were in a hurry to see a show (we replied ""no"" each time we were asked but that didn't stop everyone from asking us)...this lead me to believe that they are of the churn-n-burn mentality to roll people in-n-out right quick.  Smart formula given the proximity to where people see shows. It's actually a really cool set up - several different dining spaces and a really lopey little bar.  Very tight quarters but I reckon that would be standard for the area and NYC in general.   Service was decent enough.  For the amount of food one receives, the menu prices are extremely reasonable - in fact, I'd argue it's cheap.  Most entrees come with a salad.  One can add the three pastas (mid-course) they serve (which change daily) to the entree for an additional fee.  There're two wine lists - one more exhaustive (and expensive), the other less expensive (and cheaper)...if one knows his wines, the latter provide provides a nice arbitrage opportunity. Here's a quick breakdown of what we ordered: -Osso Buco - my boy was pretty happy with his selection (I didn't taste it) - my other boy scooped up the bone marrow so it was kinda like a 2-fer -Salmone - grilled and served with roasted cauliflower - this is what I ordered...it was a tad bit dry but generally okay -Ribeye steak - this thing was huge...like Shaq-sized foot huge...my girl couldn't put a dent in this thing, even after sharing much of it with the table I added the pasta mid-course to my meal.  The daily pastas from yesterday were swiss chard ravioli (kind of bland), farfalle in a tomato based sauce (the pasta was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came from a can) and seafood (shrimp) linguini (this was actually pretty decent though the pasta was overcooked here as well). For desert, we ordered apple strudel served with vanilla ice cream topped with carmel sauce.  Interestingly, the strudel was a long, thin slice and had golden raisins in it...it added a little bite to the desert.  There was also a desert special - strawberries with whipped cream and some sort of balsamic vinaigrette...the berries were good.  Pretty tough to mess up whip cream...I didn't really care for the vinaigrette. In short, I would go there again ONLY if I were strapped for cash, starving or in a hurry to catch a show nearby. Not my favorite Italian but sometimes, it's about the company more than the food.  Luckily, the homies were solid so it took the focus off of and away from the mediocre offerings here. But, as always, decide for yourself... Great eating to you!",3.0,1,0
440736,25776,3745,2009-07-07,"This was my first time having real ramen and I wasn't disappointed. My first visit was for a friend's birthday dinner here just a couple of weeks ago. We arrived on a Friday night between 6:30-7:30. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations and there were 8 people in our party so we had about an hour wait. A few of us decided to go just a couple of blocks down to grab a couple of drinks to pass that time.   We were seated in our own private area, which was good since if you're in a smaller party, you're usually grouped with other guests in several community tables. We ordered two orders of the hirata chicken wings and samurai ribs for appetizers. They were both quite delicious and I loved the sauce of the chicken wings. We also ordered a bottle of sweet sake for the table, which was pretty good considering I'm not a big fan of sake. I ordered the shiromaru hakata classic ramen. It was a great dish but I wished there was more of the pork. For dessert, we ordered 2 orders of the matcha brulee and one of the mascarpone cheese & ice cream..mm soo good.

491279,230271,4027,2014-05-06,"A good friend of mine had a wedding there this past weekend and I can't even begin to tell you all of the things that went wrong.   While the place looked beautiful (completely decorated by the wedding party, dessert bar from a separate company) and the company was wonderful, this restaurant couldn't have done worse. For starters, my friend (the bride) was given one price, and after paying a deposit, the co-owner (who by the way has yet to respond to any emails or texts sent her), decided to charge more about 3-4 weeks before the actual event.  After that mess was settled, and my friend was directed to the ""Events Manager"" (who wasn't deemed manager of anything until the co-owner finally decided not to deal with the event at all).  The Events Manager had NO idea what was agreed upon and what was being done.  The last payment which was due on the day of the event, was requested on the day before at the last minute. They gave the wedding party about an hour to set up and the wedding commenced. The menu the bride decided on was buffet style with an open bar on premium drinks.  Apparently, the bartenders had NO idea that there was an open bar and charged some of the guests for some of the drinks they were not supposed to get charged for as that portion was already paid for.   The buffet area was quite interesting to say the least.  The food was presented on dinner plates for the guests to pick off of.  Not to mention the fact that the refills did not come fast enough, leaving some guests hungry.  The wedding party paid for 80 guests, maybe 10 didn't show up, and there wasn't even enough food for 60 guests.  On top of being charged extra for allowing the extra staff (unassociated with the restaurant -- dj's, photographer, emcee, etc) to eat being that some guests did not show up.  Oh, and did I mention that the bride was billed midway through the night for them.  Because of course, the manager in charge could not possibly wait until the end of the night.  The manager, who followed the bride around as she was trying to help clean up at the end of the night.... just waiting for a very small payment.  Did I mention that the groom's father didn't get a chance to eat?  Oh... should I also mention that the black beans weren't entirely cooked, the yellow rice (which was supposed to be paella - but I guess they thought it would be cute to bring out yellow rice when no one was paying attention because they didn't make enough), was tasteless, don't even get me started on the extremely underseasoned ropa vieja.... and the weak drinks some were charged for.   But I think the highlight for me, the entire night, was watching the Events Manager take pictures of the wedding with her phone, without anyone's permission.  The wedding which was a private event, the set up which the restaurant did not assist with, and pictures of the guests.  Yet at no time, was there a consent form allowing them to take pictures of the event nor was it included in the contract.  Tasteless?  Absolutely. I'm sure I'm leaving out many, many other things, however, after this week and that event, there will be plenty more complaints. If you're in the restaurant business, before you agree to do a private event (especially a wedding) maybe you should do your research and keep in mind that whatever you put in a contract, you're legally bound to.  And had the wedding party not been gracious, they could have very well refused to pay that final balance on the bill.  Good riddance Cubana Social.  We will never ever do business with you and we will make sure people know you're inept to handle private functions.",1.0,-1,1

589526,6435,3975,2012-09-26,"This wonderful pizzeria is the creation of indie filmmaker Ron Brown and Jon Greenberg, who previously worked at Paulie Gee's and, before that, the original Robicelli's. Perhaps it is not too surprising, then, that the pizza at Barboncino is remarkably similar to that of Paul Giannone. Even the Ferraro oven, imported directly from Naples, is the same as that of the popular Greenpoint pizzeria, just a bit smaller. This is all for the best, since these guys learned their pizza lessons well: The pie is thin, chewy, airy, and nicely spotted with char dots[1]; the tomato sauce is fresh and tangy; and the fiordilatte mozzarella[2] is as tasty as it is creamy. In fact, the Margherita pizza ($11) is such a beautifully balanced and light thing that I felt that I could easily eat five pies. The full bar that serves cocktails, nicely priced at just $10. It also has Dogfish Head 90 Min. IPA on tap, together with Brooklyn Chocolate Stout. The people behind Barboncino clearly put great care and a lot of effort in creating a dark, sexy ambiance that is also warm and welcoming. The two-level massive room sports lots of dark wood, exposed bricks, and great attention to details. The recently opened outdoor patio is more intimate. Barboncino is a great place to meet up with some friends, for a low-key date, or even to just enjoy a pizza and a beer by yourself at the bar[3]. Start with an appetizer: the Neapolitan Meatballs are just as good as an appetizer ($9) as they are as a pizza topping. The best part of the salumi board ($19) is the accompanying piece of pizza dough (or ""pizza pane""; which also comes in a garlic version for $4) freshly baked in the oven. I cannot praise enough the fire roasted peppers with burrata ($12): the peppers are drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, capers, and parsley are sweet and juicy, and the burrata is wonderfully light and milky. In fact, this burrata is absolutely delicious! The pizza menu is fairly basic, if not particularly innovative. - The Eggplant and Zucchini ($13; tomatoes, red pepper flakes, fiordilatte, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil) is perhaps my favorite pie: very flavorful, with a nice earthiness to it. - The Cremini Mushrooms and Fennel Sausage ($17; fiordilatte, garlic, thyme, pecorino romano, and extra virgin olive oil) sounded better than what it tasted, and fell a bit flat in flavor. - Similarly underwhelming was the Artichoke and Smoked Pancetta ($17; fiordilatte, garlic, pecorino romano, and extra virgin olive oil). - Soppressata Piccante ($15; tomatoes, fiordilatte, garlic, oregano, and extra virgin olive oil) was solid. - The Neapolitan Meatballs ($15; fiordilatte, house-made meatballs, parmigiano reggiano, basil, and extra virgin olive oil) is perhaps the best pie on the menu. - The Arugula ($14; cherry tomatoes, fiordilatte, shaved parmigiano reggiano) was nice, light, and refreshing. The pizza is excellent by itself, but add prosciutto di parma if you want some extra flavor ($4): it's tasty and comes just slightly crisp on the edges. - I am generally suspicious of seafood-based pizza, but the Cherry Stone Clam pie ($17; fiordilatte, garlic, parsley butter, and extra virgin olive oil) was nothing short of wonderful, and transformed me into a believer/worshipper. - A potato and anchovies white pizza served as a special was excellent, and in fact it would later become part of the regular menu -albeit briefly. A potato and rosemary white pizza special, on the other hand, left me unimpressed. For dessert, ice cream comes from Il Laboratorio del Gelato, and it's fantastic (I recommend hazelnut and pistachio). A tiramisu' dessert special[4] was surprisingly light and fluffyly delicious; I highly recommend it. Despite some shortcomings with some the toppings, the pizza here is consistently good. If this is their starting point, Barboncino set the bar pretty high. A very solid 4.5 stars. ------------------------------ [1] Be aware that the charring is more substantial than at other places. [2] They use exclusively fiordilatte on their pizza. [3] I've done that several times, and got to know more about the history of the neighborhood from some of the local patrons that hang out at the bar.

Spicy fries too. ($10.25 or so for both.) It was good, not remarkable. I have to admit, I prefer 5 Guys sloppy mess of a burger for the taste. Still, I devoured that 500 burger and did enjoy it.

Upon my last visit to Petisco I found, to my shock, that I ate my entire entree (Coconut crusted chicken sandwich, oh good God, you guys, seriously, oh my god, amazing) before touching a single french fry. THAT is quality food. Petisco is a small restaurant with intimate environs and a relaxed feel. Its specials and deserts are written on the mirrors rather than formal triple laminated card-stock and the wait staff is friendly and personable. The Food is out of this world. I've only been to Petisco three times, but each entree has exceeded my expectations. The extensive burger/sandwich menu seems to be the most popular (for good reason) but don't overlook their more formal fare- the honey glazed lamb chops were so good I briefly left my body and floated above myself, watching as I chewed the delectable morsels of lamb.

55055,39480,495,2014-12-18,"Tinto 114 S 20th St, Philadelphia, PA 19103 (215) 665-9150 While it is normally my want to display a photo of the outside of the building, this photo says everything I want to say about Tinto: sophisticated, intimate, Basque, cozy and sultry. Basque of course refers to the region of North Central Spain that straddles the area between north central Spain and south western France.  This tapas restaurant serves to reflect this fusion and Chef Jose Garces certainly does a marvelous job fusing all the best of France and Spain.  Coincidentally, Tinto is Spanish for ""stained"" and ""red"" as in red wine, so the hundreds of bottles of wine throughout the restaurant is of course no surprise. The restaurant is an intimate setting with an open style kitchen (see back of this photo) with a luxurious bar with small rectangular wooden shelves lined with hundreds of wine bottles. It is lit with gorgeous incandescent lighting which casts a golden glow over everything--the perfect date spot. Without further adieu, allow me to present the culinary masterpiece that is Tinto. Since this blog is titled, Fine Food, Good Drinks, I can't help but mention the sangria I chose to accompany my meal. Sangria is a typical beverage from Spain and Portugal. It normally consists of wine, chopped fruit, a sweetener, and a small amount of added brandy. Chopped fruit can include orange, lemon, lime, apple, peach, melon, berries, pineapple, grape, kiwifruit and mango. A sweetener such as honey, sugar, syrup, or orange juice is added. Pintxos: OLIVES House Marinated Mixed Olives.  Pintxos appears at the top of the Tinto menu, and I learned it was the Spanish word for ""tapas"".  The marinated olives were delicious and arguably one of the best dishes of the evening.  With so many to choose from there was not a clear winner in my book, however. ALMONDS: House Smoked Marcona Almonds. Someone call the fire department because these almonds were smokin'. Well, not literally, but they were smoked and the flavorful sea salt, almonds and wooden smokey taste made this appetizer a delight to the palate. Marcona almonds, the ""Queen of Almonds,"" are imported from Spain. Marcona almonds are prized for being more tender, sweet, and delicate than regular almonds, with a nice buttery flavor that is due to their high oil and moisture content. GAZPACHO Goat Cheese Mousse, Strawberry, Rhubarb, Crispy Serrano. Jamón serrano is a type of jamón (dry-cured Spanish ham), which is generally served in thin slices, or occasionally diced.  Gazpacho is a chilled soup and this particular variety was fruity, summery tasting, sweet and creamy due to the goat cheese.  The Serrano ham was a nice accouterment with the salty cured meat balancing the sweetness of the fruit and cheese.  The rhubarb was an interesting addition to the dish, as I have never had a gazpacho served with it before. Rhubarb is a perennial vegetable, though it is generally used as a fruit in desserts and jams. You only eat the stalks, which have a rich tart flavor. ARUGULA Serrano Ham, Mission Figs, Fried Goat Cheese, Spiced Almonds, Sevilla Orange Vinaigrette.  Probably the most interesting addition to the arugula salad here was the addition of the balls of fried goat cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  The Orange vinaigrette wasn't half bad either. Certainly cleaned the plate here. DIVER SCALLOPS Quince, Uni Emulsion, Parsnip, Crispy Serrano.  You can see the little chunks of serrano ham mixed in with the greens.  The little yellow chunks are the quince, a yellow fruit similar to the apple. Quince is a small deciduous tree that bears a pome fruit, similar in appearance to a pear, and bright golden-yellow when mature.  The scallops can be dipped in the vanilla parsnip puree- which was amazingly creamy and sweet. ORGANIC CHICKEN Brussels Sprouts, Chorizo, Fingerling Potatoes, Herb Jus.  The chicken was fantastic, tender, sweet, loved the brussel sprouts.  The herb jus was rich and sweet. Postre (Dessert): Gateau Basque. Almond Cake, Vanilla Cream, Cherry Fig Jam, Pedro Ximenez Ice Cream.  The most interesting part of this delicious dessert was the Pedro Ximenez (sherry) flavored ice cream.  I would attest, the entire dessert could have been a giant bowel of the ice cream because that was by far the best portion of this dessert.",4.0,1,0

308008,25486,2701,2014-03-10,"By far the greatest thing this place has to offer are the shakes, but I am reviewing this place for overall experience. The major pros are that it's open 24 hours and the shakes. If this place only sold shakes, it would probably be a five-star rating. The fact that it's open 24 hours is nice but I personally would hesitate to hang out here during the late hours. I think I would personally choose a diner over this place if I was looking for late-night food after the club. But in the morning, hangover shakes, here I come! LOL Which brings me to the food - in my opinion, I've had better. But then again, I've eaten items off the menu that I've had homemade and from various sit-down type restaurants. So for all I know, it may supposed to be on or slightly above par with fast-food joints in terms of quality and I am just judging harshly. But then again, I think I just wish the food were as good as the shakes. Service is fine, place gets pretty packed and you have to know what you want prior to ordering. The place looks old but it looks like they do their best to have it well-kept. At the end of the day, I will keep going back to find that one meal, sandwich or piece of food that measures up to their delicious shakes. Once I find that, I might just bump my rating!",3.0,1,0
300624,165183,2634,2014-01-27,"I heard alot of wonderful commentary about Audrey Claire's that it definitely caught my interest and curiosity.  I went last weekend and was a 3 hour wait which made me even more curious and anxious to experience this place.  I honestly have to say that myself and my party of 8 were all so disappointed.  Some of the food was decent enought but the service was ok with a bit of an attitude.  The workers treated you as it you were lucky to be eating at thier restaurant.  The shortrib was very fatty and not a good cut of meat at all and the mussles very fishy.  The creme Brulee was over cooked as well.  After waiting 3 hours I had high expectations which were definitely not met for myself nor anyone else in my party.  I think this place survives because it is BYOB and would definitely not recommend waiting 3 plus hours for this lousy, obnoxious experience.  This is by far not my definition of fine dining or even would consider it a trendy environment.  In addition to the inadequate food and service with a tude, the place was so noisy that it made it complicated to converse with the folks next to you.   NONE OF US WOULD EVER GO BACK AND WOULD NOT SUGGEST WASTING PRECIOUS TIME ON THIS RESTAURANT.",1.0,-1,1

I began working in the Bourse Building almost a year ago and my coworkers would tell these horror stories about food poisoning and rats, etc. about a lot of the places in the food court downstairs. They said, ""only eat at ""Mexico"" and Liberty Chicken"". I was always so skeptical, but a few weeks ago I gave Liberty Chicken a try and daaaaaang, it's good! Everything is fresh and homemade and the couple that owns it are like the Asian parents I never had! They always ask me where my coat is and why I'm eating lunch so late while preparing a heaping bowl of chicken terryaki or some extra crispy chicken fingers.

221712,13341,1586,2012-05-14,"On a Friday night, what could have been more romantic than a dinner with the boyfriend at Bistro Petit! The restaurant is cozy , seating 10 people inside on high bar tables and 3 small round tables outside. I really felt as if I was on vacation dining in a French restaurant with its cute classical decor, sipping a glass of wine and watching pedestrians walk by. Mental notes I took down: - Definitely make a reservation as this place is very small. - BYOB ! This restaurant focuses on French bistro cuisine, with an Asian/Korean influence. Keep an eye out on what is their specials for the day. We had the watermelon salad appetizer and it was extremely refreshing with a marriage of the sweet & juicy of the watermelon, sourness from the pickled watermelon rind, and savoriness from the grilled cheese. The entrees are reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food. I had the kimchi bouillabaisse, which is a caldron pot filled with mussels, scallop, shrimp, fish in a kimchi based sauce. Caution: If you can't take spicy food, you may want to stay away from it because it's a good type of spiciness that stays in your mouth and refuses to leave.... Always leave room for dessert. Bistro Petit is known for their donuts which are rather large in size (5 pieces) and comes freshly made with a googy eggy goodness inside.  One order is more than enjoy for 2 people - trust me , I made the mistake of ordering two orders because my eyes were bigger than my stomach!",4.0,1,0
331439,51491,2879,2014-02-01,"If you go on weekend at night, you may have to wait some time to be seated at a table. Understandable, because it gets crowded and this place is very good. I stumbled upon this place and read the menu and was hooked. I HAD to try to this place. The menu items are so interesting and unique, especially with that glazed doughnut burger. We ordered the buffalo chicken waffle fries as an appetizer. It's basically waffle fries topped with chicken, buffalo sauce and blue cheese. It was very good. I ordered the Nickleback burger that had fried pickles and Jameson whiskey sauce. My friend was feeling adventurous that night and ordered the Glazed Doughnut burger that had chocolate covered bacon. I tried it and it was an mixtures of flavors. It was oddly kind of good. He finished it and liked it. The burgers come with a side of waffle fries, which are good or, for extra, you could switch them out for the beer battered onion rings. The onions rings are huge, but very greasy and they fell apart. I should've went with the fries instead. I would definitely come back to try more of their burgers and other items.",4.0,1,0
411674,204987,2681,2008-08-08,"I went here on a Thursday night to satisfy my craving for some delicious steak. After eating at Landmarc, I was definitely satisfied! I started off with some calamari and French Onion Soup. I liked the calamari better than the soup, it was not too chewy and the spicy marinara sauce was a nice touch. The soup was lacking a little compared to other places I've had it. Then I ordered the Rib Eye with the peppercorn sauce. It was simply amazing. It was cooked wonderfully (I got it medium rare) and the sauce was a great complement. The fries that came with it was also quite delicious. The whole thing was so good I almost ordered another one! To top it all off I got the creme brulee for dessert. Again, wonderful. The only thing to criticize is the tiny portion size of the desserts! The waitress also suggested a great wine that complemented our meal very well.",5.0,1,0

14916,18668,3536,2014-11-23,"4 stars for the food plus one for impeccable service. This place is worth the wait for brunch. Came at around 1 PM on a Saturday with my friend and waited for a little less than half an hour. They've got a little vestibule for you to hang out in and benches outside. The hostess was very friendly and chatted with us every now and then. Once we were seated, immediately someone brought us water and took our order. We shared a chocolate hazelnut doughnut and biscuits with quince jam to start, plus my friend had a specialty fruit seltzer, which she affectionately referred to as ""childhood in a glass."" The doughnut and biscuits were heaven. For our entrees, I had the special, which was a lamb burger with duck fat fries. My friend had the kale salad with eggs. Both dishes were incredible in their own right - fresh ingredients, exciting flavors, savory and satisfying without overdoing it. I'll be back!!",5.0,1,0

This is authentic but authentic doesn't always mean good. Not bad just average. The chips were cold not fresh and the tacos were authentic but average. The meat was dry.  For NYC it gets a 3 for authenticity. Outside of NY it would get a 2. We have a large Mexican community but diners here do not demand good food and when you get used to eating mediocre food you get all excited when it is mediocre and authentic. Not much else to say really. If you live in the neighborhood it is fine but it doesn't warrant a special trip. It is better than Tacos Matamoros in Sunset Park. That was too sloppy. Not really sloppy aesthetically. But how it tastes. This is more to the point crisper flavors. But not as good as Tacos Al Suadero in Queens.

We're visiting from out of town and I found this place through Yelp, and that is is close to our Hotel at the Holiday Inn. We came on a Saturday night around eight and didn't have a reservation. While looking at the menu the manager smiled and waived us in. We came in but reluctant because we really weren't dressed to impress. They didn't care. We sat down and immediately was asked for the type of water we want by a handsome waiter who was extremely accessible when we wanted him throughout the dinner. The restaurant is clean and nice and a bit tight but not too bad. They brought Italian bread and some topping on a smaller bread and olives right away. I had some raspberry sparking wine cocktail which was ok, not excellent. For an appetizer we had these eggplant wraps on goat cheese. Freaking delicious. They were brought within five minutes of ordering and tasted fresh. For dinner he got the duck and I got the lobster crepes. Both were incredible. For dessert I had a cappuccino and we split a tiramisu. The tiramisu came in a sundae cup arrangement but still was great. All of that came to about $90 before tax. Tables were cleared promptly after both parties finished and the service was immaculate. I definitely recommend. Authentic and wonderful! Mmmm delizioso!",5.0,1,0
