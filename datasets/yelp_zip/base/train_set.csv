"Fun little spot much more homey than a tourist spot. We had the Papardelle (oxtail ragu) (a new one if me), ricotta cavatelli, and buffalo mozzerella, tomato, prosciutto antipasti along with happy hour $5 house wine. All very yummy and pretty affordable for NYC Little Italy. Also the pasta portions were adequately sized (not oversized) so truly right for one person. We enjoyed the ambiance and very attentive service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Nooooooooooooo. I decided to get some soup here when I wasn't feeling well along with some ""spicy food"". I decided to order from them because they left menus all over my apt building. I ordered for pick up and couldn't find the place right away. The girl who worked the counter kept calling and screaming at me asking where I was... I told you the first 2 times you called I was having trouble locating the restaurant.... Anyway, I ended up finding the place and getting my food and it was pretty bland and not that great....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been to Cafe Mulino several times with my most recent visit being last night. I met up with a business associate and we just hung out at the bar for dinner. We started out with sausage and hot peppers which were great, the peppers were fresh and very spicey. The bartender also brought out bread to start and the best part were the garlic sticks which were great, especially when using the sauce from the peppers as a dipping sauce. For dinner, I went with a whole wheat pasta dish with garlic, oil and grilled chicken, it was absolutely delicious. My friend went with a bronzini which he thought was tremendous (I'm not a seafood eater so I can't really confirm). We finished the meal with coffee and averna.   Johnson, one of the owners stopped by to say hi as he usually does. The only thing that they really need to improve is speed of service, I'm okay with a long meal, but a lot of people are unfortunately in a rush, so if you are I would suggest letting your server know ahead of time so that you can be accommodated.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So good!! Went with a bunch of friends; we had a reservation but still wound up having to wait 25 extra minutes. We weren't very happy about that but Rubirosa was very accommodating - they gave us a free bottle of Prosecco and a free bruschetta appetizer! The bruschetta was SO good - mushroom, goat cheese and panchetta! I would have definitely still ordered it if it wasn't free :-) To continue our meal we ordered 2 Rubirosa salads which we very good. Had the meatballs, a vodka pizza and a caprese pizza as well as a cavatelli pasta dish. Definitely over ordered but it was all SO good that we didn't regret indulging! The environment was very nice for groups and I will definitely be returning!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We won't be back! Let me start off by saying I have never written a review before. As a business owner myself, I feel that some places get an unfair ""rap"" with sites like this, but I felt compelled for the first time to write one after what we (my wife and I) found out. As a life long ""Stavener"", I have been going to The RIb House for years. Mostly take out&the bar, occasionally being waited on at a table.This place is a staple (or eye sore) in EH. For the most part the food has been consistent. You pretty much know what you were going to get when you go there and you would always walk out stuffed and/or drunk.  Same staff/family for as long as I can remember, many of them which I know from growing up here. Seemed  the waitstaff had a lot of hostility towards each other, based upon the gossip that could be over heard though. Someone was always complaining. Not so much with the bar staff. They seemed to do their own thing. The bartenders have all been great through the MANY years. After I got married, I didn't go in as much. I'd stop in on my way home for take out, which always seemed expensive to me. It wasn't till recently that I realized  they were charging an extra $0.30 or $0.40 (don't know the exact amount) for EVERY item ordered. I am far from cheap, but I have never seen a ""take out charge"" anywhere, or maybe I just haven't noticed it. Either way, not that big of a deal I guess, but it is something people should be aware of if you are ordering take out/to go. My wife, (not from EH) wanted to experience the RH about two or so years ago. She thought it was some roadside biker bar. It was happy because she usually has me take her to the more ""fine dining"" establishments. We went in on a Saturday and there was an attractive blonde girl behind the bar. I was nervous because my wife never likes other women, never mind someone that is attractive. To my shock my wife loved the bartender. She ended up being very humble and funny and man could she manage a difficult and demanding crowd. We loved sitting there watching her make drink after drink wondering how she kept track. Anyway,  It ended up being the place my wife wanted to go when we did get a night out, over to see ""her Chris"" (who ended up coming up with a new drink for her every time we went in, which I enjoyed too because as I said before, the food was consistent (average)). Also, I have to say, her friends&customers that came in to see her were so amusing. We had so many belly laughs there on many occasions. Fast  forward to a few months ago... The RH must have been getting desperate or fancy because they got a ""new manager"". Instantly, you could see she was rubbing everyone the wrong way. She was trying way too hard with the customers &snobbish to the bartender. My wife made a comment to me that day, something to the effect that ""She has it out for her...watch"". I just figured it was some woman thing and thought nothing of it even though we did witness the attitude. It wasn't till I stopped in again one night just for a quick beer on my way home that I witnessed it for myself. That manager, who I ended up recognizing (and knowing from EH) after seeing her for a second time, was being so ridiculous and unprofessional, not even conscious that I was a customer in the other room. I ended up leaving, before I ended up getting involved myself, which now I regret not doing. My wife and I stopped in the other day to see ""our girl"". We were told  that manager ""got rid"" of her. WHAT?? Are you insane!  SHAME ON THE OWNERS OF THE RH!! (and yes, I know them well too You let the most personable, honest and hard working employee of yours go? The one that actually brought in customers? That brought me back in after not frequenting that place for years?She was always saying ""I love where I work"". Even if a customer didn't tip well she still smiled&said thank you. That place was PACKED on Halloween,a Mon. night, because she threw a Halloween party. That brought you business!! Do you really think anyone would have been there on a Halloween Monday?? This is just one example, because I could go on and on about how disgusting your lack of judgement was/is. You get in this ""manager"" who has quite the reputation (not favorable at all),whose credibility is shot&then poof, the employee that brought you business is gone?My wife was SO right! Trust me, I would hire this girl in a heart beat if my business was something in this industry. We just can't believe it. I can tell you right now, you rubbed everyone the wrong way with this move RH. My wife&I will NEVER be back nor will our friends or family. This is supposed to be a family run establishment, a place you feel comfortable. For the owners to allow this treatment of their employees (we heard some kitchen staff too) is disgusting.And BTW what is with all your Italian specials? You lost all direction!If i wanted Italian I'd go to Wooster St.or my parent's house. The RH is for ribs, etc.not Italian food. BIG MISTAKE!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The fresh fish is somewhat overpriced (though high quality), but the prepared food is awesome. Just had lunch here for the first time.  Outstandingly good! I got a blackened Marlin sandwich with fries and a coke, all for $11.  Slightly more than Hoagie Haven, Panera, etc. but the quality is way better.  The roll was even very good, a soft Kaiser roll (but not too soft).  Great whole lettuce and red ripe tomatoes as well.  Much better than the shredded iceberg crap and whitish tomatoes you get at hoagie haven. The fish was just perfect, nice and juicy but slightly crispy on the outside.  Fresh too so without a strong fishy taste.  I often don't like blackened fish as it can be too salty, but this had just the right amount of spice.  Also a nice thick piece of fish.  The fries were perfectly done too.  Can't go wrong here!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went here on a Friday night for dinner with another couple, and loved our experience. The restaurant is such a cool concept, that I don't know why nobody ever thought of it before. A BYOB with a state store inside? Perfection! They even sell gourmet cheeses and olive oils in the market, so you can wander around and taste items while you're waiting for your table. The food is pretty darn delicious. Hubs and I shared the chef's selection cheese platter, and it was to die for. My entree (duck confit salad) was pretty good, but not melt in your mouth amazing. Overall, we'd definately come back, if nothing else just for the cheese sampler and to split a pizza.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Use to love this place but recently it has gone downhill.. Two friends and I went last night (7-13-13) and the wait wasn't a problem jus about 15 min. But when we got seated outside we sat down and it took about 20 min for someone to come over to our table and asked what we wanted for drinks.. So we ordered a blood orange margarita frozen pitcher than ordered our food... In the meantime they are supposed to bring chips and salsa to your table, yea right we didn't get anything so about 20 min later our pitcher finally came.. Still No chips.. Finally our food came out about 45 min later (we only ordered 2 little things) and it took so long.. Once they brought our food I said can we have chip and she said oh they didn't being them out.. After and hour went by.. She said someone will be right out with them.. (Yea right) we were pissed at this point... We ate our food had our drinks than asked for the check which took another 20 min to get an it wasn't even packer there.. We had to hunt the lady down to get it because she really came to our table to begin with I think 2 times that's it... Anyways I just wanted to say I definitely don't recommend this plaw at all!!! Maybe 3 years ago but not anymore..     Poor service, horrible food that looked like road kill, and very high on prices!!      Pitcher of Blood Orange Margarita $23.. $2.00 for being frozen $7.00 for being blood orange.. Unbelievable.. $32 for a pitcher.. Crazy     Ill go to adobe next time I herd they are cheaper and better! It's right down the street.      Oh and one more thing... We left the lady a $1.00 tip.. Wanted to leave nothing but I think a $1.00 was enough for the two times she came to our table!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Bad stuff: We got double tipped.  The tip was already added to the bill when presented and the server didn't mention it.  We tipped on top of the already fully loaded bill.  Shame on us but shame on them too.  It's a BYO, and we split appetizers and skipped desserts, and our double tipped bill cost us $270 for six people!  I can't revisit a place that lacks scruples...","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This review is for their garlic knots only. Francoluigi's does not offer or provide marinara with the garlic knots but it turned out Francoluigi's knots were good enough without the sauce. While the knots only had a mellow, not overpowering scent, the visual appeal was present.  The bread was cooked nicely with the top a dark golden brown and the light sprinkling of parsley was a nice touch. Size-wise, they were bigger than Mario and Frank's (in Bordentown, NJ; my personal favorite).  This would prove to be the only real ""flaw"" and that term is being used loosely.  The knots' texture was excellent; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside while the taste was full of garlick-y goodness! Francoluigi's proves to be a decent contender in the search of the perfect garlic knot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"To me it is best place to try real American burger and Steak! You will be melting while eating.. It is a promise! I  just dont like the way they help you in the entrance. The receptionist says they put you on a waiting list but They dont even take your phone number. You either come back after 1,5 - 2hrs later or wait ourside or hang out at the bar area. And you have to ask and remind that person several times that you are waiting for the t - it seems tt need more efficient system..

"What the H*** is an arepa? was my first question when I first spotted this truck. After looking at the reviews here, I got the general idea, plus was very intrigued with the description, as well as the almost universal praise (which, honestly, triggered my skepticism a little... what can I say, except I'm a New Englander :) So, with friend in tow, I descended on this truck at the opposite end of Cedar St from where I usually go, and threw caution to the wind and ordered a pork arepa. Faith rewarded! Everything was great, as was the price. My friend even said he had to look up the recipe and see if he could recreate this newly found culinary wonder. Bottom line, very happy with my choice, and would go again. Highly recommended.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Before the new restaurant, the line used to twist around the block, now its just a few feet next to the old place, which is also a pizzeria. No credit cards. ONLY CASH. $4.50 ATM FEE. No beer. Busy place, wrong orders can occur. Poor guest appreciation (old place had a brighter attitude), however, if compared to Totonno's, well then G's got best customer service. The servers are very respectful and attentive. Food: The food is good regardless of the customer service. This is why I am giving this place a 4 star rating. This place moves a lot of traffic so the circulation of fresh ingredients is accurate. Setting: Awesome romantic setting, while you sitting next to almost 50 people.   Old Rating: One of the coolest and tastiest joints in Brooklyn. Limited seating but its worth the wait. A great place for a first date. I bake pizza and can vouch for their sauce and dough. Sometimes the pizza is slightly burnt but you can always ask to make sure that its not.

"This is a great place that I think not enough people, especially students, know about yet. The hot food is better than most any 'chinese' takeout place around here, plus they also have a Deli that will sell you fresh meats & cheeses, sandwiches, salads, wraps, sushi, even fruit & vegetables. They also usually sell pre-made breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and coffee in the mornings. Whenever I see people buying crappy reheated food from 7-11 I want to tell them to go here. it's only like a block away and world's better in almost every way. The groceries, drinks, and candy selection has a lot going on in addition to the usual corner store fare. One of my favorite things is the front counter where they're always getting new little snacks to test out, and the selection is very unique, lots of imported candies and chocolates. Another thing worth mentioning is the guys who run it, two young Korean brothers who are also artists, are super friendly and accommodating. If you live on the west side of campus, or even if you don't, I highly recommend finding an excuse to go here. It's worth going out of your way for.","[1.0, 0.0]"

At that time there were three seats at the sushi bar, two open two tops and no one waiting. We felt that that this was extremely rude.

"My mother is Japanese.  She was a chef at the old Rising Sun restaurant in the Hartford Civic Center. Some friends of the family have many years experience in managing and working in Japanese restaurants.   I know a thing or two about what makes a Japanese restaurant good.  I grew up eating this food.  ....my credentials. Murasaki offers the VERY BEST food.  Number one in what I look for when I eat raw food! The restaurant offers a very simple surrounding that actually fairly reflects traditional japanese restaurants.  It feels right.  No doubt one or two tables feel cramped, but for the most part this not a problem.  I'd say if this is a problem for you, then ask or wait for other seating or go elsewhere.  I've been in a group of six and sat comfortably. Look, I've been to pretty much all of these restaurants, some are flashy with a metro feel, some are fun with hibachi food thrown at you, some are not so fresh and therefore, questionably dangerous.  Murasaki is what is right in Japanese restaurants.  I still try a new restaurant when they pop-up, but this is the one all of my family will always return to.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Metro North has potential, but it's definitely in need of some sophistication.   Let's start with the bar - there are only a handful of beers on tap and those beers read as such: Miller Lite, Coors Light, Bud Light.  To me, why have a tap, just start crackin' open some cans, what's the difference?  Also, the wine by the glass selection is really awful - just really cheap wine with not so cheap price tags. Next, the service was horrific. Our server was either very inexperienced or just very unprofessional.  I know you guys are wearing jeans, but don't act like we're at Crapplebees. Also, it took quite long to get our meal.  About 15 minutes before it arrived,  our server apologized for the wait and said it would be right out.  Then we didn't see him again until he delivered the check.  A food runner eventually delivered our entrees.  My entree didn't come out correctly, but unfortunately there was no one to tell so I had to flag down another server for assistance. Positives: the decor is tastefully done and creates a degree of ambiance. The restaurant is dimly lit and noise is not an issue which creates an atmopshere for a romantic dinner or plenty of conversation among friends. Food prices are very reasonable.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I really want to re-emphasive how great L'artusi really is. If I could give 6 stars, I would give it to this restaurant. I came for the first time in over a year, and my server from the past, Luke, actually remembered my friend and me as well as what we ordered. Though he wasn't my main waiter this time, I still had a phenomenal time and I really enjoyed every portion of our meal. I wasn't able to sit in the front of the kitchen this time, though I did have a peripheral view from the bar. Although I got a few of the same things this time...what was different was just as good as the old. As I mentioned before, the service here is casual, friendly and fantastic. I was again given free food(free spinach ravioli and sea salt gelato dessert) and boy were they good. -I had the scallop crudo (just as well done as I remember it) -Ricotta Cheese(housemade, last time I tried to order it, but they had ran out)...It was phenomenal...felt like eating dessert more than anything. The cheese was delicate and the blood orange marmalade it came with was a perfect complement as it was both sweet and slightly bitter. The theme of this restaurant is really how simplicity is perfect. They never use too many ingredients...but they are able to bring the best out of food. -Gnocchi with Lamb Ragu: It's evolved into something even better, as while the gnocchi were still perfect balls that melt in your mouth, the extra lamb ragu acts as a richer and more flavorful complement than a plain tomato sauce. -Spinach Ravioli- Al Dente and well made, I preferred the cheese ravioli, but this was still fantastic. -octopus with charred potatoes and a few other complements- simply the best octopus I've ever had. Though its more of an appetizer than an entree...it's still fantastic. The Octopus is crisp on the outside but firm on the inside. It's perfectly cooked and the potatoes, olives, and lemon that came with it acted perfectly to bring out the most of the octopus. The desserts were fantastic. The sea salt gelato we got was Luke's favorite dessert and I could immediately tell why. The gelato was not ""flavorless"" but it was very subtle with a hint of salt that made you really want more. It was truly addictive yet still light. Finally I had the lemon semifreddo. The semifreddo is a unique take on ice cream that makes it more of a solid that resembles a cake in appearance, though still retaining the taste of ice cream. The Limoncello granita was the star of the show though. Invoking memories of a hot italian summer, granita(think of flavored ice that's slightly slushie) is best enjoyed out during a hot day on the Amalfi Coast, however, I loved how they incorporated one of my favorite alcoholic beverages(limoncello) with an upscale dessert. A work of simple beauty.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I recently organized a networking event at Halvorson's (which I booked only a few days before), and while I didn't partake in the cuisine (too busy drinking), I must say the staff at Halvorson's were some of the most pleasant restaurant staff that I've encountered anywhere in long time.

It doesn't sound like much, but it is a life changing work of art.  This sandwich includes: braised lamb shouulder, vadouvan raisin jam, harissa aioli, arugula, shredded carrots, red onions, served on toasted ciabatta bread.  My mind has been blown, from this day on I will never be fully satisfied with any other sandwich, not to mention their jalapeno bacon mac and cheese was utterly amazing.  This perfect lunch is pretty much as good as it gets!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Appallingly rude!  We went there for Sunday brunch.  Arrived at 10.30 and the sign painted on the door said they opened at 11.  We went for a walk around the neighborhood and returned about 5 to 11, by which time a line of about 10 people had formed outside the restaurant waiting to get in.  One of the waitstaff was pointedly mopping the area right inside the large front window, and kept looking at the window at all the people waiting outside.  FINALLY, at 11.15, after we'd been waiting in the freezing cold for 20 minutes, he decided to come outside and tell us they had decided not to open until 1pm that day.  Everyone was very angry and I don't think any of those people will ever return.  I don't care how good the food is, you cannot treat customers with such disdain!!!

"I had  a casual dinner at the bar and my server was excellent. She was pleasant and knew the menu well. I was not too hungry so I decided to have the crostini with eggplant (a bargain at $6). Thin grilled pieces of toast with a very nice spread. They have 4 or 5 choices of spread. I would try the parmesan cheese with balsamic next time. For main course I had the Mare seafood salad ($16 and worth every penny). I am a seafood snob and this was done perfectly. The server explained the seafood-mostly shrimp, scallops, calamari & octopus is poached and then tossed in a lovely olive oil and lemon sauce. Absolutely delicious. This is a perfect dish for lunch or light dinner but I would also get as app if in chow down mode. The only thing I did not like was a draft beer was $9, but hey it's NYC. If I came again with friends I would go with a bottle of wine. Sadly, I did not try anything else but I will be back when in the area. Osteria Morini rocks!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was really looking forward to my birthday trip to Char no4. Bourbon and BBQ sounds like such a wonderful way to spend a pre-memorial Saturday . Bringing along a large amount of people seemed a no-brainer, just to get to try as much food as possible. The reservation process was brief and painless (thanks to memorial day), and the staff was remarkably friendly. The restaurant itself is beautiful, if cramped, and the smell emanating from the kitchen is the best aperitif one can ask for. But the room is ridiculously hot, and claustrophobic because of the low ceilings. Cocktails were amazing, and I really appreciate their dedication in having nothing behind the bar other than bourbon and whisky. I would come back here just for drinks. Food though, at least in my opinion left a lot to be desired. In no particular order, here are some of the the issues that we had. Ribs were terrible, barely grilled, they were tough, and just had a spoonful of sauce on top, baked beans were actually tastier than the ribs; shrimp and grits were drowned under the cilantro microgreens, and there wasn't a touch of salt in the entire dish, shrimp was dry and boring; bacon with mushrooms was very blah, with bacon being almost tough as if again, it didn't spend enough time in the smoker, the mushrooms greasy to the point of grossness, a little jus would have gone a long way. But, the sausage was phenomenal as was the steak. Pork nuggets were pretty good, as well as the lamb pastrami, but neither was anything out of this world. Resto makes better pork nuggets IMO. All in all, the best part of Char was the service and drinks. I'll definetely come back for drinks and maybe a few snacks, but doubt that a full meal is going to be worth it here.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I met some friends here for a late Sunday brunch last week.  The place itself is very clean, with simple black and white decor.  The staff all wears matching t-shirts with ""the smith"" written on them and jeans, which gave it a strange suburban feeling in the middle of Manhattan. The food selection was your standard ""American"" fare - mac 'n cheese, burgers, fried things,and a bunch of scrambled platters.  If you are on a healthy eating plan, this place is a definite avoid.  The healthiest thing you can find on the menu is substituting egg whites for the scrambled eggs and substituting mixed greens for home fries.   However, the home fries were delicious and they did give our table a complementary dish of mac 'n cheese.  The food was delicious, and their home-made hot sauce went great on the egg whites.  The service was a little slow, but super friendly, as it was a busy Sunday.  The prices on the menu were a little steep for what it was, but not overly so. Overall, I would probably go back to The Smith if someone else suggested it and we were in that part of town.  However, for a great brunch, which won't break the bank or your caloric budget for the week, head down to Alias instead.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The owners of this joint need to get off their high horse!!!! This place is just too damn expensive.  Don't bother. The view is spectacular, but that's it.  Go for a drink, check out the view and leave.   In this economy they better lower their prices and get a new chef, $140.00 for three people, two lousy beers and no desert. Get your own water, that's right get up and get your own water. No coffee either!!   The server said we have a coffee maker, they just haven't hooked it up yet. Give me a break, it doesn't take two months to hook up a machine.The owners know the view is going suck the masses in, so they don't give a crap. I had just as good a lobster dinner at the Red Lobster chain.  By the way, the mussels appetizer was disgusting.  My wife had a mediocre sword fish for $28.00, they don't even give you a potato with it.  If you want to throw your money away, this is the place.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I stumbled in here for brunch last Sunday after watching the marathon and was pleasantly surprised! It has a sports bar feel but is slightly more upscale. I had the build your own omelet with my choice of three fillings. It was delicious and well prepared. I didn't love the home fries that came on the side, but the omelete was large enough that I was stuffed after I finished it and didn't want the potatoes anyway. My date had the Tuscan burger with pesto, arugala and mozarella. We decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip and it was most likely the best I've ever had. I normally don't love the stuff but this dip was phenomenal. I would highly recommend ordering it. It comes with these cripsy almost fried tasting crunchy pita triangles. At brunch they have $6 cocktails - bloody marys, bellinis, mimosas, etc. and they have a full selection of beers and football on the tvs. Its a good place to come to enjoy a game without sacrifing an excellent Sunday brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Another nice dainty-looking restaurant located near the famous Nassau Inn in Princeton, Teresa Caffe is known for their pizza. Their pizzas are between $12-$18 and I would estimate approximately 12 inches in diameter.

"Italian food and carbs are basically the downfall of my diets. I love them too much to ever give them up and Osteria would only make this statement ever more true. It was about a month ago that I came here with the boyfriend since he came here before and raved about how much he loved Marc Vetri's restaurants! The service was great and I enjoyed every minute of our date. We were seated in the small area of the restaurant that is glass enclosed close to windows which I love anyway. We started the meal with the usual bread basket that came with an assortment of bread and it also came with bread sticks too! I am a sucker for popovers and breadsticks. Hehe. Then came our pizza. We had the cacio e pepe with sheep milk ricotta. I loved it. Honestly, for me, the crust makes the pizza. Living in brooklyn all my life, I am accustomed to that thin crust pizza where you bite into it and you hear that crunch. Oh my..so honestly, any pizza was great! But when we also ordered the baked snails and cardoons in puff pastry. Like I said, carbs are my life. I love snails and escargot and to wrap them in a puff pastry. I may have just died and gone to heaven..hopefully they serve that there. The pastry was so crisp and had so many layers and the snail was just baked to perfection. Then came our pasta dishes. The veal and sweetbread agnolotti and chicken liver rigatoni with cipollni onions and sage and lastly came the special of the day which was a roast suckling pig special. It was basically every part of the pig in small portions and when you put man with a pig together, you have a marriage for life. My boyfriend loved that dish so much. The pastas were delicious - especially the veal and sweetbread agnolotti with pockets of lush and decadent goodness. The rigatoni was good too but the agnolotti was really the star pasta for me. By this point, we were both comfortably stuffed so we decided to share a dessert and ended up getting the coconut pannacotta. It was both beautiful in presentation and a great palate cleanser for the night! Overall, I would most definitely come back here again for the pasta and the beautifully done pizza - without a doubt!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I will preface this with the fact that I have been vegetarian of over 8 years, and was vegan for 3.  So, I may be a little bit naturally biased in that going into a restaurant where you can eat literally everything on the menu has not been common over the past few years.  (I also haven't visited all the locations of this local change, so I have no point of comparison from one to the other.) But, I can honestly say that I have been very satisfied with every dish I have tried here.  Everything tastes fresh and tasty.  Particularly good is their fake pork; any dish that they make with this particular substitute is especially good, but the BBQ Pork appetizer is the most delicious.  It is my goal to one day try everything on the menu (and, given the amount of options, I will have my work cut out for me for quite a while).  The desserts are also yummy, and almost all of them are vegan. They also do a veggie turkey feast for $25 for Thanksgiving which is outstanding.  We've ordered it for years, and it's been a real favorite in our family; it's their fake meat with a brown rice stuffing, potatoes, a salad with ginger dressing, brown rice, and, best of all, fake turkey drumsticks (which never actually make it to the dinner table because we attack them immediately each time we take the ""feast"" home).  I would definitely recommend this. If you are vegetarian or plan to dine with someone who is, you can't go wrong with this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Very nice place, with colorful walls and interesting lighting. Bottle of Turkish white wine: actually pretty good. Meze platter: very good. Fried dough filled with feta cheese: ok. Octopus: tender but kinda plain. Calamari: too chewy. Falafel and crab cakes: nothing to rave about. Branzino: fresh, but not flavorful. Swordfish kebab: a bit dry. 4 desserts, all tasty. Overall: a good Turkish spot in a neighborhood lacking decent options.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been here many times and finally come to the conclusion that there are only about 4 things that are good on the menu and you need to order those items if you want to leave satisfied. Great outdoor seating for people watching on the end of South Street, and polite service. (Be warned - sitting outside you will have to sometimes deal with the drunk South Street homeless.) Here are the four things you should order: 1)Tomato Fennel / basil pesto soup, $5 2)Goat Cheese Salad / summer greens / candied walnuts / dried cherry vinaigrette, $9 3) Grilled Cheese / parmesan crust / cheddar / tomato fennel soup, $8 4) Mac and Cheese / Wisconsin cheddar / ham, $7 And dear god; Whatever you do, do not come here for a nice dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If you're looking for good tasting food, warm customer service and a beautiful environment you need to check this place out.  It's kind of hard to find it at first but it's well worth the wait.  When the bread was brought out I thought ""this looks like a dry biscuit"" but to my surprise it was a delightful buttery-garlic-ky piece of heaven.  Everything that followed our salad, bruscetta and entre was absolutely amazing!  One more visit and tasting and the star rating will change to a 5!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A pleasant experience indeed. My guy friend and I came here for the first time and was pretty excited as this place has great reviews! I love ramen and wanted to come here when Ramen King came to town but missed out. Either way, I knew I had to come for a taste to see what everyone is raving about. First off, the wait for this place is ridiculously long!  We waited for over an hour before being seated, and this was on a Monday night!  Imagine if we had came on a weekend, whew! Once seated, we were greeted by our server and beverages quickly came out. We ordered the Pork Hirata Buns which were DEliciousss.  Amazing flavors, I wanted more! We also ordered Hirata Chicken Wings.  They were also very tasty but I would take the buns over this any day!  Salivating as I recall the taste :D As for the ramen, I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend had the Karaka Men.  I love spicy food but was sick so I chose not to have anything spicy.   I was more than happy with my pick as it was soooo scrumptiously good.  I really love food and this place is probably one of my favorites now.  Although a bit pricy but to me, they were worth every penny...oh and even the long wait! ^_~; Ippudo, you will be seeing me again :D","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Though the media has blinders for the existence of anything ungentrified in Brooklyn, like neighborhoods, there are two kinds of Brooklyn restaurants. Not hip, and hip. The not hip restaurants are 95% empty on a Sunday night at 9 PM. If you show up to Chuko, in the latter category, at said time, you will be turned away. While I have enjoyed the ramen here, and think it is a solid 4*s, I don't know if the food exactly warrants this kind of absurd struggle to get a seat. And the seat you will get, if you get one, is not all that comfortable. It's loud, and if you're sitting in the middle there are tons of people passing by - it's just generally a zoo. This just points out that there's generally a lack of good ramen in Brooklyn. But the next time I have a hankering, I might just grab the F to the East Village, where there's more than one option and less of a scene.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is Horrible!!!! Been there once and will never go there again. the ""famous"" burger sucks! it has no taste, its huge and not in a good way, and it just looks like a sloppy massive ball of ground beef with no other condiments. The french fries look like crap, disgustingly oily. ThIs has to be the worst Diner ever! the place looks dirty. How can you possibly give these people a 5 star. and the Service was probably the worst i've ever experienced.

"I LOVE Calle Ocho. It's one of the best brunch places in NYC if you like sangria. Basically, you order one entree (ranging between $12 to $20) and you can have unlimited sangria which sit in 8 giant jugs on one side of the room. Of the 8 jugs, 4 are white sangria and the other 4 are red. I have to warn you though, if you are a sangria expert and expect high quality, don't. These are great sangrias, but they are not high quality. To be honest, while they have a wide range of entrees, nothing has yet to wow me. It's all good food, just not amazing. But then again, with the price and unlimited sangria, I'm not complaining. I came here one other time for dinner and it's the same deal. But I don't think it is every night so you should check their website or call them. Their dinner menu was slightly expensive, but the food was really really good. We also had the unlimited sangria. I believe this was a Sunday night. Oh yea, and you might want to make a reservation for brunch....at least 2 weeks ahead of time if not more.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been twice.  The first time I thought the brunch was great.  The second time I came for dinner and got the Moqueca.  If you ever have this in Brazil, it is a mesmerizing amazing dish.  There was a small place in the West Village that used to make a good one.  It was so disappointing here.  First of all it was a tiny cup of soup with 5 miniature shrimp in it. It was mostly onions and didn't have the complexity of a moqueca. It was not much of a dinner at all.  It's really sad to call this Moqueca if you have ever had the real thing.  The sandwiches are good and a good value.  I'd stick with those. Based on my previous experience I would have given this place five stars but the moqueca was very disappointing.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I nearly gave this place 4-stars since my last visit had a pretty high hit ratio of good vs bad dishes and the ambiance is positive--if you're looking for that west village, relaxed, kinda-hipster-kinda-yuppy vibe.  ...Then I didn't because in my most recent stop in for dinner, I had forgotten that I'd been here before.  ...anddd I just realized that I had been here another time before that.   Extra Virgin has good food and a chill vibe, but apparently doesn't stick out in my mind.  To be more fair, a 3.5 or 3.75 would be more accurate. It's a bit tight on space and unfortunately not really in the cozy sense.  The service is friendly, and the dishes were great at best and still not bad at worst.   On my last visit, my fritto misto was great.  They were out of the Sunday special spaghetti and meatballs--funny and a lil sad since the table next to us was the last order that went out.  Bugger! when that happens.  The rigatoni pomodoro was a satisfying albeit undesired substitute.  Another downer, they were out of the warm mixed berry cobbler.  So we went with only the flourless chocolate cake instead, good, not great.   Overall, it wouldn't shock me if you told me that the best thing of the night you went to Extra Virgin was the company you enjoyed there instead of the meal.  So kudos to my company and the ambiance, and pretty good job to the restaurant kitchen staff.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yuca Bar was a recommendation from some local barman, we were a group of 8 and we were seated easily enough.  The service was excellent, we all had so much fun with the server, she was super friendly and had a very good humor, always smiling, which we loved!  Also the manager was super nice checking us out, and making sure that we had everything we wanted! We also loved the decor...we were talking about the place and the FOOD all night long... the food, OMG!!!! Is so delicious! We ate almost all tapas, and it was hard to choose the best one,  but I would say I loved the mussels and the arepa vegetariana the most....wait and the ceviche tasting!!! VERY good! THE DRINKS!!!!  LOL!!!!!! Super well done!!!! Was just perfect!!! All my friends wasn't planing to drink a lot...but we simplify couldn't cause the drinks were so good! I had met the ""caipirinha"" in Brazil and I loved, but at yuca was BETTER than Brazil!!! Most of my friends din't know it,  and they also loved! Drinks are very good prices, the caipirinha was made with a good quality cachaça (Leblon) and  was a huge drink comparing to any other caipirinha that I had before...   but the real reason that I'm giving it 5 stars is.... EVERYTHING  :) At the end we were super happy and satisfied, and our server recommended the desert TRES LECHES, which was INCREDIBLE delicious! LOL!!! I can't wait  to go back!

"I rarely ever write negative reviews but my experience with the service at Temple Grill was truly insulting. We came in with a group of 10 and some people wanted to leave early so they requested separate checks. When the final 5 people went to pay the rest of the bill, we found that we were being required to pay the 18% gratuity on the entire bill, even though our friends had included their portion of the gratuity on their separate checks- which amounted to $20 more than we actually needed to pay. We talked to two of the waitresses about the mistake and they did not want to listen to us at all. In fact one of them said ""I just can't deal with people today."" We explained we were tipping more than the required 18% if they counted the amount our friends had left but the waitresses insisted that our friends must have meant to leave extra tip on their separate bills. We asked them if we could speak to their manager and after hearing the whole story, he simply said ""I wasn't there so I don't know what happened with the checks. All I know is that the waitresses say you owe more money."" All three staff members were completely disrespectful to us while we were trying to explain the situation to them and straight up wrong about the bill. That is my main complaint about this restaurant. Aside from the service, the food was mediocre and cold when we got it and drinks were delivered to all of the wrong people.  My friends and I will definitely never be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's just okay -- I don't really understand the higher ratings here.  I've been there twice: once last year for my birthday brunch and once this week for an impromptu glass of bourbon with my girlfriend.   Last year the food was good but it took quite a while to get seated and it was pretty cramped.  I'm used to New York-sized restaurants, but really, it wasn't too comfortable.  I remember most of my guests being pretty ""meh"" about the whole experience.  I felt bad bringing them there, especially because you're not really allowed to pay for your own birthday food/drinks. Dropping by for a drink this week was both better and worse: the bartender was friendly and responsive despite the crowd at the bar waiting for their tables, but she actually measured out the bourbon with an ounce measure!  Considering we paid $36 for two mid-level bourbons, the least she could do would be to pretend that she was hand-pouring a generous amount.  Maybe the owner was looking over her shoulder?  I don't know, but it sealed the deal -- I won't bother going back, especially with lots of friendlier places around Smith St.","[1.0, 0.0]"

A second visit. While the style and flair has much of the same qualities of Nobu - and the Rock shrimp were similarly great - some of the dishes were less than stellar - especially the Ceviche just wasn't much flavors at all and undercooked by citrus.

"This is a must for anyone living in or vying to live in Park Slope. The food is essentially local ingredients and simple dishes that are bursting with flavor. The meal starts with fresh, homemade bread with a delicious olive oil infused in-house. We took advantage of the Brooklyn Restaurant Week special and had the fried goat cheese (really yummy, especially with the honey), roasted chicken (the sides and chicken were both flavorful), and the skate (fresh, light, but still yummy). The dessert was not as strong as I'd hoped, which is why I did not give this place 5 stars. I recommend the carrot cake fritters but the chocolate mousse dish was not so good, in my opinion, because of the orange infusion. I'm not comfortable with the combination of chocolate and orange, personally. Overall, it's a fantastic meal at a place with a cute ambiance. Great for dates or catching up with a friend.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wish this could be a positive review, but I'm afraid the positive points of this establishment are strongly outweighed by negatives. Summary:  The food is average quality for common dishes, with an occasional inedible dish thrown into the mix. The location is terrible. The atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall, slightly ghetto, almost take-out-only. The service is slow but friendly, with a language barrier that complicates ordering. The price is high for what you get.  RATING: D Location As a person who has to drive there, the location of Saffron Place is the single biggest detractor from this establishment. The horrific Park Road location drops the rating down to 2 stars. During dinner pickup time there is NO parking on a very busy street. I had to park in a less-than-legal location on the street in order to quickly grab my order. So, the extra 10 or 15 minute wait inside had me thinking about getting a ticket the entire time. To top it off, during dinner time rush hour traffic I almost got hit twice going to and from the restaurant. People drive crazy in Hartford & West Hartford at that hour. Even if the food was fantastic, I would never go back because of the shockingly poor location and it's associated driving implications. Of course, none of this matters if you're walking there. Food I ordered quite a bit of food for my entire family, totaling $73.51: - 1 chicken tikka masala. Average sauce, with tender pieces of chicken. Small portion. - 1 tandoori chicken. The best entrée of the bunch. Tender, spicy chicken with just the right amount of char. Expensive. - 1 vegetable vindaloo. Very spicy.. and pretty good. Best value. - 1 lamb curry. Average sauce with somewhat hard pieces of lamb. Very small portion. - 2 orders of vegetable samosas. Quite good. Cooked just right. Decent size (2 per order). - 2 orders of basmati rice. Meh.  The basmati flavor was hidden by curry spice, which I didn't order or expect. It was fast-food grade rice. - Mango chutney & hot/spicy sauce.  These spices were tiny for the price. The chutney was quite good, but we could have used 3 times as much for 4 people. - 2 naan bread. Decent. Harder and chewier than most other Indian restaurants. - 2 chapati bread. Missing from the order. - The dinners came with two orders of sweet / sour apple filling (I'm not sure what it's called). The sour flavoring was unappealing to everyone. We threw it out, and I hate throwing out food. Atmosphere The atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall, slightly ghetto, almost take-out-only. If you look at the photo in the Yelp profile, you will see a room with a green wall, a few tables and a cash register. This is the entire restaurant. It's not what I would consider a sit-down restaurant. The place is clean but unappealing, and certainly not a 'date restaurant'.  The cooks and waiter can easily be heard in the back room talking about what is being ordered & cooked. The place smells of burnt oil and, not surprisingly, curry. The busy road immediately outside doesn't help matters. Service I called in my order at 4:25 PM. I showed up at the restaurant at 5:25 PM, but I then waited for 10 minutes for the food to be ready. Way too slow. There were two people ahead of me with much smaller orders. The waiter was friendly and personable. When I got home I found out that some of my order was either the wrong item, missing items, or the wrong number of a particular item. There was some sort of horrific pickled meat included in the order that we had to throw out because it was so unpalatable. The bones included in the dish didn't help. One of the naan breads were missing. And the Chapati bread was completely missing from the order. Interestingly, when the waiter was ringing up my order he had to look up the price of every single item I ordered from their take-out menu, which means he surprisingly did not know any of the prices. It took 3 or 4 minutes for him to do this while I waited. Then, when I gave him the cash and the coupon he did not have more than $20 in singles in the register and no change. After asking if I had coins (I didn't), he had to reach into his pocket to give me the appropriate coinage. Price The total price for the order was $73.51, which was reduced to $43.51 with a $30 Groupon coupon. The price of the basmati/curry rice was very reasonable for $2.50 per aluminum take-out tray.  $2.50 for two tasty samosas is very reasonable, also. Every one of the entrées are all overpriced. $11.50 for 4-5 ounces of mediocre Chicken tikka masala or  4 ounces of curried lamb is outrageous. $17 for a Tandoori chicken leg and half of a chicken breast is quite steep, too.  None of the dishes can feed two people, without ordering extra rice, samosas, or extra bread. The vegetable vindaloo was the best deal of the bunch; one full pint of tasty, spicy veggies for $8.50. Again, for two people you probably want to order extra rice with that. I will never go back to Saffron Place, even with a $30 Groupon coupon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Sofia, how I love you! This is such an adorable little spot tucked away on 50th street....apparently the same owners as DeGrezia? Definitely cozy and intimate, with a dark interior lit by candlelight, and a seemingly secret back patio that I always forget about until after the fact.  They have small bites that are quite tasty - I usually go for the meatballs and the bresaola carpaccio, and have never been disappointed! The meatballs are moist and plump, with a perfectly seasoned red sauce, and the carpaccio is just what it should be.  Perfectly and lightly dressed arugula over not too thinly sliced bresaola with some parmesan shavings. Yum! To more important things - the wine.  The wine list here is great! They have so many wines by the glass that it's hard to choose, but that's fine because the bartenders will usually give you a taste of whatever you like.  If you're feeling like a baller, they also have some reserve wines by the bottle....Gajas and the like. Go here!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Might Quinn reminds me of Fette Sau except the food has more delicate presentation and they give you a bunch of pickled veggies to go with the meats. We got Brisket, Spare Ribs, and Brontosaurus Rib.  Brontosaurus Rib was the highlight as it is juicy, tender, and uniquely spiced.  Also love the fact that it came in a HUGE chunk!  Brisket is seasoned slightly heavier than Fetter Sau's, and I would prefer a little less seasoning.  Pickled veggies help balancing out the greasiness of the meats, a great addition to the plate. Also worth mentioning are the homemade ice tea and ice cream sandwich.  The lemon flavor ice tea is refreshing and goes great with BBQ meats.  Finish a BBQ meal right with ginger flavor ice cream sandwich. FYI - Might Quinn has a stand at Smorgasburg, but the line is among the longest.  I'd recommend coming to the East Village location instead of soaking in the sun for half an hour for a plate of juicy meats.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Just inconsistent and too expensive.  Kind of place that leaves an inch off the top of a $4 small iced coffee, and you never know what kind of a sandwhich you're going to get.  Their tripe is incredible, but last time I was there the waiter gave me a small piece of bread with maybe a tablespoon of the tripe filling.  I ended up buying a real lunch at the Islands on the way home the whole rotis. chicken is the best around, and i'm hopeful they'll continue to iron out the kinks with sandwhiches and disinterested service, but it's been too long for these inconsistencies to keep ruining lunches.  i feel like the chef/waitstaff just needs to truthfully ask themselves each time before they put ameal out to service - would I be pissed off if I paid $9 for a sandwhich and this is what i got?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What an excellent selection! No portion of the menu lacks on this fabulous range... from drinks (sangrita anyone? half sangria, half margarita and 100% tasty) to main course to desserts. Extensice all-around and also So, they claimed they did not take reservations beyond 7pm, but when I arrived at 8pm thinking we did have reservations coordinated by my fellow Yelper and I asked, they scanned a list of those with reservations. Interesting. I don't quite *get* the reservation situation here? The hostess was super apologetic, thinking our reservations had been overlooked, and tried her hardest to get us in ASAP. I was honestly torn as to what to eat. Too many options, which is a problem I love to have! I finally settled on the jalapeno grilled catfish, which came with a jalapeno marinade and was topped with strawberry salsa. There was a wide variety of sides (the dish came with two) - and I opted for the cilantro mashed potatoes (amazing - they were the oddest shade of strong pea green, but tasted oh so fabulous) and the garlic spinach (could have been a tad warmer, but it was quite good as well). Let's just say I usually take a pic of my dinner, especially when it was as colorful and unique as this one, but it smelled too good to wait. Ooops. And to round out the meal, we had an order of churros - which became um two orders of churros. Fabulous. The churros themselves were good but pretty standard, but the dipping sauces were what made it. There was a chocolate dipping sauce (good but only decent) and then there was a thick, rich dulce de leche sauce. That was where it was at... I don't go to Brooklyn often, but this is a reason to go again. And um again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I can't think of a bad thing I could say about Sripraphai. I don't see how it could really get better. The food tastes fresh, the service is, for the most part, impeccable, and the environment is clean and spacious. For a starter I would recommend the tom yum soup just because before trying the one they serve here I used to hate it, that's just how great it tastes. Also, the fried fish is the best deal here because I've never seen a fried fish entree at any Thai restaurant for as little as 10 dollars. This dish is really big enough to leave you with no appetite, and there are multiple variations. Their Thai iced tea is the best I've tasted in new york, and you also have the option of adding tapioca pearls which is fun! :) I also appreciate that they offer outdoor seating which is always the better option on a summer night. Their menu is very helpful because they actually have pictures of just about every dish they serve, so it makes the process of choosing a dish a LOT easier. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai food or who wants to try it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A fantastic meal . I chose the Chef's Tasting menu. Each course was phenomenal ! I have been to Degustaion many times through the past 6 years and this time was really special.

"Went to brunch here today and I must say it was not bad at all. Very clean and quaint location. We had the wing dinner with Mac and cheese, greens and corn pudding, fried whiting and ox tails. The ox tails and cornbread were awesome! The fish not bad but it could have used more seasoning and it had bones which is a major turn off for me. The greens were good, but I did not care for the Mac nor the corn pudding. This DOES NOT mean they were not good, but I am REAL particular about these two since my mom and gram were caterers and I cook myself. My party was over all pleased with our visit, but what REALLY sealed the deal - the desserts (hummingbird cake, bean pie, peach cobbler and pineapple coconut cake) and the waitress Ms Andrea's beautiful motherly smile!

"This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. It was introduced to me when I first moved to Manhattan and I have been a fan ever since. As everyone else says - yes - be prepared to wait. And be prepared to not get in on Saturday. They close briefly on Saturday afternoons before dinner. While ""closed"" isn't really closed - they stop taking new customers at 3:30 and reopen at 5 while trying to accomodate those that were already in line waiting. I recommend the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri. It sounds strange - a cucumber with sesame oil - but it is delicious. As for the ramen - I haven't found one I don't like. Try the Miso. Unlike other ramen places in the East Village and another I have been to Uptown, the noodles are fresh. Ippudo's noodles are soft and chewy and not like the prepackaged ones I have had in other locations. Other than that, I love the atmosphere - it's dark and comfortable and you get a good cheer when you walk in the door. It's definietly an experience to be had if you are in/around Union Square.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Love this 24/7 tofu house!! A great place after hangout at korean town. Their tofu soup is awesome and there are lots of choices. You can choose the spicy level by yourself also. I even tried the plain tofu soup without any spicy flavor since my friend can't have anything spicy. It's still sooooo good. The fried fish in the appetizer dishes reminds me the food cooked by my grandma. Some of the time I am just coming in for the fish. Other than the tofu soup they do not have much korean food choices such rice cakes. Come here when you want something hot and spicy!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

I've been to Habana Outpost a maybe 6 or 7 times.  Its a nice place to go to in the summers if you cannot find anything else to do.  Its situated on the Corner of Lafayette Ave in Downtown BK.  Usually in the summer you can find some celebrities walking around around.  Has a college and post graduate crowd.  Lots of women and people having a good time.  I prefer to only go in the summer around 4pm on Saturdays thats more of my type of crowd.  They have a great shrimp and black beans dish as well as good corn.   Frozen margaritas with Mango is a must.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"We had 3 different types of soups and chef's choice of 5 appetizers.  My oh my.  The broth in all 3 soups was fantastic.  I'm not a Ramen specialist in the least, but my past experience led me to believe the flavours were meant to be understated and subtle.  Not the case here at all.  Very strong and gorgeous flavors - and all 3 soups were quite distinct, the spicy ground pork one really had a nice kick.   The apps were lovely particularly the pork belly which was like eating foie gras on top of chicharon - holy instant heart attack - but at least you died with a smile.   The only downside was the apparent lack of choice for vegetarians.  No vegetarian broth, with what seemed like only 1 main that was vegetarian.  The 2 veggies that I was with were frustrated by the lack of choice, but seemed to enjoy there meal. Definitely going back there - at $13 bucks for the noodles its more than worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of the reasons why I'm so glad I moved to the Upper West Side - quality restaurants like Kefi that won't bust your monthly food budget. I haven't experienced much in the way of Greek food before Kefi, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered the tubular pasta with Greek sausage to be on the safe side, as well as the Greek spreads sampler with pita bread. The pita bread was super soft and fresh, and all the different spreads were great - my favorites were the yogurt and the sundried tomato spreads. The restaurant has a large interior that is not overly decorated and doesn't try too hard to be stylish; it comes off as very inviting and home-y. Service was good, although it's not hard to see that it could get overwhelmed during busier hours, especially with the big room downstairs. Overall, the bill wasn't too expensive, and the quality of food was solid - a nice little taste of Greece in the middle of the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been wanting to try Audrey Claire for a while now and decided the Friday of Memorial Day Weekend was the perfect opportunity thanks to the entire city emptying out and going down the shore.. We arrived at about 730 and put our name in for an outdoor table. We gave the host our name and telephone number so we could have a drink while waiting- 30 minutes later my phone rang and we were seated. Our waiter was great- he knew the menu very well and knew exactly what to recommend. Since we'd been eying down this menu for some time, we decided to try a little bit of everything. We started with the antipasto for two which was an amazing value for $17- it literally came with a little of everything in plentiful amounts. We also split the Mussels, which is 2lbs worth- definitely not skimping on the amount in there! I was already getting somewhat full before our entrees arrived. I ordered a tuna which was crusted in potato- which was perfection. Cooked properly with the right amount of seasonings. The piece of tuna which came out was a sizable portion for the quality and price. Overall, an adorable place to eat dinner, with tons of outdoor seating and a delicious menu. Can not wait to go back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I passed by this spot everyday as they were doing the reno, and was really excited to see what opened. Cuban food and cocktails?  Sounds good to me!! Food was very good.  The empanadas are HUGE, but very light and satisfying.  The plantain sandwich thingy was also very good.   The cocktails aren't that impressive.  The hemingway didn't taste right.  Definitely skimpy on the marischino liqueur (or they're using a crappy brand like Stock).  The sazerac didn't have enough anise flavor, and pretty much tasted like an old fashioned (which is fine, but not what we were looking for) Will definitely go back.  The bartenders were really nice and the vibe was perfect. Oh - and it would be AWESOME if they opened up the coffee window in the mornings, so us waterfront dwellers could grab a nice cup of coffee on the way to the L.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Pagani has nice interior decor, and seems like a great place for drinks with some cured meats and cheeses (which is what most people there were doing).  Having a full meal here, however, was quite disappointing.  An Italian restaurant that cannot do pasta properly will seldom impress. Some of their appetizers were good.  The duck leg confit was tasty and moist.  The charred octopus was just that, charred, and super tender.  And the yellowfin tuna was not bad, though a bit too salty.  The poached eggs were nothing special though.   So far so good, but that's where the enjoyment ends.  The gnocchi didn't have much flavor, and wasn't airy and fluffy.  We also had the linguine and the pasta special which was mixed with seafood.  Both were bland, and the pasta was way overcooked, resulting in too soft, almost mushy pasta.  Seriously reminded me of my college cafeteria.   The branzino entree was underwhelming also.  The meat texture was just not good, being chewy, possibly cooked too long.  As with pasta, I generally expect Italian restaurants to do branzino right as well.  I did enjoy the seared scallops however, at least they didn't mess up a quick sear.   I would return here...but only as a prelude to dinner, which would be eaten elsewhere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Trading post is a new place right by the Seaport. I think it's more popular for dinner or after work happy hour, but I just came  here from my moms birthday brunch with all of my family at 1 PM on Sunday. You don't need to make a reservation during the day as it is a pretty empty space but we did because we were a large party. The restaurant definitely is not as crowded for lunch as it is for dinner but You can enjoy all of the space. The restaurant really is nicely decorated and has a old American classic theme; everything being wooden you also have really large-screen TVs for watching Sunday football. Brunch is in the mid teens but you do get a drink (bloody Mary or Mimosa) that comes with that I got a virgin bloody Mary which was actually really good and quite spicy And sour.   The brunch menu is actually quite varied, and I definitely recommend getting a lot of sides to share for the table as they were  some of the best things that we had. Most of the Egg dishes Need sides. They are little bare.  My mom got with the Blue crab eggs Benedict which was really good and had flavorful crab on some decent hollandise poached eggs. It came on with some standard English muffin was the case with all poached eggs. My dad had  the lobster BLT I didn't try this at all but he said it was just so-so he said that chips were Not super fresh. My sister had the kale salad which was really big and fresh, though you really can't get that creative with that. I didn't try my brother's chicken dish But the fried Eggs looked good. Lastly my brother-in-law got the omelette special which was made with the wild mushroom and Looked okay, but apparently was really good. As for me, I ordered the challah French toast which was definitely not as good as I've had, It was slightly above average bread But overall a little too eggy in middle and dry on the  outside. As I mentioned its all about the sides, and I highly recommend the grits, they are really cheesy and buttery (Could perhaps be a little less cheesy). They have a southern twist  to them which is kind of like how the entire range   menu is. We also shared the hash brown which is probably the best thing I had all night, it was don't see and quite crispy and the outside with a soften the inside. There's a lot to go around the whole table, and it is well seasoned. Lastly we got a  side of chicken sausage, that was grilled really well however there could've been More. Was brunch stellar? No, I had better but it's enough for me to come back and try the varied very things on the menu, or at least come for dinner. Props go to our waitress, who was really polite and attentive.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am shocked that this restaurant has such high reviews. I live around the corner, have been wanting to come for ages and was very underwhelmed. The food was not very flavorful and really quite forgettable. After the first bite of mine and my friend's meals, I thought, ""Yeaaah, I won't be coming back here."" Further (And this is a personal peeve), they wouldn't change ANYTHING on the menu. I wanted to pair one pasta dish with a different sauce from the menu and the answer was no. I wanted a different kind of pasta and the answer was no. I understand changes that really throw the kitchen off, but I'm almost positive they microwave things, so I can't imagine it being that difficult of a task. It is their restaurant, their rules, but I think accommodating your guests goes a long way. For the area, the prices are really good, though, so if you need an inexpensive meal and aren't fussed about how good it is, this works.

Outside of New York deli's (like the original Katz on Houston Street) this is my fav! Yes this is a copy of Katz NY but they did it right. Can't say enough good stuff about this Jewish style deli. They have cafeteria style seating with red checkered floor tiles with a few booths by the windows. They always put out tasty free pickles and slaw on each table. I always get the onion rings as a starter followed by a full size corned beef sandwich with their spicy deli mustard. They have a long menu so something for everyone. I also like the turkey meatloaf sandwich with mash potatoes and gravy on top. The staff moves fast so your food doesn't take very long to come out.

Their menu expanded just enough to add a few more simple options such as a chicken burger. But if you really want to have your socks knocked off, try the mashed potatoes with jalapeño puree.

"Pancakes: The best I have ever had and the great reviews on yelp reflect this. Service:  Unacceptable and RUDE...most of the negative reviews seem to reflect this too. After hearing many good things about this place I decided to give it a try.  My mom saw Bobby Flay's show that featured Clinton Street and wanted to go too.  So as not to have to wait, we picked a Monday night. Walked in and was seated right away. Order was taken and food arrived shortly after.  Food was excellent. In fact, the pancakes were so good that we decided to order another stack. I got the attention of the waitress and told her that we wanted anther order of the pancakes. So my mom stops eating the stack we were sharing and waits for her order of pancakes to come out. After about 15 mins of waiting the waitress comes to our table and asks us if she can get us anything else!!  I'm like where are the pancakes we ordered???  Waitress somehow misunderstood that we wanted an additional order. OK, misunderstandings happen...everyone is human. People make mistakes...but when I told her we wanted another order of pancakes she was very short with me...I was not sure she heard as she was not really responding and so I told her again explicitly that in addition to what what we have ordered we would like another order of the pancakes. But she evidently was not paying attention, even the second time I told her...because she was oblivious after.  Place was not even packed or that busy. So I just told her to forget it and asked for a check. So like I said, I would not hold this mistake against her or the restaurant...but I found it incredibly rude that she did not even have the decency to apologize. This I do hold against her.  She did not even explain to us that she misunderstood...just WALKED AWAY.  After all my mom ended up waiting 15 mins and then eating the rest of my cold pancakes. As much as I loved the pancakes, I hate rude people and shitty service.  Happy to pay 13 bucks for an order of amazing pancakes, but it is not really enjoyable to eat out at a place with poor service.  That said, the busboy was amazing...every other min he was there with water. Would have liked to give this place 5 stars, but probably won't return. I have read other reviews commenting on rude/bad service, I wonder if owner is aware.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had a great time, the food was delicious and prices were reasonable. And then came the aftermath. I ordered oxtail noodle soup and the meat was bad; I wound up getting a serious case of food poisoning from it. I spent all weekend with a high fever, complete with vomiting and dry-heaving. My dinner companion did not have the oxtail and was completely fine. I spent all weekend hugging the toilet or lying under 4 different blankets shaking. I liked this place, but it's been ruined for me. :(","[0.0, 1.0]"
We've been there twice. The first time was a busy Friday evening and we did not have a reservation but the hostess worked some magic and got us a table by the door within 10 minutes!  We ordered the gluten free fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp both times and it was absolutely delicious. The second visit was for Saturday brunch. The brunch menu offers half portion on the pasta and they actually reduce the price! We shared the spinach and walnut salad which was great. We will definitely be returning.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ten Stone is one of the BEST places in the city. It has a great beer selection, it can be a little noisy but sitting outside solves that. The ham and cheese on a pretzel is the BEST SANDWICH I've ever had in my life, the honey mustard is to die for. I've even asked for the recipe, it's a secret. Pretty much everything I've had there is amazing, the flank steak sandwich, cheese fondue (very big so share with a lot of people) and the staff is very friendly. Its always busy which says something about a place and the staff hasn't changed for the few years I've been going which is also a great sign. I consistently choose Ten Stone over many other Philly restaurants I LOVE IT.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Claire had a visa payment sticker on the door, however, when I tried purchasing a drink for $5 with visa, I was denied service because there must be a $10 minimum on card payment. It is not true because it applies to credit cards only and I wanted to pay debit. I was denied the service, the owner did not offer any other alternative than making me purchase a gift card and then she said she does not like fees associated with visa. Absolutely disappointing place, I am never going there again. Smaller businesses in this case always offer at least an apology or try to work out an alternative.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I always order pizza, the delivery is fast and courteous. I am Italian and the pizza is really like the Italian one, besides the americanized versions with chicken and other stuff whic we would never ever put on pizza.

"My fiance and I love reading the reviews on trip advisor and yelp, we find them to be pretty much accurate 90 percent of the time. However, we drove all the way from westchester New York to try this restaurant, and we were truly disappointed. First of all, when I called the place, they were not professional over the phone. When I got there the host was very nice. He told me it was an hour wait, and we decided to walk around and wait because we really wanted to try this restaurant. The place was very small and cute, and the service was fast and good. My fiance had some soup and lasagna, he said the lasagna had a chef boyardee taste to it. He did not like it very much. I had a spinach salad which was not good at all and gnocchi as an entree. The gnocchi was good not great and the same goes for everything else. If I had to rate the place, I would give the place a 2.50 out of a 5. However, the food was very inexpensive for New York City. If you want an inexpensive average meal, this is the place to dine but certainly not worth the wait. I will not be going back there. If you want really good Italian food, you must go to Zero Otto Nove on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx they also have a new location in NYC. However, I have only been to the one in the Bronx. It's really worth the trip. I think it's one of the best restaurants in New York.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went to DeLorenzo's last night (Tuesday) at 8:30 with two other people for a quick dinner.  Since I literally live upstairs from the restaurant in the Lofts I bare witness to the lines of people waiting outside daily to get in.  Each time I see this I have to chuckle and ask myself ""why?""  The pizza is ok but it's surely not worth waiting an hour (sometimes more) for.   Then comes the service.  Horrible!  Servers are only interested in getting you in and out.  I guess I can understand this since they're constantly trying to turn tables in order to get the mass of people waiting outside into the restaurant.  However, last night this was not the case.  It was fairly slow with 4 open booths.  Thinking we would walk in and sit down we were greeted (I think by the owner or manager), given a number and ask to wait.  Why???  After 10 min of waiting I requested to be seated in one of the 4 open booths.  ""I'm sorry sir, I can't sit 3 in a booth"" was the response.  I politely asked ""What happens if 3 sit in a booth?"" then reminded him that it was 8:30 on a Tuesday night and it would probably be ok to sit us there.  ""No I'm sorry sir, it's our policy"".  So after 10 more minutes of standing there hungary staring at 4 open tables we left and went to the best kept secret in Robbinsville for Italian food...Massimo's. In the opinions of myself and of my friends the pizza at Massimo's is much better than at DeLorenzo's.  There is never a wait, servers are friendly and there is a bigger selection.  My suggestion is to skip the hype of D.L's and head 1/2 mile down the street to Massimo's.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I really can't believe that I've been to the same place as those of you who give Brickyard glowing reviews.  I've been there twice since they opened a little over a year ago.  The first time was shortly after they opened.  I sat at the bar and ordered a vodka martini - which was served to me in a plastic Miller Lite cup by the bartender, who said, ""Yeah, sorry, I'm out of glasses.""  Seriously?  And it's not like I got a discount or anything on it. The second time was last week, when a friend and I stopped in on a weekday at about 6pm.  We again sat at the bar and waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  There was no contact from the bartender whatsoever - no nod, no eye contact, and definitely not any ""Hey guys, I'll be with you in a second.""  We were just ignored for more than 10 minutes, at which point my friend (who also happens to be a bartender) said, ""This is ridiculous - let's just go somewhere else.""   In short, you can all keep this overpriced ""gastropub.""  I'll gladly go spend my money somewhere else.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"While sitting on the couch hungover with the boyfriend New Year's Day we decided we should order some delivery. Apparently on holidays a lot of delivery places are not open. After some searching we found that Andy's Pizza was open. Now normally this is not my go to as their pizza leaves much to be desired. We ordered a chicken ceasar wrap, a bbq wrap, onion rings, and mozz sticks. All pretty safe things to order from a pizza place or so we thought. The bbq chicken wrap didn't even have bbq sauce rather some pink almost tasting like teriyaki sauce (gag). The chicken ceasar wrap had soggy lettuce that was brown and no ceasar dressing. The onion rings had so much batter that even those were not enjoyable. Now mozz sticks from a pizza restaurant should at least be hot and crispy not these; these were soggy and cold.  Obviously we immediately regretted our decision by ordering from here.

"I work at the Best Western Plus Fairfield Executive Inn, and we're always in a bind when it comes to finding 'lunch' options that fit into our wonky shift hours. After losing a former pizza shop in the same spot, I was excited to try Pazzo since I got tired of Chinese and burgers all the time. I was really surprised to find a pretty varied menu. They do salads/wraps/sandwiches, pasta dishes and really fantastic pizza. I was also thrilled to see ""Fat Sandwiches"". They're ""overstuffed"" and on these big doughy rolls. My only complaint is that my manager has to order them ""Morbidly Obese"" so they're filled to his liking. Personally I think they're a pretty hardy sandwich, but I'm 92 lbs of fury so we'll have to agree to disagree. xD I'm typing this while eating a BBQ Chicken slice. $3 isn't bad for a specialty slice. I like that they added sweet onion and I was very glad the sauce wasn't overpowering. I usually go in for wraps. The chicken/bacon/ranch wrap is a loyal go-to. They have a lot of options and the staff is really very friendly and accomodating. Everybody we send from the Front Desk has been pleased as well.

The service was also sub-par, they messed up our bill three times, overcharging us on drinks, then fixed that but created a new mistake, in the end they didn't even apply the discount they had applied as part of their Monday special, but at that point we were just done.

It was my first Venezuelan cuisine experience and i fell in love with it. The grilled tiger shrimp as an appetizer was delicious as well as the simple but flavorful cheese sticks. For dinner I had a empanada and it was tasty and filling. The red stripe and sangria we brought complimented the meal very well. The service was excellent and very friendly.

"There has got to be some sanity in the review section. I went to Do or Dine on Valentines Day with my girlfriend, after a long hard day of busting my ass. First thing I asked for was a cup of coffee, and honest to god, the waitress told me ""we don't serve beverages here."" To put it plainly, I was furious. I don't drink alcohol so there was nothing for me to drink but water. The entire meal, they were playing music I actually like, but playing it ironically(I know that sounds weird but you could tell if you were there), which [pissed me off even more. I ordered steak, and they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked. When it came, it actually was a delicious flavor, but the meat was tough and chewy(it was supposed to be flank), which frustrated me. And there was no salt anywhere. My girlfriend is a vegetarian, and she basically was presented with a 15$plate of leaves, all arranged very nicely, and flavorful, but vastly insubstantial. The general vibe I got was that the maintenance of their hip atmosphere was far more important than satisfying the customer. Apparently, at Do or Dine, the old addage ""the customer is always right"" does not apply. If not for the beauty and grace of my date, I would have a. lost my cool and b. had a terrible time. That I had a great dinner was in no way contributed to by the restaurant, service, atmosphere, or food. I will say the appetizers were fantastic, I can't lie. When the check came, I slapped a one hundred dollar bill on top of it and waited about 20 minutes in the emptying restaurant for the waitress to come pick it up, as though they had somehow forgotten me? I don't understand why that took so damn long. So, they get 2 stars, rather than one, for the following reasons. 1. They are competent food-wise. 2. There probably are some people who want to be abused in the way that we were when we went there, who would see it as a validation of their hipsterness. 3.Its not my taste, I guess, but they clearly have got something specific going there and are very accurately achieving it, even though I think it's bullsh*t.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The Franklin Steakhouse in Fairfield has some great things going for it. Great location, fun sports environment with probably over 20 huge TVs, attractive staff (for the most part), fun drinks specials, and a decent menu. However, that being said it is pretty obvious to any patron that the kitchen is not organized, the so called managers or owners are unprofessional and rude and it is clear they never worked in the restaurant business. The food was good, but some of it came out cold and those at our table that got steak it came out rare when it was supposed to be medium. Another time I went the food came out perfect so it goes both ways. I know that they just opened and I also know that sometimes it takes a month or two to have the kitchen work out all its kicks, so you can let that slide. Both times I went there the wait staff got my orders correctly, and spaced the appetizer and entrees perfectly. My one complaint about the waits staff is the first time I went there a brunette girl whose name I missed, took care of us, she lacked that personable quality a waitress should have and barely said a word to us, and never asked us if we wanted a refill (big drinking crowd here). The second time I went there was when it was a Saturday so it was really busy and this extremely friendly red headed waitress named Christan(spelling?) took care of us and made us get over our frustration of the long wait, was attentive to our table never letting a drink go dry, and even managed to joke around with us despite the fact that she/ the place was extremely busy. Having owned a restaurant myself, those type of staff members the place needs more of, because when things go wrong, the kitchen fails, the bar makes a drink wrong ect.. the server is the restaurant's first line of defense to make the customer not get upset/ smooth things over. Now on to my biggest complaint, the managers. They dress in everyday clothes, one of them who I think might be a manager/ owner I saw approach a table in sweats and continue to talk to the patron in a brash manner. Like a previous comment said I even over heard the managers cursing amongst each other about all the mishaps within earshot of the patrons. If they want a long term successful business they need to fix management, get people in there that know how to run a restaurant business and save the owner/managers social hour for after work hours. and Dress Professionally not that hard!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Eating at Degustation is a bit of dinner theater, with front row seats to watch the chefs as they prepare your dishes.  I went to Degustation last night not realizing that it's part of the Jack and Grace Lamb empire.  I went to Jewel Bako years ago and I think Degustation fits well within the mold of their other restaurants tucked away on E.5th street - intimate, personal, and creative. The dishes, being tapas, were predictably small, and the waitress suggested 3-4 tapas per person.  We weren't horribly hungry and ended up ordering about five dishes to share, ranging from the jamon croquettes ($5) to the tasting of lamb ($17).  The squid stuffed with ox tail served over squid ink risotto was especially good.

We decided to come here for a little date night and the whole time, with full mouths, we couldn't stop saying ""what a great idea!"" Posto is small, but we got seated pretty quickly. We ended up getting a large Pineapple and bacon pie. It can out perfectly crispy, and the bacon was thick cut, smokey and delicious. My only complaint would be that the girls that work there don't really seem to care about the customers. The hostess saw us in and told up there would be a 15 minute wait, but didn't offer an alternative for us (like go wait at the bar) I had to ask her if we can wait at the bar and get a drink. The ""bartender"" didn't ask us if we wanted anything, instead she threw some menus our way and then went back to the end of the bar to continue chatting with the waitress and hostess. When a table finally opened up we were finally asked if we wanted something to drink. we sat there for about 10 minutes drinkless. not even a glass of water. When we finally moved to our table, it took some time for our waitress to arrive but she was nice and friendly and seemed to be the only waitress on staff that night. in the end the waitress, bartender and hostess would keep gathering at the end of the bar and talk, be on their phones and just kind of hang out and look bored. When we left the hostess was eating dinner and we said goodbye and thank you and she just kind of looked annoyed that we acknowledged her. Anyways, go there for the delicious pizza and don't try to make friends with the staff. they don't want to be friends with you.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I recently visited NYC on a trip with my mom and sister.  My mom and I are gluten free, so we visited Bistango Restaurant in search of some delicious Italian gluten free food.  For the first time in almost three years, my mom and I had delicious filled pastas: she had manicotti and I had tortellini.  After stuffing ourselves, I asked the owner where they got such authentic gluten free food and he gave us the brochure for DePuma's Gluten Free Pasta! WOOHOO!  Upon arriving back home in Atlanta, I looked up their site and immediately ordered my mom several packages of manicotti and tortellini to have shipped directly to her house. They arrived perfectly packaged to WV and we had gluten free manicotti with meatballs on Christmas Eve.  I am SO happy that we found this gem of a gluten free store and that they make getting their products so easy!!  Definitely check them out, you'll be so happy that you did!!  My only request is that you pester some Italian restaurants here in Atlanta to start carrying your products!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Disclaimer: I am not a fan of hipsters; in fact I'm a notorious hipster-hater, but I have to give them credit where credit is due: political awareness, bicycle promotion and morning cuisine.  When it comes to making a slamming breakfast, nobody beats the hipster, and Café Lift is standing proof.  On the savory side, their frittatas are amazing (especially the mushroom frittata).  For those with a sweet tooth, I have yet to find a superior French toast.  They have specials every so often to mix things up, and their diner-style bar is nice when there are only two of you.  The only downsides are that the neighborhood is a bit (i.e. VERY) seedy and the place gets really crowded on weekends.","[0.0, 1.0]"

HORRIBLE! I order from here a few months ago (would've reviewed sooner but just signed up for yelp) and was disgusted with the food and the lack of care from the delivery driver. It took over 2 hours for us to get our food and when it finally arrived the driver left our pizza at the restaurant. Instead of apologizing he suggested we pick it up instead. When he came back a half hour later he expected an extra tip for having to return and gave me an attitude when I told him I was not going to reward his mistake. And then to top it off the pizza was ice cold. Never ordering from here ever again!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"I think ""solid"" is the right word for this place. Though a bit pricey, the food is good and the portions are generous. As an example, the $5 ""side"" of tostones my friend and I ordered looked (in her words) ""more like potato latkes"" because of their size - and there were about 6 of them. I don't even know how we finished them between her cast-iron pot full of about 4 servings of seafood paella and my gargantuan plate of very fresh, delicious shrimp. My only complaints are that the sangria was really weak/too sweet, there weren't many good, hearty sounding salad options, and the bartender actually carded me for water while waiting for my friend, which was especially weird considering I wasn't carded at the table when we ordered a pitcher of sangria.

"People, believe the hype. After living in NY for three years, I finally tried this place after hearing so much about it... but I did it with a Google offer for dinner for two. I have no qualms about eating breakfast food for dinner however (ESPECIALLY if that means I don't have to wait 2 hours just to get seated), so away my fiance and I went on a Friday after work. We walked in around 7 p.m. and were greeted by the hostess. There were a few empty tables, and we got seated right away... but next to the food window. We asked our server if we could sit at a different table, and she helped us do just that. But most importantly, the blueberry pancakes and maple butter are awesome (moist, fluffy yummy goodness), and the fried chicken delectable. My fiance is obsessed about fried chicken, so he knows when it's good. He couldn't stop talking about how wonderful the breading and its crispiness were... how juicy and flavorful the meat was... he killed the entire dish. He's also not a big fan of pancakes, but he was impressed with Clinton St.'s. Congratulations, Clinton St., you've managed to impress a guy I thought could not be impressed. We were already pretty full after the main courses but couldn't help ourselves and ordered the sundae with a brownie. IT WAS SO GOOD. I could hardly speak after eating it; it was as if all the sugar I had just consumed had paralyzed my mouth. This little place is cute, clean, and worth trying! I'd avoid weekend brunch hours if you don't like waiting, but other times are probably not too busy.

"Little owl lives up to my interpretation of its name.... It is a little restaurant with a killer food instinct that grabs you and won't ever let you loose. First off, the menu is interestingly diverse and sophisticated with excellent presentation and preparation. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive (noticed quickly that I was bothered by a small draft of cold air from the door and blocked it off without me having to ask). We started with the flavorful meatball sliders and the special of lobster soup. Both excellent and surprising despite their apparent simplicity. For entrees, we had cured ham wrapped scallops and broiled halibut. Both dishes exceptional, the halibut had a wonderful crispiness on the outside while retaining an interior juiciness. Lastly, the desert of pumpkin panna cotta was a bit of a disappointment (too sweet with a tad too much cinnamon). However, the cheese selection was quite interesting and paired quite nicely with a dry sherry. Looking forward to my next trip.  Note: Excellent wine list, available by the glass.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I admit, I've been on a bad yelp rut lately.  But my visit to one of the most celebrated gastro pubs in NYC should restore some of the lost mojo.  Spotted Pig boasts a terrific English-Italian style menu in a super casual setting.  Wait can be upwards of two hours, during peak dinner hours.   The grilled burger with Roquefort cheese was very satisfying.  The Pig is one of the few spots that makes medium rare perfectly.  The meat itself was a bit bland and was overpowered by the cheese.  But that's nitpicking.  Overall, this place is well above average.  Don't forget the deviled eggs too, that really sums up the Pig's rich and salty food theme.  Service was excellent as well.  As James Cromwell said in one of my favorite movies, ""That will do, Pig, that will do.""","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The line of the evening: ""I just burped my chicken po boy and it was still just as delicious!""  My husband and I took my father-n-law, who lived in New Orleans, to try Sugarfreak. He was skeptical, especially when my husband chose the crawfish etouffee.  You could just tell he didn't think there was anyway crawfish in Queens would compare to the authentic dish from New Orleans.  Lets just say the skeptic let out a very vocal ""Mmmmmm"" when he took his first bite.   My husband also ordered the charbroiled oysters and thought they were absolutely delicious.  I tried the pork boudin balls and thought they were pretty good.  We came back three nights later for dinner with my brother/sis-n-law and ordered the oysters, beef n bits, crawfish boudin balls, jumbalya, crawfish etouffee, and chicken po boy.  There wasn't any food left over. The drink menu is great.  They offer New Orleans beer.  Right now they're carrying Abita 'Restoration' beer from Louisiana, which my husband really liked. We also tried the cajun martini, pimm's cup, the pumpkin spice martini, and the blackberry margarita (across the two dinners!) and they were all delicious.

I guess that will be similar to a nice home cooked meal. We did enjoy the south indian style chicken curry. I wish they had more meat cuts (like thighs and breasts) in the tandoori. Just drumsticks.

"Ok so Martha's was on my to try list for brunch for quite some time and I was so excited to finally eat there on Christmas weekend (it was pretty empty) only to be kind of disappointed by the food itself. Don't get me wrong, it was unique and tasty but way waaay too salty/spicy making it difficult to actually finish a dish. The decor is very hipster chic. The coffee comes in metal mugs. Enough said. We ordered a lot of food for the table because it all sounded amazing. - The Fried Chicken and Biscuit was a hit but two little pieces of chicken for $14 always feels a little ridiculous - Thai egg salad (fried eggs, celery, carrots, peanuts, shallots etc) sounded great but was heavily over sauced and is served cold. Cold eggs just don't do it for me. - Cast iron pancake - heavy and had a weird aftertaste like it was cooked near bacon or something. The apple compote on top was delicious though. - Brussel sprouts - you can almost do no wrong with brussel sprouts as far as I'm concerned except these were again a tiny bit too salty/over-spiced -Duck fat biscuit - apples on top were good but biscuit tasted too dry Overall it was a big heavy meal and I'm glad I tried it.

The medium spicy sauce actually has spice, unlike every other place, where medium tastes like nothing!  I had the pork, which was a little dry- I want to try the carne asada next time.   BUT MY FAVORITE THING is that they put the sour cream on from a squeeze bottle!  I find large amounts of sour cream sickening but I still like a little bit of the flavor- so this is perfect!  I always ask Chipotle for a ""little"" sour cream but they always always glob on a whole bunch!  Yuck!

Great pork belly sliders, sick fried oysters (maybe the best I've had) and very cool drinks list. We ended up sticking around for dinner and didn't disappoint.

"Don't be fooled by some of these moderate ratings.. This place bar none is by far the best pizza in New York. I used to deliver for Dom back in the '70's Here's the deal. He uses fresh tomatoes along with canned that is shipped from Italy. He uses the best Mozzarella cheese commercially available. He grinds his own Parmesan and Romano cheeses which he generously sprinkles on the pies before and after he lifts them from the 400 degree oven with his bare hands..That in itself is worth the hour wait for a pie. It is ""Thin Crust"" so you can easily devour a pie with just one other person. He grows oregano in his window of the shop and there is plenty in a jar at the counter to sprinkle on the delightful olive oil he delicately adds as the pie leaves the oven. The wait may be long. But the experience of that pizza lasts a lifetime. I'm sorry to write this because I just put myself in the back of the line. Anyone who's written a negative review of this place is clueless to what a true Brooklyn experience Dom's hard work is.. He is a treasure to our community. He's in his 80's and he's still going 6 days a week making these works of art!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The restaurant is located in a not very pleasant neighborhood and getting there is a challenge; you better have a decent SUV since the roads are all in a pretty bad shape.

Now, why I cannot give it more than ""two starts"". The restaurant marked at having slightly above average price. This (I assumed) should come with something ""above average"".  However... and this is where I have to warn those who want to visit this place: either reserve/ask for a table which is NOT the closest to the kitchen, or be brave enough to ask for a cut nex to the surface when you are ordering Rodizio. I've got a table which was the first on the way from the kitchen and I didn't have guts to ask for a slice of meat which is not the burned-and-spiced surface one.

"Walked in to get some soup - to go.  Today's soup was black bean.  Terrific!  I love black bean soup!  And they politely warned me it had bacon.  No problem.  Bacon?  Bring it.   What they should have warned me is that their black bean soup with bacon costs, with tax, $10.79.  Eleven bucks for soup?  That's insane.  Even the server was embarrassed by it.  Nice people work there.  But I will never go there again.  Because only an incredibly idiotic person would spend that much for black bean soup.  The owners are, it seems, conning thieves who should be ashamed of themselves.  Eleven-buck soup is killing The West Village. Walked four blocks down West 4th.  Ordered black bean soup at Sevilla.  Five bucks.  It was delicious.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Okay, I'll agree with the name; pretty awesome. Came here with my boyfriend and two friends on Saturday. Small place, weird to park (we parked in front because we could), but friendly staff and very good food! The menu was thorough but not completely overwhelming - they knew what dishes they were good at. All of us ordered some form of curry - I had the yellow curry with squid, pineapple, baby corn, etc. Terrific! It was pretty hot so I took half of it home and had a tasty lunch yesterday. Prices were fair. Place was a bit quiet (I think at one point the music turned off and it was one of those weird quiet scenarios where you felt the other tables looking at each other like oh no, they can hear us now!) but otherwise the ambiance was fine.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"WOW ..............I walked inside Sports Burger and I got a warm welcome from the Manager Jimmy. He told me he just took over the location and that it was under New management. I looked at the menu and ordered the New Jersey Burger with Waffle Fries & a Drink. I didn't know what to expect. The food was ready and Jimmy brought it over to me. I haven't had a burger like this in a while. It was a Fresh ground beef Burger, Peppers ,Onions, Cheese, lettuce & tomato, Mayo & Ketchup and the Bun was really good, never seen anything like it.          I have to say that was a great meal, at a great price. The hospitality & the staff was so nice. The place had a great vibe. The food was fresh and I enjoyed every bite. I am always in Newark on business, and that will be my spot for a great burger. On the way out Jimmy made me a sample of the wings. I will let you guys know about them next time. Keep up the great job SPORTS BURGER! SEE YOU SOON!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Decided to eat here today to taste what all the buzz was about. Approaching the store I saw a B-grade from the health department but still went inside following my gut (or hunger). I wanted to try something semi healthy and new, so I ordered the vegetarian chicken sandwich with medium spicy option. Included inside the French baguette was the veggie chicken, mayo, butter, cucumber, picked carrots & daikon radish and cilantro. As far as the spice, they added sriracha sauce (instead of the usual jalapeno peppers that traditional Vietnamese sandwiches add). Overall my experience was positive. They provided speedy customer service and the sandwich was warm and tasty. I will be visiting here again in the near future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A hustling bustiling prime lunch spot, Sergimmo's definitely is a diamond in the rough compared to the lack of good eats around penn station.   Its a small order at the counter with limited seating so try to get their early if you plan to eat in.   A small Italian deli, with amazing typical panini styles, but they definitely spark in quality.   I ordered the Lombardia and I was not dissapointed.  The pesto in the Lombardia is just the right amount where it doesnt overwhelm the taste of the chicken. The Umbria was my next choice.  a great combination of chicken and proscuitto for those meatlovers.  not too much of either meat that you feel stuffed.  Tastes great but not as flavorful as the Lombardia. I have heard great things about the Massimo as well.

"Been here 10 times and I've eaten around the menu and tried some specials. Good news: Excellent food - really excellent. I've been to New Orleans and this stacks up. The ribs are the best I've had in NYC, as is the red beans and rice. A couple of the chicken dishes I tried are serious revelations, and the drinks and desserts are just as good - not trucked-in afterthoughts like at other places. (Not to dump on my adopted borough, but there's a lot of care and delicacy to their stuff which is lacking in most SI restaurants.) The portions are huge which just means yummy leftovers. It's not cheap, but in terms of value, it's exceptional. Waitstaff is very friendly and professional.   Bad news: Kitchen is too small. No, I'm not an interior designer, but this is the only conclusion i can come to. The waiters hustle their asses off but if you go on a busy night (most nights I've been there) it can take over 2.5 hours just to get through a 3-course meal. Once I clocked a full hour between appetizers and main courses. Too many tables for the size of the kitchen. We only go very early now, which is a drag because most of the time that's inconvenient. Get the food out quicker and I'd give a fifth star without hesitation. Seriously - this is a great place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We stopped at Isabella's on 8/31/2013 because it looked quaint and had outdoor seating. The restaurant was quite busy on this hot, Saturday afternoon. My first impression was that of a busy, NYC cafe. Nothing special and nothing bad. While waiting for seating I visited the restroom. Dirty and cramped is the best way to describe it. Xcelerator hand dryer located over the toilet??? Toilet paper on the floor flying all over the bathroom while I'm drying my hands (over the toilet). Gross. Once seated outside, our waitress was friendly but we had to wait a bit for pretty much everything, including a straw. I ordered the chopped salad (think Greek salad) with shell steak. I was very disappointed. the salad had no reall taste and the steak was VERY fatty. At $8 extra for the steak, I was disappointed. 1/2 of the steak was not edible. My daughter had (runny) scrambled eggs since this was still considered brunch. The lemon fries was good. My friend had the grilled chicken skewer salad and said it was tasty. My bloody mary was nothing special, and the more I drank it the more I was questioning the chunks of horseradish that I was swallowing since my experience at Isabella's left me questioning the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our bill came to $64 for 3 people including the bloody mary and a belini. I will never come back here again and I do not recommend this restaurant, especially when there are thousands of others to choose from.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Hands down the best meal I've had (in NYC) for a really long time. We got there around 9pm on Tuesday and the place was packed! It's a small spot but every table was taken and the bar (it's little) was full. They are a teensy on the disorganized side and it took some time for someone to greet us. We finally get a spot at the bar and my friend orders a glass of wine (nice wine by the glass list) and I order a White Manhattan off the cocktail list.  I like Manhattan's, preferably made with bourbon but this one caught my eye because it was made with a corn whiskey.  I'm a bartender and I thought it would only be right for me to investigate this further. It was very dry. I think they may have used dry vermouth to keep it white. Not really my style and I found the drink to be underwhelming. On to dinner... another glass of white for my friend. I had a Nebbiolo. Very good. I should probably go on to describe it as being earthy or notes of cherry. Uh, like I said, it was very good. Now to the food: We began with a dozen oysters, 6 east coast, 6 west coast. I prefer my oysters to be big suckers and these were on the smaller size but they were fresh and delicious!  Damn, I seriously love oysters! Then we shared a bunch of stuff. - Chicken Liver Pate- OMG! -Market Salad- made with raw kale, chopped finely, with a bit of olive oil and lemon- Sounds healthy? It was. And so simple, yet delicious. -King Fish sashimi- light, fresh, yum -Muffaletta sandwich- It's a very good and if I had never been to Central Grocery in New Orleans- the birth place of the muffaletta sandwich- I would have never thought to order it.  It's not quite the same as CG but it's pretty damn good nevertheless. - We also had some meat and cheese which was served with some really delicious bread. For desert they sent us out homemade vanilla ice cream in a bowl of espresso with biscotti on the side and a chocolate caramel tart. To top off the evening a round of some lemony liquor (not lemoncelo) but similar (we have a friend there, so that's why the special treatment)! Luckily I live nearby and was able to roll home. Marlow and Son's is perfect for a date or for catching up with old friends. We sat for 3 hours and ate and drank and had a grand ol' time. I'm looking forward to coming back in the daytime and perusing their general store. I noticed they carry a large selection of foreign and gourmet products as well as a good deal of southern goodies. In addition they sell coffee and baked goods. I may be popping in tomorrow morning for breakie. P.S. Maybe it's boring that I named everything I ate/drank. It was just so so good!

"The food was closer to 3-stars than 4, but the interior decor and the great service boosts this up to 4 stars.  Also, since I came for a Restaurant Week lunch, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   I had the salad to start, followed by the hand-made pasta, and a slice of olive oil cake to finish.  The salad was fresh, beautiful, and very satisfying.  The pasta was good for a couple of bites, then quickly became too creamy for my taste.  This is entirely a matter of opinion--I just felt it was a bit too heavy for lunch.  The olive oil cake was soft, moist, and just the right portion (I tend to finish anything you set in front of me, so portion sizes do matter, if only for my personal health).   Terrific staff and nice ambiance.  I look forward to coming back, but probably not during RW next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Just got back from Nizi Sushi where we had New Years Day dinner and it was great. When we arrived we were seated immediately, by the time we left - the place was packed...as the other reviews state it's small but cozy. We went to this particular place because of Yelp and the other reviews, I liked the idea of the free soups and mussels and that did indeed add to the meal. About a minute after ordering we received the rice/crab porridge, it was delicious. When we finished, the miso soup came right away and was also delicious. We ordered the 20 piece sashimi boat and edimame as the starter, I loved it all. The waiters were attentive, friendly and spot on. They waited until they knew we were through, and asked before taking anything away to make sure we wanted them to. For the main dish we ordered Kop-Dol, my wife the vegetable and myself the pork. As expected, after all the yummy starter food, this was too much food and we wound up taking half of the Kop-Dol home, however, I did have to say out loud to my wife that this has to be the last bight or I will be too full (at least 3 times) before finally finishing. I found the sushi to be great and the Kop-Dol is a perfect follow up to make the meal full and hearty. The Sushi/Korean Kop-Dol combo is great. I definitely recommend going for dinner. We usually order take out Sushi from another establishment in Rutherford (also good) but Nizi is far better. We did bring a bottle of wine with us, which they took as we were seated, and, had opened and sent to our table with glasses and our menu's before we ordered. As we left I started making plans to go back with friends. I'm glad we decided to stay in Jersey rather than go into the city for dinner. Thumbs up. So happy to have found a quaint little jem of a place so close to home. I'm rating 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the food, and the feeling of wanting to go back again and again. Side note: the wife is currently on the couch ready to fall asleep, but, I think the New Years Eve celebration last night has more to do with that than anything. All the best to Nizi Zushi in 2011.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I don't think I've ever enjoyed a meal as much as I did tonight, so I'm starting my account on Yelp! and dedicating my first review to Coppelia.  It really deserves it. Short Version: DELICIOUS, WONDERFUL WAITING SERVICE, QUICK, LOVELY, GREAT, FRIENDLY, HAPPINESS, YAY! Long Version: Four friends and I decided to eat at Coppelia after being told there was a 3-hour wait at Hakata TonTon.  We arrived around 8:30 PM, and there were no empty tables.  The hostess told us to wait just a moment and then went to help a table with their check.  She returned, saying quietly with a grin, in a joking conspiring tone, ""Those girls just paid, so they're probably leaving"".   We were seated within 5 minutes.  Their tables were very comfortable, and the menus were on paper place mats but didn't look at all cheap.   The busser who brought us our water was also extremely friendly, smiled a lot, and joked around with us throughout our meal.  We asked our server Carlos for his suggestions, which were the Parridilla and the Chaufa de Mariscos.  The special starter of the day was mussels in a garlic sauce with fries.  He, too, was really friendly.  (Everyone was just super duper friendly.) In the end, as a group, we ended up ordering the mussels as an appetizer, a Lomo Saltado, a Chaufa de Mariscos, a Camarones Diablo, and 2 Parridillas. The mussels came out very quickly.  Perhaps 10 minutes at the most.  And they were delicious.  The nicely seasoned fries were presented on a napkin in a nice mini fryer basket, and the mussels were a good portion for 5 people.  They also gave us a pretty decent sized bowl of extra sauce, which was also really tasty.  When we finished the mussels, we kept saying how great it would be if there were some bread to dip in the sauce, and lo and behold!  The busser brought us a nice basket of buttery, warm, delicious bread.  I don't know if he overheard us or just knew.  It was really great. The main entrees came out just about 5 minutes or so after we finished with the appetizer.  Really great portion sizes...meaning large.  And everything tasted delicious.  What was really nice was that when the Parridillas came out, they had these huge steak knives, and one of the other bussers came by and took away the bread knives of my friends who ordered them, saying with a smile,  ""You probably don't need two knives, huh.""  It was really great seeing that they noticed something like that and were comfortable enough to do that. Everything was wonderful.  Our glasses were never empty of water, and everyone always came by with a smile.  The waiting staff sang ""Happy Birthday"" to a woman sitting at the next table and gave her a piece of delicious-looking cake.  The only thing I was sad about was that, unlike some sort of ruminant animal, I didn't have four stomachs to fill with wonderful food. At the end of the meal, we were all really full, but kept attempting to finish everything.  We did pretty well, I think.  People who think women can't eat large quantities should stop by this restaurant next time that my friends and I are there.  Carlos asked us if we wanted dessert, which we sadly declined.  (Everyone should probably try some, though.  The pastry chef is Pichet Ong from Spice Market and Spot Dessert Bar.)  He also asked us to fill out some comment cards, which we happily did because we enjoyed everything so much.  You can probably tell, though, because I'm writing this ridiculously long review. Our check came up to just under $100 not including tip, about $20 per person, which is on the low side of average in a nice restaurant in New York.  We tipped according to how we felt about the place and, being students, how much we could afford. While we were figuring out the check, the staff was gathered around reading our comment cards and the hostess jokingly hid them.  It was a lot of joking around and fun. Finally, after this long review (or rather, this long story), if you don't want to have a really welcoming, friendly, delicious meal, don't go to Coppelia.  Because if you do go to Coppelia, you'll get all of that and more.   Also, I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever drawn tiny hearts as a comment for a meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"For some reason I feel like there's been a rash of pizza joints operated by heavily tattooed folks opening in this city.   Like pizza is edgy or something.  It's not.  It should be straightforward and good.  Simple.  And don't hug me when I check into your joint (Pizza Brain).  Gross.  Go make me a pizza. This is where Bufad excels.  Yeah, people had an edge here.  But more South Philly rough-around-the-edges edge versus Northern Liberties look-at-me edge.  Good edge.  But whatever, I'm here to eat pizza.  Do you make good pizza?  Yes.  Do you need to beat me over the head with that fact?  No.  Deal.  Let's eat. The sausage pizza here is the best I've ever had.  Any pizza, any place.  They make a few non-pizza dishes that all look, or can be confirmed as, delicious.  Simple.  Take the burrata.  A few everyday ingredients thrown together in a way you feel like you could do at home, but know deep down it wouldn't be the same.

"After all of the hype Shake Shack has been getting the last couple months I've been wanting to try it and finally did. I got a single shackburger, cheese fries, and a black and white milkshake. The tomato and lettuce was fresh and a good size, but I was disappointed in the size of the single patty. The meat was good and I love that it's all-natural, it just wasn't enough especially for almost $5. Next time I'll definitely have to get the double. The shacksauce on the burger was incredible and definitely makes the burger. The cheese fries were also delicious, but my favorite part of the meal was the milkshake. The black and white milkshake was so good and the perfect thickness. They were running a promotion for charity where if you donated $2, you got a free milkshake on your next visit.

"I am going to keep it simple- I have a book to write. As a struggling writer,when my books take off, I WILL be in the wonderful establishment during brunch with my laptop, in some corner doing what I adore doing. I adore this place-it's interiors- the windows- the sophisticated crowd. Pretty awesome. Monument Lane is the intellectual's version of ""The Cafeteria""- and just as adored. I kind of what this place to blow up-become super successful, but not really. It's perfect as it is-those in the know come here to congregate with like minds, delicious,creative food and WONDERFUL service. BTW- The bartender- some handsome black man- was STELLAR very attentive. My ONLY complaint is that they have very little vegan or vegetarian fare. But my server always helps me with soups and delicious salads as well as other 'culinary concoctions' that are spread across their small but fabulous menu. I always leaved pleased.

"oh jacobs pickles, why don't you take reservations? I've been trying to eat here for awhile but always felt let down when the wait was an hour or more.  This past Saturday night, however, we had time to kill before a party so we put our names down and went elsewhere to grab some drinks. The hostess told us an hour but the time increase to almost an hour 30. Finally we got seated.  The wait staff seemed to be small in number and therefore extremely busy.  Wait times were slow, unfortunately from the start. To eat, we had the biscuits and fixins which were pretty good but I felt the biscuits could've been warmer/fresher. For my main I got the salmon which was recommended by the waiter.  The salmon was excellent, perfectly cooked and seasoned but I thought the side to the salmon was very odd. It was mushrooms in a cream and cheese sauce. Did not work with the salmon.  My boyfriend had the mac and cheese which was quite tasty and the portion was huge.   I would only come back here if you can make a reservation for a large party. Otherwise, try your hand somewhere else","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Korean food is not for everybody. It can sometimes really disagree with your stomach, and if you've never tried it before, it can be very intimidating. But at Woorijip, which means ""our house,"" you will have a much better chance falling in love with this cuisine. And if you like Korean and want to introduce your friend to it, this is a great place to bring them for their first ever Korean dinner. The restaurant boasts of ""choices that are endless"" and ""prices that are impressive,"" and promises that you will come back for more. All three of these things are true. The food is great: there are selections that are tamed down for the less adventurous people, and selections that are so spicy that steam will come out of your ears. (Fans of Korean food actually consider that a GOOD thing.) There is also a great selection of what I love most about Korean cuisine: the sweets! Don't let the plain appearance of these cakes fool you. Korean baked goods are amazing: light, not too sweet, sometimes with a very slight hint of salt, they are like no other pastries in the world.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Told them to make it flavourful, with a hint of truffle oil and mushroom, and they came up with the best-tasting spaghetti bolognese I've ever had! It was plate licking good-I finished everything.

Waitress was terrible.  We had to wait 15 minutes for the other waitress, who was obviously stretched too thin.  Also, the place is two crowded, and twice, when delivering food to other tables, the waitress kicked a chair into me: once on the left, and once on the right.  She only appologized the second time, and never asked how our food was.

"I am glad I didn't see the negative reviews here before I went.  My wife, being from Japan, is very picky about what she'll call good food and suggested Ricky's for dinner last night, and her restaurant recommendations are rarely wrong. The food was great.  I've traveled many times over many years to Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, and have a taste for the regional cuisine - especially the aromas and unusual flavors - though not necessarily for the unquenchable fire.   That said, Ricky's kept the things I love about Thai food, the spices, a gifted use of ingredients like coconut milk and lemon grass, but were blissfully light on the painful fire you often get with Thai food.  (You can choose a high level of fire if you like - you're in control). We had the Panang Curry with chicken, the Pad Thai with Shrimp, a Warm Salad dish that had minced pork in a delicious lemon-grass marinade, a duck appetizer and egg rolls. The only thing that was just OK were the egg-rolls, which were OK but did not rise up to the level of the 4 other dishes. But those 4 other dishes were truly exceptional. The decor and food presentation was lovely, and the service was charming.   I guess others on this board had experienced otherwise, but in addition to the regular wait-staff, I thought the owner, Ricky, himself was also very charming.  Service was friendly, helpful, and efficient without feeling rushed. Given a small group of 3, we had a nicely varied array of dishes, left the table fully satisfied, and spent exactly $21 a person, at DINNER time.   That's a rare achievement in this area, especially for this kind of food experience and pleasant decor. You could spend more if you want at Ricky's, but the curries, warm salads and noodle dishes are all very reasonable, and so if you base your meal around these, it will be very light on your wallet.  They have other higher end dishes too - a great selection for any Thai food lover. As a Montgomery resident I'll be bringing family and friends often.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"How did I not write a review about this place yet?  They have the best steak in all of NYC and I've been to the usual suspects (Peter Lugers, Sparks, etc).   The skirt steak with the chimichurri on the side & sea salt, plus the mashed potatoes sprinkled with amazingness are soo good and if memory serves me correctly, only $21. The avocado fries for appetizer are a MUST. They are always crunchy on the outside (yay panko!) and smooth and creamy on the inside. The spicy ketchup-like dipping sauce is amazing.   I've also tried their fish tacos, calamari, side salad, rib eye, stuffed pepper and flan.  ALL are soo good.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. When I can, I grab a seat at the bar, because table seating can be tight.  There is also one waitress there that can be a little bitchy, but I'm totally overlooking that because no amount of rudeness could keep me away from the amazing steaks!!

"Went for pizza because it was recommended to me by another person who has Celiac disease.  It means I have to eat Gluten Free.  Happened to be watching how they made it and discovered they REALLY DO NOT understand what G/F means.  They used the same sauce and ladle as for all their pizzas.  When I brought this to their attention, I was told, ""this is how we always do it.""  They were perplexed as to what to do when the owner asked what the problem was.  I explained and he ordered another pie with a clean ladle and sauce.  So I watched from a distance and the pie was prepped by the same person making all the other pies, with his hands from the regular dough.  This is cross-contamination!  I did eat that pizza and am paying the price today.  My advice if you have Celiac disease, don't eat where they think it's a fad.  Ask if they understand what the fuss is all about. On another note, my companion thought the regular pizza was good and the place was clean. D.C. Pompton Plains","[0.0, 1.0]"

Waitress took order at 4:55. Salad was served at 5:25. Dinner was served at 5:35. In the meantime, at least 7 other parties were seated and served - with their dinners, salads, drinks, etc. - afer we had been seated.One of the parties that received service after we had been waiting for almost an hour to eat intervened with the manager, Lisa, to point out that we had not been served yet, and we were there ahead of them, and Lisa did not even come to our table to enquire as to the situation.

"The good:  Margaritas were excellent. The bad:  Linty napkins -- don't wear black pants or a shirt.  Slow service -- delay between dishes was 15-20 minutes.  Food was underwhelming. Cuban corn - really acidic compared to other cuban corn I've had. Also not enough cheese. Mac and Cheese -- they added bacon and pork rinds to mac and cheese and IT DIDN'T MAKE IT TASTE ANY BETTER. That is a travesty to pork products. The best mac and cheese is made from just macaroni and cheese at Beecher's -- when will people learn the secret is just USE HIGH QUALITY CHEESE and SEASONING. Frita Cubana - this burger was raved about in Time Out NY and I have to say it's a solid ""Meh.""  I ordered the chef's recommendation of medium for the burger and I should have stuck to my normal rare/medium-rare.  The burger meat was not seasoned and there is no excuse for that.  No amount of cheese or whatever can make up for that. Chicken arepas - the chicken (spicy, well seasoned) and guacamole were excellent. The arepa shell was tasty and crunchy WHEN HOT.  Unfortunately, the bottom halves of each arepa was ice cold. Overall a solid ""Meh""... after I had to dust off the lint from my pants.  Honestly, we're not in Cuba and there is no excuse for cheap, linty napkins.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Grimaldi's is the best pizza that has ever hit these lips. There's always a line outside, but it moves quickly. I do recommend breaking up your party into smaller groups if you have a large group. The wait was much longer for our party of 6. However, it was soooo worth it. Once we were seated, the pizzas were out within about 10 minutes of ordering. Try the Brooklyn Black Cherry soda bottled right there in Brooklyn. Delicious. The fresh mozzarella, the hint of fresh basil and the fresh toppings coupled with the coal oven baked crust is what makes this pizza heavenly. Well worth the wait and we'll be back again and again. They also apparently opened a Manhattan location around 20th St that we were unaware of. Brooklyn is a bit of a trek, but I like going over there just to hang out in Brooklyn! If you are unfamiliar with the subways, make sure you take the BLUE line down (A, C). Puts you off very close to Grimaldi's.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We came here for a late-ish dinner on a Thursday. My friend had already eaten and wanted a drink. I was eager to try out a dish and a glass of wine. We ended up at the bar at Il Pesce. To be honest, I was initially a bit put off by the service. It was later on a Wednesday night. We sat at the bar at Il Pesce. Normally we would have felt bad not ordering food for both of us. But it was late, and I was planning on getting something. We both ordered wine (rose for me, a red for my friend) and declined hearing about the specials because I didn't want to be tempted when I already had an idea of what I wanted to order. Must have been miscommunication, although I told my friend, in front of the waitress, my intention to go through the menu and order a dish. Our waitress informed us that normally they don't people to sit at the bar just for drinks. I totally understand and was not offended by the policy. But I was clearly looking through the menu (had menu in hand and was studying it, asked someone next to me what they ordered bc it looked delish) and had mentioned ordering something; she still felt that she had to come by to reiterate the policy. To her credit, when I complained that I felt the whole experience off-putting especially because I was clearly planning on ordering, she apologized right away and had a manager stop by to check on us. The rest of the meal was fine. With that initial awkwardness over, she was very attentive, let us know Birreria was open after 10 (unlike the rest of Eataly), and we tipped her the usual 20-25%. Food and service were fine. Had a good fig/shrimp/pancetta dish. The three stars is more for the concept. It seems really cool at first, but then actually dining there, it felt more like a mess. The benefit of having so many options nearby is mitigated by the fact that everyone in your party has to dine at the same place if you want to sit together. To me, it defeats the purpose of cramming so many places into one giant space. It would be nice to have one person get pasta, another get fish, etc. There also really isn't a place to stand with a drink/snack. They have bar tables, but they are SUPER high. I can't comfortably eat/drink off of them. Cool idea, good energy, but a confusing and the concept falls a bit flat in execution. But it's nice to see that providing good service is a priority here and any errors are quickly addressed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Ordered the porchetta panino which was very underwhelming with small bits of pork, random globs of mustard, and forgettable caramelized onions. The side of arugula salad was atrocious--it tasted as if the entire salad was washed in a saline solution. Otherwise, the place has a nice ambiance and pleasant waitstaff. TL;DR - worth your time if you're just getting coffee; food is sub-par at best.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hands down th best PIZZA!!!!!! Don't go on the weekend, the wait is too long - they do not take reservations.  I live in brooklyn and often drive buy and buy a pie and take it home and finish it all by myself in 2 sets :)  I also always ask for the extra sauce and cheese.  Their sauce is great, made from the real tomatoes, not the paste and the brick over makes that thin crust too goooooooood","[0.0, 1.0]"

I love this charming little sushi restaurant. The quality is generally excellent (I have to admit I've had one so-so meal here but I go here a lot); they turn over a lot of raw fish each day. Fairly standard menu and great lunch specials. It's like a private find in the Heights.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Finally, I made it to this place today after living in NYC over 10yrs. As a Tokyo-born Japanese, unfortunately I have to say their soba was very disappointing... The soba sauce didn't have enough saltiness/sweetness at all, no flavor of Bonito/Niboshi(dried fish) either. Addition to that, my cold soba was way too cold (icy cold) which is not the right way. (Never had that cold soba/any noodle in my life) And, soba itself didn't have an aroma of buckwheat at all... Even though I was starving and was so excited to have soba that day, I couldn't finish a 2/3 of the mid-small bowl of it. I wanted to take my parents to this place whenever they visit me next time, but it seems like that's not gonna happen... ;(","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cocktails.  We were entertained just watching the bartender artistically pour spirits, mixers, muddled fruit, spices making two drinks at the same time. Going to Ward III is vicarious living for me.  The crowd is younger than my peer group but, I can relate to the scene. The atmosphere is all about fun, good drinks, good music, friends.  The menu has a ""behavioral"" guideline: engage others, be nice, don't be creepy.  It's quirky and cool. For the record, when I give 5 stars, it does not mean it is the Rolls Royce, red carpet treatment type of experience.  Just that it is a true quality place within it's range of competition (e.g. I could give a dive bar 5 stars).  Ward III is hip - nowhere near a dive.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Get the Munchkin sandwich on their brunch/lunch menu. It is bangin' and has become my go-to lunch meal. It's an Italian chicken panini with artichokes, pesto, roasted red peppers and fontina cheese. Naturally, I get it without the cheese but my friend ordered it with and loved every bite. I didn't think I was super hungry and had every intention of saving half for the next day but once I started I just couldn't stop. The bread was fabulous and there was just the right amount of pesto. It comes with a side of home-made chips which added a nice crunch to the sandwich. My other friend got Eggs Benedict with Salmon and seriously devoured it in minutes. Everything here is very tasty and nicely priced. The only thing I've ordered and wasn't crazy about was the French Toast which was more bread-pudding-y than the traditional breakfast classic. They also have a serious craft beer collection that's worth checking out even if you're not hungry.

"I was really psyched to see them come to the neighborhood and couldn't wait to check them out. I finally got my chance last week to stop in for lunch. We started out with the pork dumplings and they really told me everything I needed to know. What I mean is that they were sooooo bad that any chef/owner worth his/her salt and/or who cared about what they were serving would never serve these. It was literally just plain ground pork put into dumplings. The pork was plain, no seasoning, and dry and crumbly. The sauce on the plate was basically a pork gravy with a huge amount of vinegar added. We're not picky eaters but these were close to inedible. Oh and they plated it with some very dodgy looking plastic flowers. I then ordered the Cuban sandwich (figured I'd play it safe, at least they'd rock that), and my friend ordered a chicken special, I don't recall the name. Well, the Cuban wasn't good; not horrible, but really not good - and the special she got was just curry chicken like you'd get at a not-too-great Indian restaurant. I remember she wasn't happy with it either. The only thing that rocked were the Yucca fries. They were amazing and came with a spicy dipping sauce. Best I ever had. So as exciting and interesting as the name sounds, we were really let down. It was lunchtime so we didn't try the drinks and the service was fine, but this place is going to have a hard time making it in the New Haven dining scene unless things change in the kitchen.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Finally!! For those of you from the Bay Area that have been waiting for a burrito place to make it out East - Here's your place! We had the carnitas and carne asada burritos and both satisfied our SF born taste buds. This place is exactly like Gordo's! The owners and staff are really nice. And it seems that they did everything they could to transplant one of the Bay Area favorites out to NYC - from the ingredients, to the flavor, to the small menu, to the wood and leather furniture. The prices are also very reasonable for the quality. And for the real Cali foodies: we all know that Gordo's may not be the best taqueria to pay homage to. But this is SERIOUSLY THE BEST I'VE HAD IN NYC FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS!! That's why I gave it 5 starts. No joke. Try it. And for the yelpers that are comparing this to Chipotle - you obviously don't know how to compare a real burrito to a lame imitation.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We were looking for something new around Union Square and stumbled into Ichabods.  We had a group of 4 and weren't overly hungry so we decided to do 6 small plates instead of each doing our own meal.   herb flatbread- surprisingly really good.  Also, very easily shareable. Flowering kale salad- excellent. We asked for no dressing and it was perfect.  The ""flowering"" kale tasted much less bitter and was perfectly light. Fried calamari - very well done, you could actually taste the calamari, not just the fried outsides like you do at so many places. Local burrata- definitely the group favorite- its more of a salad then just the burrata which we quite liked. Fries- pretty standard but good.  The sauce on the side was excellent. Spare ribs- I didn't try as I don't eat meat but the group seemed to enjoy (I typically don't eat fish either but did try the calamari above). All in all, 4/5. Food was great. Service, location, atmosphere were all pretty standard.  I'd certainly go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had read so many good reviews about this place and had been planning to visit for so long. Finally we went there today. We walked in late Sunday afternoon. We were greeted on the entrance and our host asked me if we had a reservation... I didn't know that we needed a reservation. He looked at me and said he might be able to get us a table outside. I looked in the restaurant and only 40 percent of the tables were occupied. Anyways, we were seated Inside after 5 minutes. I don't know what was his concerns. ..The inside decor is lovely. It feels like inside of Pottery barn. The service was slowish even though they were not that busy. I ordered Funghi pizza and baked eggs. Let me say this, it was the most delicious flat bread pizza I ever had. Wow. It really made up for the slow service and everything. The baked eggs were ok. We were also given complimentary bread basket to soak with the olive oil. We loved the food. The drinks were ok but were Pricey. In the end I ordered macaroons. We had coconut and pistachio flavors. Coconut was very sweet but the pistachio was perfect. You can try different types of olive oils on your way back or waiting for a table. And you may end up buying one :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This review comes about 3 months after my experience, but I am still turning down invites to go back.  While the place is gorgeous and the service was sufficient, the food was a huge let down.  There are a lot of gimmicks on the menu, but very poor execution.  The octopus was tough, beans under cooked, wild boar chops... 1 well done, 1 med rare.  Fois gras creme brulee is rather contrived (as is much of the menu) but only worth while if fois gras is creamy and luxurious, but instead I got mealy and smelling of wet dog (aka old fois gras).  In my opinion, it doesnt matter if you are using local or fancy ingredients if you cant cook them.  Go back to the basics...technique technique technique.  I wont be back, but for their sake, I hope they learn from early mistakes, and not just be another Montclair  flash in the pan.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Go at an off time to avoid the lines.. I find both Pat & Geno's highly overrated but I do suggest going at least once. Go with at least one friend and order the same items at each spot and share to compare! You'll probably get a few interesting looks and laughs haha   These guys have gotten too commercialized.. I prefer the more momnpop hole in the wall feel. It seems like their are many less hyped but higher quality spots all over the city.. AND lots of places with vegetarian friendly options! My review is mostly based on going repeatedly with friends... and their reactions. But I have tried their cheese fries.. ultra processed cheese so you definitely need a fork to eat these babies.. so synthetic and bad.. but ooo so good all at the same time. I'm lucky I don't live in Philly.. they are like crack (not just at Pats but the cheese fries in general) I like the condiment bar.. it has that over Geno's!

"Love this spot for brunch, after living in No Libs for the year I had the opportunity to frequent many of the great breakfast spots. This is one of my favorite. It is a cozy restaurant with much better decor and roomier than many of the packed brunch places in No Libs. I always lucked out with the cute cafe table at the window. Slightly more pricey but worth it because service is great, food is delicious and I've never had much of a wait compared to some of the other popular brunch restaurants in the city. Great place to try if your aren't quite in the mood to wait for 1+ hours to get a table at Honeys or Green Eggs.

"Giorgio's lets you get your dishes made-to-order, so you can basically kind of have whatever you want on your pasta. And I'm assuming Giorgio greeted us and was very friendly. Some basics before I start: BYOB, takes reservations, does take-out, all dishes less than $20, umm I think I'm sold. We started with the bruschetta. When it came out it wasn't exactly what I expected; I thought all the ingredients were mixed together and we'd just get some pieces and what not (I don't think I read the menu right). But I'm glad that it wasn't that way. The best piece of bruschetta in that appetizer was the one with onion and cheese. Yum. I got the linguini with prosciutto, sweet peas, and shitake. So much food! I thought I'd be health-conscious for once and take a doggie-bag but I thought heck why not eat all of eat. I did not regret it. Very filling and delicious. Got the tiramisu to go.

"This was formerly Chuck's, where the pizza was lousy. I had a square slice here, and while it was certainly an improvement over Chuck's it was still average at best. The pie that the slice came from was undercooked, and I had to have it reheated a second time. It still wasn't done well enough but I dealt with it. I must add that while the place appeared very clean, I had to brush crumbs off both tables I sat at. There was also no paper of any kind in the rest room. I normally would return to try a round slice, but they did not look all that cheesy so I probably won't. 6/24/13 They now offer $1 slices 11am-5pm so maybe I will try it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The food was very rich and flavorful.  Some of the flavors such as the lavender honey truffle sauce with the manchega cheese was a truly unique flavor.   My favorite dish we had was the shortrib flatbread with Parmesan and bacon.   At one point I realized that Jason C. and I were both eating with our eyes closed to fully enjoy the flavors.  It was THAT good! I am a picky eater but decided to try things that I don't normally enjoy much during the dinner considering they were small portions.  Much to my surprise I enjoyed the fish and chips as well as the flatbread with bacon.  I have never enjoyed fish, but this just MELTED in your mouth.   Good wine list as well.  My friend and I picked random wines just to try a few out, and they were all delish!

"Based on Caitlin C.'s yelp review, I went here to get some excellent sushi for a great price... and it was amazing. The restaurant is very intimate and the decor has a lot of spirit.  It isn't trying to say trendy and it isn't traditional.  It really speaks to the spirit of its own character without bowing to what a sushi place should or shouldn't be. So many choices for sushi!  There were special platters, featured sushi dishes, and of course a la carte options as well. The presentation and quality of taste is amazing.  There are also a great variety of appetizers to choose from as well.  I had a hard time deciding what I was going to get, but in the end I decided on Tekka maki, a special sushi dish, and the Gyoza beef dumplings which I shard with my friend. As mentioned in the other review, this is a BYOB, so just bring what you want and they'll give you glasses as soon as they have found you a table. For dessert, they have three ice creams: Mocha, Green Tea, and Red Bean.  I opted for the red bean and my friend chose the green tea.  Red bean is definitely the way to go.  The green tea was, well, it tasted like frozen unsweetened green tea.  Its verisimilitude to the drink was uncanny.  So, my recommendation is to stick with the other two more sweet ice creams if you are looking for a dessert treat. Get reservations as there often will not be an open table between prime dining hours. Tip: This place is right down the street from the Walnut Street Theater.  I would definitely eat here before a show!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My best experiences in sushi restaurants is where you sit down at the bar and chat w/ the sushi chef.  You can't get that at some, if not most, sushi restaurants.  Yamada Sensei runs a small local business, not a chain.  I ALWAYS stop by his place whenever I'm in the Rutherford area - ALWAYS - I've been going to his restaurant for the last 4 years.  On this outing - best Saba (mackerel) ever. If you go by there, sit at the bar and chat him up.  If you prefer a table, the lack of conversation will not  detract from the incredible sushi.  A Korean friend of mine in college told me that the best sushi chefs are Korean, and so far, he's been right.  Moderately priced, but not over priced.  It is sushi after all.  Do you really want cheap raw fish?   Yamada offers a full menu of other fare if you don't like incredible tasting sashimi and sushi.  Yamada sensei tells me that most restaurants in Bergen county are dry, so BYOB!  He says if you want to bring in a bottle of nice scotch, he'll likely sample some with you!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Super-delicious, reasonably-priced, decent-portioned, northern italian comfort food. Cozy, rustic atmosphere. Great service. The wine was a little pricey in proportion to the price of the dishes--but not outrageous. Hadn't been to this place in a while, and I was bringing two friends who hadn't been yet, so I was a little nervous about the quality being as good as it once was. I quickly realized there was nothing to worry about. Was as delicious as it was the last time i went!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After hearing such great things about Modo Mio, I was excited to try it out when our party of 5 was able to get a reservation there on a Thursday evening.  Unfortunately, it failed to live up to the hype in my estimation.  The meal started out great - the mussels I ordered for the antipasti course were some of the best I've had.  The buccatini pasta w/ panchetta was tasty but nothing special.  For the main course I ordered one of the day's specials, a whole bronzino filleted table-side.  Again, good but not amazing.  Like wise the apple cake I had for the dessert.  I have to be honest, the whole evening the food left me wondering what all the fuss is all about.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things but my friends felt the same way about their dinners. Having said that, on the strength of its food, Modo Mio was worthy of 4 stars.  Unfortunately, I felt that the service there was very mediocre.  We had long waits in between each of our courses, with the whole dinner clocking in at over 2 1/2 hours.  Worse, the wait staff was not very attentive, often letting our water glasses stay completely dry.  Several times we had to flag somebody down to get service. I'd probably give Modo Mio another try, since it seems plausible we just caught them on an off night.  But I probably won't be running out the door to go there again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had some family visiting from ATL and since they're originally from Philly, they missed good Italian food.  Because the options are many, and visit time was short, the pressure was on to find a good place hearty cozy friendly byob that wasn't too overwhelming.  This was my first time here, but Yelp never fails me.   Our party came in bits and pieces, some later than others.  But we were seated, bottles were opened, and bread was served to allow us to enjoy the wait with present company.  Our waitress, maybe the owner, patiently read through and re-read through the specials for all of us as we arrived.  I think we all ended up ordering off the specials menu, because she sold the items like Jay-Z sells water to a whale.   My tuna dish was great, my friends' lobster with gnocchi was fantastic, the multiple appetizers we got were delicious.  The one complaint came from the Chilean sea bass people who said it was overcooked.  I think the steak was more under cook than requested, but it was ordered for take out so perhaps they were trying to account for the travel time (I don't know, doesn't it cook in it's own heat or something?) Last piece of advice, get the tiramisu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So its nearing midnight, you have had a few cocktails and now you are feeling a bit peckish - what to do?  Well, if you are anywhere near Hells Kitchen, then you need to haul your self over to Empanad Mama! Dont let the fact that this place fills up fast detour you - there is a quick turn over in tables.  This Mama provides some very creative tastes that add great flavor to the evening.  Not only are there emanadas but there are also arepas (yumm!)  And in case you are worried about losing ground in the drink count, they offer some tasty drinks (and beer) to go along with them.  So, you can keep you buzz and munch away. We ordered several different emanadas and split them between us.  We both agreed that the Cuban was the best - the pork was tender, tasty and literally melted in our mouths.  The cheeseburger arepa took second place.  And as for desert - don't fret - there are more treats to indulge in.  We decided to split two: The caramel/cheese and the chocolate/banana.  Now, I am not a huge caramel fan, but this little guy packed a sweet punch!  Of course, the chocolate/banana left me wanting some more. The service is quick and friendly.  They do deliver (if it is too cold for you to make out here).  I saw several guys making many runs in and out.  They pack you in pretty tight but its always nice to make some convo with a table next to you.  They are open 24/7 so it does not get much better than that!  Unfortunately, we discovered this place on our last night in NYC, otherwise we probably would have been regulars every day.  Prices are reasonable to boot! So take our advice and check this place out on day 1 (if you are visiting).  If you are a local then there really is no excuse!  Let this Mama treat you whether you want a meal or a snack!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Seriously damn good!  Had dinner tonight for my husband's birthday and it was WORTH every penny.  Definitely lives up to the hype.  We ordered the Kampachi tartare and Chili Lobster.  I am deathly allergic to shellfish so I didn't try the lobster but my husband LOVED it and he didn't seem to want to share any of it.  The Kampachi tartare was tasty but I would have preferred a bit more acidity, it finished a little on the sweet side for me. For entrees, we ordered the Chicken under a brick which was everything you wish chicken could be and then take it up a few notches.  Hubby had the duck special.  Boy, was that good.  I will be dreaming about both for the next few months. Dessert- we ordered the s'mores, cheesecake and 10 minute cookies.  All unbelievable.  S'mores were whimsy, cookies comforting and the strawberry rhubarb sauce on the cheesecake was out of this world. NOW the reason for 5 stars is for the EXCELLENT service.  Ian was our server and he went above and beyond to be accommodating.  Our sommelier (didn't catch his name) was fantastic, helpful, knowledgeable and great personality.  Chef Forgione came to our table to make sure everything was to our liking, suddenly all form of speech left me and I could only smile and thank him.

"Hartford's an odd town for restaurants. You think you're in the middle of nowhere, a desolate wasteland bereft of nice restaurants... and then something nice like Peppercorn's just happens to be sitting there. Indeed, Peppercorn's isn't exactly in the heart of Downtown Hartford, but it won't matter once you step inside. It's a pleasant, quasi-upscale Italian restaurant, complete with a small bar, and an unpretentious waitstaff. I must echo the sentiments of many other reviewers: The ravioli is AWESOME. It's hard to describe until you taste it... it's just got that you-know-it's-fresh-pasta taste and texture to it. I tried an artichoke ravioli in a butter sauce that was particularly decadent. The prociutto-wrapped ""Italian Sushi"" is a unique dish - wrapped around figs and topped with a balsamic reduction, it's a nice salty start to a meal. Just cut them in half before eating them - I wouldn't call them ""one bite wonders"" like sushi should be. Anyway, it's really nice place. It's pricey, but it's worth a return trip.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Bloomfield Steak & Seafood House is my ""go to"" place when I want to unwind from a tough day at the office in NYC. It is also a place I go when I want some relaxation with a cocktail in my hand. I have been going here for several years; it is 1 mile from my home in Belleville. From the bartender, waitresses and the rest of the staff...everyone is friendly and treat you like family. Their steak, seafood and pasta dishes are sure to please everyone's taste buds. I am not a huge fan of red meat but I enjoy their filet mignon, garlic-seasoned green beans and mashed potatoes. Their lobster ravioli, made with fresh tomato and spinach, is highly recommended. I also cannot forget their lamb chops, one of my other favorite dishes. My recommendation, go to Bloomfield Steak & Seafood House and taste for yourself.

"Went here for brunch this past weekend during the wake of Hurricane Irene.  They were one of the only places open in the area, so it was busy.  The wait for the food was a little long, but given the circumstances, we let that slide.  The food was delicious!  I had a grilled chicken sandwich and my wife had a salad.  Uncomplicated, but done very well and nicely portioned.  We also had a side of cheese polenta which was very tasty.

"SAVE YOUR MONEY! THIS RESTAURANT IS THE WORST! CLEANLINESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A MAJOR ISSUE!! Last Saturday, Oct 30, 2010 we planned my best friend's Bridal Shower at Tessara's Restaurant. From the beginning the managing partner, Yakya Ozdemir seemed a little curt when we met for the set up meeting. But because my former company had a Christmas dinner there and set it up with the other partner, Mustafa Ceylan, I assumed things would work out. When we arrived to do some decorating about 30 minutes prior to the event  the set up was just as we asked and seemed very nice. Yet when the meals started coming that is when the problems began. Originally we based our numbers on 30 guests but when there was a mix up with the choices and there were two more chicken dinners than Lasagna, they said the meals were pre-made the and would have to charge us for two additional meals, strike one. Ok ... that was fine. But when I received my lasagna, there was a hair on the top of the sauce...ugh! I sent it back and they brought out a new one twenty minutes later. The biggest problem however was when the ice cream was brought out covered with whip creal and fudge sauce. After eating the dessert, one of our guest said she felt sick because she was disguested by what she found in her dessert glass. She had eaten the ice cream half way and found a dead fly buried in the last part of the ice cream. I apologized and immediately went to show this to the manager, Yakya. He seemed unmoved and just reluntantly said he was sorry and he'd get another ice cream. I could not believe his reaction to such a major health issue.He seemed unconcerned and said the fly must have just fallen in. I was trying not to cause a scene and keep everything  going smoothly. So I said this was unacceptable and agreed to speak to him after the event was over. Once they brought the new ice cream in, the  guest said she did not want it and said she was leaving because she felt ill. I completely understood why she feel the way she did. After we finished packing up I went to pay the bill. I expected us to talk about the incident and the manager to be remorseful  to the incident once he thought about the major issue at hand. Unfortunately, Yakya brought me the bill with all charges the same. I expressed to him that I felt that he should have taken that particular meal off the bill as the least of the things he could do to show some typ of appropriate customer service to a major health mishap. Instead, he gets indignent and basically starts raising his voice at me and saying ""Ma'am just pay the bill! The fly was on the top of the ice cream and we gave you another one...just pay the bill"" I  thought I was in the twilight zone. I could not believe this man was so rude and oblivious to the facts. I argued that the fly was in the middle of the ice cream that the guest had already eaten and this was a serious health issue. He continued to say in so many words; ""so what and to pay the bill and get the hell out!"" Unacceptable! His only response was  that we were supposed to be out at four and we were not out until 4:15pm so just pay the bill! I was appauled and again said, 30 guest just supported your business and expected decent service. I concluded by paying the bill and saying, this was a health issue and we would not support your business again. He responded by saying, ""that is your choice!"" I felt so violated and taken advantage of  and poorly treated I called the Health Dept. to follow up with the two major health incidents that we were subjected to. So in conclusion, I will NEVER eat there again or advise anyone else to. SAVE your $600-$700 and host your event elsewhere and  don't ever go there for any meal if your health and safety are of concern to you!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I loved Salinas! My friends and I got to dinner on a Thursday at the right time (6:30pm) to get a table in the back room, which has a retractable ceiling. It just happened to be the PERFECT summer night, so the ceiling was pulled back and we were dining under the stars by the end of our meal. The restaurant itself is gorgeously decorated. Beautiful lighting, lovely fireplace in the back, blue velvet banquets. The tables are a tad too close together, but they need the utilize the space...it was packed by 8pm! Really modern and spa-like restrooms that smell SO GOOD! The menu is limited and quite pricey, but everything is amazing! Try the Gambas Al Ajo Fresco and the Lamb Meatballs appetizers...both were so tasty, with beautiful presentation. For my entree I went with the Yelp recommended Rossejat Rapida, which was a crispy pasta with chicken, mussels, and chorizo...delicious!

"Think these negative reviews are out of left field and obviously outdated. I have dined here on more than one occasion. I recently visited Calandra's on a Sunday afternoon. (They are currently running a special in which two people share one appetizer, order two entrees, and share one dessert for $27.) Like every other Italian restaurant, bread is brought to the table while you gaze through the menu. The bread is directly from their bakery less than 500 feet away and it is quite unique. A round rustic loaf is stuffed with cheese, garlic, and butter. This warm loaf was served and quickly disappeared. Regarding appetizers, I suggest the stuffed meatballs. They come two to a plate, over sauce and had wonderful flavor. Entrees consisted of chicken parm, pasta primavera, veal, tilapia and rigatoni. Main dishes were enjoyed by all. For dessert, the table shared cheesecake, chocolate cannoli, and homemade zeppoles. They were brought to the table in a brown paper bag and were shaken table side before served. I was surprised on how good they were. Service was speedy and attentive. Bottom line for the price, quality, and quantity of food I will attempt to return in the near future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

For $12.95, this place is a good deal as it includes a drink plus an entree.  The entrees aren't huge, but not small either.  They are probably the ""right"" portion, but the Americans we are are used to larger portions. And you wonder why America is obese?  Anyhow, the french toast is made with brioche which is my bread of choice, but it's just lightly dipped in egg.  Thus nothing special.  The benedict is ok too.  Not great, but not bad. However, it's a cute place and it does remind me a little bit of places we went to in Paris, so for the atmosphere I'd come back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is alright I guess.  Our appetizer was good, scallops.  My husbands entree was good, but we paid an eztra 10 dollars for literally two bites of lobster to come in the pasta.  My entree almost made me sick.  I ordered the venison, which was a 34 dollar dish, opretty expensive even for NYC.  I ordered it cooked the way they recommended it, medium rare.  I am pretty open minded about how well done my food is, but this was just gross.  I trimmed off the outer 1/8 of an inch of meat, the only part that seemed edible, and I ate that.  It was cold in the middle.  Anyways, that being said, it wasn't a horrible meal, just be careful if you order this medium rare. In retrospect I could have sent it back to have them throw it back on the grill for a few minutes. But oh well.  Another thing that bugged me was my wine.  I only got MAYBE 2/3 of a pour.  Perhaps if someone else in my party wants desparately to go here, I would return, otherwise NYC has way too many incredible restaurants to waste another 135 dollars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"There's always a line outside, but I got lucky one Sunday morning. Instead of going to the normal smorgasburg, I decided to wait on line for 15 minutes to check out  Grimaldi's new location. Surprisingly, the whole pizza ordeal with waiting, ordering, and eating only took 1.5 hours (which is about what I'd expect if they made it fresh).  Since we were one of the early ones on line, we got the first batch of seating. If you ever miss this first set, you should probably just give up because you'll be waiting another hour to have the pizzas made, eaten, and checks paid.  I think there's a paper about this somewhere that talks about wait times at restaurants around peak hours. Anyway, the best idea is to call in and get the pizza to go. Eat it in the park and make everyone else jelly. You could probably sell a slice at Smorgasburg if someone's desperate enough. We got a pepperoni pizza pie and ate 4 slices each. I don't mind to admit it when I'm a piggy. When you wait 30 minutes to get a seat, you might as well get a large and indulge in the stewarts black cherry or rootbeer. The pizza itself. Still awesome like the last time. I'm sure most of your complaints will be about the wait. If I had the time to kill, I'd defiintely do it. In fact, this would be a great date spot so you can see which girl is patient enough to take the time to wait for a good thing. Or... which girl really loves pizza.

"Best all around bar in Astoria.    Great food, great drinks, great service, and usually a great crowd.    It can get crowded, so seating can be hard to come by, so come a bit early on busy days if you want to eat sooner than later. Must try's on the menu, include the 'Sweet Afton Burger,' which is hands down the best burger in Astoria.   It is composed of a patty of Pat La Frieda Beef and served with lettuce, tomato onions,  Bob McClure pickles, all on a wonderful Roll Mio bun (for an extra dollar you can add a slice of cheese from Murray's as well).   Seriously well sourced, cooked, and executed.   The burger is a bit hefty, so if you're a light eater, you might be able to split one with your date.  Though if you are looking for something a bit lighter, you might want to consider ordering the 'Grilled Cheese on Pullman Loaf.' As with the aforementioned burger, all the grilled cheese's ingredients are locally sourced (in so far as buying ingredients in NY can be considered 'local' ;).   So again the quality is top notch.   If you're just coming to drink, Sweet Afton also offers what is probably the most thoughtful tap selection in the neighborhood, with a variety of ales, lagers, etc.   During Happy Hour, which is on Monday to Friday (4-7), the drafts are only $4.   The same deal is also available for weekend brunch from 11am-4:30pm.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The restaurant must really care about patrons waistline because you really need a microscope to see your $36 portion of halibut and a high resolution microscope to see your equally overpriced desert. It's ok to charge more for really good food, but would it kill them to make a portion a reasonable size so you don't have to look for a hot dog vendor at the exit? You should stick with their pastas because the portions are small enough as not to break your Atkins diet. The food is not that great to  justify really small potions. The bartender was nice and the cocktail my wife ordered was really good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"On the plus side, this place was delicious.  On the VERY negative side, I got food poisoning that evening.  On the not as negative side, our half an hour quoted wait turned into about an hour and a half.  That wait was ONLY for just getting seated and didn't include the wait to get our order taken (about 20 minutes) and for the food (dishes came out over the next HOUR.)  We were starving but this place came highly recommended so we waited it out. Here's what I had: * Takoyaki - Delicious!  Serving comes with 6 takoyaki filled dumplings.  Sauce was tangy and I savored each one. * Enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon - It's really difficult to go wrong with [insert food here] wrapped in bacon.  If you've never had enoki mushrooms, I think this might be a good starting place.  As much as I wanted to eat these little pieces (2 in all) in many bites, its hard to rip the mushrooms apart with your teeth. * Cold tofu salad - My friend had this and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Mind you, New York is sweltering hot in July and this was a great refreshing dish.  Simple yet tasty. * Gyutan/beef tongue - Mine was a little overcooked but flavored nicely with enough salt and pepper. * Salmon ochazuke - BEST ochazuke I've ever had (sorry Mom).  Perfectly salty and a great way to end the meal.  I was hoping the ochazuke would come somewhere in the middle of dinner but it actually came about 20 minutes after the initial rush of food. We left the restaurant and soon after I started experiencing major stomach pains.  Luckily, they let me back into the restaurant.  I asked a couple of the waiters if I could just sit somewhere on the side while I endured the worst stomach pains of my life and they both looked at me like I was insane (I probably was.  I was hurting!) and I spoke a different language (maybe my pidgin accent came out).  At least they let me back into the restaurant.  I'm pretty 100% it was this food because I didn't eat anything else that day and the pain carried well into the next day.  Luckily the rest of my group was A-OK.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food and service are as good as some of the restaurants that I've rated 4 stars.  However, with the price and overall persona projected by Barcelona, I expect more.  Everything in context, which is why Barcelona drops to 3 stars. Barcelona is one of the newcomers of the downtown/Crown Street area of New Haven.  I would say it fits in pretty well - it's hip, trendy, and pricey.  It definitely succeeds as a hot spot.  Sadly, it has all the appearance without truly delivering on the food front, which is my primary concern. I've been a few times, and the food is ok.  There were some pretty good dishes, both on the tapas menu as well as the daily special menu.  I enjoyed the goat cheese/wild mushroom, pan-seared scallops (so fleshy and succelent, with a great crisp on the outside), Spanish octopus (amazingly soft and non-rubbery), and artichoke.  Don't get me wrong, nothing was downright bad, and I liked most of the dishes, but unfortunately nothing blew me off my feet. Barcelona wants to look like something out of NYC, and it could pass.  But it doesn't have the service to match.  My water glass was empty for longer than it should have been, and maybe I'm a bread whore, but it's slightly upsetting when waiters are indignant about my desire for more bread.  Hey, if anything, you should be flattered that I want to sop up delicious sauces with bread! I've had the sangria - eh, pretty generic - and the caipirinha - woo, this packs a boozy punch! Overall, I can't say I had a bad experience, I guess I just had too high expectations.  I wanted to like Barcelona so much, especially since Ibiza has gone the entree route and abandoned the tapas.  Who doesn't love tapas?  You get to maximize your tastings and it's so fun to sit around a table with your friends.  Barcelona now has the monopoly on tapas in New Haven, and for that reason, it will probably do well for itself.  Hey, I don't begrudge Barcelona this monopoly, in fact, I wish Barcelona the best because New Haven needs a place like this.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bar review - Expensive, yes (potentially very), but a fantastic selection of whiskeys.  If you're just aiming to chill with a drink in hand for a short time, this can be a great stop.  I've hit up about 20 of their whiskeys so far, and while they get pricey, if you're willing to go splurge for a flight or two with a friend, you'll receive good service and a great liquor. Most of my trips have been during off-times (i.e. not Fri/Sat 6-10pm), and I've found the bar staff to be HIGHLY knowledgeable about the various whiskeys, bourbons, and ryes, and have had a very good time naming a price and letting them decide which palate route I should go.  I only ever liked myself some Jameson or Jim Beam, but about 3 months of these guys and I'm a right snob!

My Favorite Delivery This is my Top Rated place to order from for dinner. We have been ordering their chicken burritos almost every week for going on 3 years now.

"Let me say that i am a tourist to nyc and know nothing of nyc cuisine but i will try not to sound like a tourist. Anyway, first of all i will say this place is a share food place, so its huge portions, which depends on who you are eating with could be good or bad, whatever. So my girlfriend and i ordered the lobster fra diavolo, which is not something we usually get but it sounded good and we said why not. We both got sodas and found out that no free refills means that youre paying $6.50 for a few sips of soda which kinda pissed me off. The food itself was amazing. My only concern is that the claws were in the marinara sauce as well which i dont know if thats normal for that dish but i found it to be odd to have hands covered with sauce in such a nice place. Its right near time square and really big, so this place is worth it to try. A few concerns is that on the menu, it says it feeds 2-3 yet my girlfriend and i arent huge eaters yet we left only shells on the plate with ease, so keep that in mind. Also the soda thing is what makes my review drop to like 4 and a half stars. Oh well. Its probably not the best italian place in nyc but well worth a try.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've come here many times in the past and usually leave happy. This time was a bit different. I know the restaurant business very well and I know that when a guest has a bad experience, you do whatever you can to turn it around. A few nights ago, I stopped by for a late dinner with a guest and at the very beginning of the meal a table next to us had an altercation and a woman at the table (presumably crazy) threw multiple champagne flutes at a man across from her, causing them to shatter, covering me in champagne and glass. This was not a good start to the experience. We had to ask for different water for fear that we would be drinking shards of glass. They moved us to a new table and the waiter vanished. Eventually, someone walked over to announce that he would be taking over. Okay. A manager walked over and asked if we were okay and I told him yes, but I was covered in glass and bubbly. He apologized quickly and walked away. I'm not one to ask for anything, but I was a little shocked that they did absolutely nothing to try to turn our experience around, albeit it wasn't their fault. I'm now looking at this from a business standpoint, and they don't know how to take care of their guests. Full check, nothing sent out as an apologetic gesture, aside from a hurried manager and we had to ask for the fresh water. This place has been here awhile and is popular, so they probably don't care about two guests; however, they are not invincible and these two guests are locals who certainly won't be coming back anytime soon. Oh, and the food was good.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ordered (for delivery) the medium Veggie Delight and the Friday's special (Sausage, green pepper and onion sandwich + fries + soda). First time ordering. Food was mediocre. The sauce and cheese weren't bad but I wasn't really a fan of the regular crust. The sandwich quality was lower than that of the average food truck, in terms of bread and meat quality. Anyway this was probably my own fault for ordering this sandwich over a popular item. I also think that the pizza was grossly overpriced. The ingredients didn't taste like they were premium or anything out of the ordinary so why am I paying $19 for a medium pizza? (I only chose it because I thought the flavors would compensate, based on previous reviews, or that they were using nonstandard sizes). What really irked me was that they advertise fast delivery AND they told me the pizza would arrive in 35 minutes...yet it took exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes! I can understand that they might have been busy since it was a Friday night but would they not have adjusted for that in their estimate? To top it off they forgot to bring me my soda.

Waffle - GRADE C  It was chewy and dense - it is a buckwheat waffle but still  I think they could do better.

Stopped here this morning with my friend. This place is so new and I really really love the decor. It makes me feel like I am in an upscale cafe in New York. I had a latte which their machine even though all automatic was pretty amazing and perfect temperature. I also tried their chocolate cake which I was told was made by a German Baker and was a family recipe of the owners. Well thumbs up to the owner and to the baker because it was fabulous. The thing I really liked is since this place is off off the main stretch of Nassau st their is ample parallel parking available.

"My boyfriend and I went to the Wrap Shack on Friday and we had a fantastic meal.  The menu had so many choices, including some really nice vegetarian selections.  My boyfriend had the Freeman Wrap and there was a ton of meat and the perfect amount of spice and sauce and he (usually complains about still being hungry after a meal) said he was perfectly full.  I had the Grilled Veggie Wrap and all the ingrediants were fresh and the goat cheese was a perfect addition.  I think next time I will try the eggplant Parm which the extremely friendly cashier recomended.  I would definitely recomend the Wrap Shack on the Square and since they deliver, you dont~ even have to go out in the cold to eat thier tasty food! ~Ryan","[0.0, 1.0]"
"An absolute jewel!! I had the spinach gnocchi with half red & half white sauce and it was really, really good. Wife had the veal in white wine & lemon and that was very good as well. We started off with the white mussels (excellent) and the buffala mozzarella special which was especially good. No room for dessert this time. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at this nice BYOB. The owners were super friendly. They even took our restaurant.com coupon which made this meal a steal! Will definitely return.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ok this place rocks. It's tiny, upstairs and doesn't open until 5:30 for dinner, but it's worth the wait. The little skewers give you the opportunity to try many different types of items for dinner. I especially enjoyed the scallops, flank steak, pork with ponzu and scallions, and the special meatballs in tiny little peppers. Be sure to sit a the bar so that you can watch the cooks grill up all of the little skewers. A thoroughly enjoyable experience! If I were given the choice between Yakitori Totto and Saki Bar Hagi, my brain would probably explode because both are excellent.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is the epitome of the breakfast/brunch ""spot"". The food is all top quality. Their have a wide selection of pancake or waffle dishes to satisfy whatever you're in the mood for. And their standard breakfast fare is anything but. My wife and I split an order of Red Velvet pancakes (which tasted like candy) and a Santa Fe omelet (we love the spicier things). Keep in mind, they bake their omelets which means they take about 20 minutes to make, but they come fluffy, larger than normal and nowhere near as greasy. The service is on point and always around to get whatever you need or refill your coffee. There are only 2 drawbacks. First is their hours. For some reason they close at 3pm and aren't open for dinner which is rough when you want breakfast for dinner. And worst of all is the parking situation. They have a private lot, but there aren't nearly enough spaces.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We have not tried any Thai restaurants since we moved into Philadelphia just over a year ago, we tried asian fusion, mixed (Thai plus Chinese plus Korean plus...  My son's birthday, ""where do you want to go""? ""Where is good Thai Food?"".  We turned to our friends at Yelp, and found Erawan in Chinatown. Some reviews were good, some bad.  We looked at a bunch of the 1 and 2 star reviews, and read past the actual review, to see that one person was upset that there was a credit card minimum, another that they were upset because grub hub took too long to deliver, yet another that was upset they had to wait too long for a seat. We went, and the food was fabulous.  My wife got the Crispy Duck, but it was too spicy for her, so she got my PadThai, and I was amazed at both dishes.  My son got Holy Basil Chicken -- also wonderful. One warning, be aware of your spice level and make sure you tell your server, and all will be fine.

"I was very disappointed with the service I experienced here recently. When I went to speak to the hostess to reserve a table for myself and a friend who had not yet arrived yet I was fully ignored for a good 5 minutes until the hostess and waitresses had finished laughing and joking around. And after that my reservation was taken reluctantly as if I were not worth their time. I had always enjoyed the food here in the past, but this disrespectfulness was unacceptable. I hate to wonder if race or gender has anything to do with it but I am Asian and female. When my companion arrived (white and male), the hostess and waitresses shot to attention and suddenly became very courteous. I've been treated far better at 5 star restaurants. I am sorry the quality of the staff has diminished so much over the years. With so many excellent Japanese restaurants in NYC I am surprised that they can afford to be so rude to customers.

"I had mixed feelings about the place since I was fluctuating between a 2 or 3 star. The bartender was attentive and knowledgeable about food and wine. Food was okay but I've had way better.  For the price that I paid I wasn't very full and the portions were small.  this is Brooklyn, not Manhattan! Why am I paying Manhattan prices for a place that is essentially in a industrial area of Brooklyn that is not easily accessible by public transportation. Decor is nice. Bartender was good but the some of the waitstaff could use some classes on food service and hospitality. Hipster and I'm too good for this vibe does not work well in the food service industry.

"I tried this place's sister restaurant in Montclair the night before. The menu is pretty similar, but there are enough differences to make it so that it is not completely repetitive. It is very small and cramped inside. We had to navigate a maze of chairs and people who didn't want to move their chair in when we tried to get to our table in the back of the restaurant. It was also somewhat loud due to the small area and fact that almost all the tables were seated. The service was a bit slow. It took a while for someone to take our order and then for our food to get to our table. The biggest disappointment for the night was that my dad's meal was brought out, and I ended up waiting at least 10 minutes for my pizza. No one came over to tell us why there was such a delay, and we waited at least 5 minutes until a busboy came over to ask why I hadn't gotten my pizza. The pizza finally arrived, and the waitress told us that they made the wrong thing so they had to make a whole new one (which would've been less annoying had someone actually informed us that this was what was happening, plus I would've just taken the wrong pizza to make things easier - it was anything I didn't like). On the plus side, they did take the pizza off our check, so we ended up having a pretty inexpensive meal, which is why I am giving this place three stars. I'm not sure if I would come back, but we may give it another chance since they were pretty reasonable in accommodations for the food delay. The food was good regardless, but it was slightly shadowed by the completely weird delay of food that no one explained to us.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been excited to try this place for awhile now. Great atmosphere and clean, interesting decor. Get passed the cozy bar area and the back opens up to a spacious dining area with high ceilings, mural artwork and cool lighting. So many Mexican places center decor on the kitchy side and it was refreshing to sit within a more mature but unpretentious setting. (My one remark upon seating is that for as nice a place as it was, they had plain old white paper napkins for the place settings...invest in linen roll ups! It suits you more!) We arrived around 5ish and were the first ones seated, so needless to say service was attentive. Quite a few apps caught our eye on the menu including the octopus and the crab fundido but since we were newbies we figured we should try to guacamole.  It came out fresh, flavorful and just a tad of extra heat, which was all good by me! The chips were fresh and toasty and the house salsa was good. The menu isn't huge but definitely enough to choose from. I ordered the Enchiladas Mariscos because I couldn't pass up crab, shrimp and a promised cream sauce.  The fiance ordered the Enchiladas con Pollo in the Mole sauce.  We ordered the side of Mexican corn (which our server nicely offered to cut in half for sharing) and a side of black beans and rice. The corn was excellent - charred, rolled in a creamy mayo and dusted with Mexican cheese. Yum! My seafood enchilada actually came in a red sauce with only ribbons drizzled with cream and I believe a tad of mole. While the chunks of seafood were delicious, I was bummed about the red sauce because it tasted more marinara. I would have chosen the mole or a green Chile sauce instead.  My guy's mole was good but I have to admit that I've had better tasting moles. I asked for a side of sour cream but they told me they serve a variation of it with cream and cheese. It was decadent and creamy and the perfect addition to the rice and beans! (Ask for it!) I enjoyed one margarita over my meal - the Garcia, as suggested by our server. I added blood orange to it.  All drinks are housemade and the one I had was made well. We were too full for dessert but the churro ice cream sounded off the hook. All in all, a welcome atmosphere for dining out with friends. Our particular meal alone teetered closer to a 3.5 for me but that is partially our faults for ordering standard fare and not branching out more.  I would go back and order a bunch of the good looking appetizers and get more creative with my drinks.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"STAY AWAY PLEASE! I lived at the close apartments so went there quiet a bit as it was in walking distance. it wasnt the best sushi ive ever had (Masa 8 by the way) but it definitely wasnt the worst. Until one nite my roommate and I took take out back to the house and as she raised a piece of roll up to her mouth something fell off and landed in her cup of soy sauce. We dumped out the cup and it was a real, live, moving, writhing around, tape worm. My roommate and I both went straight to separate bathrooms and started throwing up while my boyfriend bagged up everything and brought it to the outside dumpster thinking it would be best for us not to come out of the bathroom and see it. Once we had calmed down about an hour later I called and they said I would need to bring in the garbage bag and show them the worm in order for any kind of refund. There was no Im sorry or concern at all. Worse yet after talking to people about the incident I talked to a girl who went to my high school and had the SAME THING HAPPEN at that place.

"I've been here for both brunch and dinner, and can attest that the brunch is notably good but the dinner is nothing to write home about. For brunch this past weekend we split the Winter Citrus salad, which was a medley of oranges, blood oranges, figs, mint and sage and looked so pretty and fresh on the plate that it took everything in me to resist my Asian-girl-taking-food-pictures instincts. For main I had the Tuna Melt and my friend got the French Toast. For brunch it's imperative that you make reservations - this space is huge but wildly popular and I've tried walking in frequently enough to know you'll be quoted like a 2-hour wait time. I had dinner here a couple of months ago and remember absolutely NOTHING except that the duck breast was kind of gummy and gross. So for those of who have been for dinner service and written this place off, come back for brunch for a renewed outlook.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Dear Santucci's, I LOVE YOUR PIZZA; however, I must say that your brunch totally blew this morning.  If you guys want to have sold out brunch like you do in the evenings you need to get it together in the following ways: Have fresh coffee (I had to wait for a new pot to be made), have condiments at the tables already , (after we were served our food we waited for the waitress to squirt a nearly empty ketchup bottle into a little container, it wasn't enough and we were never given more. We waited for butter until our toast was cold and then waited for jam- which wasn't enough for everyone to use). GET YO EGGS RIGHT, (I ordered over easy eggs and they were served over hard). My friend got given the wrong kind of tea (random, but disappointing none the less). And if you can- insulate the front door like other restaurants have done temporarily for winter, (it was freezing). Hopefully soon your brunch will be as good as your dinner ;-)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Stopped by here yesterday for the first time to get some chocolate covered bacon. They were out but Elliot got right on the phone and ordered more to be delievered the next day. The atmosphere was so cozy and warm - sun streaming in the bay windows, local art on the walls, friendly knowledgeable staff - I decided to sit for a minute, grab some coffee and treat myself to a bacon chocolate cupcake (I was still craving, what can I say). While I sat Elliot offered a sample of the carob bacon (yes there's a theme, sorry!) which was much better than I had expected - I'm not much of a carob fan. While I was sipping my delish coffee a father and son came in. Apparently strict vegans, the father asked to see the ingredients list for the vegan, gluten-free baked goods and Elliot gladly supplied it. He even got back on the phone with his supplier (a local home-based baker) and nailed down some specifics for this demanding guy. The gentleman seemed a little put off by the $4.50 pricetag on his cupcake - but really, when you can only use soy butter you've got to be willing to pay. The prices are a little steep - most lunch items are between $8-$12, and we're talking wraps and salads - with a couple of seafood items getting as high as $17 so eating a meal is a little costly. Coffee isn't bad - $2.10 for a large - but specialty coffees again get a little high - $4.50 for a latte. The menu seems fresh and has interesting combinations - brie & apple on a baguettte, wasabi mayo & shrimp, lemon lobster on brioche - but it just seems a little too 2005 - it really pains me to say that since I loved my experiance SO much, I'm just concerned that people in this economy will balk at paying $12 for a salad. I really and sincerely wish them the best of luck though, the guys were welcoming and warm, the cupcake was moist and amazing, the atmosphere was cozy and perfect...I really can't say enough good things about this place. Just go when you have a full wallet...and an empty stomach, it's nearly impossible to resist the tempation of the bakery case.","[1.0, 0.0]"

As for their service - quick and friendly.  Atmosphere is also nice and clean, they clean the tables immediately upon a party's departure and hand sanny is always available.  I love the environment too - decorated with mirrors, chalkboard, and map wallpaper, it's very nice for a small group of maybe 4 at most.  Also, I've heard they have burgers...I will probably be back for burgahs!

"I was told to come to American Flatbread by many locals, so I thought I would give it a try...or maybe not...1 hour wait....the next week I came back and the same looong wait. This time I waited. Im glad I went here but I feel I won't have to return. It was just ok. I think a lot of it's popularity is just hype. The pizza, not actually called pizza and I don't think it is ever referenced as such is flatbread. Who cares, a panini is a sandwich. Call it what it is. I say it is a yuppie marketing term to spend more money on .....pizza.. Pros: High quality ingredients Great Beer selection Comfortable and fun ambiance Good salad Cons: Flatbread (Pizza) was bland. I had a mix of the sausage and pepperoni styles. My date and I both agreed that there was nothing special.  Nothing punched me in  the mouth because basically all we have is a thin crackery woodfired crust with a thin layer of some good toppings. I'm sure that is all that some people want. Some people also love boxed macaroni and cheese and put ketchup on everything. Good for them, but I expected more. The wait is ridiculous and over crowded. You will routinely see people walk in, then walk out when they hear the wait time for a table. Overall, it is a nice place if you don't mind crowds and need something expensive to to soak up the beer. If I want good pizza, I would pick a cheap piece of $3 NYC pizza over American Flatbread (Pizza) anyday.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I ordered the salad for delivery and I tried paying over the phone with my debit card. He asked for my zip code and I gave it to him. He sounded aggravated. I called my bank and settled it with them . I called him back to try again and refused to take my payment!!,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"What can I say about Spring Garden... It's a small establishment run by good, hard working people, where one can get a meal and a Coke for about 8 bucks. Hard to beat that.

"Well, I haven't exactly had a chance to eat their ramen yet, if only they would stop running out of it, and the wait wasn't ridiculously long.  My husband and his friends went there on Saturday afternoon and were told that they had run out of ramen, and that they were going to reopen at 5pm.  Fast forward to 9:30pm the same day, there we were, thinking we would definitely be able to try it out, and lo and behold, the wait we were told was going to be 2 and a half hours!!  At 9:30pm, a 2.5 hour wait?!  That's just crazy!  What kind of business runs out of their main product the first week that they're open?!  There were actually people dozing off on a couple of chairs near the entrance!  Not too mention, there was a sign on the window that said they may run out of soup for the ramen, in which case they would be closing early.  With my luck, I'd wait for 2.5 hours to find out they've run out, so we just decided to head back home and try again another day.  I'm giving this place one star for now since I had to choose one. I'll be back to update it once I've actually been able to eat something there. Just thought I give a heads up to those of you who are planning to go - you may want to go when they first open to avoid any of this nonsense.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"i think that this is my favorite pizza place in all of the NE US. It's really that good. The key piece to their pizza pie is the fact that they put a thick layer of cheese-y goodness between the tomato sauce and the bread, thereby making the bread taste cheesey. the extra cheese on top only makes it more wonderful. if you've never attempted a trip to Spumoni Gardens, it's well worth the effort. AND! their ice's are a great way to finish your meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Good: Awesome ambiance for brunch (really chill spot with great variety of people) and great cocktails (I go the one with the pickled tomato and it was pretty bomb...Get this one if you are a fan of cocktails that are more of the salty/spicy side as opposed to sweet drinks). I def understand why this place is such a popular brunch spot. The Almost Good: In my usual perusal of the reviews prior to going it seemed like tons of yelpers were raving about the jane/johnny dishes. Of course we decided to go for it since these menu items just sound awesome. We ended up with the benedict jane, benedict johnny, and brussel sprouts (I always end up getting sprouts if I spot them on a menu cause I'm a sprout crackhead). I appreciate the creativity...I really do, but the results just didn't come close the deliciousness I had prepared myself for. My johnny came out cold with one overcooked egg (wasn't runny) and the jane, although pretty good, didn't blow my mind. The thing that really got me were the sprouts...let me just say I've had better at many other restaurants and this really disappointed me. Basically, I just wasn't really feeling the food and I'm typically a huge fan of these dishes. All in all I am glad I tried this place and I recommend this place for a nice brunch spot, but I probably wouldn't rush back unless someone dragged me along. I'm  giving this place 3 stars cause I think it's worth a try because of the awesome drinks/space, but the food didn't do it for me.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Dinnertime is lovely too, great place to grab a bite with a friend and catch up.

"I went to the Belgian Cafe last night with a group of friends, having been here once and enjoying the food immensely. Went again last night, and everything was just a mess. We were waited on by a waitress with an attitude problem who didn't want to seem to be there at all. Our orders were wrong or missing entirely. I had to remind her about my burger which wasn't put in at all apparently. That problem could have been avoided if she wrote down our orders instead of trying to play Super Waitress. There were quite a few people, it's understandable if you can't remember it all. A few people at the table ordered burgers, and when my friend received her medium rare burger, hers came out more ultra well done super hockey puck style. Being a server herself, she doesn't really send food back unless it was inedible. It was not edible. After the table was eating for a bit, I inquired about my burger and was given a blank look, even though the surrounding people, including my husband heard me order it loud and clear (and the only person at the table who just ordered without having her ask how I wanted it, what sides, what burger etc). My burger came out, before my friend who sent her burger back and when I bite into it, I almost gagged. I cannot, will not eat rare burgers, it's just a personal thing, which is why I order medium-well but instead got a burger so rare, it was practically mooing. I just gave up and just gave the burger to my husband to eat. My friend who sent her burger back got one that was almost as rare, almost to the point where it wasn't cooked at all, just thrown on the grill, flipped and slapped on a bun, almost if it was a punishment for sending the food back. Well, jokes on them, she actually prefers burgers that way but tries not to eat them because of health reasons. Other than the food issues regarding the burger temps, the food itself is quite good. The problem is the servers, they just seem nasty and have a bad attitude. Look, I know my friends can get loud and rowdy, but most of us have worked the service industry and try to make life as simple as possible for the waitress and tip really well if we're happy, 35% minimum. Hell, even if you give just the basic service, you still get 18%. Even among the servers, we were debating if 10% would have been too much. I think last night will be the last time we go to Belgians and just head into the city instead and go to Monk's, where we were at least greeted warmly, received drinks in a timely fashion and received what we ordered.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Throughout the meal his presence was so scarce the tables in our area started giving each other extra salt, napkins, and ketchup to avoid calling him. The second time the service was more swift, however the server was not personable at ALL. I don't know if he was bored, tired, or flat out hates his job but he didn't seem interested.

"Smokin Betty's is like Devil's Alley on human growth hormone. The space is much larger and open with a bit more light. The menu is more expansive and executed a lot better then it's counterpart. For the most part I would stick to the comfort foods part of the menu: the beef burgers, mac and cheese , biscuits and BBQ sliders are all good. The ribs are some of the better ones I have had in Philly ( I had them dry rubbed and dipped em in their sweet and tangy St Louis style BBQ sauce). What chaps my ass on city BBQ is when you order a full rack at some spots and they give you what appears to be ribs from an anemic miniature Cambodian pot belly pig. Not so at Betty's a full rack is a red blood American style portion proving why American will always suffer from heart disease- no problem Jefferson is down the street. I would stay away from their riskier dishes: salmon BLT and Turducken burger, both were a bit dry and disappointing, but they have a good happy hour. Either way a welcome addition to what is fast beginning to be my favorite part of the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Note: editing this review to reflect the good news that La Sirene now serves booze. Rustic French fair served at an out of the way location. Not quite sure why this place is so highly rated among the yelping community. Been three times and while the food is very delicious, but in my opinion doesn't quite reach expectational levels. Within Yelp, 4.5 ratings are consistent with the level of food and service encountered at Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. La Sirene is a different animal altogether, so don't expect the same here that you would encounter at other 4.5 yelp starred dining restaurants. There is admittedly a sincerity and humility that pervades this place, and perhaps the lack of prentention contributes to the good feelings customers have for this restaurant. Those who appreciate a quaint environment with nostalgic charms will find this place endearing. Since it's an intimate restaurant with a limited number of seats, it's great for a date with someone special.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is a small place, cute and quiet. I went there for their sushi lunch special which came with soup and 2 rolls. They would not let me substitute any rolls, even for an up charge. I had the spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura. The rice was very loose (not packed well around the roll) and the taste was mediocre. Overall the presentation of the sushi was messy and I was not impressed. Probably wouldn't go there again and I live a block away.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Best middle eastern food in the area This place will serve you hummus as it should taste, and salads as they should taste.  Everything is so fresh, they clearly take pride in their ingredients. You will come out so satisfied eating anything from here, because its made properly, and tastes so good.   The area around soho has quite a few places that have the same thing on the menu, but not as fresh, genuine and tasty as here.  Honest good food. Bigger plus is they use recyclable materials for all take out packaging and they're extremely nice people who work there.   I can't remember which one, but I was a bit alarmed about the oil leaving a mark on the paper towel. That said, the oil wasn't the usual 'nasty'.  These guys cook properly so I trust they use a pure oil that adds to the flavour.   Overall, a good taste, trust in that they are using ingredients that satisfy an appetite in a way that is made healthier than other (cheaper) places in the area.

"Ever go out to a chain restaurant, and you see these people, and you can tell that this is a big night out for them? Like, when they were sitting at home trying to figure out where to go for dinner, there was a heated debate between Chili's, Texas Roadhouse, and Hooters? That's what I felt like. Like this was everyone's special dinner. I mean, we basically came here because we gave up. We couldn't figure out what we wanted to eat, or where we wanted to go, and I had drove past this place on the highway a bunch of times, so it was like, ""this place CAN'T be any good. Let's go have dinner with some crazy, toothless, George W Bush lovin' hicks and see how scary it is."" Turns out, not that scary at all. My steak, while not likely to be confused with kobe beef any time soon, was tasty, even if I did have to cut around all the fat. But I expected that for the really cheap prices. The side dishes were mostly good, although they do tend to go over the top, wanting to add cheese and bacon to just about everything (hey, I love me some bacon, but even I get to a point occasionally where I'm just like, ""hmm... that's entirely unnecessary""). The service is friendly and efficient, and when all was said and done, the two of us had steak dinners for about $40 total. Not too bad at all. I don't need to pick out my own steak, though. It's not like I'm picking from a selection of incredible quality meat. It's just a gimmick. It makes no difference to me. Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.

"For my cousin's post-30th birthday brunch, we needed a serious amount of heavy food to reinvigorate our livers. Naturally, we turned to our people. Schlesinger's has all the appearances of a Jewish deli, but didn't quite deliver on the premise. They have an incredible-looking display case that's filled with cold cuts, salads and enormous desserts. In practice, not everything tasted as good as it looked. I got a turkey bacon, egg and cheese wrap. It was good, although a little heavy on the cheese. The bagels are Philly bagels (see my thoughts here: yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-ba…), and therefore sad. My challah french toast was very soggy, but the fresh challah loaf we bought was a little dry. Some of the desserts had more promise. I got a macaroon while I was waiting, and I liked it a lot. And then there were the black & whites. Holy crap...they were delicious and huge. I haven't seen so much black and white crammed together since Eminem played Yankee Stadium. While we were there (we got everything to go), the cashier was having a petty fight with one of the servers. At first it was funny, but they were bickering for 10 minutes about who should be seating new customers. The cashier rolled her eyes and said ""I can't stand that guy!"" I wouldn't consider this a good Jewish deli without lots of complaining, but it wasn't the most professional thing in the world. Overall, it's always good to see a taste of NY in Philly, but there's room for improvement here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mamoun's is a great spot in the village when you have a crave for a falafel sandwich. Price per is running at $3 and that's a great value. This place is open very late, and it's the definitive place to get a post drinking snack if you're in the area. If you're brave enough, get the hot sauce but beware of it since it's deathly hot. The heat is so intense for some that it might really make you sweat. I personally don't put a generous amount, but just enough to give the sandwich a little extra kick. Seating is limited inside to a couple of tables and there is an additional bench outside, but not an option in the winter time. Most customers just grab and go. The falafel is also availalbe in a platter form so it's not as messy to eat.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Excellent rodizio meal. Much thanks to my wonderful boyfriend for taking me here for a lovely birthday dinner. We both ordered the rodizio and skipped appetizers as the salad bar combined with unlimited meats would be plenty. The salad bar was cute and minimal - and more than enough given the size of the entrees (we scoped out other tables - it would be quite hard not to have leftovers). My favs included the mozzarella (yes, you read that right - smoky grilled cheese - looked like roasted marshmallows but was the perfect mix of smoke, cream and salt and was completely awesome and surprising), top sirloin (melt in your mouth), garlic steak (don't talk to anyone for a day after), chicken and ham. I thought the rest of the meats were just average, although the bf really enjoyed the short rib also. Some of the meats were quite salty, which I loved, but it may be a bit much for some people. I skipped all the carbalicious side dishes. We learned a cool tip from nearby diners - if you order the Churrasco a Fernandes from the menu, you get all of the meats from the rodizio in a huge portion - and get to take the leftovers home. I was really bummed that they cleared away my fried banana that I put aside for dessert, but the grilled cinnamon pineapple slice was yummy. Service was a bit disorganized at times when we were there, but we were advised with an apology that they were training some new staff. Nothing really to complain about.","[1.0, 0.0]"

My fiancé and I stayed in New York for our very first time over New Years and were DYING for some real Italian New York pizza! This little gem was amazing and the perfect place for a date night. Dim lighting and candles at every table and the service was fantastic. We got the Salsiccia pizza and it was so delicious we ate the whole thing!

"I found this vegetarian/vegan restaurant/take out spot while exploring the city and what a find.  Their vegan take on everyday Philly eats like cheesesteak was so tasty that I have been back a couple of times already.  I don't even want to get into the desert, which is delivered fresh every Thursday from what I have been told.  Sometimes I have to fight the craving, but as you can tell by my review that is not a fight that I win very often.  Check this place out ASAP.  LoL!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A small, charmingly dark cafe bar with some tasty food options.

"The unlimited sangrias kicked this up to 4 stars. The food was not bad, but nothing spectacular. I had the quesadilla with grilled chicken and a huge dollop of sour cream. The only memorable flavor was a hint of spiciness from the peppers. On to more important things, here is a list of the flavors of their unlimited sangrias: Blancas: Blanco (fresh fruit and a splash of spirits) - plain, but a solid drink. Havanna Banana (coconut, bananas, lychees, coconut rum) - the rum is very distinct in this one. Mojito (lemons, limes, oranges, sugar cane, citrus vodka) - strong vodka taste, but the non-alcoholic ingredients hold their own here. Tropical (mango, pineapple, lemongrass, passion fruit, light rum) - this was a table-favorite. The alcohol is subtle here. Rojas Rojo (fresh fruit and a splash of spirits) - plain, but good. Fresas (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, raspberry vodka) - true to its name, this was a fruity delight. Spanish Harlem (peaches, mandarin, cinnamon, dark rum, brandy) - my personal  Favorite! This drink had a very distinct flavor and is different from the others because of its cinnamon bite. Mulata (Tarmarind, Vanilla, Spice Dark Rum) - another idiosyncratic Calle Ocho drink - try it to be different! Rest assured, I tried every single one, so don't worry about the authenticity of these critiques. =)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a review for the new location, inside the Excelsior Hotel on W. 81st Street. The decor is darker, more serious and pulled-together, with lots of semi-circular banquettes. The bar area up front is loud and attractive, with some seating by the front windows. The major difference is no more sangria bar. It's still gratis, but you place your order and it's delivered by the glass. I didn't have a problem with this, but it definitely changes the vibe. No more freewheeling sampling, no more guys stirring the giant vats to keep the fruit distributed. The apps (salad with creamy goat cheese, tamal, and an empanada that was plated from a giant metal press!) were all winners. Entree-wise, the luscious duck sat on a bed of the most flavorful lentils, and the hangar steak was similarly lip-smacking. Salmon came with a generous helping of lobster mash. There are usually fish specials, which are worth waiting for. The one sour note was our waiter. He was obviously annoyed with us the moment we sat down, and he responded to the simplest questions (Like why does the free sangria have prices listed in the menu?) with disdain. He slammed down requested bowls of fruit that had gone missing from our sangria. It was so bad that the 4 of us almost walked out. Then, suddenly and for no reason, he became our best friend. He laughed, he chatted, he made little jokes. WTF? Did someone take him aside and mention that I Yelp?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you have friends or family from out of town and they want to experience ""the Philly cheesesteak,"" bring them here. BUT, do not park; in fact, do not even let them get out of your car.

Then, when they had their fill of watching people wait in line for 30+ minutes for a terrible cheesesteak, take them somewhere else. Anywhere else. I've had cheesesteaks from food trucks (and not the big, fancy food trucks that are becoming popular in this city, but from the ""roach coaches"") that were 100% better than Geno's (or the closely-related, possibly even run by the same people, cheesesteaks at Pat's).

"I think Alice's Arbor is actually one of Brooklyn's hidden gems-not just Bed-Stuy, but all of Brooklyn. The food here is exceptional, and as someone who works with food and spends a lot of time eating pretty fancy stuff, Alice's Arbor ranks pretty high. They use high quality, fresh ingredients, and do new American twists really well. Their beet salad includes shaved fennel and a pistachio vinaigrette that is a nice spin on the old goat cheese stand-by. I can not get enough of their ribs with black eyed pea salad-Seriously, sometime I dream about those vinegary, slightly spicy ribs when  I'm not there. I also think they do vegetables really well, which is usually a sign of a restaurant a cut above the rest. As I said, everything is very fresh, which is the most important component, and they also do a beautiful presentation. Their seasonal heirloom salad is perfect in its simplicity. I highly reccomened Alice's Arbor for people that really enjoy quality, interesting New American food. I'm surprised at how few of the reviews here talk about it. It's also a really good looking place, going with the current Brooklyn theme of rustic wooden tables and exposed brick, which is nice, but the food is what keeps me coming back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Unfortunately for my boyfriend and friends, I will never be sick of this restaurant. Every single thing that they make is delicious. Probably go there about once a week if possible (which it normally is). The pho is always great and the menu is huge for non-pho lovers. If you are a meat eater and not squeamish, try the raw beef in lime juice salad for an appetizer (#116) - lettuce, cilantro, onion, lime juice, peanuts, and meat that is only slightly cooked from the acidity of the lime juice (ceviche style). It is phenomenal. The only downside to the restaurant is the parking situation. It shares a lot with an apparently very popular Asian grocery store - on weekend afternoons, don't even bother with the lot at all, just find street parking. We have been stuck there for 20 minutes at a time with people idling with groceries and menacing each other for parking spots. I have tried tons and tons of Vietnamese restaurants and this one is by far the best.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've heard about this place and read reviews about it but hadn't gotten around to trying it til this past weekend.  One my cousins is a huge fan of Calle Ocho so I was looking forward to checking it out for myself.  First obvious thing that draws in their customers...complimentary unlimited sangria throughout the course of your brunch..SCORE!  (I'm actually not a big drinker so I'm probably one of their more favored customers, haaa)..  They offer 10+ different types of sangria which is cool cause you can try as many different ones as you want (but they wont give you a new glass of sangria until you finish whats in your glass). Their starter bread basket is amazingggg!!!!!!!  It comes with a strawberry butter (I think that's what it was?).  It comes with corn bread, this donut-y kind of bread, and this circle round ball of HEAVEN.  It was so good, I think I consumed 5-6 of them in the span of 10 minutes.  (Yup, I'm a total oinker!!) Entrees- We tried the burrito (good but not amazing), beef strips with rice (probably the best dish we tried), cubano sandwich (not good but the fries were good), quesadillas (good), plantains (good) and yuca fries (good).  for dessert we shared the banana tres leches (good) and creme brulee (good).   Overall the food was good (but not absolutely amazing either) but I still rate it a 5 because....unlimited sangria (I got drunk off of HALF a glass of sangria...I am the weakest weaksauce girl of them all :P), amazing bread basket, amazing quick service, and pretty decent food (I think the only thing I wouldnt ever really order again would be the cubano sandwich).

"This is my favorite restaurant in Williamsburg.  It is an absolutely delightful place.  It has a beautifully crafted ambience that is anchored by the wooden bar on the left side of the restaurant as well as the wooden beams that hang overhead.  It is glamorous without being fussy, classic without being ironic. The service is by far the best I have ever received in the neighborhood, if not the city.  Chris (who works most weekends and some weekdays) is a prime reason I became a regular, and the hostesses always have a pleasant and welcoming demeanor. Brunch is delicious.  My favorite meal is a combination of savory and sweet: the belgian waffles, topped with slivered almonds, blueberries, and raspberries with the real mccoy maple syrup and fresh cream, are mesmerizing.  Balance them with the Walter Breakfast (eggs how you want 'em, toast, delicious links or bacon), the chorizo scramble, a classic breakfast sandwich, or one of the special scrambles - always delicious - and you won't be let down.  The chicken and waffles (amazing hot sauce, and the waffles are pumpkin!) are also sure to please, as is the pumpernickel bagel plate. Try the bramble (gin, lemonade, fresh blackberries) if you're looking for a new breakfast cocktail. I recommend it without reservation.  It's a perfect balance of casual with fancy - a place where you can be both frugal and splurge - but will have a great meal no matter which you decide.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"so REALLY a 3.5 start at this point, but oh well. i really wanted to luv this place bc of the reviews....and i did think some aspects of it were done really well. we both got the chicken paitan ramen since this is their signature dish (although i would like to come back & try the spicy or miso ramen- maybe i'll up my stars =). i am definitely a pork person, so i was a bit hesitant, but the chicken broth was flavorful and creamy, every slurp was a tasty one. i think i still prefer the fuller flavor of pork broth though. the ramen was cooked to al dente, which i like as well. there was no egg, so i kind of missed that. but my friend go it and it wasn't soft boiled...as rumored. it's such a wonderful thing, that soft boiled egg. everyone should implement it! i actually think ramen setagaya does this the best. we also got for apps the char siu mayo don & seared tuna w/ avacado. the tuna was lacking in flavor and texture was a bit on the mushy side. i wouldn't get this again. i usu like my pork on the tender side so the char siu, was a bit tough for me, but my friend enjoyed it so depends on your pork preference ;) quick tips- there is no host, just write your name on the clipboard hanging on the door. it seats about 20 ppl, including counter space so there will most likely be a wait. we waited about 30 mins w/ 4 tables of 2 and 1 of 1 ahead of us.

"This was an amazing experience from the moment we walked through the door. Waitstaff was knowledgable and attentive. I saw one server spend almost 10 minutes taking photos for people at a table.  Our server ""T"" was awesome. I dropped a piece of bread on the ground like a fool and without missing a beat she brought over a whole new plate. Everyone shares responsibility and it's a real team of people who care. This was a busy Friday night and I am a super fussy person. The food was original and very good. A salad with jalepino sauce, cheddar and apples was so good. And maple gelato with bacon.

"Still as good as always, we called very last minute to get a reservation for 4 adults and one 3 year old and got it for 7h45. We had family coming into Manhatten and when we initially called she was stuck in bumper to bumper traffic in the Lincoln tunnel, so we did not know how long it would take  so we called at 6h30, and requested a 7h30, they informed us they could do 7h45. As per usual Murphy (as in Murphy's law) was on duty,so she zipped out really quickly and we ended up showing up at 7h15.  Fully aware we were way before schedule, we signed in and let them know we would be willing to wait, this was all our bad.   They  (Kefi) being  one of the most accomadating places ever,  found us a table (they were really busy so this was no small feet), we sat and had a wonderful meal. Here is what we ordered: Apps: Fried calamari (which came with an awsome dipping sauce), Greek salad for table (which for purest is not really the same as greek cause it has shredded lettuce, but we like it), their awwwwwwsome warm feta salad, really a must have, and the octupus with chick peas.  We laughed about the octupus because anyone who has prepared it knows that to get a great texture it has to be tenderized.  We told the waiter this one had been severely whacked and abused because it melted in your mouth. We followed up with Pastitsio X 2,  which were repeat orders from last time but the heart wants what it wants, and the other two dishes were the Flat pasta with Pulled rabbit, this was very good, the only hiccup is that there was a little carteledge and one bone so beware.  To be fair however having made this dish before and knowing about rabbit, it is physically impossible to get a those pesky bones out, so if you know this you always look for it, otherwise don't order rabbit.  The last main was the Mac and cheese from the kids menu, as an aside about this they offered us everything kid friendly, crayons and booster and kid page with drawings.  They were also very nice with the little man offering fist bumps. Greek red was suggested by the very nice waiter, and we were checked on by the host during the meal.  I hate to go on but this place does it right on all levels so it is worth the shout out. Thanks to the Kefi team once again and see next time and many more to come.","[1.0, 0.0]"

In other news, the salmon is amazing, as is the burger, the fries, and the steak. Drinks: the celery gimlet is a great mix of salty, sweet, and refreshing. Pimm's cup is tasty too. Decor: laid back, rustic, but modern. The downstairs room is a much quieter, more intimate alternative to the raucous upstairs. And the bathrooms are super cool...if not confusing.

"We went for restaurant week.  I am not a huge seafood fan, but my boyfriend is, so we decided to give this place a try.  We were there at 6PM on a Saturday and we were the only ones there till around 7PM.  There were many people coming to pick up food, so I guess the take out is quite popular from there. I have the beggars pouches, which were very good.  The boyfriend has the seafood rolls, and he really enjoyed them as well. For the meals, I had the softshell crabs, which were great!  The boyfriend really liked them too.  He couldn't decided between the Rad Naar or their other fish dish which came in a hot pot or something.  He went with the Rad Naar and added the lobster to it.  He was quite disappointed.  It was a little bland, not much flavor.  He wished he'd went with the other one. For dessert, he got the key lime pie.  He said it was the best key lime pie he ever had!  I had the creme brûlée and it was average, nothing special. Not sure if we would go back here, maybe for the appetizers and desserts.  I would want to try some of the other dishes people mentioned on here.  Might have to just have the take out then.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came to this place only because Tre Scalini was closed next door. Already had a bottle of wine we  left in the car after coming here. Tuesdays are Byob and no corking fee. Trust me when I tell you that is the only good thing about this place. My experience went like this: The menu is extremely small. No soup options and only one salad option (octopus).I ordered the tripe appetizer and it was way too salty. Almost to the point of having to send it back. But I was starving and dealt with it! My boyfriend had the octopus salad. The octopus (just legs) were the size of pin needles. No joke. For my entree I ordered the parpadell in a saffron truffle sauce. This dish was $20 and the size of an appetizer (literally). The owner of the restaurant brought our dishes to the table and, although he did not introduce himself, I thought this was a very nice gesture. So back to the parpadell... This dish too was overbearingly salty!! I sent it back. I had one bite and was through with it! My boyfriend had the gnocchi in a white cream rabbit ragu. Again, his dish was appetizer size and was extremely salty. So after pushing my dish aside the minute it came out, I was not waited on again until we had to ask for the check. I guess all the wait staff and the owner were too busy to notice I had pushed my dish aside. When the bus boy came over, I explained that I did not like my dish, it was too salty and I wanted to send it back. He said ok. And three minutes later he brought it back wrapped to go! I again specified I did not want it. When the waiter came, I believe he might have been unaware of the situation (attentive much?) and handed us our check, with my $20 parpadell still on it. I immediately took the check into the hostess and told her I did not eat my entree and I wanted the charge off.  The waiter came back an apologized because no one ""told him."" Meaning while, during all this, I sat at a table with no food STARVING while my boyfriend was chowing down. NO ONE came over to rectify the situation. I sat with no food and was given no option to re order after the fact. My main gripe is that the owner was there. He even served us our food for christ sake! How could he have let this happen?! I've lived in south Philly my entire life. I've dined at practically every restaurant in South Philly/center city. From fine dining to diners. Ive had it all. But I have never experienced customer service in this magnitude. If I could give this place no stars, I would! My tip for the chef at Le Virtu: if you are already loading up dishes with salt and salted butter, please do not add or top your dishes with salty macaroni cheese! I started writing this review while I was sitting in Le virtue, that's how disgusted I was. Now.. I am sitting down the street at Stogie Joes enjoying a wonderful meal and a nice cold brew!","[1.0, 0.0]"
This definitely made the top 5 places I have ever eaten at. (I tried both mine and my dates food) The Food: 1. Pretzel Crusted Calamari - Perfect balance of the crunchy texture from the pretzels to the soft/tender texture of the fresh calamari I just don't understand why other restaurants are not frying their calamari in crushed pretzels. 2. Raw Scallops on the shell - They were so sweet and honestly melted in your mouth. This was by far my FAVORITE dish. 3. The Suckling Pig - Well this had bacon marmalade on top of it...Need I say more? 4. Fried chicken in hot butter sauce - You honestly can't go wrong with fried chicken and butter and this was so juicy and buttery that it was just amazing! The service was impeccable and the decor was perfectly trendy and romantic. In my opinion everyone needs to come here at least once. I for sure want to come back so I can try the dessert in addition to other menu items. So DELICIOUS!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I purchased a Groupon for my wife's birthday and while my expectations weren't high, we were truly blown away by the quality of the food here. The restaurant's in a very residential area, to the point where I understand why they use Groupon to drive traffic....it would be hard to just find this place by accident. The restaurant is very nice on the inside. We were immediately seated and were given a salad to start after we ordered, which had a delicious dressing. We started with the flaming sausage appetizer, which was great. For the main course, my wife and kids had the seafood paella which they all loved (and will be eating as leftovers for the next few days). I took the waiter's recommendation and had the Portuguese steak, which was unreal. We topped everything off with a lava cake for desert. As an entire meal, this was top-notch. If the purpose of Groupon is to introduce you to new places with the hope of becoming a regular customer...mission accomplished. The staff was great, the food was great, no complaints at all. Highly recommended.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've only ordered pizza, so keep that in mind.   Friendly neighborhood pizza / Italian on Broad street.  The people who run it are great.  Once when I stopped for a slice the guy brought out some water in a bowl for my dog.   Place can get busy, but if you're dropping by for a slice it's no problem.  I'm a fan of the chicken parm pizza and the baked zita pizza.  Sicilian and plain are also great.   there's some outdoor seating when the weather is good, the front opens up completely.  If you're local I'd recommend Prime Time for your pies.  Thumbs up.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Gross! I had my first cheesesteak at Pat's today (I'm new to Philly) and was bitterly disappointed. The guy at the window actually wasn't so bad, didn't feel like I was in ""Soup Nazi"" territory. But the quality of the cheesesteak (I had one 'wit' with cheese whiz) was a complete letdown. The meat was pretty dry and tough, because it had been sitting for a while. It was in the middle of the afternoon, so no lines... that might be different when there's more business. The cheese whiz was ok, and the bread was actually good. BUT the quality of the meat was AWFUL - disgusting, with lots of pieces of gristly fat in between. It almost made me puke... I have no idea how Pat's came to have this reputation. Never again! BTW, I liked Steaks on South a lot better! Go there if you are looking for a good cheesesteak. They make them fresh, so you're not in for nasty surprises like at Pat's.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I REALLY wanted to like Cornerstone Cafe, for a few reasons: A) It's a cutesy little cafe in Alphabet City. B) It's almost perfectly midway between mine and my little's apts - so the perfect meet up/catch up place. C) It had really good reviews on Yelp. D) It's really inexpensive. I had a Groupon for dinner, so my little and I decided to catch up over some delicious pasta. While the food was really good, when I asked for a few extra mushrooms (as a sub for another vegetable), the waitress told me that'd be an additional $6. An additional $1 or $2 for a substitute or extra vegetables I would've understood, but not $6. So weird. Also, our waitress was semi-attentive. She seemed to be more interested in her phone than any tips we would've given her. I needed to flag her down quite a few times to refill my water - something I really dislike doing. So while the food was pretty good, I'd try other places that would allow me to get some extra veg for less than $6 before trying this place again. Unless I was craving inexpensive and delicious Italian - then I'd drag a friend over here. By the way - it's cash only! So make sure you have some in your wallet before arriving!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A friend of ours has told us for years that this place has the best pizza in NJ.  We had not been here in over 15 years, and we decided to give it a try when we were in Boonton on a Saturday afternoon. We were sat at a table that was covered in cheese, which we brushed onto the floor.  The olive oil on the table, and the bread that came out were good.  We ordered the pasta e fagioli and the broccoli rabe pizza.  The soup was tasty, not as good as some others, but good.  The pizza was very bland though.  Really not much flavor at all.  We did take home 1/2 the pie, and it did taste better cold the next day. I would not make a trip up to Boonton to eat here.  In fact, if I was in Boonton, there are a lot of other, better choices to make.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Solid, satisfying pizza served quickly despite a very busy lunch hour in the Financial District.  Shared the well-sized white with onions and sun dried tomatoes with a buddy and were plenty full and happy at the end. The missing star?  Meal service and seating.  It's a rare instance to become happy when a family of three sits down next to you, but the amount of space that opened up by putting their tables together helped more than one should expect.  Unfortunately, the service could not compensate for the cramped seating since there only seemed to be three servers for the whole packed house, including the bar. Nonetheless, the food, even on its own, earns the place a well-deserved four out of five.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yesterday I was on vacation in NYC staying at a hotel a few blocks away and wanted to hit a great NYC breakfast spot.  Penelope's was recommended by the hotel concierge. I arrived and put my name in. I was by myself.  The host asked me if I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar and I said I would love to.  The expected wait for a seat at the bar was about 15 minutes.  Other people in groups were told 45 minutes to an hour wait for a table.  The restaurant was very busy and after about 40 minutes of waiting outside on a beautiful day, I went inside to check on my seat and the host said it would be a few minutes longer. A few minutes later I was seated. I was thrilled to see that they had crab cake eggs benedict as a special.  I've never had it before but I love crab cakes and I love eggs benedict so it seemed like the perfect choice for me. When my meal arrived I was immediately disappointed by its appearance.  Eggs benedict is supposed to be topped with holladaise sauce and the egg yolks are supposed to be soft and runny.  My egg yolks were hard as rocks and there wasn't a drop of hollandaise sauce to be found.  I tried the dish anyways, but the taste of dry hard cooked eggs on top of crab cake with no sauce was a complete turn off and it was quite shocking to me that such a dish would be allowed to leave the kitchen of a reputable restaurant.  I re-read the description of my dish to make sure I didn't misunderstand it and indeed the description said that the dish was prepared with hollandaise sauce.  I spoke with the manager on duty and explained to her that my dish wasn't prepared properly and the reasons why.  She was very professional, apologized, and I didn't have to pay for it.  As an added token, she gave me a cupcake in a cute little to go cup and said that she hoped I would come back again.   On my way out I visited the restroom first, and as I stepped through the hall where the kitchen is into the restaurant to make my exit, I noticed another plate of crab cake eggs benedict leaving the kitchen looking exactly as mine did... rock hard dry eggs and no hollandaise sauce...unbelievable! I was disappointed with my experience here.  My meal was not prepared properly and the fact that I was a party of one and waited so long for a spot at the bar was too much.  I was a hostess and server in restaurants for several years back in the day and in my experience a party of one is seated quite quickly.   However, people don't line up at this place for an hour every Saturday and Sunday morning for nothing so next time I am in NYC I will give it a second chance and maybe order something more safe like bacon and eggs.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We live in the neighborhood and were looking for breakfast on a rainy Saturday, too hungry to deal with the crush of tourists at Reading Terminal. I knew this was a hotel restaurant but got sucked into all the rave reviews and became convinced it must be  something more than the usual midrange business class hotel breakfast. It isn't. If you have stayed in a chain hotel on the side of a busy highway anywhere in the country that includes a free breakfast in the lobby, you know exactly what this is. The addition of a live chef to cook omelettes and scrambled eggs is nice, but it is still a melamine bar with stainless steel buckets set in ice and filled with individual pots of yogurt and half pints of milk, some pastries in a clear acrylic case, and a steam bar with troughs of bacon and sausage. The view is lovely, your fellow diners are exactly what you would expect at a $100 a night hotel across from a convention center, and you will pay $15.95 unless this came as part of a room package.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My friend strongly recommended the brunch deal ... a cocktail, main course and tea/coffee for $22. However comparing this amount with the a-la-carte prices, i didn't notice any substantial difference. Two of us went for the Turkish eggs ... its two poached eggs on Greek yoghurt and butter. This was delicious (though i might have preferred a bit less of the yoghurt) ... runny egg-yolk mixed with yoghurt ... i was proud of my choice ... until i had had the lychee french toast. Without doubt that was the best brunch dish i have ever tasted. It was sweet ... not excessive ... exactly the right amount. Sadly i have now come to know that the Public has removed this wonderful preparation from their menu ... beats me why. Besides the standard offerings, the brunch menu consists of quite a few interesting alternatives ... like black pudding waffles. I can return a few times just to sample these. It was only after my meal there that i came to know that the Public was a michelin starred place. Its the only one that i have been to that offers a good breakfast ... which makes it unique among its peers. The brunch price is way below what one would expect from a restaurant of its league. Its surely not to be missed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This review is solely based on the brunch... hoping to make it there for dinner soon! The biscuits and homemade seasonal preserves are some of the best I've ever had, amazing!!

"I have really really enjoyed American Sardine Bar every time that I have been there. It's a mere 4 blocks from my sister's house, which is a plus (a sketchy 4 blocks, but I'm tough - it's cool). The neighborhood needs more kick butt places like this. I love the chalkboard menus. I love that the beer is very reasonable and delicious. I love the pickles. The brussel sprouts are freakin amazing. I love the atmosphere inside. Every time I go, every one is more than happy.I tried a bunch of food the first time - falafel, grilled cheese, fried PB & J, pork sandwich. I have been on the healthier side as of late, but the dill tomato soup I had was beyond awesome. Did I say that I like the pickles? Also, last time I went here - I saw not one, but two people that I knew. One yelper and one random other person. Any place that draws such an awesome crowd is top notch in my book. :) Despite the recent yelp hate  - I really do like this place, and I think that every one else should love it too.

"How I want to give Sakagura 5 stars! But after the 2nd time going there for dinner, their service is showing more and more cracks.   The food is good! The fact that it's underground somewhere, makes it even cooler. But the service.... The 1st time I went there, we were done with dinner, the place started to clear out and they asked if we could free up the table, because there was a queue outside. Uhm, there were 2 people waiting. Seriously?! 2nd time we went there, the oysters were soooo chewy, i couldn't even bite it nor swallow it. My friend had the same issue. So we called the waitress and asked if this is normal, coz I'm not unfamiliar with oysters, and this was just not eatable. The waitress said she would check with the chef and eventually came back and told us they would cancel this from our total bill and asked if we wanted something else instead. Good way of solving this I thought. Then the head waiter comes in and says that they will still charge us for the oysters. Uhm, hello, your colleague just said something different. After lots of going back and forth, they still deleted it from our bill. Oh, and that was after the insult that maybe we are not familiar with oysters...Why would you say this to your complaining customer? So, word of advice Sakagura: Improve your service! Then you'll be worth 5 stars:)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As a working Chef (trained in Italy). I was not too impressed by the Pizza there. For all I know it could have been an off night. So I'll give it another try later on in the year. One point I have to bring up here. The old fellow called Patsy really, really made a pest of himself tonight. For one he was way too chatty cathy for our taste and forced us to have espressos that we didn't want. My advise is this: He should take some pointers from our / his beaded server that was Highly professional and Very discreet. Come to think of it why is that kind of server working there?. Either way give it a try!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Starr really did get this one right. The upscale French bistro decor pushes the line of over-the-top-ness but manages not to cross it, somehow, with touches throughout that are simultaneously charming and impressive (the men's room alone is something to behold). Certainly pricey, which shouldn't come as a surprise, but the service is top notch and the menu is both authentically upscale French and inventive.  Brunch is particularly well conceived. The complaints:  For the prices, the plates should be a bit fuller than they are.  And the crowd is... well... very, VERY Rittenhouse-y... beware the phalanx of $500 strollers parked at the door during weekend brunch!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have never left a restaurant with such disgust ever before.... Care to know to know why, read on... We considered ourselves to be ""regulars"" being there once a week for along time but our works schedule changed so we couldn't make it there for over a year (they close at nine). Today was the day so we made it there at eight with our bottle of wine to get our favorite ""make your own pasta"". I am going to skip the difficulty we encountered trying so hard to get couple of glasses for our wine, water and trying so hard to get the warm bread which used to appear on the table as you order your dinner. Bread appeared like it was forgotten on the counter yesterday but hastily warmed up to see if it would fly... Then we get our pasta dishes which we ordered with the five ingredients you can choose from. Both of ours came up with two out of five ingredients missing, Sundried tomatoes were substituted with chunks of canned tomatoes and no fresh pharm at all on mine and no sundried tomatoes and eggplant on hers. When we pointed it out, the waitperson first came back telling us it is because sundried tomatoes fall apart therefore we don't see it. Instead of fixing it right, kitchen sends it back on the side with a bowl of cold from fridge sundried tomatoes. I declined and ask for a check to pay my corkage fee since we already begged to get couple of glasses to have our wine and ended up waiting for an hour to get our dishes. She comes back with a check which they took one of the dishes off. At that point, we've got up to go to the cashier to pay corkage. Up to this point, I wanted to establish the circumstances, but this is where it gets interesting. What appeared to be the cook comes out and immediately starts yelling at us that we want to eat, drink and not wanting to pay. When I said I am not going to pay what I did not get and ate, she snatches the check from my hand and asks me not to ever come back again assuming that we would. I have never felt the need to write anything like this before but she pushed me over the edge. I don't recall ever been so upset with any other restaurant as I am now and needless to say I am not going to order the deliveries we had almost weekly. I am done with them with regrets.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I happen to live just 2 blocks away from Peaches HotHouse.This place is accorded a 1 star for the following reasons; 1) Service ~ what service????? Way too slow, not attentive and did I mention way TOO slow!!! C'mon people! 2) Portions ~ Way too small for the price that they charge on all items except for the fried chicken. Some of the items on the menu are quite edible. 3) Decor ~ the lousy wood work around the bar area is a clear indication that the owners lack 'passion' in making this place right. The shelves are warp, the cheap plywood bar counter is just that - cheap! 4) The space is NOT well laid out. They did not give a lot of thought in the 'flow' of the space. Too cramped!!

"Hillstone is unapologetically American in its culinary style, and in its style of service too. If there is a perfect American restaurant on this continent, Hillstone is it. The only word to describe the service here is ""perfection"". Every server I have ever had was friendly and entertaining, but brief and professional as well. They present themselves with a clean appearance and take command of the floor. They work together so you never feel neglected. Properly trained servers are hard to find, but you'll find them here. The kitchen at Hillstone is incredibly consistent. Each and every menu option is appealing in its own way, and the execution is excellent. Whether you're in the mood for a simple burger, a rack of ribs, or a New York strip, you'll not be disappointed. Presentation is done with a sensible, rustic simplicity. Lighting, seating, floor plan, waiting areas, bathrooms, and everything in between are well thought out, and well done. I will never, never, never stop going to Hillstone. Never.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I rarely write reviews but after an especially great experience last night (I've probably been 5-6 times in total) I've decided to share. This is everything you want a neighborhood restaurant to be. If you have a bad experience here, you probably ordered poorly or your taste buds do not function properly. Instead of raving about the fried chicken or bitching about the long waits, I will instead provide you with useful information. 1) Sit at the bar if you are 2 people. It blows my mind that people will wait two hours for a table for 2 when bar waits are frequently less than 30 minutes. There is plenty of space, the bartenders are friendly and informative, and it's actually much easier to converse with your dining companion. 2) The house cocktails are very good and the beer selection is perfectly adequate.  The wine list is good, but there isn't a ton under $40.  It is what it is.     3) If you're an oyster fan, have some oysters. I'm not a connoisseur, but I've taken some raw bar fans here and they all rave. 4) GET THE DAILY SPECIAL. They're specials for a reason. Notably, the Saturday ribeye is outrageous.  Seriously.  Outrageous. 5) If you don't get the special, the duck meatloaf and the warm lamb salad (which sounds weird, especially as an entree) are both awesome. You are not obligated to order the fried chicken.  It's good, but it's not the star.  I said it. 6) Yes the brunch (and bloody mary) is good, but dinner is far more enjoyable. Honestly, a restaurant that does brunch better than dinner is either 1) a diner, or 2) doing something wrong. That is an entirely separate rant from which I will spare you. 7) Vegetarians: rejoice!  In addition to having a few selections on the normal-person menu (the mustardy brussel sprouts are a nice side, by the way), there is a separate menu just for you.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The first thing my hubby tasted made him exclaim, ""WHOA!.... What was that!!!!!?!?"" with a complete look of amazement on his face.   I really could wax on about just how wonderful this place is and how it was one of the best meals I've ever had, but really, take the challenge of getting the reservation to eat there and find out for yourself.  I mean, when a friend told me that he knew someone who ate there and had to wipe tears off his face from one of the courses, I believe him.  Chef Ramirez's food is like a gorgeous and touching performance that engulfs you in it's delicacy and beauty.  But it's the kind of performance you make friends over as you exclaim and delight with your dining neighbors.  Drinks get shared, laughter, grins, and contented countenances ensue.   I often eat at places that are well-executed and delicious, but very rarely have I eaten at a place that is that thrilling. Truly astonishing food.  Go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So, I came here on a recommendation and I'm glad I did. From the outside it didn't seem as spacious as it really is - on my journey to the VIP room (aka THE BATHROOM) i saw a third room in the back. I requested to the hostess to sit there and she said that would be okay). BOOZE: At the bar while I waited I had a cocktail called ""citrus and something"". The ""something"" isn't part of the name - I just forget what it was called - it was very good but very dangerous, as in one turned in to 3.... The hostess told me it would be about 10 minutes for the table I requested - it ended up being 15-20mins. FOOD: I had the pasta with rabbit and its hard to do rabbit well - they succeeded. Very tender and tasty. I then had the folded chicken (I know, 2 entrees, give me a break i was HUNGRY!). It's hard to get excited over chicken but the folded chicken was spot on - perfect texture. I think the figs that it's served with was the clincher for me... WHY NOT 5 STARS: You can't tell me it's going to be 10mins and then have me wait 15-20.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm a huge fan of Heirloom, especially after our wildly fun e-list Girls Night Out last year. And now it's even better: a new chef and an entirely locavore menu. Carey Savona (ex of Nobu, NY) has raised the bar with his locally sourced, revamped versions of traditional American foods. Start with a pile of charred Gypsy peppers, roasted and salted and as addictive as potato chips but oh, so much healthier. Next, a chunky sugar pea puree to spread on husks of grilled fresh bread. Lunch was Carey's genius rendition of a tuna melt: smoked New England trout piled on artisanal bread, smothered with cheddar and radish slivers, served with a side of homemade pickles (newly legal in CT) and devilishly good fries. Omnivore and vegetarian friendly, the new menu is a must try. Makes you wonder why every restaurant on the Shoreline has yet to embrace this trend. Girls night out anyone??","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went here for a special date night with my S.O.. I made my reservations on OpenTable and I was able the change it three times the day of, which was really awesome of them. The ambiance of Public was beautiful -it's what NYC fine dining is all about (IMO). The hosts  were helpful and quickly checked out coats and bags, before seating us about 5 minutes later. We ordered a bottle of Australian Riesling off a suggestion from a friend. It was nice and light, though a bit sweeter than we're used to. We also ordered the kangaroo apitizer (why not, right?). It was okay -it felt a little raw and cold, but when paired with the samaosa piece below it, it was actually delicious. My S/O ordered the salmon and I ordered the pork tenderloin. We agreed, the vegetables were INCREDIBLE. They were crunchy and flavourful and just amazing. The fish/poultry was good, too. I was actually pretty full from the relatively small portions. Side note- they also make a few house breads that are fused with tamarind and the focaccia has cilantro. GET IT. It was so good. I found the food a little salty, but the wait staff was extraordinary with filling glasses up. Overall, I would definitely bring guests back as a cool NYC spot. The bill came to about $150 for the bottle of wine, two entrées and appetizer, so not so much for the everyday meal, but a nice night out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I tried to come here once before for Pancake month- arriving at 6 p.m. and was told that everyone was just seated and it would be a long wait. With 2 small children, I left and came back today, arriving at a few minutes before 3 p.m.- thinking it would be a quieter time. I did call in advance and was told this was a better time.  Our children were quiet and not making a peep. The hostess told me that everyone had just seated and they wouldn't seat again as they closed at 4 p.m. I couldn't imagine that it would take an hour to eat pancakes, however, we decided to get some to go (a 15 minute wait). As we waited, the hostess seated a table for one. We had already ordered, but we asked if we could be seated on the two high top seats. We were told no. Then, another two tables big enough for us opened up. After much reluctance, we were given one of the tables. We were seated in a tight two top- but knew the pancakes wouldn't travel well.  Several other tables opened up and the hostess sat all of them- up until 3:40 p.m. I was quite annoyed with this shoddy service. I've never been discriminated against because i had children. Although the pancakes were very good, I couldn't justify coming back to a place that would treat my family so poorly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The guys that worked there were extremely friendly, the owner was very cool and fun to talk to as well. I'm definitely coming back asap!

They said they saw a cockroach crawling by their table.  Needless to say, I lost my appetite.  My fries had been put on my table by then.  I got up to leave.  As I'm walking pass the bar the waitress gets in my way and said she would get my check ready.  When I told her that I didn't want to eat there because there were cockroaches crawling around the place, she said I still needed to pay, still blockin gmy  way so I wouldn't get by.  Then I heard the woman behind say to her in an irritating and annoying voice ""just let her go""  It was humiliating.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"i'm usually wary of restaurants in hotels - i guess i've had too many bad experiences of overpriced, sub-par food that sucks in the unsuspecting traveler secondary to convenience. not the case here at the gramercy park hotel. my brother stayed here and heard positive reviews of the restaurant so while i had in mind to take him to one of the other many fine dining establishments in the area, i had no idea that maialino would soon join those ranks! we had brunch and shared the ricotta pancakes and the pork sandwich with a fried egg on top in order to balance our meal with a bit of sweet and a bit of salt and both were absolutely phenomenal. i am salivating just thinking of it now! of course, my preggers self also had to have a chocolate croissant with my latte at the end which was the perfect ending to our meal. reading the reviews here on yelp, i've decided i MUST return for dinner. yum.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Recently had dinner with family and friends in the dining room. We opted for the 3 course tasting menu to get some variety and share some tastes. The trout appetizer was to die for....the trout just melted in your mouth. The mains (lamb, sea bass, pork loin) were all wonderfully prepared with very interesting flavors. We all loved the desserts as well (rhubarb almond cake, pear linden flower custard, and devils food chocolate cake). They also provided wonderful carrot juice amuse bouche, grapefruit/avocado palet cleanser, and assortment of three after dessert small treats (mini macaroon, chocolate filled with passion fruit, and one other that was tasty). Finally, they sent us each home with a wrapped muffin for breakfast or a late night snack. The wait staff was prompt, friendly, attentive and helpful with details and recommendations. The wine list was extension yet with a wide range of prices.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The menu may be small, but the portions are not - my husband and I can easily get away with each ordering an appetizer and then sharing an entree and dessert.  However, everything is so delicious that we rarely restrain ourselves in terms of ordering.  Personal faves include the pickles, chicken and short ribs... yum.

As for the food, wow.  So tasty.  Excellent variety of ""real"" tea, hot or iced.  Amazing pastries (I love the ginger snaps and sugar cookies).  The roast beef sandwich is AMAZING.  Normally I don't like pre-made food but their chicken salad sandwhich was unbelievable!  And I had some really good pancakes and omelet for brunch.  You're pretty much set here. It's a nice place for brunch and people watching...I once saw a guy training another guy on how to sell some kind of sports water.  Considering my degree is in water resources engineering, I had a good laugh!

My husband have been telling me about this place for months! I wasn't excited about it until I walked through the door of this wonderful establishment! The name doesn't sound too amazing but when you first walk in....it sure takes you back to another era.  There are black and white portraits of frank Sinatra and old Hollywood glamour...... it feels like we are dining in class! The service is top notch....from the manager (sorry I forgot your name who had the throwback mustache) who spends 10-15 minutes explaining the different types of oysters like they are wine....to the waitress who is knowledgable of the menus and even give great recommendations.  The only issue was that we came here after happy hour was over so we paid full price for the oysters. Although it wasn't necessarily a bad thing since we were able to try many different types of oysters from many other regions. I don't think the happy hour give you the other types of selections. My only compliant was the drinks we ordered wasn't that great....it was on the smaller and sweeter side.  I ordered the spring garden and the hubby ordered one of the bubbly. I will need to try some other drink recommendations. This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. We also ordered the oysters (lots of them) and the duck fat fries! Why was it all so amazing?!!! I definitely need to come here again to try the rest of the adventurous menu!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

And while I stand by the accuracy of that experience, I must say I was pleasantly surprised when someone from Almond's management tracked me down, apologized and invited me back to Almond for another try. I tried it again last night with three friends and our experience could not have been more different. This time the food, service and attention to detail were exceptional - 5 stars! When we arrived, we were seated right away.  The primary waiter serving us was amazing - great attitude and very attentive.  The food was delicious; we mostly ordered seafood as I now realize that, that is Almond's strength.  We were treated as royalty.  I am impressed that the restaurant cared about our unpleasant prior experience and invited us to return so they could show their better side.  And that better side, which I hope is their norm, is spectacular.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I don't know why we were even given menus, since the owner insisted on commenting on and correcting everything we said we wanted. According to the owner, he knows best, and if a diner doesn't agree with his ideas, the diner does not deserve to eat in his restaurant. No, he's right, we DIDN'T deserve to be treated like members of a concentration camp. The food was just okay, and I will never darken his door again. The whole experience cost me $100 for three people, including tip. And he is very hard on his servers. Altogether, an awful place for dinner.

We ordered the following Appetizers Omu Soba - Ramen Noodles wrapped in an Omelette.  I was ok with this dish, but I guess I just prefer to have my ramen noodles in soup broth instead of in an omelette style.  My friend enjoyed it more than me though Tuna Avocado Salad - I am usually always a big fan of this as it isnt too hard to do, but did not enjoy this version of it much.  Ive definitely tasted much better ones from other restaurants Takoyaki - This reminded me of Squid balls that I got at the street carts in Taiwan so wanted to try them out.  Also wasnt a big fan of it.  My other friends werent fans of it, so I had to finish the remaining ones. Okonomiyaki - This was just as I would expect it and I always liked eating these, probably because of all the Ranma 1/2 animes I use to watch, lol.  It was tasty and a bit gooey Entrees Mew Special Roll - This was actually very good and I think it was the best part of the night.  Was delicious 2 - Miso Ramen - We got two of these and shared with friends.  Nothing special with this but it was pretty good. Overall the place is nice and if you are around the area and just want a good decent meal I wouldnt mind going here again.  However, the food was just average.  I think it kind of hurt us that we ordered the Omu Soba and the Okonomiyaki as they were somewhat similar.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here on a living social and left stuffed! The portions are certainly generous, but I was underwhelmed by most of the dishes in terms of flavor. Favorites: Butter chicken- super tender and moist even though the sauce was not as developed as I wish it could have been Crispy spinach salad + spicy potato appetizer- I've never had spinach quite like this. It was so delicious and addicting! Not greasy tasting at all Cons: Tandoori vegetables- beautiful on the plate, but underdone and under-salted. The other dishes were good, but nothing too exciting. I enjoyed this as a fusion experiment, but I'm going to stick to traditional Indian food when I'm craving those flavors. I was also sort of confused on the attire. My bf and I dressed up for our date night as the prices suggested it was a bit on the nicer side. When we walked in, however, some diners were in jean cut-offs and t-shirts which is kind of distracting to the ambiance. I definitely think a dress code would enhance the overall dining experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Petite Crevette is 2 small, cozy rooms with GREAT food.  The menu is presented casually on chalk boards and fish/seafood is emphasized.  French and Italian seem to permeate the choices but there is no stuffy snobbery.  There is a hambuger and usually a carnivores' steak. Prices are not high - a scrumptious tuna burger, with fries and greens is $12. The fried oysters are stunning, served with greens. Where do the tasty tomatoes, year round, come from? Entrees run from $15-25. The BYOB policy is wonderful and Old Brooklyn Wines is right around the corner.   Given the high quality/reasonable prices, combined with a small but comfy space, there can be a wait.  Other diners are out there craving this food.  The staff will take your cell phone # and call.   The owner of PC, Neil, is not quite ... PC. He makes me laugh. He is jocular and engaging, on top of being a fine chef.  If you think you are a star attraction because you are 6'8"", if you dislike people older than you, stay home and eat boxed mac and cheese instead of low-balling this gem to a 3 star rating. If you decide to bring babies to dinner because they are your larvae and/or you cannot afford a baby sitter, be prepared to be an object of scorn. And be happy I was not there. Perhaps we could take up a collection for a baby sitter or birth control. A 1 star?  Gerber gets a 5 star I bet.

"There are certain things I like about a pizza - density of the crust, the level of salt in the cheese (I want gooey, not salt lick) and the sauce. A pizza with a thin, uninspired sauce might as well just call itself a slice of bread and cheese and get on with it. The sauce on our Bufala pizza was prodigiously good. It was a little sweet, a little tart, flavored well and was full-bodied, not runny. The crust was a little too thin for my liking, but I'm a fan of the hefty NYC crust, what can I say. I liked the quick service, I liked the variety of toppings. The sides, well, they weren't all that great - stick with the pizza.

"This is what 5 stars tastes like, mes chéris! Avocado Bread.  Spread some ripe avocado over a thick seven grain bread, sprinkle w/ chili flakes, add a dash of lemon juice.  Simple perfection.  A little heavy though, so share it w/ a friend or get two and call it a day. I love their salads.  The toasted aioli and parm croutons on the mixed green salad are truly divine.  They offer this as bigger portion along w/ some prosciutto as another salad.  I also dig the heart of palm salad, which somehow combines oranges, avocado, chili flakes into a juicy pile of sweet, spicy, savory deliciousness. Can't speak of the service, though, as I've only ever had take out/delivery.  But speaking from a food-only standpoint, the chef could come out and slap my grandma while I was eating, and I'd still probably come back the next day for lunch.

"Usually a pretty crowed spot. Seating might take a bit. Although always busy the service is fast and that saves the experience each time. I order the traditional burger. I love how it always looks perfect, like a little crabby patty. Food is delicious perfect size not to small or big. The only thing that I have ever ordered and been disappointed with was a shake. Took that as pretty odd seeing as how shake is in the business name you'd think it was a main focus. I ordered a chocolate shake but when I tasted the shake it had a weird mint taste to it, not sure if it was supposed to be like that or if the employee failed to clean the mixer correctly because they do have a seasonal mint flavor. Either way, this place is good for a quick and easy experience with a good bite. I would continue to give them my business.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Finally... got a chance to dine at the Industry.  It's been on my restaurant list for months.  We had the risotto and veggie tofu dip with chips for appetizers.  The veggie tofu dip was served cold and on the sweet side.  The risotto was deep fried and served with a tomato based sauce.  It was ok.  We ordered it for the kids, but were expecting the traditional risotto (of course, should have known better that there would be a twist).   The kids had the veggie alphabet soup for their entree.  It was light and healthy, and they enjoyed spelling words with the pasta.  For entrees, we had the bbq duck burger and flank steak; both were served with home-made fries.  The bbq sauce was sweet, wish it was spicy, should have asked for tabasco.  The steak was tender. I had the mixed drink with egg white.  Had to try it.  It sounds weird, but the drink was very good.  I couldn't taste the egg white at all.  My husband tried various specialty beers.  The Industry has a decent selection of craft beers. The best part of our meal was the outstanding service.  Our waitress was friendly, helpful and checked in on us frequently.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really loved Melograno. The place was packed but we got a table immediately. Our served was very attentive and helpful. We had: 1) Gamberi Calamari e Cannellini Inzimino: This was listed as a salad, but it was more of an appetizer... and the most wonderful appetizer I have ever had! Warm shrimp and cannellini beans served over baby spinach in a lemony/tomato-y juice. I could eat this all day every day! 2) Pappardelle Tartufate: We shared this pasta dish because every review raves about it. The bf liked it a lot, I thought it was good, but the truffle oil was too strong for my liking. This is why i gave it 4.5 stars... too strongly flavored. 3) Quaglie Arrosto: I loved, loved, loved this. The presentation was wonderful (two small quails completely deboned and stuffed), and the dried fruit stuffing was both savory and sweet. 4) Special Lam (I don't remember the exact name): Bf had this and he really loved it. 5) Molten Chocolate: Yum! I don't normally have chocolate desserts, but this one was hot, sweet, fudgey, delicious!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We come as regularly as our wallet will allow, this last trip was probably our 7th or so.  Each time, we ask to sit at the sushi bar and get omakase.  Sushi is always sublime.  The rice is slightly warm and perfectly seasoned.  The most incredible sushi we had were the uni, eel, sea scallop gut, oyster, and ikura.  The scallop gut (marvelous, like uni) and oyster were both accentuated by sea salt which crunches a bit when you eat it.  Texturally awesome.  We also had several tunas of various fattiness levels, giant clam, squid leg, king salmon, atlantic char salmon, king white salmon, fluke, branzino, and an uni hand roll.  A fun adventure of textures and tastes, all impeccably fresh and delicious.  We left happily stuffed.  Together with sake and beer, the damage was $250 before tip for 2 people.  Can't wait to return!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow - where do I start?   The waitress informing us of no free refills on the apple juice (duh) or that they have no sprite or 7 up.  How about the upcharge to have the mixed greens REMOVED from the crabcake entree' because it's the one entree with NO substitutions!!  All because we ordered a grilled romaine salad as an appetizer???  I'm confused.... How about two dining couples requesting separate checks - resulting in...NO separate checks.  However, the  waitress was kind enough to explain the inner workings of the kitchen - that one check order would be placed with the kitchen and two checks would be presented at the the end of our meal - you kdding me?  I don't care how your kitchen operates...and then the check comes out as one. HA!!! Dessert was offered with two diners absent from the table - in the ladies room. Every request was met with a reason why the request could not be met.  We absolutely had no idea what we would recieve after placing our order.  Also, we felt lectured to and patronized by the waitress.   Overall ambience - zero.  Service - maybe a 2 - because our food came out hot. For the prices charged I would at least like empty glasses removed from the table.  How about  tablecloths on tables?   If you want to be appreciated as a serious epicurean experience there is a lot of room for improvement. Next time, Yardley Inn - at least I know what to expect. It was the most surreal, absurd dining experience in quite some time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Dinner at Caracas was recommended to me by a local, but after my meal there I'd add this as a must-do for any tourist visiting Brooklyn.

Those, plus ""La Popular"" to share, were a perfect amount of food. It's popular for a reason-- all three of the caracas were amazing and completely different.

"First of all, the reviews preceding mine are spot on.  I found this place on yelp looking for a BYOB restaurant to celebrate the engagement of some friends with some champagne.  I got a reservation for the same night.  The owner/waiter is a weird dude for sure.  We might have been offended but it seems to be part of the whole experience of the place.  My friend ordered the goulash and the guy made a weird face.  She asked if he had a better recommendation, and he waved his hands and said ""no, no, no.""  She actually really liked the goulash.  My steak frites was perfectly delicious though a teeny bit gristly.  The mushroom cigar was great, but the chocolate mousse was amazing.    Definitely opt for dessert.  The final bill was suprisingly low--byob is great! On the downside, the portions are strangely varied.  The goulash was small, the tuna was tiny.  The chicken was large and I had so much steak, I shared it around the table.  The mushroom cigar is only about 4 bites.  The mousse was plenty for 2 to share.  Then, of course, the place is tiny and cramped and the service was definitely odd, though we had everything we needed in a timely manner. My overall advice is definitely try this place.  Make reservations, bring cash and wine, and bring a happy, open mind, and friends or a date. Added-perk--  the shop next door has a shop window full of the cutest puppies in the world if you get there before 8pm.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A planned visit to Mole, which was closed for renovations resulted in the execution of backup plan. Here is a review of my experience: let's start with the atmosphere. If you like loud music, loud conversations and a tight squeeze, this will work for you. If you want a quiet dinner without the pressure to finish your meal and leave, then try somewhere else. Food: The Tacos were very good and the portions although small, were just enough. My partner in crime and I had the Steak and Fish tacos respectively and they were both good. I recommended both. We included a side dish of Rice and Beans, which was very good and highly recommended. We also had Guacamole, which was okay but not up there with the best that I have had. Drinks: I had a Margarita on the rocks with salt. It was not too sweet, signaling not too much triple sec was used, which was great but the use of Tequila was light. Could have been a really good margarita, if less ice and more Tequila was used. Service: Overall the service was not too bad, although I did not care for the bus boy trying to take my friends basket when she was not finished eating. A request for hot sauce, got me a side order of Salsa. Say what!?! Who ever heard of a Mexican Restaurant with no hot sauce. Authenticity people, don't be trippin. The price was not bad and bargain hunters after a long day in the East Village would find this welcoming. I give this place a 3 star because they could do better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went to this restaurant when we found out that the Piolin in East Hartford was closed on Monday nights. My Peruvian parents are regulars at the other restaurants and we were happy to join them to check out this Franklin Ave. facility ( i think they have more grilled options) My daughter and husband are vegetarians and were very happy with the Papa la huancaina and Ocopa appetizers. My daughter ate the Peruvian style veggie omelette and my husband had the Tallarines with the piolin sauce (I think they added veggies to his pasta). The waiter was very helpful with his selection. My dad had the Chicharron de Pescado and mom had some mixed fish stew. I had the Chaufa with chicken(Chinese style fried rice). We all had HUGE portions. We also ordered a pitcher of Chicha (purple corn drink). It was a little sweeter that at the other restaurants. The presentation was very nicely done. My dad's dish had an almost architectural quality with the yucca and plantains "" housing"" the breaded fish and veggies. The waiter was very attentive. There was no one else in the restaurant for a while.  Though we were stuffed my daughter was curious about their desserts. Sadly, our waiter told us they didn't have any available this night.

"My boyfriend and I wanted to try a Portugese place so we came here. Calamari was good , crispy and light how it should be, the marinara seemed ketchupy but it was barely something to complain about. Then we ordered our entrees...  Swordfish in a butter sauce , and the stuffed lobster. I will not hesitate to say it was pretty horrible and we were utterly disappointed. Neither of us continued to eat after realizing we were just forcing down tasteless food because we were hungry. I don't know how you mess up lobster meat that bad. It was dry , overcooked, and any hint of lobster flavor was killed by an overwhelming taste of burn from the oven. The stuffing was the texture of soggy greasy breadcrumbs , and I'm shocked they call it ""crabmeat"" I'm 90% sure it was imitation crab meat , if it wasn't id be surprised. The ""crabmeat"" did not have the same soft lumps of texture that real crab does,It wasn't only the texture, the taste was horrible too, it tasted artificial and oddly sweet, like ketchup was added to it or something. The sides were a slice if tomato and raw onions , which was also confusing and more of a garnish than something I'd want to eat. The swordfish in butter sauce was an enormous disappointment. It came out and before I even ate it, I knew it was going to be flavorless. What I wanted was a deliciously prepared swordfish meal with accommodating sides and a tasty butter sauce to tie it together ..... What I ended up with was a plate with a slab of dry swordfish with not even an ounce of a sauce or butter , three slices of carrot , three potatoes , and a piece of broccoli all of which were only boiled and had NO seasoning whatsoever. The plate was sad looking and it tasted like nothing. I ended up having to squeeze all the lemon I could find on the table all over it , pour my bfs butter from his lobster on it, and season it with salt and pepper myself in an effort to add flavor. Just so disappointing and will never come back based on the quality of the entrees we got.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"One of my favorite fine dining spots in Philadelphila!! I love the dim and romantic lighting. It really makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. Also, they have very pretty chandeliers and small lights around the restaurant creating a very aesthetic ambiance! PERFECT for DATES!!  I've only been here once, and I will most probably be back when I visit Philly! My date and I came here during dinner time on a Saturday night, and it was filled! Luckily, there were two floors with  a lot of seating, so there wasn't much of a wait! We ordered three appetizers, and I especially remember those fried potatoes with shishito peppers! MY FAVORITE! I literally devoured those in a minute! the potatoes was cut into small bite sizes and generously seasoned with lots of spices and flavors! Plus, it was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. The TEXTURES, TASTE, SMELL, APPEARANCE!! AMAZING. The way they present the menu is very unique. Instead of having the typical appetizers, entrees, desserts, and etc, they categorized them into different sizes, such as ""small dish"" and 'large dish."" After sharing three appetizers with my date, I really should've ordered a small dish as my entree, because I was already half way full! I got an order of sea bass with a red sauce (large dish), and it was good. I like the flavors, and it wasn't fishy!! But I realized that I'm not a huge fan of steamed sea bass because the fish meat was kind of tough. They also have a great selection of other delicious dishes! My date had some steamed mozzarella balls-I forgot the name of it!! But it was under the small dishes, and he LOVED it! He loves lightly fragrant (not smelly) cheeses! The texture of the cheeses was very smooth, and he described it as if the moment he took a bite of the cheeses, it'd slowly melt onto his tongue! IT WAS A LOVELY DINING EXPERIENCE!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tried this with friends based on the good reviews. Maybe I didn't order the right thing...but I got the ""kitchen sink"" breakfast and it was awful, one of the worst meals I've eaten in the past many months (based on my food, I would have given one star or less, but my friends' sandwiches were at least decent and that moved it up to 2 stars). In short, my meal was a giant skillet of greasy slop. Despite my efforts digging around in the trough, I could not distinguish one ingredient from another because the underlying eggs/potatoes/ peppers were drowning in a vat of bland sausage gravy, melted cheese and grease puddles, topped with a tough biscuit half. (Maybe I am spoiled by just moving from the South, but biscuits should be fluffy and flaky and sausage gravy is creamy and rich with well-seasoned sausage.) It truly was nauseating. Would absolutely not recommend based on my meal, although based on the number of patrons, there must be some redeeming quality to the place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Not that this place needs another review, but here goes: First of all the place is tiny. Could only get a reservation for 5:30 but the tables are small and seating is cramped. Still it is intimate and cozy. Service was great, waitresses were all adorable. Had the goat cheese tart which was DELICIOUS. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the vegetarian platter option for my entree. Wasn't super impressed with it, especially for how much it was. Also, all the food comes with a side dish of 4 different vegetables, so I had my plate of veggies and then 2 other plates of side veggies from everyone else (we were a party of four) and most of the side dishes were already on my plate. Do you see what I'm saying here? I just wish they would have been a bit more creative. Or I almost wished they had used more butter as none of the vegetables were that exciting. Cold beets. Some eggplant. Green beans. Pile of rice. Some of it was delicious but for being the only non-meat entree option on the menu, don't you think they could have put a bit more effort into it and differentiated from the sides? Just a thought. Everyone else's food was great though and they were satisfied. Dessert was good, had the cream puffs, profiteroles, and the apple tartine thing which was the only disappointing one - it's literally just a bunch of soft apples on top of a crust. They light it on fire and it wasn't working so our waitress doused it with rum so by the time we ate it, it just tasted like....burnt rum. The point is, it was overall great and a charming little spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Stopped by here today, FINALLY. I've been craving sorbetto for a while now and Eataly definitely satisfied me. First off, this place is very crowded so don't come if you're starving or in a hurry. The gelato/sorbetto line is by far the longest. There aren't that many flavors to choose from but let me tell you, what they have is good. I got the lemon and raspberry sorbetto. The lemon was very light--perfect. The raspberry was a bit thick I think and melted too fast, but still appetizing. My friend got the coffee and mint chocolate chip gelato--amazing. The coffee gelato was very strong and flavorful. I also got a taster of the banana chocolate chip sorbetto, surprisingly wonderful! For the price I say it's definitely worth it. Much better than Grom in both taste and price. The waffle cones are a bit cheaper because there is a little less gelato/sorbetto in them, so stick to the cups if you're a huge fan and don't be afraid to ask for tasters! The servers were very friendly. Also, their hot chocolate is literally just hot, melted chocolate. Extremely rich and thick. I'd recommend getting a small because it's so creamy and filling.","[1.0, 0.0]"

She is everything I want in a restaurant experience from her old world charm so lush I feel as if I am traveling over seas to her exceptional wine list and menu offerings.  Rare is it that a place not only has terrific lunch and dinner, but dessert is perfect too.   It's difficult for me to pinpoint a favorite dish, but since I am a fan of eggs it would be hard to neglect mentioning the scrumptious Green Eggs and Lamb (fluffy scrambled with cilantro, onions and tomatoes complete with juicy potatoes, salad, pita and the perfect size lamb sausage).  That or the Savory Parmesan French Toast with poached egg, peas and sprouts?  I just cannot decide.   For dinner it has to be a few delicious tapas like the sausage stuffed olives or baquerones.  But seriously, BRAKE for the oysters.  THEY ARE SOME OF THE  BEST IN TOWN.  And there's nothing quite like sipping a sparkling Cava while sitting beneath a palm tree awaiting that Lamb Sausage Sandwich or whole fish entree.   If you ask nicely, you might even get a couple more of those complimentary chocolates that come with the check.  (but i suggest having the caramel affogato first.  With a port, of course.)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here for brunch with three friends, and while we really enjoyed the outdoor seating and the cheap and yummy mimosas ($6 with three refills?? What?!?), the food and service could have been much better. The food itself was fine but none of us got hot food. My potatoes were cold (though spiced nicely, so they would have been great if warm), the salad had some dead leaves, I got meat when I asked for no meat, and I got the wrong kind of bread. Also, no refills on coffee is madness, but the coffee itself tasted fine. Lastly, my portion was tiny and I was still hungry after the meal.

"This could be the best restaurant in the west village. My girlfriend and I have been unable to get in here because it is packed every sunday night.  We finally made a reservation and it was definitely worth the wait. The place is very cute and straightforward.  It is a family owned and operated joint that you can get some excellent red-sauce style Italian dishes.  The garlic bread was superb, hot and fresh.  The mozzarella was way better than in most places in the area.  As far as mains we got: fettuccine bolognese, chicken parmigiana, linguini with olive oil and garlic, and shrimp fra diavolo.  We were only four people but we literally devoured everything and even had to ask for a second helping of linguini.  This was not because the dishes were small by any means.  Everything was so good we had to try dessert. Had a cannoli and chocolate cake and it was worth feeling absolutely stuffed and having to unbutton my pants. Also - this place gets extra points because it was someone's birthday and they hit the lights and played a birthday song.  The whole place was into it and clapping.  That might not be your cup of tea but we really had fun.   Don't sleep!","[0.0, 1.0]"
They just don't seem to up to their past standard.  I have tried them three time recently and have been disappointed each time.  I usually order three pies at a time or more and each of them has been below their past standard.  The pies have been soggy and not very tasteful.  One of the best thing in the past was the sauce now its can not even be tasted on the pie.  Maybe I'm just going on bad nights but the pizza I've had does not live up to what it was in the past.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"As good as it gets in Park Slope.  Place is quite large with a back area + outdoor seating. It still had a casual, homey feel to it. Modern & simple. We had a 30mn wait as we had arrived  during prime brunching time. I didn't like how people waiting inside had to stand right next to those who were dining..uncomfortable for both parties. Chose to wait outside, since they took down our #.   Once seated, had the passion fruit which tasted like more like champagne than a fruit cocktail. Still good and better than the cranberry cocktail they offered. Had  a hard time deciding what to eat (sign of a great selection from a place). Settled with the short rib and eggs while S.O. had the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were awesome.I must say, they make their eggs really well. Didn't see the appeal of paying extra for the side biscuit, which tasted pretty regular. Service was attentive, though you could tell they were extra busy, just breezing through us. Prices are higher than your typical brunch menu. No unlimited mimosa here, but the food is so worth it. Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. I anticipate coming back for dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The ambiance at Pepe Giallo is reminiscent of something you would stumble across tucked away off the beaten path in a Tuscan village. It is a phenomenal neighborhood Italian restaurant equally off the beaten path on 10th Avenue. The fare is simple and savory. The prices are extremely reasonable (borderline cheap by NYC standards). The wait staff is extremely attentive and friendly. We arrived at about 8pm on a Tuesday and they allowed us to linger and enjoy our meal until 11pm, even though it was past closing. We started with the Pear, Arugula, Gorgonzola Cheese & Walnut salad and then dove into the entrees. I had the Fettuccine with chicken & mushrooms in cream sauce which could easily have been for two. Others at the table had the Papardelle and Branzino. The Branzino in particular was delicious. Finally, we capped this off with a traditional Tiramisu which lasted all of about 30 seconds on the table as it was so good. Paired with a big fruity Pinot Noir, it really was overall one of the better meals I've had in a while. I highly recommend Pepe for a date. Start with a drink at Pastis or the Standard Biergarten in Meatpacking then cruise the Highline's newest section up to 25th street and finish with dinner here. You won't forget it and neither will your date!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Dough is simplyAWESOME!!!  I have eaten at Dough three times for lunch and once for dinner and I can't stop raving about this place.  The service is great!  The waitstaff are pleasant, helpful and enthusiastic about the restaurant and the food.  I consider myself a pizza connoisseur and this pizza is AWESOME! Most certainly a top 10 in my opinion.  The ingredients are high quality and fresh. I also place great value on the farm to table approach.  But what is most notable about the pizza (my favorite is the margharita), is that it is really light, the crust is ""airy"" and after eating it I don't feel full, heavy or like a glutton.  Imagine eating an individual pizza pie but feeling like you had a small piece of salmon and steamed vegetables.  That has been my experience each time.  Dough has a large table up front that is somewhat separate, which accomodates a large party and gives a bit of privacy.  They also have a separate room that could be used for a private event and a cozy outdoor patio.  I highly recommend this restaurant!!  Check it out!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"When in SOHO we felt we needed to try Minettas tavern.  First time there, we got lucky to be seated in less than 15 minutes at the bar.  The bartender that night was amazing, he ran that place like a cop controlling traffic.  We had the black label burger which totally rocked.  The second time around, I thought I would be smart and make reservations to avoid the wait and sit at a table. We arrived a little early and they told us they were an hour behind and if we wanted we could get a drink at the bar.  The place was standing room only.  So we didn't move.  After waiting about 30-40 minutes we finally were seated.  The tables are so small that it's impossible to hold a lot plates. We decided to order the Côte de Beouf, the plate was huge it barely fit on the table.  The beef was amazing it could feed 4!  It also came with bone marrow (my weakness) but the marrow was topped with this glaze which in my opinion ruined it!  Bone marrow should be served simple with a little sea salt.  Seeing this just ruined my appetite.  Especially for the price.  If we do go again I will ask them specifically to separate the bone marrow and skip the glaze.  Service was amazing.  Will give this place another try when in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I wish I could give this place 3.75 stars.   It's very good but the wait is 1hr (on a slow day)!  Normally, I wouldn't consider wait time in my reviews but it was just too ridiculous, esp for an expensive ramen place.   The broth is very complex and flavorful.  I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic ramen.  I wish I had the slightly thicker noodles my bf had.  He ordered the vegetarian ramen.  However, sometimes I feel when there's so many flavors in the ramen, it can be distracting.  Sometimes simplicity is best especially since we're eating ramen. My friend ordered the ramen with the clear chicken broth and I felt that was extremely flavorful.  For a ""light"" meal, I would definitely recommend that. Next time, I probably would go try a different ramen place.  But, I would recommend the Classic or the one with the chicken broth.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Despite the fact that they are the same, I prefer this Hummus Grill over the other locations. I don't know exactly why - food seems a little better, I like the seating available, and maybe it's because we've gone here more with friends. Regardless, solid, tasty, filling Mediterranean food. The platters are where it's at IMHO; lots of protein choices (including salmon! and lamb!), choice of three salads/veggies with fries or rice, and it comes with pita. Meats are cooked well (although once the salmon was overcooked and I was quite disappointed), especially the shawarma which is always well seasoned, and they have some of the better tasting falafel in the city. Prices aren't too bad given the food quality and amount, and of the places in the area to eat at, it's one of the first choices. Particularly great for lunch or a quick meal before heading to the movies.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend and I wanted to try something new so we checked out Abyssinian Ethiopian Restaurant on Farmington Ave in West Hartford. We encountered delicious new tastes (it was the second time for my friend), a friendly waiter, and beautiful cooked meats in an assortment of sauces and styles. My friend and I didn't have a huge appetite so we shared the meet platter. It ended up being just enough and incredibly tasty.

"I've been to Vietnamese restaurants from coast to coast and this has to be the worst one. I ordered the pho special for take out and the broth was so cold that the oil congealed.

I took the meal back to the restaurant and the lady insisted that this was how Vietnamese noodles were made to go. She was trying to fool me but I'm not stupid. I'm a Southeast Asian-American who grew up among Vietnamese Americans. Apparently, they'll microwave old broth for you if you eat in. Good luck. On the bright side, the bubble tea was good.

"NOT TO FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE OF COLOR!!!!! A co-worker told a couple of people at my job about this place saying how good the food was. Unfortunately this place does not take kind to people of color. Myself and my sister in-law decided to visit and soon as we walked through the door the bartender asked if it was something she could help us with ( in a manner of what are you doing here). I told her we would like to sit down and see a menu. After we sat down she handed us a menu. I asked her if she could make me a fruity drink and she told me ""don't make me think cause I don't feel like thinking"". I was so disappointed by her customer service as well as her bluntly disrespect. We decided to just leave. The next day I went to work explaining to my coworker the vibe and service we received and another coworker stated how she received the same type of service and vibe as well.. They were also people of color and stated they made reservations however they still waited an hour to be seated and another couple who was not black came in after them and the bartender lady went and sat them first. When my coworker asked the bartender weren't they there first? The bartender said yeah you were here first and what does that mean. My coworker stated the man she was with said ok does it have something to do with our color and the bartender stated ""not to go there with her"". Do to the fact these were two separate incidents I don't think it was a coincidence that we both got the same vibe and crappy service.

"I have been so sad since the Zibetto downtown closed. Although Da Capo is in a different neighborhood, I will be making the trip up here for sure! The cappuccino is perfection, the pastries - fresh,  the atmosphere - European. There is a nice espresso bar to cozy up to Ruth Italian music playing softly In The background. As opposed to Zibetto, this place actually has stools to sit on up front and  there will be some seating out back in the solarium. Based on the fact that they have applied for their liquor license,  I would categorize this place as a bit more of a future wine bar and light fare than pure espresso bar. As a vegetarian I can't comment on the sandwiches other than to say the patrons consuming them seemed to be enjoying. Would it sound terribly cliche to say that while sipping my cappuccino I felt transported back to my last trip to Italy? Probably. But true nonetheless. It doesn't hurt that the staff is cute as well ;) I would say that if you are looking for a break from the new wave of pretentious hipster cafés with the requisite knit hatted, inked baristas and want a more authentic Italian experience, stop in hete.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bridget Foy's has the feel of a neighborhood bar even though it's on prime South Street real estate. If you find yourself on South for a show at the TLA, I'd recommend stopping in for a drink and some appetizers. I was really impressed with their duck tacos, they were very flavorful. They also have great fried calamari (jalapenos thrown into the mix, great touch) and very strong wings. I haven't been there for happy hour in a while, but I believe the appetizers are half off and there's some decent beer specials. Based on its location alone, Foy's could really just phone it in with mediocre food, but they elevate bar food a step beyond and have friendly service and a nice atmosphere (a nice refuge from all the kiddies outside). Most of the time, it's not too crowded and you're quite likely to find room at the bar in the summer while people crowd the outdoor tables.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Good, not great. If you're wondering if the hour+ wait is worth it, it's not. I don't fully understand all the 5 star ratings. I'm almost certain it's one of those situations where people feel a need to be part of the trend, so they rate high to match others. The food is as good as you'd expect southern comfort food to be. It's not earth shattering. The equation of fat+salty meats and sauce will always equal tasty. If you've ever been to Cracker Barrel, this place will be very familiar food-wise. The best thing I had was the bourbon based honey julep drink. At $12 it cost about the same price as a meal, but that's pretty standard for NYC, but also brings up another negative. $13-14 for a meal at this place is actually a bit on the high side. There are some other spectacular options near by so I'd probably only eat here again if I could make a reservation.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I have no complaints about the service, but the food aside from the pizza is bland and definitely NOT worth the price.  We split a pizza which being her first time there she was very pleased with.  For our main course we ordered the ribeye to split as we normally do in restaurants because portions are always a bit too large for one and leftovers never taste as good as when it's freshly cooked.  Well, they charged us $35.00 each to split a steak that we only ate half of our half portions anyway (the other half was pure fat).  After complaining to the server about this they said ""sorry that's the way it is"".  I didn't make too big a stink as my sister and I had a few glasses of wine and it would be inappropriate to fuss but WARNING the entire menu is over priced for the mediocre food that is being served and if you do have to go there I say stick with the pizza.  Being in the business and at a time when you would love to have as many return customers as possible that was BAD business practice!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Unfortunately, that's not what my party did. The food was overpriced and not especially edible. I ordered the chicken gyro--the pita bread was so dry it crumbled apart when I tried to pick the gyro up, and the chicken was dry, overcooked, and tasteless. I sent it back and ordered the truffle mac & cheese instead, which was good but overpriced. My friend got a side of sweet potato fries, and instead of being sliced to the expected size of french fries, they looked like the chef had haphazardly quartered a whole sweet potato and dropped the chunks into batter--the entire side order consisted of 4-5 fries, and they didn't taste good. The service was slow, and I had to argue with the waitress and a manager who wanted me to pay for the gyro (which I sent back) and the mac & cheese, even though the waitress had offered to replace the gyro without extra charge, as it was so poorly cooked.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Northern Spy Food Co. is as good as it gets when it comes to a neighborhood staple. Luckily for me, I live two blocks away. While they don't have a full bar (beer/wine only) they always come up with delicious and innovative cocktails highlighting different aperitifs. You've all heard about the kale salad, and it really is that good -- try it with two poached eggs for an even bigger delight. But the rest of the menu is worth checking out, too. Exceptional vegetarian dishes alongside hearty meat plates really offer something for everyone. Do not miss the pork sticky buns -- something you never knew you wanted, but won't stop thinking about for a few weeks after you try them. The room itself is cute, but small. If you're over 6'2"" you'll probably have trouble sitting in the two back booths. My 6'4"" boyfriend couldn't fit in the tight space, and the staff didn't seem terribly pleased about re-seating us, but since there were tables open, they did (with a time limit). Other than that instance, I find the service to be very pleasant. I will definitely be back -- and soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Super cute homey-yet-modern decor, servers that are cute as a button, and a build-your-own-bloody-mary order form? I like it! But the food was just ok. Huevos rancheros had soft tortillas and the much touted ""monkey bread"" was small and unexciting for a whopping $8. Tots come with everything. I get that Jones is aa comfort food spot, but I think homemade homefries are hella comforting. Tater tots come from a freezer bag, people. Ain't nothin' comforting about that.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've had my eye on this place for a while, and it definitely didn't disappoint. A friend and I walked in around 6:45 on a Tuesday night and we were seated immediately. Cornichons and fresh bread (brioche!) were great, and I opted to try one of the specials: fried chicken with green and yellow beans and a tomato cucumber salad. The chicken was tender, crispy, salty... perfect. Service was attentive and friendlier than I was expecting. Least expensive bottle of red was about $35, which seemed a bit high, but it was definitely a quality bottle. I can't wait to go back, since everything on the menu sounded amazing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Upon one of my solo-outings a rare misfortune saw to it that my card was dropped behind the POS during checkout. They were so nice that they accommodated and comped a lot off my bill with a date from work (don't judge me!). I was expecting just an app comp but no, so much more!

"Good, and not particularly overpriced for the area * quality of food.   4.5 stars... Been here a couple of times for dinner and once for lunch... The olive oil with bread basket freebie is usually stellar, though there was one time when I was not pleased with the oil. On the recent trips, once I had the Penne all' Arrabbiata (w/ chicken), one of my all-time favorite pasta dishes. It is a fairly simple dish, but both the chicken and the pasta were so perfectly cooked I would be amazed if the chef can pull that off every time.  The sauce is very tasty and deliciously spicy.  I was going to opt for meatless, but the server informed me they use organic chicken meat hence I opted in. At the same caliber was their eggplant rollatini appetizer (of the day), with out of this world taste... I also recommend their uovo (egg) pizza, which if I remember correctly was a tomato-less spinach and cheese pizza with black truffle and an egg cracked in the middle (after cooking).  Quite interesting and very delicious. They do have some mediocre items - I did not find their flatbread panini di verdura (vegetarian) as tasty as it sounded.  Reminded me of another bad panini I had in Mediterra (from the same owner)... They do change up their items quite a bit, which is why it is fun to come to this restaurant at least every season or two.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've always loved Jamaican food, especially jerk chicken. But ever since taking a trip to Jamaica last year and tasting some of the best jerk chicken I've had in my life (3 Dives in Negril & Scotchies in Ocho Rios) , I've had a bit of an obsession with finding something that compares here in NY. This place definitely comes close, but not quite. It might just be the particular way they grill the chicken in Jamaica-- which is over a charcoal grill and using pimento wood, and lots of smoke! Not sure if they use gas since I didn't see how they cooked the food. Def, a hole in the wall. They didn't have the any shrimp or lamb dishes, so we ordered the curried vegetables and jerk chicken. Chicken was very tender, the seasoning and spiciness was just right but was too moist for me. Curried vegetables were delicious. Would like to go back and try a shrimp or fish dish. Better to take out and just eat in the park on a nice day.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner here back in September when they had their soft opening. The ambiance is amazing, definitely not your traditional Indian restaurant.

I even tried (and liked!) the octopus. The general manager and owner were both extremely nice and accommodating. Can't wait to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I am still wondering if the 2 hour wait was worth it.  The great thing about the wait is that they will text you just before you need to be there.  Other Ramen places do not do you the courtesy.   The pork buns are a must.  They melt in your mouth. I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with a poached egg.  It was a perfect light spring ramen.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Friendly service, nice ambiance and delicious margaritas! Came here with a couple of friends on a Thursday evening and we were able to score a table right by the front window open to the sidewalk. As soon as we entered, we were greeted nicely by the host and seated to our table even though the third person in our party was a bit delayed. So thankful for that considering most places in NYC will not seat you without your entire party present. We started off with some house happy hour margaritas and they were delicious. A bit on the smaller side, but packed quite a punch so that was a non-issue. We got the rojo guacamole, which was good, but the chipotle sauce on the side was the real star of the dish. I do wish it was a bit bigger of a portion however. To eat we shared the shrimp quesadilla, lechon tacos and fish tacos. Portions are a bit small all around, and it would have been nice if the tacos could have been served in groups of three since there were three in our party. The shrimp quesadilla was a favorite of the table and I highly recommend this here! Probably the best version of that dish I have had. We even ordered a second quesadilla since it was that good. The lechon and fish tacos were okay, but not sure I would order them again. Would probably try something different next time. Unfortunately the grasshopper tacos were unavailable that night so we weren't able to try them. Great ambiance, they take reservations and I highly recommend for your Mexican fix if you are in the Village! I will be back for sure!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Hidden Demons This place has great food, cool ambiance and a great model for a simple menu- grill everything.  The hour wait for a seat at the bar is unfortunate, but when we finally sat, it was a front row seat for the tiny kitchen, where pros are seen firing the food, and an idea of everything you're seeing on the menu is in front of you.  It's better than the most knowledgeable server, actually seeing the portion sizes, seeing how its all cooked (again, simple, all on a grill), and ordering means knowing what to expect, even if its your first time.   What wasn't so great is sitting in front of the kitchen means seeing stuff that I don't want to know about.  The steak looks like a great idea on the menu (not the Rib Eye for 2, the shell steak), but I can see a par-cooked steak just sitting there for a half an hour before the kitchen gets a ticket for one, and then they quick fire it.  I get it, the wait for seating is already so long, you're finding ways to turn the tables/seats more quickly, but its on display for all to see.  All restaurants do this kind of thing, but seeing it takes away something magical. Also, the pass for food and drink pickup is one foot away from me.  Service staff talks meanly of one another inches from my ears, then I watch the hot food I ordered sitting literally within arms reach, and as I look around for the runner, they do not run it for 3 minutes.  I watched the food plated with haste, but saw no effort to prioritize the follow through to take it to me.  Yum the food is good, but I know it was hotter 3 minutes ago.  Disappointment by my own design, at the end of the day.   All in all, I would say that the wait is to be expected in this neighborhood, especially on busy nights (Fri/Sat), so don't go starving and expect to be in a great mood before the food comes.  Watch the cooks, but not TOO closely, you may see a face scratch, a naked finger touch a steak to check its temperature, a dish sit ""too long"" before being run.  Turn a blind eye to all that and the food is stellar.  As for the meandering morale among staff, that changes nightly and is to be expected, you would just think they'd know not to speak ill within ear shot of guests. Go on an off night, and expect greatness, go hungry on a busy night, and expect to be satiated, but having observed some possibly negative aspects.  When starved, I see the glass half-empty and as such, call it as I see it.  But when I left, I said to myself ""that was good,"" and that's all that matters.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I also ordered a spicy scallop handroll. It was on the expensive side since the scallop was live. And I do mean live -- literally still twitching. It doesn't get more fresh than that.

"BT receives a full 5star review even thought they have gone ""all fancy-smancy"" with waiter service. The self-serve worked just fine for me.  Mark was cool and he resembles the character Lt.Dangle from Reno 911, so I guess it will grow on me.  You do what you have to do to enjoy the bona fide best brisket in all of NYC. Two buddies had never been to BT and one had (with me in 2013). They were utterly floored.  On several occasions this crew has canvased LIC and Astoria for BBQ. BristketTown was the ace up my sleeve.  They could not believe the brisket could be so moist and  tender - but still have the right amount of char on the end and smokiness.  They each enjoyed their side dish, as well as the quality of the pickled accompaniments that came with the platter.  I skipped on the sides -   a slice of potato bread and a cold-one are enough for me.

"I find it easy to carry a bit of skepticism when visiting some places for the first time.  Particularly so, when they are in hip neighborhoods full of people who want to discover the next thing in dining out. First thing I`ll point out is that this location is not very close to the Bedford St. subway stop, its a whole lot closer to the Williamsburg Bridge.  So if you`re in lower Manhattan, you might as well hoof it over the bridge to get here, burn some calories before you fill them right back up. Their entrance is low-key, which I look.  No flashy or off-putting signage.  Upon entering, there is the register to your left, where you place your order.  If you are staying, you can choose one of the booths, not too many, so arrive early. But the most important thing, the food, was very good.  The namesake brisket was nice and tender.  It had a great flavor to it and did great w/o any sauce.  The veggies added a good accompaniment to the meat.  Staff was very friendly in addition.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is new so I will be back to give it a second chance. However, I did want to put my experience out there. The first thing I noticed was how incredibly loud it was.  I got used to it but it is definitely not a good place to go if you want to have a nice talk with someone. The food itself was pretty terrible. I had the market BLT fish sandwich while my friend had the porchetta.  Mine consisted of poorly battered fish, sad lettuce and ONE piece of bacon on a buttered roll.  There was no aioli, or any sauce of any kind.  It did not taste like anything.  Absolutely nothing. My friend didn't fare much better.  We did tell the waitress and she kindly brought us pickled mayonnaise. Unfortunately, it tasted neither of mayonnaise or of pickles. The server did take one sandwich off of the bill which was nice. She did, however, bring our bill with the coaster that said ""If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to drink in a bar. Go to the liquor store."" They need to get rid of these, they are not cute.   The menu doesn't work with the neighborhood in my eyes. It was too pretentious and the prices too high.

"So I was visiting my friends in Burlington and did a quick search on great places for brunch in the area. I came across the Magnolia Bistro. After calling the restaurant we learned that the wait was going to be almost an hour. Whoever answered the phone politely suggested that we send an envoy from our party to put our name on the list so the rest of our party could meet up with us later. Since the place was packed I put in our name and walked outside in the square only to return 30 minutes later with the rest of our party to find that they had already called our table. When we approached the host, he assured us he would call our party next. After waiting a little bit longer, we reminded the host that we were still waiting, only to be told that it was basically our fault for not being there but that we would be seated soon. Since we had received such a rude reception, we did not dare approach him again, but then proceeded to wait another hour while parties of 2, 3, 5, and 7 people that arrived after our party of 4 were seated.  Completely frustrated, I finally went back up to the host and inquired again about our table.  Realizing that he had forgotten about us, he finally sat us next.  We did receive an apology, but nothing else for our trouble. Perhaps after waiting for almost two hours we all were hoping that the food would extinguish the bitterness that had accumulated after our waitlist debacle. No such luck. Despite the fact that our table service was really good, the food was lackluster. The coffee was weak, the omelets were just so so and underseasoned (we had two of the special omelets - one mushroom, one fiddleheads), and the steak portion of the steak and eggs was disappointingly small. The only things that I can say that I thought were stand outs were the blueberry lemon bread and homemade raspberry preserves that were on the table. The magnolia french toast was also pretty good. For the amount of money ($75 for four people after tax and tip), I would have expected better flavor and portions. I'd recommend seeking out one of the other great brunch places in the area and saving your time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The beet salad is a great appetizer -  red and gold beets diced and served with a generous dollop of goat cheese.  The tempura string beans, which are actually offered as a side, also make a good started to share for the table.  Beware of the spicy mustard sauce - I was overzealous and teared up with the first bean I ate. I was really excited to see tres leches on the menu, but disappointed when it arrived.  It's slightly spicy, which is not the way tres leches should taste.  Also, it wasn't nearly moist enough - that sucker should be drenched in milk.  But the apple currant crisp was good and distracted me from my tres leches sorrow.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Complete Disappointment. We visited Greek Taverna on a Saturday night - there was no wait. The wait and hostess seemed distracted to guests arriving (because the staff were rearranging tables). We were seated outside. The waitress arrived and was very pleasant. After taking our order it took over 15 minutes to be served bread and water. When our appetizer arrived we had to return it because they made a mistake. At this point we were there for about a half hour. The waitress finally circled back and offered nothing but several excuses as to the mistake. She mostly blamed the kitchen staff and the increase in guests arrival. Notwithstanding the initial bad experience, we overlooked the slow start, the error in our food order, and in fact enjoyed our appetizer, when it finally arrived. After finishing our appetizer, dinner arrived about 45 minutes later and the temperature of the food was cold. The management staff appears unengaged to customers and the place lacks managerial control of it's staff. We returned our dinners and asked for the check. The hostess finally came over (who appeared to be a college student who did not convey an understanding of the business, the problem and only offered more excuses as to the extreme delay).  We paid for the appetizer and took a walk (at 9:30pm)  to to a local Thai Restaurant which was great. We were very disappointed in that we have visited this restaurant in the past and the experiences have been relatively good.

"The Beam Cream, Creamsicle, and Sportsman totally rule - try all three. Especially on your first visit. Cheese puffs and Twizzlers galore always waiting on the bar.

"Food is excellent! Spanakopita is the best I have ever tried: filled with creamy spinach and feta. Octopus is spectacular, very tender and  delicious. All fish is fresh. You can check it over the counter in front of the kitchen. All appetizers taramasalata, tzatziki and so are very good. Prices are regular, a fish is under $20 and appetizers are about $6 to $8. I have been to Greece for over ten years and I know what and how they eat. This restaurant is authentic. Another very positive aspect is the open kitchen. You can see the people cooking and everything looks clean and well organized. I hate restaurants that smell and this one doesn't, unless you eat at the bar, which I did the second time, and my clothes were a bit stinky but nothing significant. Portions are big and fulfilling. It is a bit noisy but who cares.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was going to give ABC Kitchen five stars, but I dropped my rating to four.  I'll explain below. Ok, so I love the decor here.  I probably said that 17 times during lunch here last week.  Think Shabby Chic meets Anthropologie meets Catbird in Brooklyn.  I must have said ""this is what I want my 'adult house' to look like"" about 11 times.  I repeat myself a lot when I like stuff. Now, to the food.  Wow, the prix fixe lunch is a great value--$28 for three full courses, and not just a salad and a sad bowl of pasta followed by a cookie.  I'm talking delicious Sullivan Street toast topped with homemade mustard butter and local baby radishes.  Sounded weird, but trust me, it was delicious and so different.  Next, for the main, I had a great tuna burger with heirloom tomatoes, ramp and a delicious, rich man's style-Russian dressing, along with herbed frites.  The tuna burger was so fresh and flavorful, and the right balance of cooked and underdone in the middle.  If I could have this tuna burger whenever I wanted, I could be converted from a cheeseburger.  No promises, though.  Next, the salted caramel and peanut sundae.  Wow.  The ice cream made me a believer in salted caramel ice cream--the right balance of sweet, salty and burnt (sugar, that is).  Who knew ice cream could be so complex in flavor?   My friend had the parmesan, egg and wild mushroom pizza.  It tasted so earthy (without being dank and overly mushroom-y) and creamy, with the baked egg forming a lovely, creamy sauce with the parmesan.  My friend has dietary restrictions, so she was very clear that she could only eat parmesan (no mozzarella, etc.); the waitress assured us the pizza contained only parmesan.  When the first pizza came out, my friend could see that the pizza had mozzarella (we lated found out it was fontina, neither of which she can have).  The kitchen replaced the pizza immediately with a pie sans offending cheese, but with dietary restrictions a common occurrence today in the culinary world, and with my friend being explicit about her needs, the slip up really shouldn't have happened.   Still, this place was fantastic and I can't wait to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Excellent atmosphere. The server was really sweet and friendly and seriously insanely delicious shrimp and grits with well poached egg. And their signature fried chicken and waffles was spot on amazing. Crispy batter and moist chicken. The waffles were well prepared and the choice of three flavored butters (blueberry, Rosemary and lemon honey were all incredible) and also nice to get real maple syrup with it. Overall could not rave enough and can't wait to go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I must say, I do not give many 5s but for the best crepe I have had well-ever-I cannot give them anything less.  That said, cash only always drops a star! We loved this place so much we went 2 mornings in a row.  The first day we ordered a crepe to share, and had croque madames for brunch.  The croques were excellent, and did not have bechamel in them, which the correct way to prepare them.  That said, the crepe stole the show and we decided to come back the next day for savory crepes, and we were so glad we did.   My goat cheese, fig and rosemary crepe was a revelation, while Maha's merguez sausage looked excellent.  Mom's goat cheese and veggies was equally exciting.  We ordered the tatin crepe for dessert, but I have to say after the savory crepes nothing really measures up. Definitely come here, come early as it fills up fast, and order the crepes.  You wont regret it. Make sure to bring cash!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I've been there every week and am looking forward to our next visit with eager anticipation.

"Finally, a Filipino restaurant better than your home cooking! Maharlika adds a sophisticated touch to traditional Filipino dishes. I took my coworkers here for a team dinner and they loved the entire experience - the cultural touch, dishes they've never tried, and the amazing 90s R&B/slow jams playlist. Their favorite part was the calamansi soy sauce! Must have dishes: UBE WAFFLE (best waffle I've ever had), Adobo and kare kare. I took off one star because of the relatively high prices. All the entrees are 20+! C'mon now... It's a cramped casual dining experience...where is my money going?! Also, no HALO HALO?! That's actually the sole reason I took my team here. A bit embarrassing when I say, ""The moment we've all been waiting for...what? you don't have it...oh...fail."" I wouldn't say Maharlika is a regular spot to hit up ($$), but I highly recommend it as a must-visit restaurant for Filipinos and Filipino-lovers.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This Cantonese gem of Chinatown was once one of New York's best kept secrets. But being the Mecca of Chinese restaurants for self-proclaimed Foodies, government elite, glitzy celebrities, and snooty locals alike, the wonders of the Great NY Noodle Town have become widely known. Unfortunately, this means you will typically have to wait in line. But no worries, the queue moves quickly and it is certainly worth the wait. It is also important to note that this is real Chinese food... some dishes are even better than those I've had in Vancouver or even China for that matter. They do not serve Mongolian Beef or Kung Pao Chicken, so spare yourself the embarrassment and don't ask... Regardless of the temperature or the season, get a piping hot bowl of roast pork wonton soup. The handmade wontons are tenderly stuffed with plump shrimp and perfectly complimented with a hint of ginger. The broth is rich and flavorful with a taste that is evident of hours of work and decades of experience. The bowl is crowned with a generous portion of decadently succulent char sui that is, of course, expertly roasted in house and chopped to order. The vegetable dishes are next: sautéed pea shoots with garlic, steamed Chinese broccoli stems and leaves with pungent oyster sauce, and Chinese eggplant in a savory garlic sauce. I cannot possibly explain the flavors occurring in these oriental treats other than to say that you will never be able to eat a humble vegetable in your life without going back in time and savoring this moment.  The salt-baked shrimp, squid, and soft-shell crab (seasonal) are other must-haves. All of NY Noodle Town's salt-bakes are flawlessly fried and served with thinly sliced chilies. The heat from the peppers melds with the saltiness of the fish to provide a deep-fried experience so rich and rewarding. Next comes the Ginger and Scallion Lobster. Just as a side note, it's dirty and cramped, but that just makes you feel like you're in China...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Alta... Don't ask, just go. Everything here is stellar. I've been coming for more than seven years and I have never been disappointed. The warm ambiance makes it a perfect date spot or a good place to catch up with friends. The menu is long, the dishes varied, and one of the many reasons Alta is perfect is that everyone can order as much or as little as they want. As a rule of thumb, I suggest going for ~2-4 dishes per person if you're going for  dinner. The staff is also good about letting you start with a few things and ordering more as you go. A few of the best dishes IMHO are: -Fried Brussel Sprouts - Crunchy, warm, and vaguely healthy? I'm sold. -Bacon Wrapped Dates - So good we ordered a second round -Pepperonicci pasta - Rich and flavorful. -Fried Goat Cheese - 4 pcs, served with lavender honey - delish. -Grilled shrimp and Chorizo skewer - Only 1 skewer, but you won't regret it. -Pulled pork empanadas - 2 of the best empanadas ever, served with mint sauce I'd skip over the 'plainer' things here (namely the nuts, Philadelphia Truffle Surprise and the Spanish Olives) in favor of the more innovative things on the menu. And... don't forget the booze! Their cocktail menu is full of stiff, savory drinks. If you're looking for something fruity or girly, reach for the sangria (red or white - and they are STRONG in a good way!). There's also a great selection of Riojas. Know before you go: -Smaller groups are better - it's a restaurant inside a townhouse -Try to sit on the first or second floor. There is a third floor that is equally pretty but after 2 glasses of Sangria you will not want to walk down all those stairs :) -If you make a reservation, they will call you the day of to confirm. They sound pretty strict about making sure you pick up or re-confirm. -Cash or AMEX only!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with my family and a friend to celebrate my birthday.  I had high hopes based on the low prices (dad-friendly) and the fact that they served sushi as well as other asian fusion food (once again dad-friendly.  I mainly picked my own birthday restaurant based on where I could find a place that my dad could tolerate.) While the prices were good and most of the food was good, I found the sushi extremely underwhelming and most of it did not taste as fresh as it could be.  Huge let-down.  The special rolls had flavors that didn't seem to mesh well and the basic rolls had very little fish in them and too much rice. Overall, I'd recommend the restaurant since it has a nice atmosphere, good service, and affordable prices.  However, I'd only recommend it if you're ordering from the kitchen.  Get sushi elsewhere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The shiro was smoky and rich, the tikile gomen was spiced with (turmeric?), and the green beans and carrots were sweet. The cabbage in the tikile gomen was deliciously tender and flavorful, soaking up the spices, however the potatoes seemed to be mushed. (I'm not sure if the potatoes were meant to be that way.) The food was very fresh , and all of the aromas and complex flavors made us slow down, reflect, savor and share the experience.The injera was beautifully light and fluffy, and when holding it you can feel the love and care that was used in making it.

"I went here for brunch and was not impressed. Since I had dietary restrictions (not for allergies), I got the lox scramble without the cream cheese. The menu said it came with a side salad and mashed potatoes. My plate came with no mashed potatoes. I was told they omitted them for me without asking because they made it with dairy. I can have some dairy, however, it was the fact I was not asked if I wanted a substitution. I asked for a substitution after the fact and he listed off my options. I went with the sweet potato fries, and although they were good, they were an add on of $4.50. I was quite upset I was not told this, or given a menu when it was time for me to pick my substitution to see the up charges. When I asked about this miscommunication, there was no remorse for me and I was given a grimy New York grin by who seemed to be the manager. About the place: It is super small. Not my cup of tea. The waiters have to pull out the tables from the wall for you to get out from your booth seat. The restaurant should be called Cramped. The food. Other than omitting things from your plate, they will not add things into it. I wanted to make my own scramble, but supposedly everything was ""set"". My food was cold in some places and warm in others (in my scramble). They heated it up in the microwave for 30 seconds, but it was quite the temperature confusion in my mouth when it first came out. The staff: There were only 3 people working. One person being the cook and 2 people on the floor. When we asked for water, one of them was standing 2 feet away on his iphone, and after trying to ask a couple times without him answering, we just waited for the other guy to come around. The price was decent for the area, $9 for a scramble, however, with the $4.50 up charge, I left paying more than what was expected for the meal that I received. All in all, I will not be returning. There are many places to brunch in the city, and this was only a one stop shop for me for sure.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love Sushi Yasuda. As everyone will tell you, the sushi is the absolute best in New York. And up until yesterday it would have kept the five stars it had in my heart were it not for their arrogance and sloppiness. First, the arrogance. Sushi Yasuda has always been a bit *particular* about reservations, ordering, time alloted to eat, etc. I was happy to play along because it was a bit like the ""Soup Nazi"" from Seinfeld and the food was worth it. But when I arrived yesterday they changed my reservation from the bar to a table and insisted that I had told them to do so (I didn't). After trying to discuss it with them, they basically said you can take the table or leave. If i didn't already know how good the food was, I probably would have left, but I took the table. Although it was their fault, they refused to admit their mistake and absolutely refused to offer any kind of accommodation. Sushi Yasuda is good and they know it, but it's made them so arrogant that they do not care how their customers are treated. Second, the sloppiness. The rice is still worthy of the Yasuda name, but the rolls I ordered were not prepared properly: misshapen and falling apart. This would not have been acceptable if Yasuda-san were still in charge and combined with my complaint above it seems obvious that the restaurant has lost its touch. I hope they get back to the level of quality and precision (both in taking reservations and preparing the food) that made the place exceptional when Yasuda-san was still behind the bar.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Another great pizza place in Manhattan.  There's so many!!  But at this place, the pizzas are square, grandma style which makes for a different, fun pizza experience.  We had two old fashioned pies for 5 guys for dinner with each person consuming 3-4 slices.  There was nothing left at the end!!  We ordered one with sausage, pepperoni and peppers, and one with cheese & mushrooms.  Both excellent!  There are other dishes on the menu but we came for the pizza!   The pizzas came out fast and tasted great.  The ingredients were very fresh and piled on.  The crust was crispy and thinner for a grandma slice which was nice.  The sauce tasty.  Nothing cheap or tasteless here.  There's also a wide variety of other toppings for pies as well as a personal size if everyone wants their own.  Full bar and a decent wine list is available also.  The service was fast and attentive.  There seemed to be an army of delivery people taking pizzas out the door so they must have a good delivery business.   Some of the pizza slices were not cut very well which turned into a chore to separate the slices with the dull, cake knife they supplied.  The place is tight in some areas but with a nice and trendy look though inside.  Overall, this place is worth the visit and we found the pizza top notch.  The restaurant is located on Stone St., in the Financial District, which is a cool area to hang out after work especially in the summer.  I'll definitely be back to Adrienne's in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This little piggy ate a pig.  A sisig pig.  I brought my LA friend here without knowing she doesn't eat much pig.  And then I force fed her some pig head.  For any people with friends who are unwilling to try new types of foods, exotic and foreign to them, just don't tell them what they're eating.  They won't be able to tell what it is when it arrives anyway.  Just scoop some onto their plate and let their minds be blown.  Don't do this if they follow any religions which restrict their diets.  They will be really angry with you.  And might 'Pork Slap' you. In fact, try the tasting menu- it's about $35/pp and you get 5 or 6 dishes served.  You won't know in advance what you'll get, but you can request a couple of must-haves to be included and they will cater to you.  What's good is that you will also be getting items not served on the regular menu. No risk, no reward.  But we did get two dishes that I wasn't particularly fond of; one was the halo-halo(one ingredient had a meaty taste and texture) and the other was the mango/papaya salad(bit too tart) that came with chicken. As for the coconut rice everyone raved about, it was THAT good and then some.  We added another order of it even though the seams on our pants were ripping.  It can be eaten as is, and since most of the items at P&K were fried, it helped to balance out our palettes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went to school in VT, like to visit when I can, and have had the opportunity to pass through Burlington twice in the last month.  Ate at Farmhouse both times after reading the reviews on Yelp.  Wasn't disappointed on either visit.  The culinary scene in Burlington and VT as a whole is very good and it can be hard to say that among the best, one place really stands out.  I thought the food at Farmhouse was excellent, the atmosphere, especially the pub area downstairs is warm and inviting, and the beer selection is stellar.  Yes, the prices are a little on the hefty side, but I think for farm-to-table, it is somewhat reasonable.   I'm sure you can get similar quality food for a little less, but when taking all aspects of the restaurant into account, I was ok with the prices.   Everything from the appetizers, to the mains, and desserts were excellent.  I had the lamb burger on one visit and the pork burger on the second.  My wife loved the vege burger so much, she had it both times.  Onion rings are awsome, but wish they gave a little more in an order. It can be very difficult to get a table, especially on Fri and Sat. evenings, but the wait is a perfect time to get acquainted with the beer selection in the downstairs area with the fireplace.   I cannot get over the sweet irony of the fact the space used to be a McDonalds.....

"Ippudo, you were worth the wait. On my last day in NYC, my friends and I were searching for a ramen place. One of my friends had originally been to Ippudo, loved it, so we searched for it and found it. Yes, there was an 1.5 hour wait...but you can definitely just put your name in, walk to soho quickly, then walk back...and it'll be just the right amount of time. Love the decor of this place. Round areas of tables in a kind of woody/tree feelings restaurant, plus a back wall of glass partitioned booths along a wall full of japanese characters written in a silver color, makes this place a pretty unique modern place to eat. Yes, a tad awkward to be sitting at the round tables (you face some other party of people you have no idea who they are), this place is definitely a neat place to go for lunch. To start off, we got the pork belly buns. Oh my, they were good. Yes, a tad too much mayo- had they just scraped off a tiny bit so that when you actually squeezed the bun....you didn't have mayo coming out it? then it would have been better, but still, pretty good. I got the karaka ramen. There was some pork belly in it....kind of wish there was more. Plus...it wasn't that spicy? Still, overall, pretty solid, and the broth was indeed, good. My friends got the classic and they liked it as well. I think overall, I wish the ramen was a tad more softer? I've had better Japanese ramen in LA, but I mean, for NYC, this ramen place was pretty good. I wish the ramen was a tad softer just for my preferences. The bathrooms... are awkward. I did not like looking at myself in the mirror when using the bathroom. haha. Nonetheless, absolutely LOVED the decor of the place and the ramen is pretty good. Definitely a fun stop for lunch..","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of my very favorite places in NYC. No, it's no secret, but every time I go it's a blast and the food is excellent. Freshest draft beer in the city--makes the beer vs. sake decision very difficult every time! I prefer to sit at the counter for quicker service and the ability to order a couple dishes at a time. (but hey, after an hour and a half's wait, I'll take a table too!) Daikon salad with dried baby sardines, fried chicken gizzards, pork belly skewers, chicken skin skewers, uni and sashimi specials!, grilled mackerel, ice cream with red bean pancake... dang, I want to go there right now! And it's far cheaper than a trip to Japan. If two of us go all-out and get every damn thing we want and drink to our livers' content, we're still only out around 100 bucks. The only cons I can think of: the wait can be ridiculously long, and they do often run out of menu items, causing me to cry inside.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I have been to blend on the water several times and I must say that each time has been an amazing experience!! I usually like to arrive early to my reservations to visit the bar and have some drinks by your amazing bartender John!! He is very welcoming and makes sure his guests are having a great time! One of the many reasons why I enjoy going to blend is to have John mix up drinks for me and my friends for some good laughs and fun. All of the waiters and waitresses have enthusiastic energy and keep the fun going once we're seated!,"[0.0, 1.0]"
Went there on Friday night and it was very fun & the food was awesome (try the octopus app as well as tomato buratta salad). We all had pizza which was great. They had some very nice bottles of wine for under $30-we had the Primitivo for $25-not bad! The only negative was that it is very loud when the restaurant is full. But other than that I'd give it 4 stars! I'll definitely go back. Oh and the attentive service was a plus also!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here with some friends. a chicken salad was 15$. and my friend steak dish was a couple dollars more. the portions are not huge though, so this isn't the place you go to pig out like a king. But two people can have a great meal for under 40$ as long as they dont order alcohol. The food was amazing. i tried my friend's dishes and everything tasted unique and different. but most importantly it was fresh. The chicken was juicy, the kale salad was crisp, and the steak was perfectly cooked. I honestly couldn't find a fault with the food. This place doesn't bother with complex fancy foods. they make simple + good tasting foods really well. it doesn't get simpler then steak over greens with some sweet potato fritters, or Chicken and kale salad with cheese and anchovies and dressing. the pleasure is in simple food prepared and cooked really well. The head chief knows what he's doing and it seems the owners are committed to getting fresh ingredients and produce. To me 12$ to 20$ for a freshly cooked delicious meal is worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been here many times and also had my bachelor party dinner here with 17 friends. Whether on a date or with a big group if friends, this is hands down my favorite NYC restaurant. Food is refined yet adventurous, atmosphere is stellar and the restaurant is large in a good way. You feel like you're at an event with the buzz in the air. Decor is superb (as it should be being a part of abc carpet) and I love everything about this place. Favorites that I can remember are the suckling pig, black striped bass, and fresh house made doughnuts, crab toast. Mmm. This is my go to recommendation for anybody- local or visiting. You'll get a top notch experience. Also good for any age or almost any setting. It's a wonderful place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Alta, you rock.  Had an amazing dinner here Saturday night with a group of nine (reservation required!), and loved every, single bite. I want seconds of the friend goat cheese (with honey and lavender), bruschetta of spinach & mascarpone (dreamy), crispy brussel sprouts (who knew?!?), and the spicy risotto (a big ol' bowl, please!). My non-veggie friends were drooling over the braised short ribs and the squid ink paella. The drinks were great: the jalapeno margarita was smoky and spicy (!), and the ginger mojitos rocked. The red sangria was nothing to sneeze at, either. I'm adding Alta to my list of repeat-ables.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been going to Rangoon since the mid '90s and it has never, ever disappointed!  It's one of my favorite restaurants of all-time, and I seriously worry about what I will do if the owners ever decide to retire! After what's probably a hundred visits by now, I've settled on my favorite dishes and I love that they never change the menu.  Why mess with perfection?  My favorite dishes are the thousand layer bread with vatana bean dip, summer chicken salad, chili monk fish, and kung pao chicken.  And farluda for dessert is a must!  I call it ""a party in a glass."" :) Rangoon also has a great story behind it of how it was founded by three women friends.  I think that core of friendship is reflected in the ambience, which is warm, inviting, and relaxed.  The decor is pretty but not trendy, which makes it a very comfortable place to just settle in and have a great meal, without worrying about dressing up or being seen.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Although the atmosphere served as the background, while the food being the main character of the show, the servers really complimented the whole experience.

"IT WAS SO GOOD. Absolutely worth every cent. I came on a Tuesday night around 6:50PM and had to wait about 45 minutes. We were seated at the bar; we probably would have had to wait longer if we wanted a table. Despite the long wait, I am still giving this place 5 stars because of how good the food was. For starters, my friend and I shared the homemade tofu with salt. It was truly a one of a kind experience. The three types of salt we had were wasabi salt, citrus salt, and some smoked wood salt. The tofu was enough for two people to enjoy and be satisfied. It cost $6. Then, I ordered the mini salmon rice bowl set ($15). It came with miso soup, steamed egg, some veggies, and 5 pieces of salmon sashimi over a bread of rice. I didn't have high expectations for the main dish because I have been to other Japanese places before that served fish over rice and generally left underwhelmed. Here, the rice tasted so good with the salmon. The texture, the flavor, and the amount was just enough to enjoy with my salmon. I was in heaven. My friend and I then ordered the green tea parfait ($8) -- super unique with the fried soba. Totally worked! I loved the red beans, they just melted in my mouth, and the mocha/other condiments were just enough. The service was good too. We didn't have to wait very long for our food, and since we were seated at the bar, all our needs were met quickly. I would definitely come back, with or without another person.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago - well I shouldn't say stumbled upon. I've walked past it for years, but never took the time to peek in. With a very unassuming storefront, this place doesn't stand out in the crush of South Street. But in any case, I actually took the plunge and walked in, and I wouldn't have thought that I would find an honest-to-goodness Italian restaurant on South Street....but I did. The dining area is small but bouncing with energy, and despite the fact that the place was full both nights I was there, it didn't feel crammed. Last night I was with a group of four and we were seated at a tabled in the back corner. The host was so concerned about our space that he gave us an additional table to ""spread out"". He also took our coats and polled us about the temperature of the dining room, which was a bit warm when we walked in, but was soon fixed. There was even an accordion player to add a bit of ambiance. The food is satisfying and affordable. We ordered the grilled calamari for the table to start and all of our dinners came with a house salad, and of course, a basket of bread. I love grilled calamari, but am often hesitant to order as it can be so easily over cooked, etc. The calamari here was not the best I've ever had, but pretty darn good, and didn't arrive drowning in oil or butter. I had linguini and clams in a white sauce (again, not drowning in sauce), and my dinner companions ordered the veal parm, fettucini alfredo, and the backed rigatoni. We polished off the meal with a cannoli, which had one of the more flavorful shells I've tasted, and a round of coffees. The staff is warm and accommodating without being overbearing, and the aforementioned host stopped by each table in the dining room to check on the diners and their meals. Oh and the best part? Tuesdays and Fridays the restaurant is BYOB!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Let me start by saying that I want to love this place - so bad.   We first came here in September after being intrigued by the creative menu and the very obvious passion that the owners and staff members have for food.  After a promising, but ultimately, somewhat disappointing lunch (I'm skipping my review of this visit because I don't recall the names of the sandwiches we had, but I will say, for the love of God, lay off the sauce on that perfectly-cooked meat), we decided to give MLC a second chance during a Sunday brunch.   I had the biscuits and gravy with the fried eggs, and my girlfriend had the roasted vegetable hash.  Add two Bloody Marys, a beer, and two coffees and our total came to a bit over $50.  Wowzas, this brunch better be magic! The delivery of our drinks was prompt.  Our coffee came out hot (and delicious) as did our Bloody Marys.  The food, however, must have been less-prompt since both our dishes came out at room temperature.  My girlfriend's dish was delicious - the hollandaise was perfect.  The veggies were cooked to perfection.  But, we both agreed that, for the price, the dish was a bit small.  My biscuits and gravy were ROOM TEMPERATURE.  That means after three bites, they were cold.  Fail.  As for the biscuits and gravy flavor - meh.   It was okay.  Definitely not ""legendary."" Dear MLC, We want to love you.  Everyone else seems to.  We enjoy your folksy environment and your flannel shirts.   Honestly, I don't feel like I'm being too picky, but, for Christ's sakes, we did pay over $50 for our brunch, so could you at least make sure it's hot.   Lotsa love, Someone else that is also passionate about food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Very cool looking place in one of my favorite corners in Philly, Headhouse Sq. First thing to notice, is they obviously have a killer tequila list. I chose to sizipp on some Don Julio up, and they delivered it with some tomato/Tabasco palette cleanser thing that was essentially a spicy virgin bloody Mary. Wonderful tequila and a nice touch. A drink is one thing, but the real deal is obviously the food. We started with the Vuelva a la Vida ceviche (scallop, squid, oyster, shrimp). It was pretty darn good, presented nicely with cilantro, onion, tomato, chile, and a tomato type sauce. Next up, I had the mixed grill, which was good, but nothing earth-shattering -- as my wife put it, ""glorified fajitas"". Again, not to say that it wasn't good, but really nothing great special for the price (most expensive on the menu). My wife had the enfrijoladas, which were disappointing tortilla wrapped veggies, with barely any veggies inside. Finished everything with the churros which as others mentioned, are radical. We were both kind of underwhelmed, but I'd go back to visit Don Julio again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm all for hyperbole but this is not hyperbole at all: Ba Xuyen IS the best banh mi place in NYC. I absolutely love banh mi so this is a lofty statement for me to make. However, when I tried the #1 from Ba Xuyen, I knew I had found something special. First of all, the baguette is the perfect golden crispiness thanks to the rice flour + wheat flour ratio. Bread is vital for me. Second, the charcuterie pieces are abundant to differentiate between each slice of cold cut meat. the protein is important. DERP. Third, unlike other banh mi places, you can actually taste the generous amount of pate they spread on the banh mi sandwich. They don't get cheap here with the pate. It's amazing how easy it is to screw up those three vital points of banh mi but Ba Xuyen gets it done perfectly. The only complaint I have about Ba Xuyen is that the cilantro they used wasn't as fresh as it could be. However, I'm willing to forgive them because they got everything else right. Don't be deceived by the incredibly ordinary look of this place by the way. You'd never know that THEY HAVE THE BEST BANH MI HERE based on appearance alone. I just yelled at you because I love banh mi and yelling.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"3.5 star tour by JoAnne. We did the Greenwich Village tour. The pizza places on the tour were all good. We started with Keste (my favorite of the 3), then walked across the street to a typical new york style pizzeria, John's, where they have ""no slices"". We made a quick stop at a local shop where they made mozzarella fresh. Our last stop on the tour was a hole in the wall pizza joint, Ben's, where we tried some square pizza with flavored bread crumbs on the top in lieu of toppings. Although I did enjoy the pizza, I wished we had learned more about pizza. The tour started off strong at the first stop with random tid bits here and there, like the fact that in the US we have pizza sauce because the tomatoes that we had here were of pour quality so they needed to be cooked first to improve the taste, but in Italy, where the tomatoes were fresh, they were used raw. I wish we had learned more pizza trivia like that. All in all JoAnne was really sweet. I think if we do this tour again, I would really like to meet the famous Scott.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I generally walk by Thai, because it all seems the same, I know some die hard enthusiasts would disagree, but if you like places like Num Pang, Joe's Shanghai, WD 50, then you eat like me and will love this place. I see a lot of bad reviews for delivery, but I never get delivery in NYC (yes, my friends think I'm weird) so can't comment on that. We've eaten all over NYC (and the US) never having this type of food. Chef Hong helped us order, the menu changes, but we had corn chowder, beet broth soup (I wanted to bottle it up and take it home), fries (I disagree with the person who said they are common, they definitely have a a twist. I don't like normal sweet potato fries. I liked the shape of the fries, the ratio of batter to sweet potato, didn't really didn't need the sauces, but enjoyed the curry mayo the best, and I'm not a fan of mayo).   We had the beef jerky, tasty, but didn't blow my mind. Finished with the duck curry, which was not a disappointment. Chef Hong said it best last night, when we asked what to order, it depends what you are in the mood for. After sitting at the counter and watching them cook with passion, we are definitely going back for the burgers and the pot pie. I can't imagine horrible service there, so I'm guessing the people who wrote the reviews are in the minority.

"Based on the overwhelmingly favorable reviews here and on other sites, my partner and I went for a quiet birthday dinner at 6:30 last Sunday.  We loved the decor (comfy rustic) and were treated warmly and professionally. We had a wonderful meal and experience - no question. But, let me voice some criticisms. Some dishes, while VG were very overpriced. We ordered the Lobster Chili appetizer based on several raves on Yelp. It was $34, more than some of the entrees. What came was a cut-up broiled lobster in a chili-spiced broth. The lobster was delicious - cooked perfectly. But, the total meat in the dish was probably half what you'd get in a small broiled lobster. We enjoyed it but considered the price a real gouge for what we got. We also ordered the brick chicken based on reviews. This dish did not disappoint. Tender and juicy meaty sections with a crisp, salty skin. If this wasn't the best chicken I've had in many years, it was pretty close. But at $56 for two, this also rates a mention in the ""poor value"" dept. Desserts (marscapone cheesecake and dis-assembled s'mores) were delicious. I repeat, we had a sumptuous dinner and experience. But, ouch! BTW, dinner for us with two appetizers, the chicken entree for two, a $50 red, dessert and coffee came to $260 with tip.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The line was out the door, but not too long of a wait.  Our hostess began to walk us to our seat and then decided to just point it out, which was weird but not a big deal.  The server was really nice and on top of things.  A little pricey for breakfast (about $20 for 3 pancakes, a side, and coffee) but the variety and uniqueness of their pancakes somewhat makes up for this.

Okay, I get it, it's crowded but seriously? 2 people 20 minutes? I'll overlook that... We sat down at a communal table in the back where there is an open kitchen. It was so incredibly tight that it seriously felt like we were speed dating. The strangers to the left and right of me were pretty much sitting on my lap. Then we ordered the food. I love to try different things so I ventured out and ordered some items off of the daily and summer menu. The portions were really small and the taste was quite bland. I don't know if I was just overwhelmed with the tight space or what, but I did not enjoy myself.

We went back the other day because the restaurant we intended to go to was closed on Mondays, and Scannicchios was located directly across the street. I had mediocre expectations because of the last visit. I ordered the Chicken Piccata and my gf got the nightly special and the Grilled Romaine starter. The Romaine was huge, definitely for sharing. She said it was really good. My chicken piccata came with a side of pasta so I went with angel hair. The chicken piccata gravy was thicker than I'm used to, but very good. The pasta was ok but has a weird aftertaste. I wonder if the sauce is homemade or can? It reminded me of canned sauce, but it was decent. Again, for me the chicken piccata was the star of the night. Very good. The bread that they give you and the olive oil on the tables are very tasty. The service was pretty good. Typical South Philly young guy server (I mean that in a respectful way).

"Honestly... We had a HORRIBLE experience here. Our party of four (all having worked in the restaurant industry) were appalled at the service we received. Our server was incredibly rude and inattentive. She did not stop to check in on if we needed anything in the 1+hours we were waiting for our food after having placed our orders. Waiting would not have been as big of a deal if she had apologized and explained that the kitchen was backed up. But no, she basically ignored us for the entire time. Not only that, other tables larger than our own, who had been seated well-over 20 minutes after us, received their food well before we received ours. At 8 we started to receive our food (we had entered the restaurant at 630 and seated around 650) When our food did start coming out (all of us had ordered pasta which we all know doesn't take an hour to cook) she pretty much THREW it down across the table in front of my roommate without a word and walked away (other tables she was chatting up nicely). This was the final straw that led us to talk to the owner/manager. We actually were ready to walk out without eating at this point because of the horrible service. The owner, Pip, came over and apologized saying he would make sure that our night from then on would be a great time. He then took the shrew of a server off of our table and had a very friendly woman take over. Food was good, not great but fine, second server was wonderful. At the end of the meal our check came.... They said they had taken some off of our bill... $8... Our bill after that ""comp"" was $100 and some change. This means that after being treated horribly And waiting over an hour for pasta we did not even get 10% off our bill. The owner had asked us to stop by the front to speak to him before we left. We thought it was a very nice gesture, however, he then takes us outside and all he says to us is that the server is ""a good girl"", that ""that's just South Philly"", that we need to try coming again (which we won't) and that it was the kitchen that made our wait so long. I'm sorry but the kitchen is not responsible for the waitress' awful attitude and horrible demeanor. To sum it up... No we will never dine at this establishment again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wonderful place.  We had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairings and they were fantastic.  Our server was knowledgeable and gave us interesting information on each course.  Both food and wine was most delicious.  Amazingly enough, the carrot course was one of the best.  Who would have thought?!?  Would go again in a minute.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Tiny little restaurant that you can easily miss.  They really should consider a bigger sign board anyway that being said this little hole in the wall is a MUST TRY for anyone who fancies SPICY this place truly gets spice!  When I order something spicy, I really want it spicy.  But what's even better is that they also get that the food needs flavor along with the heat.  I find all of the dishes that I have had here to have very complex flavors and perfectly bold with what you expect from a good Chinese restaurant. It's decently priced and the meat (I usually get beef or lamb dishes) is very tender.  Service is great!  By far, my favorite Chinese joint in the NJ.  They don't try to Americanize their dishes like most places do.  I love it.  Be bold and ask for their dishes spicy if you can handle it. ;-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

The waitress was the worst I have ever seen. When I was leaving I asked if there was new owners, and someone asked me why I don't know if he was a owner or manager, and I told him because it use to be so good, and how awful my experience was and all he could do was tell me the server was new, didn't want to take responsibility for the problems. Also wanted to mention the very dirty wall we were seated next to it looks like soda was spilled all over so if they are not cleaning where customers are sitting have to wonder what the kitchen looks like.

"First , the owner came outside while my friend and I looked at their menu. He offered us a 15% discount. My friend and I agreed. Our table was extremely wobbly, causing us to deal with it often throughout the meal. Our vegetable pakoras appeared to be only one vegetable, onion. They were over-cooked and tasteless. The chutneys that came with it were in extremely small portions, as if tamarind chutney is worth its weight in gold. And the traditional onion chutney was replaced raita. However, raita isn't a dipping sauce or chutney, so that made no sense. And again, it was maybe a single tablespoon of the stuff. Our waitress, who I must admit was incredibly cute and a total sweetheart, was very inexperienced, noticeably so. Our entree's, chicken tikka masala and madras chicken, were fairly good. Better than the other Indian restaurant just up the street to the west.  We ran out of rice, and they offered no refill. The garlic naan was soft but lacking in flavor. Our mango lassi's were bright orange, but strangely tasteless,  as if either cheap mango pulp or food coloring was used. We also ordered a lamb biryani. But what we got wasn't really biryani at all. It appeared to be just lamb, rice and whatever basic masala gravy they had around in the kitchen. It had none of the whole spices and fragrant, intriguing flavors of a good biryani. And in the end, the owner did not give us the 15% discount he offered outside. Not a great experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Philippe Massoud has a story to tell at Ilili (which means tell me). Ilili is a high end, contemporary Lebanese restaurant, located in the Flatiron district. Massoud's culinary tales are woven into the nouveau Lebanese cuisine he's created that draws on his beginnings in hospitality in Beirut and experiences that followed suit in the United States. The space is expansive. There is a funky lounge area, a large dinning area, several private rooms and a DJ to set the mood. One would really expect to find this kind of place in the Meatpacking District. The brunch at Ilili, which was recently introduced, pairs classic American offerings with a Middle Eastern twist. These inventive combinations present a great alternative to traditional brunch dishes. It is priced at $25 for a cocktail and two courses from the brunch menu. Dessert is not included but definitely worth trying. I'm going to go back to try out their lunch and dinner deals for sure. Everything we tried ranged from good to very good. So, if you are looking for something a little different to do on a weekend morning...mosey on down to Ilili for brunch and tell them that the Restaurant Fairy sent you along for some good eats.........","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was impressed by the earthy, funky sulfite free wine selection, uniquely curated. The cocktails are impressive and culinary. I had the Baked Apple and it is worth all the praise it has received, but have to say The Pines drink is particularly refreshing and drinkable, delicious. We started with the testa, wow. The combination of the thinly sliced testa with the slightly sweet pumpkin bread was perfect, then a few bites of celtuse to give a bit of crunch. Inspired, unique. ""When have I ever seen or ever dreamt of this? but how have I lived without it until now?"" This is what I have to say about everything I had at The Pines. When I think of jicama, I think of the dried out sticks they serve at some salad bars, this was fresh and the consistency was more like water chestnuts. With coconut and pancetta, the combination was a perfect appetizer. I had oxtail cappellacci in crab brodo, sort of an italian ""soup dumpling"". The broth is so good you want to drink it in a mug. We  also had the madai crudo, I had never had this fish but it's now a favorite. It was tender, light, yet buttery. I appreciated the crispy skin left on. I shared the pork shoulder, good choice, it's actually a very generous portion. Tender, perfectly seasoned. My overall impression is that this is NOT a chef asleep at the wheel. There is a sense of play, a passionate interest in great food. I definitely will be back soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I can easily say I've been stopping in to Le Barricou for brunch at least once a month for the past 2 or so years... until now.  I can no longer ignore their steady decline.  I'd say that things started to change towards the end of this past summer.  First they took away the complimentary croissants and then portion sizes got smaller and smaller.  I used to leave brunch feeling full, now I leave hungry!  When they say dishes come with a side of home fries and salad, that means about 6ish pieces of potato and 8 pieces of lettuce.  And I used to love their salad dressing, I think it was a simple lemon vinaigrette; not anymore.  My boyfriend used to love their french toast, it used to come with 3 slices, now 2 and it used to come out hot, now it comes out at room temperature if you're lucky. I go in today and for the first time I ordered the side of fruit with my meal for $5.  When it came out I was shocked!  They gave me a small bowl with 1 strawberry, 5 small pieces of honeydew, 5 blueberries, 1 blackberry and a couple small pieces of pineapple.  For real?  I could still see the bottom of the bowl!  Anyway, so I eat a few pieces of fruit and not only was it a stife portion, but the fruit tasted like onion.   Bleh, I'm over it!!!!

"A group of friends got together for some fun and food on a Saturday night and we all wanted to try Papa's.  I ordered the mussels marinara - the sauce was to die for - but all I got was empty shells - no mussels. So if you order mussels marinara  be prepared to get a plate of shells, with  sauce and bread. The owner came over to ask how things were and I told him I got a plate of shells with no mussels in them and his reply was I don't grown them - what kind of answer is that? My husband ordered the stuffed artichoke appetizer and it was so dry he could not eat it. The pizza is alright I would not vote it #1. My dinner was pasta, broccoli rabe and sausage in a wine sauce - it was all butter  by the third bite I could not eat any more it was to greasy from to much butter and not enough wine.  The waiter was wonderful but the owner seemed to have a problem with our table. So, guess what....you won't see the 10 of us again.  We dropped a pretty penny your way that night -- but not again.

"$4 Parking Scam. Beware severe physical intimidation and threats of being arrested for felony theft. On its website where it advertises $4 parking (readingterminalmarket.co…), there is no mention of time limits, except 2 hours. The site says to pay $10 to a merchant and parking for 2 hours is $4 with discounted rates after that. It's a scam, and a frightening one at that. My family, including my 14-year-old son (on spring break from Phoenix, AZ) visited the Market specifically to get a cheese steak sandwich. Our lunch was great (about $25) and we had a blast in the Market. We walked around outside, too, taking photos. We stayed a little over 3 hours. I gave the parking attendant our validated receipt and was told our parking was $29. I asked to speak with a supervisor. A huge man - well over 6 feet tall and close to 300 pounds came storming out screaming at me. He shouted until his face was red saying I would be arrested for felony theft if we did not pay $29. He stopped a police officer and had me get out of my car. My son was terrorized and still is. The cop said I had to pay it. Under duress, we did, of course. Reading Terminal Market stole at least $20 from us and truly frightened my family. We are filing complaints with the BBB, Philadelphia Tourism (visitphilly.com) and the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau (discoverphi.com). And we are contacting Philadelphia media outlets to report this scam.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ok so, I know tapas when I see them, and these are not tapas. They are more like appetizers. This is not a complaint! Came with my friend who recommended the place. Obviously we started the night by sharing a pitcher of sangria, which was awesome. I had the fried calamari, which was very good. Our night was thrown a little off course by the fact that the people sitting next to us had apparently invited even more friends to their table. They had about four people sitting their already and two or three more people came which put my friend in a tight squeeze. Our waitress was so nice. She explained to them that there were too many people there, but the group did not want to move, stating that they did not hear any complaints. So she offered to let us move, and we gladly accepted. I wish I could remember her name, because she was so nice to us. She brought us a brown sugar cake topped with a pear (I really don't know the exact name of the dish, blame the 3 or so glasses of sangria + a caipirosca), but it was to die for!

"Had a last minute lunch for 7 at Nicola's just yesterday. My dish (Veal San Remo) was amazing and most dishes for lunch were large enough to take something home (mine wasn't because I was starving and it was two smallish veal scallops). Very good reviews from everyone at the table - both on their dishes and also on the community bread basket. Bread is the good crusty semolina loaf, presliced. Just to give an indication of the popularity of this place - we got there at 12 and the parking lot was empty - easy in a plaza that has only 3 businesses and is built for more. By the time we left around 1 45, the restaurant was packed and so was the parking lot. The only issues I had was a) not being able to call the place at 11am (before their 11 30 opening time) to tell them it was going to be 7 of us - this turned out to be not a big deal since they have many tables for 6-8 people set and calling after they opened they assured me of that; and b) our original waitress stopped by one more time but this is a place where several servers will help a table out - not a bad thing necessarily but it made for multiple requests for an iced tea and silverware. This is a BYO and/but there's a liquor store that's slated to open next month right next door.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had such a pleasantly surprising experience here! Perhaps I was keeping my expectations low, but I loved everything about this bar/restaurant. I love that they separate the bar space from the dining space. The bar area is definitely busier and has more energy - would likely be fun for after-work drinks. But my friends and I opted to sit down for dinner. Our waitress was incredibly nice and helpful - she was attentive and efficient. The little bread rolls that they bring you while you wait for your food are heavenly: warm and fluffy and buttery. I think we ate two or three plates - they were amazing. The food itself is also delicious, definitely not your usual bar food. I ordered chicken noodle soup and sauteed greens. For two dishes that could be pretty bland or uninteresting, both were incredible. The depth of flavor in the broth of the chicken soup was fantastic and unlike anything I've tasted: it was rich and deep but a light clear broth. I don't know what they put in it or how they got that kind of flavor into what is usually a watery broth, but it was amazing and intensely satisfying. My sauteed greens were perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I would eat greens so much more often if they were served like this! From the moment we walked in and had our coats taken to the moment we left when we picked up our leftovers, everything was perfect. I am so happy this place is in my neighborhood and I can come back very easily!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Half the stuff on the menu was not available.From whatever was available, food was served 45 minutes to 1 hour after the order was given. The waiters did not have the courtesy to serve water during the wait. They showed loads of attitude, as though they were doing us a favor by serving us. The food was good, but for the price we paid and for the excruciatingly long wait, Ive had much better food elsewhere. At the end of it all, while paying the bill, one of us commented that the service is poor, and the response was haughty...such that complaints of this nature were very usual to the staff, and they dont seem interested in making amends. They have a 'Take it or leave it' attitude, which, according to me is not very inviting. I am not going to go there again, so they have lost at least one customer for good.

"I was really craving Turkish coffee and baklava today so we decided to stop by before heading home from the city.  Since we split a slice of pizza earlier on, we weren't that hungry but I saw that they had manti so we had to get an order.  I mean, you can't be offered manti and turn down an opportunity to have some.  We got ours stuffed with ground beef; the dumplings themselves were plump and had a soft, tender shell with plenty of well-seasoned beef filling.  They were topped off with a garlicky, creamy yogurt-based sauce with a touch of mint, butter, and red pepper.  It was very good, surpassed only by a friend's mom's homemade specialty.  They were also very authentic so that was a huge plus.  I only wish that they also offered lamb-stuffed manti.  That would have made my...well, year.  We also got an order of the Turkish bread, which was served fresh from the oven with a nice array of spreads.  I had it with simple butter, which really brought out the bread's inherent toasty, buttery goodness.  There's really no other bread to compare it to except maybe a French baguette, which is kind of similar but not really.  Anyhow, it's definitely worth a try if you're in the area.  The coffee was fantastic: authentically strong and bitter.  The baklava was also delicious.  The pastry layers were flaky, light, and buttery, and the filling sweet yet not overly so.  The touch of honey drizzle was a great finishing touch and it was presented beautifully on a plate.  We even brought back an extra order.  Service was great and the seating small but cozy.  Will definitely return.  In the meantime, get yourself here for a coffee and/or dessert and snack.  The breakfast platters looked great so that will be next on my list.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friend and I were expecting your run of the mill chinese/vietnamese joint.

Also it was a few months of eating here before we realized there is a relatively clean if tiny restroom in the back we can use. Now onto the food. Decent. I don't eat meat but I do eat copious amounts of fish and the catfish bahn mi is bomb. So's the rice claypot dish with catfish. Veggie pho is meh, I like the tofu a bit better than the soy protein but they're both deep fried. You're better off grabbing a soup side with your bahn mi instead if you just want a hot liquid-y chase. The classic bahn mi tastes proper (unlike at bahn mi saigon on mott) according to my friend. Exceeds expectations, overall - which admittedly were low. Service is laidback. The owner's half Chinese but the friendly girl working there is Vietnamese. The girl working remembers us and what heat and how we like our bahn mi, regardless if it's an order we phone in for takeaway or dining in. We've taken to picking up the bahn mi and sitting at the park nearby if the day is nice . . . so much more relaxing plus you don't walk out permeated by an aura of grease.

The atmosphere was really cute, but very, very small.  It made for a great intimate brunch date with the girls.  As for food, I ordered their infamous pancakes, with chocolate chunks, while my other friends also had different variations on the pancakes, and another had a sort of egg sandwich.  As for the pancakes, they were  good, but very rich.  As one friend explained it, they could almost be their own dessert.  I can't say that they were the BEST pancakes I've ever eaten, but for the price ($13) they were just right - pretty good, but not great.   I guess so many people have hyped this place up that I expected to be blown away.  Perhaps I need to try more of their brunch/lunch dishes before I make up my mind to not come here again.   Bottom line:  All in all, it was a good brunch, but not spectacular.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm a big fan of this restaurant.  Every time I make it to the city, I have to eat here for their spaghetti limone ($13).  I've even replicated it at home with great success.   The menu is impressive and I plan on coming back and trying a lot more stuff. We started off with a mixed salad; bruschetta with tomatoes, polenta with shaved leeks and the complimentary rustic breads with garlicky bean salad -- so good. The salad was enough for three people, very simple and clean. WHERE DOES THIS PLACE GET THEIR TOMOATOES? Seriously, I wanted to lick the bruschetta plate clean. The polenta wasn't really creamy, but the large slices of cheese was enough for me to really like it. The great service, excellent food and private space made for a really wonderful evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This was a very quaint place with a cozy feeling type atmosphere. We went for Sunday brunch and were seated right away. Coffee was great. Homemade soda was very good, not too sweet. I ordered the ""autumn veggie omelet"", which had squash in it. Very tasty for a veggie omelet. I also ordered a pork sausage as a side dish which was yummy. Boyfriend ordered the pastrami hash - this was very tasty also. Size of the Portions were just right even if you are pretty hungry. The food did take very long to come out but everything was so fresh as if all the ingredients were hand picked from a farm minutes before they prepared it, so no complaints.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This tiny Mediterranean spot on the corner of 10th and Spruce may not look like too much from the outside, but once you step inside, the experience is sure to blow you away. I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu. My first bit of advice is, if you haven't been before and want to know what to order, the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal, and it is quite filling, has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs, a big slab of ham, two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese, some delicious bread and a salad, all together on one glorious plate. My fiancé and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen, go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly, this was really touching to see. I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My wife and I had just attended an evening meeting of the Dutch Kills Civic Association in the area and then went to Flux Factory art venue. We were not done yet, so we walked by Crescent Grill since they have a small art gallery at the front of the restaurant. Since we had already eaten diner right before the meeting and had cake at the meeting we only ordered an appetizer to share a the bar. We had Duck Balls. I kid you not. I had never seen Duck balls before. They were DELICIOUS. We found out that they serve Sunday brunch. We will look at their web site and see if they list the brunch special for that day. Wait ... just went to site and signed up for their Twitter feed. So now I hope they tweet announce Sunday bunch. Sometimes we don't get up till 1:00pm. So they better say from what time to what time. Oh, over the bar is this fantastic photo of the Queensboro Bridge [the full length of the bar] and more art throughout the Crescent Grill. I think that it is all local artists as we recognized many of the names. Update of Sunday October 27, 2013 We had signed up for their Twitter feed so was notified of Sunday brunch. It says until 3:00PM, so we got up early at around 12:30 Noon Previously we had eaten before going there, but when you go to a restaurant, you should eat at the restaurant, not before you get there. Wife had ""Country Breakfast"". She loved the way the home fries were cooked. I had ""Seafood Omelet"". It was delicious. You could tell in both that only the freshest and best ingredients were used. We had been to a house party night before so wife did not want an alcoholic drink. I had a Bellini which Wikipedia describes as ""A Bellini cocktail is a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach purée. Originating in Venice, it is one of Italy's most popular long drinks."" It was delicious. We then had their delicious coffee as we chatted and I mused how this would be a nice place before or after evening theater. There are theaters in the neighborhood. So we may have dinner there one evening as this is a very nice place.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Restaurant Review: Skappo Italian Wine Bar I had never felt a need to venture far from the main Yale campus for Italian food with Geronimo's, Ibiza, and Basta within walking distance. But when a friend mentioned a small, family-run Italian restaurant down on crown I decided it was worth a try. And I was not disappointed. The 15-minute walk to Skappo Italian Wine Bar on Crown Street gave me the chance to work up an appetite. Outside hangs a coat-of-arms flag and bright red curtains coat the glass windows. Inside, was a well-lit dining room with beige walls and small tables everywhere, with a wine rack at the end.  We were greeted by the daughter, who seated us at a cozy table -- if a little too close to the family next to us. Thankfully, they finished soon after we arrived so we no longer had to fear we'd be eavesdropped on. The menu featured exquisite Italian options, done differently. Instead of big portions, Skappos offers tapa-style Italian dishes. This appeals to me because I love to share when I go out to dinner, and order a wide variety of dishes. The daughter (who was our waitress), came over and briefed us on the specials -- a wild mushroom risotto and a duck dish I tuned out because, frankly, I don't like duck. It was obvious from the menu that authentic Italian ingredients are important to the owners of Skappo. Everything is in Italian, with a description beneath it. The menu featured the sections of cured meats and cheeses (Salumi e Formaggi), crostini, vegetables (Vegetali), Meat and Fish (Carne e Pesce), and Desserts (Dolcetti). We wanted to try something from most categories and decided on the Crostini con Pomodori e Parmigiano-Reggiano (parmesan and tomatos), the risotto of the day (wild mushroom), the insalata of the day (fresh mixed greens with a citrus vinaigrette), homemade meatballs, and a roast chicken stew special. She smiled and took our menu, then brought us fresh Italian bread and butter. First to come out was the salad, which was light and refreshing. Then came the crostini, piping hot. The combination of flavors was perfectly balanced: the tomato was slightly warm from the toasted bread, and the cheese complemented it perfectly but was subtle enough to not overwhelm the rest of the dish. Then came everything else. The mushroom risotto was rich, but not too rich. The chicken was stringy in a good way, and the flavor of the stew was perfect. It was obvious that it had time for all the flavors to fuse together. And then there were the meatballs: bite-size and perfectly seasoned. The best meatballs I've ever had. I only wish I had a bit more marinara sauce to soak them in. They were moist, delicious, and the first plate to be emptied. I always delight in sharing, but found even this was too much food for both of us to tackle. Unfortunately, this meant we left Skappo without any dolcetti. But we were far from unsatisfied. Each dish was an incredible blend of flavors that I would never think to put together. The ingredients were fresh (most directly imported from Italy), and the result was delightful. I liked each dish, though all were very different. Perhaps what I like best about Skappo is the evolving menu. While all the traditional Italian staples remain on the menu, sometimes the best dishes are the daily specials -- like the mushroom risotto and the chicken stew. But you must be adventurous and willing to try new things you haven't had before. We were carefully attended to, and made to feel that are meal was a personal experience, not just an occasion to eat. I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious, home-made, rich, Italian food. The experience is personal and it is obvious the family puts a great deal into their food. The only drawbacks are that it is a bit pricy (we spent about $55 without tip) and the seating a little cramped. This is a great date location, but a little too formal for a casual meal.

"Brunch brunch brunch! I'd been dying to check out Calle Ocho ever since I heard about its unlimited sangria and finally went a couple of Saturdays ago. Reservations fill up way in advance so my friends and I figured we'd just show up and see if there would still be seating. Two of us got there right around noon, right when they open, and were snagged great seats in the lounge. Our two other friends were delayed so we got to order sangria first and eat the bread/muffins they give out. I'll get to the sangria later, but let me start off by saying oh my goodness, that bread is amazing, oh so wonderful and delightful and leaves me wanting more delicious! A little sweet, but perfectly hard and soft and just so amazing, the bread already ensured that I will be returning. When my other friends arrived, we ordered more sangria and food. I had the Tortilla Espanola, which was good. I particularly enjoyed the crab enchilado, which was a little spicy, but well flavored. My friends and I didn't think any of the entrees were mind-blowing, but considering the amazing prices, delicious bread, nice ambiance, and unlimited sangria, you won't hear any complaints from me. As promised, the sangria! I started with the Fresas, which was delicious, but also strong. I couldn't finish it: the other sangrias distracted me, namely the Punta Cana, which was fruity and my favorite. Tropical was a close second and Havana Banana did not disappoint either. All in all, we had a great time and I'll definitely be back to brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They were mild to medium and crispy and not over-sauced. All the blue cheese they use is real blue cheese, not the dressing from a bottle, and its amazing.

"Went to Shade last night during a friends bday celebration.   Average prices Bud Light $4.  Corona $5.  Glass of wine $6 and up. When we arrive at 9 there was tons of seating.  Around 10, the waitress let us know there was a party with reservations coming to take our seats at 11.  Which was fine.  What wasn't fine was that she reminded us again every 15 minutes for the next hour.  It's like okay - we get the point but we're staying here until they get here.   The music was all 80s, all night.  Which I wasn't in the mood for. ...maybe I was just cranky last night.   At least they played Billy Jean and it wasn't too loud.  You could talk to someone on the other side of the table.  Not just the person next to you.  I did like the layout.  Small, cute.  Funky pillows.  Dark.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I checked out Hawthornes last night, and I'm glad this place opened up in my neighborhood. The beer selection is very cool, they have nearly as many as The Foodery does.  There were some interesting choices that I haven't seen before, like a Watermelon wheat beer.   I ordered a grilled cheese/ham/olive tapenade sandwich, and it was tasty.  The chips were homemade.  Nothing to go crazy about, but the food was well-made and hit the spot. I think the thing I most like about this place is the atmosphere.  Very friendly.  I like that there are no waiters--you just pick a beer from the case, pay for it at the counter, and find a table.  It's actually kind of a novel idea. It seems like a nice place to go with some friends and just hang around drinking interesting beers.  A bottle of microbrew will cost you as low as 2.50, which is cheaper than it would be at a bar. One thing I would like to see is a way to figure out how much the beers cost before taking them to the counter.  I took up a beer that was $16.  I said ""oh, didn't know it was that much, hold on while I go put it back.""","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The Skinny - Made 6:30pm RSVP for myself and siblings for dinner on a Thursday night; no wait when we got there but at around 7:00pm the place started to get packed. Nice cozy Italian restaurant tucked away from the loud and crowded streets of the neighborhood. Food was pretty decent, had a very natural and organic taste/texture to the dishes we ordered. Service was pretty spot on. However, at the end of the day, I wasn't exactly blown away by the whole experience, in particular the food The Major Pros - Great service (server came by every 5 minutes to make sure our water glasses were full) - Organic ingredients and generally good tasting food; risotto balls are pretty solid as an appetizer - Intimate ambiance and setting; perfect if you're with a significant other or with close friends/family and trying to get away from the madness of the city - Decently priced dishes and portions The Major Cons - We were seated right next to the entrance and anytime patrons came or left, really cold air managed to get to right at our table; avoid this table or tell them to get you some Snuggies The Verdict - Dunno if I'd come back here again, at least not for dinner; perhaps their brunch or lunch menu is better. I will say though, if you're looking for a nice date spot, this place is pretty good because its intimate and not overly crowded.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"BOMB-BAY! This place is currently my favorite place to eat in Philly. Granted, I don't live here but I like to think that I've tried my fair share of the eateries and Village Whiskey is the one I want to come back to the most. The restaurant is a bit cramped, so waits can get pretty extreme. The bar ""area"" is seat yourself, so you can always take your chances with that. I haven't had the pleasure of drinking here yet, but from the looks of it, the whiskey selection is extensive. Village Burger - Very solid burger. The meat is juicy and cooked to perfection. After my first bite of a burger, I like it when juices come slipping out and the bottom bun eventually gets soaked. But only after I bite into the burger. To me, its a sign that the burger isn't overcooked and there is a ton of meat and fat flavor sealed into the patty. And the Village Burger cooked medium does that. The thousand island dressing reminds me of In-N-Out spread. And I mean that as a big compliment. Haha. I didn't get any toppings when I got the Village Burger, but there are a variety of options available. Whiskey King - BOMB-BAY! This burger is quite possibly the best Non-Umami burger I have ever had. (And to be fair, Umami burgers don't really count as burgers in my head cause their flavor profiles can be really different and non-burger tasting). The patty is fantastic and the same from the Village Burger. The bacon is crunchy, thick cut and deliciously sweet and salty. The foie gras is decedent, rich and creamy. And the blue cheese cuts through everything with its tartness. The combination of all the flavors and textures really make it a memorable eating experience. The $26 price tag is intimidating, but if you're looking for an indulgent treat, this would be my choice. Tater Tots - The most interesting tater tot i've ever had. When I have tots, I'm thrown back to my youth days of elementary school. Dipping small balls of potatoes, basically shredded hash browns, into ketchup. Crunchy all the way through. These tots are nothing like that. Sure you get a nice crispy exterior, but the inside of these things are mash potato soft. Its like a beignet tater tot. Its amazing, but be warned that it isn't your childhood tater tot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Oh Artichoke pizza, I love that your Margarita slice makes me drool puddles like an infant. I hate that your prices keep creeping up and the long line that is always outside. Service: 3/5 Can be pretty slow at times and not efficient Decor: Its dirty and decorations are random but thats ok, its take out! Food: 5/5 Margarita - easily my favorite, everything about this pizza is delicious - the fresh tasting tangy tomato sauce, the thin and crispy crust ,the chunks of melted cheese, and especially the whole basil leaves littered on top. Sicilian - same toppings as the margarita but the crust is thicker, crunchier, and slices are square, good if you like crunchy Crab Slice - sprinkles of shredded crab meat, I prefer tomato based pizzas with a bit more tang Artichoke + Spinach Slice - Very very very very .. wait.. yeah, very heavy. Think artichoke dip, but dumped all over a pizza crust and baked. - delicious if you're into that kind of thing - I can never have more than a few bites. - eating more than one may clog arteries.

"Quite a while back, I saw a list on NY Eater that ranked ""15 Epic New York Burgers to Eat before you Die."" I read this like a challenge and immediately emailed my friend: ""We are going to hit up every single place on this list."" His response? ""Wah! All 15, a? (loosens belt) I'm ready!"" Of course, most of the places on this list are for fairly pricey burgers, so we had only ever had Shake Shack, which was 2nd on the list. The first was the black label burger from Minetta Tavern, and NY Eater made the bold claim that this was the ""Citizen Kane of burgers."" Take that as you wish, but I assume it means FANTASTIC. I made reservations online at Minetta a week prior via Open Table, so that was easy (reservations are a MUST!). I gathered 5 friends and we showed up on time for our 9pm reservation. What wasn't on time, however, was Minetta, as our table was not ready. In fact, we had to wait another half hour to be seated. Normally I don't mind so much but it was already 9pm and I was starving! The interior of the restaurant is dark, and brings you back to a long-gone era where Hemingway and Fitzgerald might have lounged about. Once we were seated in our cramped space, I felt a lot less romantic about it, since the guy at the table next to us could have just shifted an elbow an extra few inches and knocked me right in the face. As we were about to order, a friend texted and demanded that we order the Côte de Boeuf. I checked the menu and despite his raging drunk recommendation, I wasn't quite in the mood to shell out $140 (tho for 2 ppl!)... and besides, I had my heart set on this #1 burger! I was also extremely curious to see what made this burger worth $26. When it arrived, it didn't sparkle (haha) or seem particularly interesting. I ate a bit of the meat first to see what all the hoopla was all about... and... well... it was good. The burger was tender, juicy, and had pretty good flavor. Was it better than any other gourmet burger I've ever had in my life? NOPE. Maybe it was too overhyped, or too expensive for what you actually get; I was a little disappointed. Does it rank up there? Yes... but not for the price! After devouring my burger, I was full but still felt a bit unsatisfied. Our server came by with the dessert menu and we opted to order 2 souffles - one vanilla and one grand marnier. And OHMYGOD, the grand marnier was the BEST souffle I've had in my life. This is the stuff dreams are made of, people!! I specifically point out the grand marnier, because the vanilla was a little less fluffy and a bit more ""watery"" than the grand marnier. They were also a tad pricey, at $18 each, but it's supposed to feed two people... and it's SO WORTH IT. I now know why I was meant to try Minetta, and it was for their extraordinarily delicious souffle. Will have to return to try the Côte de Boeuf and order a gazillion souffles!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The place is busy, but the staff are so attentive and friendly that you truly feel welcomed and appreciated. I love that the owner came out and personally asked me what I thought of my dish.  This is not a place where they simply throw things together, there is thought and careful preparation put into every dish, which is what makes the fresh menu so great.  I would highly recommend Dough both for the quality of food, the awesome atmosphere and the excellent service, and I am definitely a new loyal customer!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I started with the pumpkin soup which was poured table-side (nice touch), while my friend got short ribs. We were both very impressed.  For the main course I ordered the hake, which is out of character for me, as I rarely order fish. However, I made the right choice as it was perfectly cooked, very well seasoned, and all the garnishes complimented the dish very well.  My friend ordered the grilled local chicken.  I picked at her's and it was also delicious. The best part, however, were the outrageous concoctions made by the mixologist. We each got two cocktails and it ended up being four of the most unique combinations but also the most amazing drinks we've ever had. He's clearly a genius.  I can't wait to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Overpriced and not good food under normal circumstances. For an airport restaurant, I suppose prices were near reasonable, and the food was mediocre. For my purposes - eating and killing time in a slightly comfortable setting - I was mostly satisfied. I had my own table, wine, and dinner. That said, the Croque Monsieur I had was the worst I ever had - it should just be named a grilled cheese with deli ham. I question whether the owners/chefs actually know what a Croque Monsieur is. The Caesar Salad I had was fine. The wine was overpriced but satisfying. My recommendation - you're probably better off getting food from one of the stands in the middle of the cafeteria-type area, and waiting for a table there or bringing the food on your plane.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is the last time I will review or otherwise think about the devil's den. I first gave it 1 star because of a bad server, then I gave it 4 stars because I had many good times and no problems. I am back to give it 1 star and I will offer a story as to why I will never go here again. So I want to emphasize that this bar is around the corner from my house and I WANT to like it. Loving the bar around the corner from where you live is pure perfection so I have overlooked many little problems. I used to have a job that didn't let out until 7pm so I could never go to happy hour at the devil's den. I finally was able to come here for happy hour with a friend and as the hostess was seating us she told us that in addition to half-priced drinks the ""small plates"" were also half-off.  My buddy and I both got drinks, a small plate and an entree. When the bill came we noticed that the small plates didn't get the discount, an understandable mistake for a busy waiter. We called the waiter over and told him about this silly mistake and he surprisingly told us that it wasn't a mistake. He proceeded to tell us that the small plates were not half off; the tapas in the back of the drink menu are the ones on special for happy hour. We told him about how the hostess told us very specifically that the ""small plates"" were half-off (found in the dinner menu) and that we wanted them to honor this.  He said there was nothing he could do and so I asked to speak to the manager.  The waiter said that the manager wasn't available but the acting manager was the bartender, who I have met many times in the way that one would be familiar with the bartender at the neighborhood bar. When I told him what happened he said ""Well you're here all the time, you should KNOW it's the tapas that are half off, not the small plates"". I told him that I had never been there for happy hour before and emphasized that the hostess TOLD US that the ""small plates"" were on special. He wouldn't budge. We left unhappy less because of having to spend an extra few dollars but more because of the ""every man for himself"" feeling that you would never expect from a neighborhood bar. The management have made it clear that they are more concerned with making every last cent from their patrons than forging a relationship with the community. There are too many other bars in south philly to spend your time and money in a place that doesn't deserve it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This restaurant seriously provided me the absolutely worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  Unfortunately, I am unable to comment on whether or not the food was good since we were so rushed and were only allotted 25 minutes for a Saturday night dinner - I barely tasted my meal.  As soon as we were seated, the wait staff and hostess continually asked my date and me every 1-2 minutes if we ""made our selections for dinner yet"" from an elaborate of a menu that has nearly 50 pastas dishes listed on it in various combinations.  Once our food arrived the staff constantly hovered over us and again berated with questions every 3-5 minutes about whether or not we ""were done"" with our meals.  They started cleaning the restaurant and putting all the chairs up on the tables while we awaited our food to arrive from the kitchen and while a few other couples finished their meals.  They even insisted on taking our dessert order before I had even tasted the pasta I ordered.  I have never experienced such a rushed, unwelcoming, and frankly offensive service by restaurant staff ever!  I felt they should never have seated us in the first place if they were unable to accommodate us in a professional and courteous manner.  (We arrived just after 10pm and were literally kicked out by 10:30!)  When I called this to the attention of the hostess she said,"" Well, there are plenty of other restaurants in the city!""  Trust me, I will NEVER return to Il Corallo again - it was the worst dining experience ever!!!   Don't Go!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My go-to banh mi joint in NYC. Their classic banh mi is delicious, filling, and CHEAP ($5!). The fillings were extremely flavorful, the baguette toasted to an exquisite perfection, and they went hard on the spice upon my request. Also tried out an order of their sweet potato fries, which are actually some of the best I've ever had. They're served with a phenomenal, why-didn't-I-think-of-that mix of soy sauce and mayo that made for the perfect sweet potato fry dip extravaganza. Service is fast, efficient, and even comes with a few FREE SMILES! My water remained full without me ever asking, and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. In terms of space/seating, there's one big table for larger groups, about 7-8 2-person tabletops, and bar seating that is comfortable without ever getting cramped. Coming back to try their pho next.

The portions are too bad either, full sandwiches or salads and since its vegetarian (trust me, I love meat and I never miss it with this menu) its a lot of fiber so not eating a lot still fills you up. It could use a little kick in the flavor department, some items are a little bland, but overall I make it a point to order here fairly often.

"Anyone who gives Pommes Frites 5 stars must be drunk.   If the one thing of substance on the menu is fries, you would expect that they would be amazing.  Yes, they've got a plethora of sauces to complement the fries, but the base of the dish are the fries.   And the fries...weren't that great.  They weren't especially tasty, crispy, and nothing about them stood out.  If sauces are your thing, you might like this place.  Many of their sauces are mayo-based, but being that I'm not a fan of mayo...I was just bleh about their sauces.  They had recommended that I try their most popular sauce, the sweet mango chutney, but I opted for their more savory sauces because I don't really like sweet stuff too much. Not really impressed.  I much rather prefer the waffles cheese fries at 99 Miles to Philly. Now those are some amazing fries.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had plans to go to another place when I stumbled upon this spot. I am not a fan. The service was great, but the food was beyond mediocre. We started with the edamame dumplings, which were doughy, pasty, and served in a tasteless broth. Next, was the sashimi: miniscule bits of fish, overdone with way too much cilantro and served with what could only be described as what looked and tasted like Pringles. The chicken satay wa good, but small and pricey for what you get. The lamb chops were a hit, but only after you scrape off the endless amount of salted topping they put on it. The sake tasted like it was watered down. I understand the concept of small plates, but let's be realistic here. $75 later, I was still starving! I would be back if the food was any good, but it just isn't.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am on a soul food binge, so get out my way! I came here or on a tip from a fellow Yelper and I'm really glad I did. I was driving in West Philly looking for this restaurant because I didn't have an exact address. I'm driving down 60th  Street and lo and behold,  I saw a really big black guy in a apron standing in front of the restaurant. In my mind I was hoping this was a place because looking at him, I knew I was in for a treat. When I approach the restaurant, the big guy said ""you look hungry and this is the place to be my friend"". Pinch me. The restaurant is newly decorated, and the spot was so clean it actually shined. There were two attractive young ladies taking orders at the counter and they were very very pleasant and personable. They handed me a menu and I told them I wanted to try the fried chicken. The big guy said I should order the breast, it came boneless and it was very large. Who I am I to argue? I ordered collard greens, mac and cheese and potato salad to go with the chicken.  The big guy said it would be ready in 10 to 15 minutes.  They have a big flat screen TV in the waiting area to keep you company until your food is ready but what caught my attention was a row of individually packaged slices of homemade sweet potato pie. So I grabbed a slice to eat while I was waiting for my order. The pie was delicious not too sweet and definitely homemade with love. The food was done and after talking with the young ladies,  I paid for it and headed home to eat. The big guy was right the chicken breast was huge, crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. and zero bones. The greens were flavorful and tender, the bake macaroni and cheese was delicious, and the potato salad was really old school. The meal came with a huge hunk of freshly baked corn bread that could have been mistaken for a dessert. It was high and fluffy with a hint of sweetness.  All in all it was a pretty impressive meal, sometime simple home made foods are the hardest to pull off these days. If they continue to consistently put out food at this high level, they will blow up! The prices are reasonable and it's worth the trip from wherever you're coming from.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really wanted SuzyQue's to be great.  I live close by and the restaurant that was here before (Quincy's) went from below-average to untenable quickly.  So a lot of folks from the neighborhood were rooting for this place to be great.  I love that it's a woman-owned business and that that woman is from the neighborhood.  But my love-affair ends there.  Unfortunately, it's a horrible restaurant.   Worst service ever. I have never, ever, not tipped a server until the service I had here one night.  It was BAD, really bad.  Another server screamed at her customers.  The manager apologized and went on to offer poor service.  I should have demanded that I not pay the bill, but I didn't. No one here knows how to run a decent restaurant.  Not the servers, not the hostess, not the floor managers and unfortunately not even Suzy. The food is just okay, it's not good.  I can cook better BBQ, and I'm not a great cook by any stretch of the imagination.   Finally, there's something wrong with a place that needs to constantly run Groupons.  Other friends who own restaurants tell me they regretted using Groupon because they lost money. The only time this place is packed is when they run a Groupon, and no one new comes back.   It stinks folks.   Suzy, if you read this, please, please, please--close down for a month, hire people who know how to run a restaurant and start over.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've spent the last three years living in Philly, hearing about how absolutely amazing this place is but never had the opportunity to try it out. A friend suggested it as our dinner destination and I was down to go, after hearing rave review after rave review. We got to the restaurant at 9pm on a Saturday night. This was stupid on our part, as we were both STARVING and weren't in the waiting mood. We stayed anyway, again due to the rave reviews. We were quoted a 15-25 minute wait but it took 40 minutes for us to get a table. That's ok, it's a Saturday night and the place is packed. I can deal. We were sat and immediately given chips and salsa, which we both started devouring lest we pass out from hunger. We waited about 5 minutes for water to be brought over and close to another 10 minutes for the waitress to return to take our order. We ordered the plantains for an appetizer, a vegan beef burrito with gauc, and a vegetable chimichanga. The plantains were incredible. Or maybe they just seemed incredible because we were still starving. Whichever the case may be, they were really yummy. The mains came out pretty quickly after the plantains which meant an insanely crowded table. My friends commented that it was more of a nightstand than a table and I agreed. Just because we are a party of two doesn't mean we don't need room for plates/drinks! My vegan beef burrito was gigantic (I ended up taking half of it home) and decent. Nothing special, although the vegan beef was really yummy. The other ingredients were just ok. My friend really enjoyed her chimichanga but wasn't blown away either. We passed on dessert but they get major points for having vegan desserts. By the time we paid our bill, it was midnight. A three hour dinner wasn't exactly what I had planned on, although I did enjoy myself. Overall the food was ok but I won't be rushing back any time soon. I felt like I could probably have made my burrito better at home and in a quieter atmosphere. Seriously, I know I'm in a bar but this place is LOUD. I got hoarse halfway through dinner because I had to yell or my friend wouldn't have been able to hear me. I admit feeling a bit let down, after hearing three years of hype for this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

They're perfectly fried and topped with special house sauce, spicy mayo, green sauce, pickled veggies, and cilantro. And probably some of the best fries I've ever had.

"A very small place but the food is oh so good!! They even have small hooks to hang your jacket at the entrance. At the counter, there are small hooks where you can hang your bags underneath. It is tres convenient especially when space is very limited here. PROS: - TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE: heavenly goodness. you have got to get this - FARRO MUSHROOM RISOTTO: another tasty cheesy dish but this was a little too SALTY - OYSTER PANCAKE - it small for its size compared to the Korean and Chinese pancakes you find but it tastes very good. It contains kimchi and oysters. Another difference is that the oyster pancake is sort of mushy while the Chinese scallion pancakes are very crunchy. - KOREAN BEEF BOURGUIGNON - the braised beef was very soft and moist. Delicious. It went well with the potatoes and carrots. The dish had a nice touch of finely thin apple slices. OKAY: - WATERMELON SALAD - tangy sour taste spin on the watermelon. it's good but I didn't like the cheese pieces with the watermelon that much. - KIMCHI BOUILLABAISSE (fisherman stew): contains mussel, shrimp, fried tofu, kimchi. This was okay for me. The seafood was fresh and it's just a tad bit spicy but nothing overwhelming but taste wise it didn't really jump out at me. It's unique and I like the chef's spin on it by adding in gnocchi in it however I had better seafood Korean stew at BCD Tofu house on 34th street. CON: - FRENCH FRIES - the fries were kind of on the burnt side and the smoky sauce was OK. You can definitely skip on the fries. This did not wow me at all. - Kind of PRICEY for small dishes but I am glad the dishes weren't that big at the same time because I was able to try more without stuffing myself.

"We just took a vacation to Pennsylvania and New Jersey 3 years ago. Several months before we went, my dad was watching The Food Network and saw a show called Meat and Potatoes. On that episode there were three restaurants that were featured. One was a location in Beverly Hills which my parents went to for their chili. My dad was always a sucker for chili. On that same episode was a place in Philadelphia called ""Old Original"" Nick's Roast Beef. My dad said it looked so good he was ready to hop on a plane himself. This was huge for him to say because he would get airsick. He gave me a print out of Nick's info and said I had to try it. When my dad became very sick, I wanted to cancel our trip. Unfortunately, my dad lost his battle with cancer just two weeks before we left. With my mom's OK, we kept our vacation and my list of must try restaurants. Of course our first stop had to be Nicks! My hubby's cousin picked us up at the airport and we headed straight for Nick's in south Philly. It wasn't in the best of neighborhoods and if it wasn't 9:30pm at night, we may have driven past it. It is a hole in the wall place. We walked past the bar area to the back seating. I don't think there were more than 12 tables total. Then I hear my cousin call out, ""It's Joe Frazier!"" What??? THE Smokin' Joe Frazier? I explained to my kids this was the man who fought Muhammad Ali in the Thrilla in Manilla. We just read a biography about Ali, so they understood. After meeting Joe and getting photos, we got to business. I always have to get what a restaurant is known for. So in this case it was their Roast Beef Sandwich with Provolone Cheese. I asked for it ""overboard"" which means they dunk the bottom half of the kaiser roll into the au jus. The sandwich wasn't quite as juicy as I was expecting, although still quite wonderful. One of the kids got their jus on the side, so I dunked my sandwich into their jus...perfect! It was salty and indulgent. The roast beef is slow roasted, sliced thin and piled high. It was tender and delicious. Thanks dad for turning me on to Nick's. It was the perfect way to start our trip!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Went in Yesterday sunday 9/22 for brunch.  Well to start with they were 10-15 mins late on their reservations.  This turned out to be more like 45 minutes late.  We weren't seated until we asked what was going on.  Turns out they forgot about us!  to their credit they did give some free doughnut appetizer which was cold but they did try to make up for it.   The Server who worked our table Nathan( i think) was great.  He personally gets 5 stars.  Very attentive.   I ordered the Benedict Jane...  the crab cake was yummy but then there was the poached egg.  Someone needs to learn how to poach an egg  my yolk was cooked throughout.   Bad experience over all but the service from our waiter was great which is why they are still get two stars.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here a couple of days ago during lunch time and wow. My friend warned me about coming here on an empty stomach and I did not listen. The entire time I was looking at their menu and all I could do was hold my grumbling stomach at bay with the thought that my sandwich would arrive on time to curb the grumbling little beast. The meats and cheeses were oh so fresh, I got the Lamazou Favorite and it was mouthwatering from the first bite to the last. The moz's and roasted peppers, oh. I'm dreaming about them now. The only gripe I had was the price to meat proportion. They could have done with a little more ""stuff"", hopefully next time I come back, I will get more. Here's to hoping.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I love this place. I've Only been there for dinner never brunch but it never disappoints.better to make reservations if it's more than 2 of y'all. They allow walk-ins but will always offer the kitchen bar 1st...which is cool if u wanna watch them make your dish but it can get hot near the flames. My go-to is the khao Soi or Sizzling Sisig with coconut rice.The rice is really good and goes with everything. The portions are generous on both dishes.The mango salad is really good as well...tried the mussels they were nothing special. The drinks are meh! so go there to eat not get drunk. although  $15 bottomless cups of beer can be a good night starter if your looking to do damage. The vibe is upbeat and it feels young and hip.The playlist is always decent with something for everybody.A little heavy on the hip hop side but they do a good job of mixing it up. Will be back soon.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"All I can say is WOW! This boat is amazing. I just stopped in for a casual lunch and ate at the bar with a friend. We had a large assortment of appetizers and split the lettuce wraps.

"Now, I always see my friends checking-in to Ippudo when they're visiting NY and I always hear such great things. I should really stop hyping things up for myself. This review is coming from a girl that does not particularly like Japanese ramen. We missed our exit on the subway so we had to walk about 2-3 miles to get here in the cold (yes, I could've taken a taxi, but it was a big indulgent weekend. I needed to find room for excercise). Ramen sounded like a great plan for the brisk chilly weather.We didn't wait long, which seemed like the theme for me this past weekend. We were sat at a community table, seems to be common in New York. My girlfriend and I place an order for the pork buns, large sake, and 2 classic ramens. The pork buns were great. Well, in all honesty, it was my first pork bun ever, but I know when I like something. This was tasty and the pork wasn't too fatty. I acually prefer this bun over Momofuku's. Yes, I said it. For the ramen .. Good, solid, clean tasting ramen. Nothing to jump up and down about. I am not a big pork eater, so I took a bite of the pork and gave the rest to my friend. It had a bland, dry taste. The broth was creamy, but not fatty creamy, and tasted really clean. The noodles grabbed my attention because it wasn't the typical curly-like ramen noodle. The noodles were long, thin, and straight. 2 large hot sakes later, the broth was tasting better and better. Loved the pipping hot green tea at the end. I wouldn't wait the ridiculous wait that others have experienced to eat here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"When i read the reviews of this sandwich restaurant, I knew it was my kind of place.  The breadth of sandwiches offered, and the number that are vegetarian is phenomenal.  We had two vegetarian sandwiches--the capressi sandwich and the Jamaican Jerk Avocado, and three meat sandwiches--the Argentinian Beef, the Cuban Pork, and the special of the day, which was a schnitzel sandwich.  Each and every one of them was spectacular and delicious.  Also individually made and we loved the chef.  Two of our party had coffee, which was delicious, and the whole meal was very affordable.  We would definitely return","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went for the Wings and Clams on a Monday night ($0.40 a piece).   Luckily, and I do mean luckily, somebody just left a table and we were able to snag it.  this place has about 5 tables up front, 3 in the back + a dozen or so seats at the bar.  All the TVs were showing the Home Run Derby which was ok. Wings:  We went through a few of the styles. Blackened:  Very dry, as if they were cooked a bit too long.  Nothing interesting Maryland:  Ok.  The spices were nice, but much like the blackened, cooked a bit too long. Extra Hot:  We ended up ordering this twice.  The first batch was average, the 2nd batch was much much better.  The wings were nice and juicy.  One thing that I did  not like was that the Extra hot was just hot enough to be spicy, but not what I would label ""extra hot"".  Especially with Hot and Mild under it. On Fire:  This is literal.  This stuff is HOT HOT HOT.  Hope you have water nearby.  What I don't like is that this is the next tier over extra hot, but in reality it is more like 3 levels hotter. Honey Mustard:  Average.  One was cooked a bit too long. Clams: We had these steamed.  They were pretty run of the mill.  However, some had a bit a of sand in them :( Overall had a good experience, but the distance makes me doubt I will travel that far.  I have a Hooters nearby and even though the wings are fundamentally not as good, they are cheaper and right near me.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been to many pizzerias in my day, but I must say the one place where the taste of the food remains constant; no matter how many times you go is L&B's. It's a place where its cool to just come and chill out with your friends; over some amazing pizza. Of course, they only have a restaurant right next door to the pizzeria; but personally, I'd have to say they're known for that pies, and square pies at that. There's just something that sets it apart from other pizzerias; maybe its the sauce, maybe its something else, but whatever it is; I was extremely satisfied the first time I went and every-time thereafter.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Paprika was definitely my go-to place for brunch. I recommended it to all my friends and came by any chance I got but since the management changed, so did the quality of the food. The brunch menu went up from $13.50 to $15.50 and they removed the mimosa/bellini/juice from the prix fixe which is sad but not why I'm giving it 3 stars. I was happy that they kept the soft poached eggs on the menu, as it is my favorite but when I got my dish, half of the polenta was cold and lumpy. I didn't send it back because this was very surprising to me, as paprika had never disappointed me before and I didn't want to make a big deal about it. After leaving, my friend mentioned that her dish wasn't very good and that the management recently changed bringing me to write up this review. Paprika was a wonderful place. I understand that changing staff is a hard time but you can't serve cold food. I hope this is just a rough period and it'll bounce back as a great restaurant, until then, I will be having my brunch elsewhere.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I discovered l'angolo randomly over the internet over 5 years ago, the first day I moved to Philly. Had very good reviews and decided to try it out. What can I say... It truly became my favorite spot in the world. I am Italian, born and raised in Milan, and as you can imagine I have experienced a lot of terrible Italian food in the US. But L'Angolo... is just like eating in my grandma's kitchen. BYOB, the ambiance is amazing - cozy, great decor (yellow walls, murals... you feel like you are in the Tuscan countryside), you always recognize people at the tables (those who discovered it keep coming back every week....)... The staff gets a 10/10 (Nino is the best, nicest, most efficient and most entertaining waiter I ever met), the music is never too loud, it allows for plenty of conversations. It's just a happy place. The food... I tried the whole menu at least once, and I enjoyed every dish. Worth of notice: grilled romaine, prosciutto wrapped asparagus/shrimp, calamari, spaghetti allo scoglio, spaghetti alla bolognese, veal milanese. But after a couple of years my absolute favorites are: entrees: funghi al forno (baked mushrooms)... With fontina, a bit of garlic, parsley... absolutely delicious (and light.. you don't want to fill up before the pasta dish!) pasta dish: gnocchi (they make them 3 ways: shrimp sauce, gorgonzola sauce - my fav- and baked... not always on the menu but if you ask they'll do it for you). Just incredible. Homemade, perfect texture, the sauce is not overpowering.. meat/fish: the special of the day never disappoints. But after the gnocchi I doubt you will have more room... (portions are abundant) dessert: chocolate cake with raspberry sauce (unbelievable) All my friends who tried it fell in love it with it. I celebrated there every single birthday and special occasion over the last 4 years(including 21st bday and graduation dinner...with my italian family). I now moved to NYC and I've yet to find a place so genuinly good, homy, unpretentious. So in conclusion: high quality food, excellent staff, low price (appetizers are 5-12 dollars, pasta dishes are 13-20, food and fish 15-30, desserts around 10). I would recommend it over any other place in Philadelphia.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I want to love you... and, so far, I think I just might...in time. Definitely still has some kinks, but I think people are missing the point on this. It's a burger joint, not a five star restaurant, remove the sticks from your collective behinds and enjoy the vibe of this pleasant spot on the Piazza. THAT being said, the burgers are solid and fast-food'ish without making you feel like you want to kill yourself for having eaten one. The onion rings are also delightful. They seem to be made from a batter similar to that of a zeppole for those of you familiar with those little tastes of heaven indigenous to the Jersey boardwalk. They're more doughy and soft than the usual crunchy fried rings you would get elsewhere. Less greasy, too. AND, the highlight...the milkshake! I shared a Caucasian (with chocolate ice cream) with a friend and it was pretty awesome. Not too heavy, but a good mix of alcohol coupled with a classic milkshake taste. All in all, it was the perfect amount of food and we got to enjoy it all while watching the Phillies game on the crazy huge Piazza screen. I'm a fan.","[1.0, 0.0]"

(Scallops). Warm lobster salad was pleasant as well. Halibut - was fishy and flavorless and I normally love Halibut. Tortellini - pretty decent. Duck was cooked well but the vinegary corn that came with it didn't work for me. Dessert was just ok. I don't think I would come back with so many better options in the city.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am not one to write reviews, but this was truly one of the worst dining experiences I have had in my 9 years in Manhattan. I had a lunch reservation that my secretary made for me and a client.  When we arrived (albeit 15 minutes late), the host, without any trace of hospitality, said that he had no record of my reservation and then immediately turned his back on us and did not return to discuss the possibility of seating us or figuring something out. Back at the office, I asked my secretary to call the restaurant to find out what went wrong.  She was hung up on midway through her explanation. Obviously this type of treatment is unacceptable anywhere, but in a restaurant of such lofty ambition it is an even bigger disappointment. I had really been looking forward to this lunch, especially since my other times at Yasuda had been so enjoyable.  After this experience, though, I can say with confidence that I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone given the risk of being treated so poorly and rudely.  No sushi, however delicious, is worth that kind of treatment.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I didn't know Scott Conant was behind Scarpetta until I saw his picture in a pamphlet by the register when we showed up for our reservation.  My little brother and I got a kick out of recognizing him as the picky guy on ""Chopped.""  Now I see his smug mug all over TV, and you know what?  He deserves to be famous, smug, even.  Scarpetta rocks. Let's get the incidentals out of the way.  The atmosphere was swank without being over-the-top.  The service was nothing out of the ordinary, but helpful and attentive enough.  There was one snag when the wait staff forgot to put in an order and it came when we were already getting full, but otherwise, no issues.  Anyway, now to the food. The bread basket was outstanding.  One of the offerings was a strombolli, a practical sandwich with layers of smoked mozzarella, salami, basil, and cherry tomato.  It was a small course unto itself, savory and flavorful.  The rest of the bread was great, too, with nice crusts and fluffy insides.  The basket was served with eggplant caponata, olive oil, and some beautiful smooth mascarpone butter.  I defy you to find a more impressive bread service anywhere. Our table of seven split three appetizers - fritto misto, creamy polenta, and braised short rib - and they were all fantastic.  The fritto misto was a delightful assortment of squid and vegetables prepared tempura style.  I'd never had a tempura without sauce that wasn't worse for its lack until this dish.  The squid and the batter were flavorful, and crispy tempura herbs and thin lemon wedges made sure that every bite was exciting.  The creamy polenta with a fricaseee of truffled mushrooms was tremendous, just out of control delicious.  The mushrooms were earthy and fragrant and offered a firm bite that contrasted well with the perfectly creamy, corn-forward polenta.  The braised short ribs of beef with vegetable and farro risotto was the least of the starters, but it was rich and meaty and good in its own right. The adult half of our table went family style and everything was wonderful.  The standouts, though, were definitely the pasta.  The spaghetti with tomato and basil was $24, and until you try it you'll be unable to fathom how it could be worth every penny.  I've tried Conant's recipe at home, and while it yielded a great spaghetti, I couldn't replicate the finesse and intensity of flavor.  You cannot leave Scarpetta without trying this spaghetti.  It was tauntingly, impudently simple, but delicious beyond compare.  The texture gave a great chew with a lovely amount of bounce-back resistance, and that peerless tomato sauce and basil oil were so consummately incorporated you would think sauce and noodle had been born together, a perfect whole like Venus from her seashell.  Don't squirm at the sticker price - this is the Platonic ideal of spaghetti. I know I've labeled the spaghetti as the must-get, but a couple of the other pastas were just as amazing.  The duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction gets a lot of attention, and deservedly so.  This was the goof-up dish that came towards the end of our meal, and that was unfortunate as it was delicious but very rich.  That said, it was easy to eat considering the unctuous ingredients, and the flavors were intense and luscious.  The ravioli had a great texture, too, again demonstrating Scarpetta's mastery of pasta.  The black tagliolini with mixed seafood, sea urchin, and minted bread crumbs was incredible, as worthy of praise as the signature dishes.  The squid ink pasta was a supple al dente, and it came with fresh mussels, squid, and shrimp.  The sea urchin added a briny creaminess that could come from nothing else, and the bright green minted bread crumbs added color and cool flavor.  The only pasta I didn't love was the short rib agnolotti with hazelnuts, brown butter, and horseradish.  The pasta was nice, but the dish was heavy and a bit cloying. We also tried the black cod with caramelized fennel and concentrated tomatoes.  This was a great piece of buttery fish and the accompaniments were tasty, but it wasn't as memorable as the pasta.  Ditto the roasted sirloin with horseradish potato puree, baby spinach, pickled shallots, and braised oxtail sauce. Desserts were lovely.  My favorites were a white chocolate semifreddo with strawberries, white balsamico, and basil syrup, and a banana budino with pecan gelato and an oat tuile.  The semifreddo was very refreshing and the strawberry and basil made a brilliant team.  The budino was like concentrated banana bread, gooey, dense, and flavorful.  A chocolate cake with burnt orange-caramel gelato and espresso sauce was another delight, and the chocolate and vanilla parfait with hazelnut milkshake and biscotti was solid, served with juicy blackberries. I'm being effusive here, but I don't think Scarpetta is capable of being overhyped.  When spaghetti with red sauce costs $24 and still puts a smile on your face, you know you're eating somewhere special.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The only reason I gave this restaurant two stars is because the food is good. BUT, the quality of the food does not compensate for the rudeness of the owner, who also serves as a waiter. The first time we attempted to try the restaurant, we were taken aback when the owner (we did not know Mario was the owner at that time; thought he was a rude Maitre d') --rather than greeting up plesantly --demanded, ""Do you have a reservation?"" We did not, as we didn't think it was necessary for an early evening during the week. While there were a few tables available, the only one he would offer us was one near the door, where there was a draft. We didn't stay, but decided to try again on a recent cold, winter night. This time, the restaurant was relatively empty. Still, he tried to seat us near the door. We politely asked if we could be seated at another table, where it was warmer and he barked that they were ""for four people."" Never mind that another couple was seated at a table for four. We eat out often and have been to many of the best restaurants in the country, as well as some mediocre restaurants. Still, we were not prepared for what the owner said next:""Well, you can sit there, but if I get busy I'll have to move you to another table."" Say what!? Move us in the middle of our meal? While we should have left then and there, we did not, as we were hungry and it was frigid out. Because of the threat of being moved midmeal, we sat at a drafty table for two. Needless to say, we were uncomfortable and could not really enjoy the food. When the check came, we also found it awkward tipping the owner, who had served as our waiter.While it is most surprising that a resturant owner would be so unwelcoming, I see from some other Yelp reviews that others had the same experience at Il Triangolo. Update: Mario felt the need to weigh in on the review above with a dismissive,""Oh please...What a long story just for a table."" So, not only doesn't he have any qualms about threatening to move someone midmeal, he apparently doesn't think it's important for diners to have a  comfortable dining experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"INCREDIBLE!  Such great tacos!  I'm so happy this taco shop is open in New York, where it can be difficult to find Mexican food.  The Adobada (or known in Mexico City as ""tacos al pastor"") tacos were so flavorful, and the Carne Asada tacos nearly melted in my mouth, with the most tender, tasty beef!  There was so much meat in each taco, too!  Great value for the price!  Usually I want something sweet after eating something like a taco, but these tacos left me wanting nothing else.  The ingredients are high quality and so fresh!  We will return again and again!  Thanks for the experience!  Love, love, love!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Really enjoy the varying menu and quality food and ingredients. Each time I have visited there is a special menu with some new awesome creations. They have a great 4 vegetarian dish meal. Which varies from quinoa to plantains with cojia queso. Haven't tried anything I didn't like. I even got a mix of iced tea mint lemonade just the right amount of sweetness with snowy ice. So refreshing. Today as I write this I ordered one of the special dishes Chipotle Chicken Bowl. - Chicken lime rice black beans peppers onions corn and avocado. Muy delizioso.

"My friend had made a reservation here for a party with 10 people, my birthday party. Once we arrived, there was only 8 of us so they would not seat us until the other 2 arrived. Turns out it wouldn't have mattered anyway as the tables which were ours were still taken, even 45 minutes after 8. By the time we were about to sit, they tell us that there is only 1lb of meat left. Recall that we had a reservation, which is actually more of a meat reservation than a seat reservation, and they still ran out. We were pissed and stormed out, walking down the street to Fette Sau instead. What was the point of a reservation if we couldn't order any brisket, and we couldn't get a table at our reservation time? If you are a reader who pays attention, you should be questioning why I gave this place a 5-star review, despite all that happened. Well, my buddy who made the reservation sent an email to the owner telling him what happened, telling him that it was a big time fail and an epic embarrassment for him and my birthday party plans. The owner responded with an actual paper card with a handwritten apology, and a gift card on it. Epic customer service + apology + acknowledgment that you were in the wrong = excellent review and repeat customers. After that service, the meat would have to be pretty bad to get a negative rating from me, but luckily for us, BrisketTown meat is amaze-balls. I have been here once before and must say that the quality of brisket is like no other I have found in the city. The exterior rub is out of this world, and the meat so flavorful and tender. Definitely worth a trip if you call yourself part of the NYC meat scene.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"If not for an issue of Time Out New York featuring the best eats in Chinatown, I never would have discovered Spicy Village, one of my fave new cheap eateries. Having lived in Flushing for 25 years, home to some of NYC's best Asian food, I naturally scoffed, since I was sure there was nothing new the TONY editors could tell me. But alas, I was proven wrong, as they led me to this little gem on Forsyth Street. It isn't a very big restaurant, and there's limited seating so there's almost always a wait on weekend nights. The experience can be brutal in the summer as there is no air conditioning, but I say it's worth sweating it out for a bowl of delicious hand-pulled noodles (""hui mei,"" as it's called here) that'll make you sweat some more from a different kind of heat. The highlight of my first visit was a shared dish aptly named ""Spicy Big Tray Chicken."" Basically it consists of chopped up dark meat chicken pieces (yes, there are bones), cilantro, star anise, and red chili flakes swimming in a vat of hot chili oil. For a couple bucks more, you can have them add hui mei, which I highly recommend. This will easily fill two people even if you aren't ordering anything else. I also had the spicy beef brisket hui mei on a separate occasion, but it was less memorable. Still tasty though. In all likelihood you'll be back for round two, but if you come to Spicy Village just once, the Spicy Big Tray Chicken is a must.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Love the feel of this place. I'm not a New York native or even frequent visitor, but walking into here felt like stepping across the ocean to Europe. The place was decorated for the holidays, and panettone's were stacked everywhere wrapped in shiny red cellophane. Inside it was packed with people in for a quick standing-room-only coffee or bite at the bar, or sitting down at the tiny tables for a nice lunch. We managed to find a table, and had coffee to start. The cappuccino was ideal, and tasted excellent with perfect velvety foam. I had a great panini with smoked ham, tomato, goat cheese, gruyere, and camembert. The combination of the three cheeses was decadent, it was one of the best hot sandwiches I've had in a long time. I can't ding them for the tight seating. I'd much rather have a small seat than none at all, and it was entirely manageable. I loved the service as well, the man helping us was very clearly a native Italian and had a great sense of humor. All in all a place I almost want to return to New York to go to again. The whole experience was one of the best lunches in recent memory. Certainly deserving of all 5 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had dinner with my roommate here for Restaurant Week, and overall our dining experience was satisfactory. The service is really great, and the ambiance is laid-back but trendy and a little romantic. The space is surprisingly smaller than I'd anticipated, far fewer tables than I would have thought, which I actually found endearing. The strawberry and basil gazpacho for the amuse-bouche was refreshing and very summery, a nice jump-start for the palate. The peekytoe crab salad app was fantastic - light, subtle, and well-balanced - and the mango and asparagus in the dish were a perfect complement to the crab without being overwhelming. The fried chicken was a little on the dry side for my taste, but the sauce on the side provided a real kick of flavor that, along with the sweet corn, tempered an otherwise underwhelming reaction to the dish. To be fair though, my roommate and I both grew up in the south, so our expectations of fried chicken are a little higher than most. The warm chocolate cake was a delight, so sweet and rich and sinful that it pulled me straight out of a chocolate dessert rut I've been in lately. Given my high praise of the service and most of the food, I'm sure it seems odd that I've marked this only as three stars. I did find the food enjoyable and certainly wouldn't mind having the crab salad and chocolate cake again soon, but I did feel a little underwhelmed at the end of the meal. Everything was certainly good, just not mind-blowing. I wouldn't mind going back to Perry Street, but the food wasn't earth-moving like I had hoped. Overall a decent meal and experience, just not one I'd gush about and badger my friends to try.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Having been to Thailand and been blown away by the spices and bright, intense flavors of the food there, I am picky when it comes to Thai. I'm not fond of Joya and I found little redeeming here, either. The mango salad was topped with plenty of mango, which was nice, but the remainder had little Thai influence - just a few whole peanuts sprinkled on lettuce, onion and tomato with a vinegar-heavy dressing. The dinner special was dull -- the red curry was very mild, with overcooked bits of chicken and shrimp inside, and theoretically some vegetables but I don't really remember what kinds. Beef in basil was ruined by the leathery beef chunks, and also included carrot slices and tough cabbage bits. The curry was served over mushy pad thai noodles, and they were comforting and pleasant, but that's the best I can say. The wine list was minimal, and started off with $6 for a glass of Yellowtail Shiraz.  Sigh. Borrrring.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm writing this review with a heavy heart because I'd love for my favorite Philly brunch place to stay line-free on Saturday mornings. Food: Strawberry Basil pitcher - Okay, basil in strawberry lemonade seems a little bit strange at first, but the basil is a really refreshing touch that really grew on me over brunch. That said, I don't think I would order a $12 dollar pitcher for two people again. It's a lot! Deviled eggs - I'm a sucker for deviled eggs. If memory serves, Farmacy's deviled eggs were pretty good, but unless you love deviled eggs, I'd probably order a different appy. Amaretto French Toast - Honestly, I'm usually pretty underwhelmed by ""special"" french toasts at various brunch places. You can't really go wrong with French toast in syrup and some fruit, so it's almost cheating! However, The Farmacy adds a delicious layer of crushed almonds to their french toast. That alone puts it above and beyond most other french toasts I've had. Rum French Toast - The amaretto is better, but it's nice tasting hints of rum in the syrup! Smoked Salmon and Capers Sandwich - Very well done smoked salmon sandwich with some great fries. Not a standout, but a very solid choice. Fries - Great the first time, you can definitely taste the richness in the duck fat. Since then, they have began to cut thicker fries, which is actually less fantastic.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Maybe when I went to Eulogy for the first time the bartender was in a pissy mood, maybe he had blue balls, I don't know. But since being there a few times more I am now a fan. To get more into detail, since I reread my last review and decided that I was just mad at them, they do have a very small bar. It is hard to walk through without being in the way of many people. Lousy atmosphere and a shitty bathroom. The past couple of times the bartenders were really nice though. They obviously don't have a lot of time to explain much about the beers so I do recommend having a basic knowledge on the subject to help yourself out. They do get really busy. Pricey, but a worthwhile stop right across the street from Triumph. Knowing now more than I knew then Monks does have a more exotic beer selection. Eulogy has a GREAT beer menu, but it's true Monks has beer you won't find anywhere else.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Let me be perfectly clear, this review is in regards to my first visit to the Sarcones Deli on Haddonfield Rd in Cherry Hill, NJ. A few hours after eating the Italian Hoagie I purchased on July 13, 2007 (Yes, Friday the 13th), I became violently ill and throwing up 6 times. I attribute my illness to Sarcones because I was the only one to eat at Sarcones that day and all of the rest of my food was shared by other family members and they were not sick. I was sick for two days. This may be an isolated experience but why should I try again. Even if I did not get sick, the hoagie was not great. Their trademark bread was too crusty and dense for a hoagie, probably good for garlic bread and pasta. And the amount of fillings was small at best - like you get at Subway. Definitely one of the worst hoagies in Cherry Hill NJ. Try somewhere else for hoagies. Suggest Gaetanos in Maple Shade where they know how to make a great hoagie as well as cheese steaks.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The owners of Tiffin have attempted a four star restaurant on South Broad Street. The project, so far, is not convincing. The property itself is awe-inspiring. One of the few places in Philly that manages to take you away from the location and immerse the diner into a new atmosphere. The food itself is excellent, with well prepared dishes and intricate flavors. IT truly takes indian food out of the context of takeout  and buffets and into the realm of fine dining. That alone is a great accomplishment. However, the problems of this restaurant are organizational, and at the prices one pays here, they are fatal. Service is glaringly inept and unorganized. At this level of fine dining, service needs to be ever present but invisible.  Service is overly invasive and often inept. The staff also doesn't understand wine pairings,  or appropriate wine service. The wine list is both wildly overpriced (a 35000-500 percent markup) , unorganized, and poorly selected for the cuisine. This place needs a great deal of work before its worth the high price tag it is asking.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm going all in on this one. I don't dish out the Fivers....(like how I used a diner pun with 'dish'?) too often and feel this one is well deserved. Tops is a Diner like no other I've been to in Northern NJ, the menu is huge, the portions are generous, the prices fair, the environment warm robust clean and up beat and the staff of excellent. They just got it all right at Tops and I'll be back pretty soon! I found the review for tops here on Yelp and gave it a shout out of utter curiosity. Straight up I like the location, this part of East Newark is a fairly abrupt and jagged intersection of industrial old Newark and new gentrification.....its anything but typical and sorta sets the stage for authenticity. There was a huge line.....clearly that's a good thing as everyone agrees with me that Tops is worth waiting for. I sat at the counter and saddled up for a solo meal. Now, what I really like about Tops, the reason I think this is the best diner in NoNJ is the little things. Here's what I mean. 1. Instant greeting by an energetic person 2. Menu is page after page and its not your basic laminated diner menu. Its just a bit elevated and different. 3. The coffee mugs are a full 16oz mug....its a big mug and that just feels nicer. 4. The butter is cool whipped butter....not frozen wet packets that ruin the bread ....the little things. I ordered a chicken breakfast quesadilla with hash browns. I asked for the potatoes to be cooked a bit crispier. The meal came out quick and hot and was falling off the plate....and was perfectly done. I mean lets be honest.....diners in NJ are ""good enough""......they all mostly look the same, taste the same and cost the same. Heck I don't even need to read the damn menu any more. Not tops.....there's something special happening in that kitchen and its well worth the wait. I'll be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I would recommend the Azuki since the rest aren't really impress me at all. The crepes somehow come different in standards, the Azuki green tea that is made by the Asian lady who assumed to be an owner impressed us right away.  On the other hand, the other two crepes that made by the employees come out much smaller in size as well as the crepes weren't cook well at all.

"A very first time in my life I've experienced the charge for a a glass of a regular water ! Wow! they called it a bottled water, or whatever , but this is a regular kitchen water that you pay $5 for! Incredible! When you pay $64 for meat combo at the place ( normally $17-$25 at other places) , even that seems to be OK, but to pay $5 to drink a regular water ( they call it ""filtered"" water ) seemed weird to say the least. Obviously the management lost a control over their desire to make an unreasonable 2000000% of profit! oh, well. At least they should of tell you , that you've been charged for a smelly glass of water , but NO! The waiter just tried to make a sale without letting you know in advance, you're being charged for that! the management refused to comment. Will send this to consumer affairs to find out their opinion on it. Oh, the food? Spicy , sometime unreasonably spicy and salted over the top. Other than that - solid 3 stars for the meat , 2 - for the tasteless  fish ( side vegetables have been charged for separately! ) , 1- for not telling us that we've been charged for water , and the same 1 for the service ( they changed the waiter 2 times during out dinner) Will never come back , but perhaps sanitation department would be interested to take a look at that 'filter' system that magically turns a glass of stinky kitchen water into $5/glass one.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sorry to say that I was pretty disappointed with this place. The reviews on yelp are great, so I expected great. Positives: the place was nicely decorated, had a warm feeling to it, service was decent, they didn't rush us out, and it's byob. Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. For appetizers we had the ginger calamari- calamari was okay, sauce was not really a ginger sauce , but rather more of a duck sauce. Pretty much your standard calamari that you could get at a pizza joint though, nothing special. Had the breading of more of a Greek style fried calamari, which is lighter, not the ones you typically get in Italian restaurants. We also had the mussels marinara which were alright, i don't like new zealand mussels because they are too big and chewy, but I have to say the marinara sauce was good. Dinner I had the Zuppa di pesce over spinach which was fine, but not anything out of the ordinary. Sauce was probably same as used for the mussels, and while there was a ton of calamari in it, there wasn't too much other variety. Plus, the shrimp was way overcooked. All others I was with seemed satisfied with their dishes, but again, nothing much to say beyond that. All in all it was just OK,  but will not return here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"cheesesteak with onions and chiz whiz! WAAA WAAA WEE WA! After an hour drive from Atlantic City we decided to head to the city of brotherly love for lunch and it was worth the trip!

Although it was over 90 degrees and the line was overflowing to the streets (thankfully no one got hit by a car in the process of waiting) I didnt mind getting a little tan in the process. If you turn 180 degrees the competition (GENO'S) was just across the street and they had pretty much the same amount of customers overflowing to the streets. Originally our plan was to order at Pat's then head to Geno's for a comparison but after one cheesesteak at Pat's it was a wrap! GREAT FOOD! Who would have thought of cheese whiz?

"This review is for Palma Apertivo. We initially tried to go to Palma, but were advised there would be an hour wait for a table but could wait at the bar next door Apertivo. We initially declined as we were so hungry, but after walking past Apertivo couldn't help but stop for a drink. The bar has a gorgeous, cosy environment with beautiful flowers everywhere. And it turns out the full menu from Palma was available at the bar, so we ended up staying there the whole evening. Food was absolutely incredible. We shared the Cavolfiore Palma (Cauliflower) and Insalata di Barbabietole (beets with goat cheese and walnuts, and then I had the Orecchiette alla Checca (pasta with fresh heirloom tomato, garlic, buffalo mozzarella and basil). The pasta was a simple dish, but perfection! Service was incredible as well. There was just the one guy managing the bar and serving food in the bar and he was attentive, very accomodating and  helpful with picking great wine.

"The place is very small and fills up pretty quickly. Food was awesome. I had the Curry puffs and the Red Curry Chicken. Curry puffs where very fresh, and the Red Curry had the right amount of heat. Service is not the best when they are busy, I will be dinning there again.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is one of the most disorganized breakfast spots I have ever been to. You walk in and are greeted with a line, or are you? Nope. It is just people waiting for their order. It was really confusing. So you have to walk around the pool of people to the register area to place your order. The cashier was really friendly and helpful, hence, two stars. But then it took 25 minutes to make an egg and cheese sandwich and I do not have that kind of time. My issue was that they made orders of people who appeared to be ""regular"" customers before my order. The place is cute, but very small. Too claustrophobic for my tastes. The food was good, although it was luke warm for coming off a grill. I've had hotter microwaved eggs from WaWa. I certainly won't be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is definitely a hidden gem, tucked in a nondescript Central NJ location on Route 130.  We definitely did not expect much when we first came in (it's a somewhat quiet restaurant in the ShopRite complex by the Renaissance -- with Afghan music fleeting softly and only a few patrons), but this restaurant should definitely get more exposure in the culinary map of New Jersey. We tried the fried cholays as appetizers, which are utterly delicious little pockets of flavors. We ordered the lamb gyro, and it's one of the best gyros we've tried -- with very soft and rich lamb (and does not have the typical ""lamb"" smell). The Chicken Tikka Masala then came in, and the rice that came with it -- we found out called kabali (sp?) is plump and sweet and exploding with raisin and carrot, compliments the well-cooked kabobs. We also ordered the afghan burger. Originally we thought it's just an american import into an afghan menu, who cares. It turned out to be one of the best burgers we've tasted!! But don't let the simple look of the burger fool you. The burger has deeply flavorful patty that are topped with layers of sweet, thinly spicy sauce, mixed with tomato ketchup, and a slice of lettuce. Compared with all the other american burger entrants, this burger tops the list! (Sorry Five Guys, Red Robin, Smashburger, even In-n-Out!!! :-) Pricewise, this restaurant also beats the other restaurants, hands-down. It's truly a quantity and quality combo punch. We'll definitely come back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"When the sheep are headed to Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern, be the smart one and veer off from the lines and head to Da Legna. This place will have pizza to satisfy those salivating for great New Haven pies, but it also has small plates for the customers that come along with pizza-goers who want something else. They also have a commendable micro-brew selection. This place won't have the lines that the others will, but you have to ask yourself the reason behind this phenomenon. Could it be that Da Legna is less established than the other three and that the masses are just following the herd? Da Legna is my number one pizza choice. Even if yours is Modern, you should remove yourself from the trough outside sometime and try out Da Legna one block away.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Stopped in here because the weather had gotten warm (time for a shake) and because I had heard their bahn mi was one of the better ones in the city. The staff were all very nice, and my sandwich was ready fairly quickly.  I knew I couldn't finish both my avocado shake and my whole bahn mi and not feel like my stomach would explode, so I opted to enjoy my shake in the sun while walking to the D train, and put my sandwich to the ""does it hold up for a 45 minute ride home"" test. The shake was interesting.  Also it was huge.  I was very full when I decided to just toss the last bit out.  I LOVE avocado, but I've never thought to add sugar and milk and turn it into an icy shake.   I had ordered the roasted pork bahn mi, so it took a little longer to make than a #1 would have.  I had asked for medium spicy, however, I'm not used to jalapeños on my bahn mi, so that took me by surprise (and I therefore took it off the other half of the sandwich).  Other than the jalapeño, though, it wasn't that spicy at all.  One thing I didn't like about this sandwich was the bread.  I wish I had read in advance that they toast it, and I would've asked for it as is.  That's why I gave this place only 4 stars rather than bumping it up to 5.   I like that they offer quite a few variations of the sandwich, and the decent list of hot and cold drinks is nice as well.  If it was more convenient to get to, I would definitely be in here often enough to try more of the sandwich and shake options, however, it'll have to be just a nice treat when I'm in Sunset / Borough Park. I've tried quite a few of the options for bahn mi in NY and while I haven't tried all of them, this is definitely near the top (other than the bread), especially considering the price and the options.  If you're planning on having a picnic in Sunset Park, or wandering around Greenwood, this would be a great place to stop for lunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I came here with an Italian friend of mine. Living in Seattle, we don't have place like this. He was really impressed with how authentic this place is. I got the prosciutto di Parma. He told me it was just meat & bread and I was a bit worried as I like the traditional American style sandwiches with lots of stuff in there. The sandwich is not very big but it was good enough for a snack. It comes out hot from being pressed on the panini grill. My worries about the lack of ingredients were quickly washed away. The prosciutto was so good it didn't need a partner and being warmed it gave it a nice smoky flavor. I'd definitely come back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The hype brought me here. The pizza made me linger. Upside - The pizza was good. I mean I'm not a fan of artichokes so that made a little bias going in but to my surprise it didn't taste too bad at all. Of course it will take a bit more to convert me to full artichoke eater but this was a start. The service was quick (once you got past the line) but that's baseline expectation for a pizza shop. Downside - seating isn't that great, lines are long and cash is king (ok this was my fault mom always told me to carry more than 5$ in my wallet). I'll have to try another flavor next time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Fantastic tacos and bowls.  I guess this is the non-corporate version of Chipotle.  I've been eating at this place since it opened in my neighborhood and have to say that the food is great. The food is fresh and made in front of you.   You can smell it grilling from a mile away, which is one of the best things for this place.  The tortillas are not overly greasy like how some places make it.   I almost always order the steak plate - tho some of the servers in there insist on calling it the Carne Asada platos. At one point early on they advertised delivery, but I think they took that away in like 2 weeks.  It's too bad, because if they delivered I'd probably order a whole lot more.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The review written by ""Nancy P."" on 12/26/14 is exactly what we experienced the same night at 6PM.. In my opinion there was NO good reason they were understaffed that evening based on the number of reservations made in advance. Money is not my issue, I gladly pay for VALUE rec'd, however, spending close to $400., sans tip for dinner for four left me wit a bitter taste, excuse the deserved pun.We had one round of drinks and after waiting a half hour the second round was ""comped"" with an apology about the ""poor"" service, ""poor"" is my word. They're known for charring their steaks but that night the charr turned out to be BURNED  for all of the meat dishes plus the very small Froie Gras was bunnt on the outside and ""runny raw"" inside, the Sea scallops fared no better. Prior to the main course, they dimmed the house lights REALLY low, I remarked in jest it was done to cover up the foods appearance, regretfully, maybe I was correct. In my opinion, I feel whoverer was manning the grill was NOT their regular person and was overwhelmed by the amount of orders resulting in burnt, nt charred meat. I cannot fault the four person wait staff which included 2 men who were pressed into service.I'm sure the kitchen was also understaffed. Upon departure, I was asked ""how was dinner""  I did not reply nor was one needed. Many years ago, I was told ""you're as good as your last job"" !!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food was amazing Indian fusion - it reminded me of Indian Accent in New Delhi - and the space was handsome and unique.  I'm giving it 4 stars our of 5, however, because the portion size/price ration is just obnoxious.  We especially liked the perfectly cooked pork tenderloin and the tandoor chaamp.  Also the chicken biryani - it was rich, flavorful, fragrant, spicy - kind of homespun in appearance but please don't miss it.  Absolutely delicious.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Knowing nothing about this place before walking in the door, other than it was highly recommended by a Lebanese friend of a friend, I was happy with my experience here.  We happened upon NYC restaurant week, and while I'm not typically a fan of RW, it turned out to be a good deal for the money - $38 for 2 appetizers, an entree, and dessert. The best part of the meal was definitely the appetizers: hummus, falafel (they look like brownies), chanakleesh (feta cheese with tomatoes), and moussaka. After reading the reviews, I'm a little upset I missed out on the magical brussels sprouts.  I think the chanakleesh was my favorite.  It was a little funny how the server used his spoon to mash it onto the plate to ""make it more edible"" as if we wouldn't have been able to eat it otherwise. The warm whiskey drink was ok.  A bit too sweet and luke warm.  The Monsanto wine was delicious.  My entree, the only vegetarian option - a risotto with butternut sqaush was not very good.  Not creamy enough, not enough cheese, the rice under cooked and definitely lacking in spice and flavor.  This was disappointing after all of the fantastic appetizers.   The dessert was too much.  We ended up ordering the Knafe Bil - an upsidedown cheese tart.  We thought that 2 of us had to order it, in order to get it, since it stated it was a 2-person portion.  We ended up being served two giant cheese tarts, which was enough for about 10 people.  It seems like a waste to serve so much.  I even took it home and ate some a few times after that.  It's really similar to baked brie. The atmosphere is large and spacious, especially by NYC standards.  My friend described it as ""dated"" but I was happy they played Portishead during dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Well Surfish piqued my interest from the beginning when I saw that the chef Miguel won on my favorite show Chopped. So of course, I want to see what this talent was bringing to the table and eventually my tummy. And I have to say it was a good plate of delicious flavor. So my favorite guy and foodie partner in crime, were on our way to another restaurant, and decided lets take a look. Surfish was a bit empty, so we took a chance and we were able to get in. I have to agree with other reviews, that the restaurant is a bit small. We dined in the garden, enjoying that warm weather in March we were experiencing. The welcomed surprise were the wonderful heaters they had in the garden coupled with the candlelight at the table. It definitely made Friday date night a nice one. We started out with appetizers, which were the grilled prawns( which were not only huge, but just were bathing in this awesome goodness of a sauce), and cerviche mixto of seafood. We definitely were happy with our appetizers, as well as the wonderful homemade plaintains, and blue chips coupled with an awesome spicy sauce and fresh salsa. As for me, I was trying my best to not fill myself up on the starters, so I was trying to contain my joy of the chips and apps. So instead just loved the Alberino wine, recommended by our server. With every bite of the starter, I think the anticipation of our meal grew. So then came out our entrees, I ordered the paella and he had the pollado. I think both of us, looked at one another with bursts of joy that we found our new favorite spot. The pollado incorporated tender pieces of dark meat in a yummy sauce, coupled with mashed potatoes. Now who does not love, mashed potatoes drenched in a yummy sauce. And if u don't, just stop reading right now. I have to say I really enjoyed my paella filled with mussels. I did opt to not include chorizo, but I thoroughly enjoyed my food. The portion was generous to me, since I did dabble in his plate for some of that yummy chicken. I definitely recommend this place, for all the foodies looking for a reasonably priced good meal. Cool date spot, I bet in the summer time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Today I took advantage of the beautiful and not yet overwhelmingly humid 80 degree weather to traipse down to the East Village for a tasty bowl of ramen with friends. We were a party of three intent on trying a new place and arrived promptly at noon for lunch. I was surprised to find Minca empty! I almost cackled in delight at the zero minute wait and lightning fast service. I ordered the Toroniku ramen with minca broth and thick noodles. It came quickly and was not a disappointment. I didn't enjoy my broth as much, I felt it wasn't as flavorful or well-seasoned as Ramen Misoya or Hidechan. However, the portions at Minca are comparable and the meat, I felt, was actually better! Really thick and sizeable pork slices, with a good strong charred soy taste. I didn't like my thick noodles as much here, but my two friends seemed to enjoy the thin and wavy noodles. The wavy noodles looked most similar to traditional ramen noodles found at other like-minded shops. All in all, I am glad I listened to Yelp- the walk from Astor to Alphabet City was worth it to try Minca! They have a great selection of noodles (thick, thin, wavy, buckwheat, etc) and broths. My only disappointment was their lack of lunch specials. This won't prevent me from going back to try the Spicy Miso though ^^","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is heaven to me.  I love Italian food and Italian grocery stores!  For those like, this is the place for you.  First off this is more than just a store and restaurant - its a MARKET which includes multiple restaurants, coffee shop, gelato shop, and a meat and cheese bar. My story begins as such.  My wife had gone there with her girlfriends a month or so before and when we were in the city celebrating new years eve she suggested that we stop for a meal at Eatly.  I was amazed at how AWESOME this place was.  We put our names down for a reservation at their pasta restaurant.  We were told 45 minutes which we were happy to do so we head over to the meat and cheese bar and order a plate of their finest salami and assorted cheese and a couple of classes of pinot noir.  As it turns out our table was ready so much quicker so after quickly canceling our order we headed to our table. Once seated and after reviewing the menu we ordered the mozzarella dish, lobster linguini and two glasses of their house pinot.  The mozzarella was amazingly fresh - almost straight from the COW it was unbelievably delicious.  The lobster linguini - GOOD GOD MAN - was out of this world.  I said above that I love Italian food so I might be going a bit overboard on the review but EFF IT the food was that EFFING good!  To add the wine was divine and helped wash down all that pasta and cheese! In conclusion, I will be going again.  I'm almost considering making a day trip to NYC just to eat there again and I live in Northern VA.  BOOM!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Nothing like setting the night off proper. In the adult sense of course. A few of us got together for a nice cultural evening at the opera and decided to do dinner beforehand. We decided on Village Whiskey as we are all seasoned whiskey sippers. I've heard the restaurant was good but man... Now, I won't call it a proper restaurant, nor will I call it a pub, but I will call it a great idea that has been executed with style, class, and gusto. It's a small spot a little wider than a narrow bar with some booths and some tables. Simple, clean, and it has elements of both new and old... But enough about that... On to the food. When looking at the menu you almost think to yourself, hrmmm, this is a small menu. And you're right it is small. But the food isn't really the point, the whiskey is. Anyway, this small menu packs a pretty big punch. Since there were 4 of us we ordered a few things and shared. We had the deviled eggs, which would've made your Mennonite grandmother proud, the tater tots which were crunchy on the outside and buttery smooth on the inside, pickled artichokes with some toasted bread and the fried cheese puffs which hot damn... I want a platter next time. We all dug right in and were immediately impressed. The prices on these apps were incredible too. $3 each for most of these at a Garces restaurant??!? What!?! Sweet! The whiskey. The menu was HUGE! Our server was knowledgeable and if we had questions about a particular whiskey she was happy to give a brief synopsis. The specialty drink menu was also a force to be reckoned with. I had an ""Old Fashioned"" that would have made my father proud. My buddy Mike had the APA which consists of a few awesome ingredients like hops infused vodka and egg whites. Sounds strange but tastes amazing. The main course - Because whiskey isn't dinner. I had the Village Burger. I am going to go ahead and rank this burger up there with some of the best burgers in the city. I ordered it medium and it came medium. Check! I topped it with bacon, gruyere cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavor of the fresh grass fed beef was incredible. My wife had the pulled pork and that too was incredible. The pork was nice and tender, juicy, and flavor packed. We split a side of the duck fat fries with the cheese sauce too. These fries are to die for. In the end we left fat and happy. The awesome whiskey list had us buzzing and the great eats left us jolly. We waddled our way over to the opera and had a great night. Village whiskey gets the win.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I saw some pregnant lady smoking while she had a toddler in there. There's darts there and it's awkward because if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to walk through the game. The bathroom is weird because it seems as if you're going into the kitchen but instead you're going down this narrow hallway. Once in the personal bathroom, glance at the mirrored walls and pretend you're in a Hal Hartley movie or some European fashion magazine. I give it 3 stars for the music and bathroom.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here on the later side (after a dinner crowd would be there) with a friend last night. Da Legna opened a short while ago and I hadn't heard much about it yet. There was no room at the bar so my friend and I sat in the dining room area. Da Legna has a HUGE menu, like, unprecedentedly so. (Unprecedentedly is a word? Awesome). My friend and I decided to choose from the artisanal pizzas and went with the Torina - baby spinach, caramelized onions and tomato, and goat cheese. The pizza tasted fantastic. The flavors were really blended well. We got the smaller size of the pizza which was fine, but I could also see getting a large and splitting that as well, though the prices were fair for either size ($13 for a 12 inch pizza). And I'm basing these prices on the fact it's a special pizza rather than a standard mozzarella and sauce pizza. My friend and I also got some drinks and this is probably the only slight downside - a bottle of Magner's was $6 when usually a pint costs that much. Not sure how much domestic bottles cost. My friend's beer was also $6. Also I do *not* understand the mason jar thing. I really dislike drinking out of mason jars but people seem to think it's cool, so maybe I need to revamp my understanding. It just feels like those old people who used to wash out and reuse jars of jelly for the same purpose. Give me a glass, jeez. Anyway, service was pretty good - staff is friendly.

"I was very impressed with the restaurant. A lot of other reviewers focused on the size of the restaurant, which to me makes no sense, as it's the food I care about... So I felt the need to write my first Yelp review to try to add my take.   Like I said, for me the food is key, and this food exceeded expectations. I went with two other friends on a Saturday night at 8pm, and I was worried about not getting a seat since we didn't have reservations. The Chef/Owner came out personally and was extremely polite and helpful. After a 10 minute wait, we were seated. It is communal seating, and the tables are small, so if you have personal space issues, this is not the place for you.   BUT the food was FANTASTIC.  It's all small/medium size plates, and the three of us were a bit worried, when the waiter recommended we order 6-8 items. We ended up starting with 4 items on the menu, and it was MORE than enough for the three of us. The green mango paneer was a unique take on that dish, and the herb flat bread it was served with was scrumptious. We also had the scallops, pork buns and zucchini hummus pizza. We had absolutely no complaints with the food. The flavors were a great meld of familiar Indian/Asian spices used in unique ways. The Lychee-Prosecco martini was delicious, with real lychee flavor, and at $7 dollars was the cheapest NY cocktail I've had a while, for a generous portion. All in all- highly recommend this restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here twice. The first time was for dinner and the good was AMAZING. I had the chicken under the brick and it was as juicy as I heard that dish could be. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Drinks were interesting too. However I recently came here for brunch and what everyone raved about, the short rib Benedict, I really did not enjoy. It was bland and odd. And the egg wasn't runny enough or didn't have enough hollandaise. My experience is a toss up but I like the space and location so maybe I'll give it one more try for dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Although I am not a fan of the name change (Shinju was so much cooler), they got everything else right.  First FS kept everything good about about the old spot (namely the fresh and innovative sushi) and fixed the things that were holding it back from sushi greatness, namely: - More tables translates into shorter lines - More space; tables are further apart (you can still talk to your neighbors, you just don't have to anymore) - More sushi chefs = less time waiting (and drooling over your neighbors food) Bottom line: This is the best sushi for your $$$ in Philly!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was extremely disappointed with our treatment by the staff this morning.  This is the objective facts of what happened:  My party of 3 arrived at 11:20am, and we were told by the hostess that there was a 20 minute wait, which I thought seemed a small timeframe, but I believed her.  After 10 minutes of waiting, I noticed that we were #5 on the list of 3+ parties.  There was a concurrent list for parties of 2.  They seated a party of 5 who arrived after us prior to seating us.  We witnessed another party of 3 who arrived before us and had been told 15 minutes speak to the hostess about the fact that they had been waiting over an hour, and she responded in a frustrated tone, ""We can't control how quickly people eat and move along.""   80 minutes after we arrived, we were finally seated.  I asked our very nice waitress if I could speak with the manager on duty.  She wanted to know why, and I told her about our waiting experience.  I told her she could pass the message along herself or she could send the manager to our table.  A slight man, who apparently had told someone who arrived about an hour after us that there was ""no wait for you"", came to our table and apologized for his hostess's lack of hospitality and because she hadn't offered us coffee the whole time we waited.  He also responded to jrg's comment about how the hostess almost got punched after she copped the attitude with the other party of three, ""That would have been cool.""  He also told us that it was her first day on the job.   Perhaps it was a confluence of bad behavior, or perhaps it was a new restaurant still growing their busy legs, but I will definitely think twice before I return on a Sunday morning.  I'll ask myself, is it early enough to go?  is it late enough to go?  how hungry am i?  how much patience for way underestimated wait-times do I have this morning?   Additionally, I noticed a large bottle of vodka and a bottle of champagne in the drink area despite the lack of alcoholic options on the menu.  I found it to be odd but forgot about it until right before we left when I heard the cork pop and 4 glasses of mimosa be served to a table in front of us.   Perhaps this might be a place where it helps to know somebody?  I'm disappointed because I do want to like this place soooo much...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too crazy in there.

Also got the salsiccia pizza (some sort of meat and olives on it). It was alright. Again, salty, but that's probably because of the olives. I've definitely had better pizza. We tried ordering dessert but it was taking FOREVER for the tiramisu and panna cotta to arrive. I asked about the dessert for the 2nd time, and they said it was on the way. It wasn't really on the way, so we cancelled it.  When we did that, the waiter seemed really peeved.  Whatevs. It's a cute and cozy restaurant, and they gave my friend's kid some colored pencils and coloring sheets, so that was cool.   It's a nice addition to the neighborhood, but I don't feel a particular need to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Their food is good - the Turkish theme is a nice twist to the normal coffee shop menu. But the service is awful.  Every time I go in I am made to feel like I am inconveniencing the staff.  In almost all my experiences there, the staff is sitting with friends or other employees, talking, usually very loudly.  The last time I went here the woman working the counter was very clearly annoyed that I had come in and disturbed her telling her friend a story.  She quickly threw together my drink, took my money, and went back to talking to her friend.  Usually the employees are louder than the patrons of the shop, surfing the internet and laughing hysterically while paying customers try to get work done or at least enjoy a quiet break.  It's just not worth it - I can go down the street and get coffee and not have to put up with rudeness and unprofessionalism.  It's a shame.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have now been here twice, and all I can say is to STAY AWAY. I went on the opening weekend and the service was terrible. They mixed up orders, forgot some food, and it was so so at best. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and figured it was just opening jitters. So I went back again last night, and it was a HUGE mistake. Their food is just not special at all. Everything is bland, and lacks seasoning. I was served loaded potato skins on old dead lettuce, and nothing else. I had to ask for sour cream, and the plating just looked pathetic. The hamburgers had zero seasoning, and they mixed up how they were supposed to be cooked. The fries had zero seasoning as well. The buffalo wings are mediocre at best, and just have a very simple buffalo sauce on them. The only positive this time was that our waiter was very helpful, and pretty much apologized for the food being terrible. That was a nice step in the direction service wise. If you are looking for something cheaper its an okay place, but you aren't even getting what you pay for. I'd rather go to any other place in town.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Koreans like myself are natural born trendsetters and hipsters (if you've been to Korea, especially Seoul's Hongdae and Apgujeong Neighborhood, you know what I mean). Not that I'm saying this place is Korean or Korean owned/operated, but it really reminds me of the many cafes or coffeeshops in Seoul due to its detail, bohemian, vintage looking interior. Books on the walls, a Piano, multiple tables, a bar, an outside seating area in the backyard (when the weather permits!!), this place is probably a gem in the neighborhood of Greenpoint, a neighborhood neglected by many and probably hated by hipsters since it's right next to Williamsburg. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. The noise level is average so don't come here to talk or laugh out loud. Most patrons are working on their laptops during the day while sipping some Espresso based drink. There is a restroom for your convenience as well. You are also a subway ride away from Long Island City if you need to get to Queens or even Manhattan. Coffee is decent here and prices are reasonable. Prices range from $2-$2.75 for Americano or Macchiato and a bit more for specialty drinks.

The beer selection was good, hence the two stars but the rest of it left a good bit to be desired.

I got the burger with potato pancakes, cuz having lived and studied in Germany and Austria on and off, I never turn down an opportunity for one. The potato pancake was thicker than the burger patty and three times as greasy! I could have gotten a bigger burger off the Wendy's dollar menu, and it wouldnt have been served to me mooing.

"Locanda Verde is a perfect spot for brunch, lunch and dinner.  It has a great cozy atmosphere with a reasonable noise level.  You can even pick up coffee and pastries on the go if you don't have time to sit down for a full meal.   The menu offers diners varied choices to select from -- whether you're craving fried chicken, seared scallops, pasta or seasonal vegetables all for relatively affordable prices.  The wine list, whether by the glass or bottle, offers something for everyone. Overall, a great addition to Tribeca!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I was brought here for the first time on a Valentine's Day date night and it was great. I've also been here for both regular lunch and dinner, and let me tell you that Obao does it right. There are about a dozen if not more Thai restaurants along 9th ave in Hell's Kitchen. Obao really sets itself apart. Decor: awesome. Service: on par. Onto the food: Calamari appetizer: HUGE pieces of squid lightly breaded with a decadent dipping sauce. Amazing. Steamed dumplings appetizer: also very good. Pad Thai: comes with shrimp unless you request otherwise. Topped off with a poached egg. Nice flavor too. Kee Mao: you're typical spicy noodle. Same silver bowl presentation as the Pad Thai. Also great flavor. Pad Kra Pow: a must try. Hard to explain but will say that with most noodle and rice dishes, it is a sautée of proteins vegetables and rice/noodles. In this dish, the rice is serve separate so you can truly enjoy the tasty flavors of the dish. Clay Pot Catfish: served in a Clay Pot and a really nice portion of lightly fried and seasoned catfish with vegetables.  This was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. Thirsty? Try the Thai iced tea. Looking for alcohol? The cucumber patida is great as are many other of their craft cocktails. Well, what are you waiting for? With an $8 lunch set for an app and entree I'm surprised you aren't already there. I personally can't wait to try more of their options to see what else they have to offer.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I found Jamaican D's, well after circling around Spring Garden for nearly 20 minutes trying to locate the icon on the Yelp map, I discovered Jamaican D's because Denise Soul Food was closed again. I've written off Denise Soul Food (Pink Truck) because they are never open anymore. I ordered the Oxtail dinner for myself, and the Jerk Chicken for my wife. The food portions here are much larger than the portions from the Pink Truck, or any other Jamaican food establishment/trucks I've eaten at. The wife and I believe the Mac & Cheese, and the other sides are better at Jamaican D's. The candied-yams, which is particularly is not known as a West-Indian dish, were a little different than what I've had at other places. Jamaican D's gives you three sides with their large platters instead of the standard two. With that said, I believe the jerk chicken at Denise Soul Food (pink truck) is still; well, was better than most. The oxtails were decent and the gravy was flavorful, especially over those rice and peas. Unable to get solid Jamaican food from my favorite place as of late, I am forced to search the region for a suitable alternate. Though I am not ready to settle, Jamaican D's looks like a feasible option for time being. I plan on trying all the dishes this truck has to offer.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Offer an awesome array of awesome sauces on the side and keep the ketchup on hand for the purists. You offer poutine (Canada's answer to disco fries). Somehow, you make people want to bathe every meal they ever have again in chicken gravy. You use some fufu French cheese and still manage to keep yourself from being pretentious. You're awesome.

"Excellent service at bar by Mariah!  I have food allergies and she never makes an error and catches the ones the kitchen makes. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't eat here so often. She is an outstanding server, with great attention to detail,hard working and quick to serve but still makes you feel you are appreciated as a customer. Love the bar bites menu. Unlike other places it's available whenever kitchen is open.  Biggest complaint is unreliable hours of kitchen. Although they state they serve food late it seems to be dependent on how cranky the evening chef is(different chefs different late nights) They advertise late dining but late night menu change over and kitchen closing varies as much as winning lottery numbers. I usually call first to see if the kitchen is closed or not and have gone elsewhere when they close early. Bar in large part due to Mariah has built good following especially with late food. Many servers from other restaurants come here. However, when kitchen closes up early it kills the bar off. Seems to lack any management at night.

"I drove until Midwood as I was told that it was the best place of NY. I was ready to wait, I was in a good mood. When they told me it would take 1 hour to 1,5 hours to get a full pizza I said OK. After 1hour they told me it will only take 30 min if I wanted slices, otherwise it would be an extra hour for a whole pizza. I said OK for the slices (16$ for 4 slices!!!). 30 min later the slices were not ready, they said it would take an extra 30 min for the slices, or 45 min for the pizza. They pissed me off: honestly, am I ready to wait for 2 hours to have a slice of pizza? this is ridiculous. If I want a proper Napolitan pizza, I'd better take the first plane to Sorrento. At least I will sit in a proper restaurant while I wait, instead of standing like an animal, ready to jump at each other's throat for a slice of pizza. They say the wait makes it better. In my case I passed that stage: I wasn't hungry anymore so I left after 90 min of waiting, without any pizza not slice.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Fresh & delicious food in a reasonable-sized portions with quality good-old mom-n-pop lovely service! This is vegetarian's delight! I've had three visits and I can't say enough good things about the place. Here are the items we ordered: Mumbai-style vada-pav. Now, we wanted them to be extra spicy, and they came out so good in taste, texture & overall experience - All 3 visits - so full marks to consistency! The second thing one of our friends ordered were Samosa and she said she had never had them any better. Then, the host brought Paneer Methi Tikki, on-the-house, because I had said I'm not sure why but I wasn't thrilled about this item on our first visit. He was so proud of his Paneer Methi Tikki that he wanted real feedback this time. To my pleasant surprise, I had nothing but praise for it this time. Then he revealed how this is his best-selling item and that he was fulfilling an order of 200 dishes of it tomorrow morning only!! We all shared his gift and liked it so much, we ordered two more!! For the meal on today's 3rd visit, our party ordered Mysore Masala Dosa, Masala Dosa, Biryani and everyone was very pleased with their portions, amount of cooking and level of spice. The dessert, although they suggested we try their Rabadi (they serve that with Jalebi on Thursdays, I think) and Rasmalai, we stayed with our old favorites of Pista Kulfi and Malai Kulfi and both just kept the great experience intact! Finally, I'm a sucker for Indian Masala Chai (cooked tea) - and the owner, God bless her, makes it customized for me and my guest. It tastes so great I had two cups - with my dinner!! There's a TV that plays latest Bollywood music albums! Got to say, it's a pleasant surprise that you get your food in real china restaurant-style plate and with right type (stainless steel) of fork-knives & spoons. I hate to name drop, but we used to go to Dimple's before and loved their food too, but it seems like for the last couple of years the quality there has tapered off significantly.

"No stars. Not a one--the one I gave is because Yelp requires at least one. Have been twice, once by choice and the experience so bad that I would never have gone back...but the second time was a special occasion and the honored guest chose the restaurant. Aside from the lovely gentleman waiting on us, there was nothing good to report...For the prices, this place is a scam. The rolls are about as good as you'd find in a grocery bread aisle.  I found a rubber band in my apple slaw, which itself tasted like mayonnaise with some cabbage and apple in it,  and a long hair on my tuna (once thing is an accident, two is a real lack of attention to something). The desserts were unspeakably bad. Again, the prices, for what you get, were insanely ridiculous. It's as if they know the Penn kids will pay so why bother...Otherwise, I don't get how the place stays in business. The wine and beer selection is tolerable.

"Okay -- you should stop reading this review right now and RUN (don't walk!) to Citrico! What a fantastic little place. The food is out of this world delicious and cheap, with huge portion sizes! It's a tiny space with an open kitchen: there are probably ~10 tables and there's space to sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook. I was fortunate to have a $40 groupon, but their prices are so reasonable that my boyfriend and I had to purposefully over-order to get past the $40 mark. We took enough food home for at least 2 more meals. Besides some non-alcoholic traditional Mexican beverages, they also have sangria and a few beers. We ordered: Horchata ($3) - Delicious, definitely get it if you're a fan! Guacamole ($7) - Pretty good! They add pomegranate which gives it a little something extra special. My boyfriend loved it and practically ate the entire bowl himself. Esquites ($4) - Corn off the cobb! I was super excited to try this since I can't eat corn on the cob right now and I was just a tad disappointed- it's really watery, almost more like a corn soup. The flavor was different and interesting for sure though. I liked the spices and the taste, but my boyfriend was not a fan. Chicken Tinga Quesadilla ($5!!) - This is a total steal for the price and probably my favorite bite of the meal. GET IT! Torta de Milanesa de Pollo (8!) - This is a hefty sandwich for the price! The flavors were spot-on.. I loved the breaded chicken, avocado and jalapenos on a nice soft, squishy bun. Yum, I'd definitely get this again. Chile Relleno de Tinga ($13) - We also really enjoyed this dish- it was moist, flavorful chicken on top of a poblano pepper with a tasty mole sauce. I'd get this again for sure too. Carlota ($5) - YOU HAVE TO GET THIS. It's an incredible citrus cream pie. Forget key lime pie- this is way better! A little sour and a little sweet, it's perfection.

"I was so excited to try Cafe Luluc. Having just moved to the neighborhood, I thought this might be my go-to brunch spot. I was wrong. Neither of us could even finish our meals, and not for lack of hunger or having unduly picky palates. I'll start with my meal: the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and scallions. When I order scrambled eggs out, I expect them to be somewhat more special than I would make at home: slowly scrambled, creamy, decadent. These were nothing like that. The salmon was old, dry, and oversalted, clearly unsold from dinner the night before. The scallions were few and far between (but some people like that, so I won't fault Luluc for that). But the eggs...they were the worst. Overcooked, dry, rubbery, with none of the beautiful texture or flavor you hope for when you're paying someone ten bucks to scramble you a few eggs. They may cook them in bulk and just leave them in a warm pan until someone orders. They were awful. I've had better from highway rest stops. My fiance ordered the gravlax salmon eggs benedict. He is a big, hungry, non-picky midwesterner, and he didn't eat most of his plate. The hollandaise sauce on his poached eggs had hardened slightly as if it had been poured over the eggs a half hour before. The outside of his eggs was rubbery, and the inside was actually cold. Cooked through and not runny, but COLD. I know brunch spots often poach eggs in bulk and reheat them, but these were not only improperly reheated, but dressed with hollandaise in advance. His gravlax was dried out around the edges, and the english muffin on which this whole mess rested was not even toasted. The sides that came with each of our meals were equally subpar. The French fries were lukewarm and mushy, like they are when you think you're being thrifty and take home half your burger and fries and try to reheat them in your oven the next day for lunch. The salad was probably great when it was made, but it was made well before I ever saw it. It had tiny chopped tomato and dark leafy greens with a really nice dressing (maybe a basil vinaigrette). Unfortunately, the greens were limp and wilted by the time they got to us. I'm giving Luluc two stars. The food deserves one star, but I will bump it up to two for the cute ambiance, decent service, and not-deplorable coffee. I hate wasting time, money, and calories on a meal that's less than delicious, and I came away from Luluc wanting to cry at the loss of a brunch on a beautiful day. I don't know if we were just particularly unlucky, but this was one of the worst meals I've ever had, let alone paid for.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My first time at Burrito Box, I asked the guy behind the register what was their most popular vegetarian burrito.  He said portebello mushroom and spinach burrito and that's what I ordered.  I was surprised how HUGE the burrito was.  And the free chips and salsa with every order is definitely a plus!!  With the burrito, I couldn't really taste the portebello mushroom because it was mixed in with all other ingredients.  Overall, it was good.  I went  back there a week later and ordered the portebello mushroom w/ hard tacos.  The portebello mushrooms smelled SOOOOOOOOO good!  And tasted great!!!  My only compaint was, the tacos were VERY soggy!  That was a disappointment =(  And this past weekend, I ordered the veg chilli, which was ok.   I definitely agree that this place is better than Chipotle's.  First, Burrito Box has much more items on their menu.  Second, their food is MUCH tastier!  I used to eat at Chipotle's so often that I got a little tired of their food, but I don't think I'll be tired of Burrito Box since they have much more choices! Someone mentioned the fact that they don't take phone orders for pick up.  I called them up and tried to place an order for pick up, they guy said ""no.""  I asked why.  He sounded a little annoyed.   He explained that they used to take phone orders and people called in but never come pick up the food.  I think it would be MUCH more convenient for the patrons to be able to place phone orders instead of waiting at the place, since there's NO place to stand!  That's a little annoying =(  Since I live only a couple of blocks away, I'll be back often!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Maharlika pride itself on its modern twist for Filipino cuisine, but the only thing that they manage to twist was my beloved wallet! No only are their dishes overpriced, but to pay for something that taste mediocre was some what criminal and insulting to my taste bud and my love for good food, especially when I had really good Filipino food before, and what they served was anything but that! Despite their lovely decor, soft lighting and promising restaurant vibe, I thought their dishes were lacking flavors while others dishes were way too salty and overall just poorly made! Worst of all, their lack of quality control was appalling when they served us complimentary fried chicken skin chips with feathers attached!! Not only was it disguising to look at, but this was not an isolated incident as I found a bunch of feathers on other chips as well!! If their food was good, I wouldn't mind paying more!

"I am so glad to see a collection of rave reviews for this Indian restaurant.  I was a fortunate attendee of their lunch buffet.   To me, Indian food is as comforting as food gets.  I think it runs in my genes, as my parents are avid Indian food fanatics and the gene has been passed down to me.  However, I tend to not regularly frequent Indian restaurants, as it is considered an indulgent treat.  I've only experienced a few Indian lunch buffets here and there, in the several cities I've lived in (ie. Austin, Boston, Nashville). That being said... this is the best Indian lunch buffet I've ever had.  It was SO good, and there was such a large variety of foods offered.  The buffet did start out with an array of salad-y foods, all of which were interesting and tasty.  Then.. there was this beautiful round-plate display of chickpeas, vegetarian samosas, pakoras, and even a mashed potato or chickpea food that added flavor and character to the display.  It's hard for me to describe this so you can picture it, but imagine a heaping serving of curried chickpeas in the center, surrounded by layers of mashed potato/chickpea, fried appetizers and naan bread.  Sound too enticing to handle?  It was that enticing.. and that good. There were several hot dishes offered, though it's a little too long ago now for me to remember every one.  I know there was dal, or lentils.  There were two chicken dishes, one saucy and one a dryer curry.  Both were good, the saucy one in particular.  This was not your standard tikka massala.  Thankfully. There were two different desserts offered.  Some other reviewers claimed they were too full to try.  Well... there's always room for dessert.  The kheer (rice pudding) had an interesting texture, less pudding like and more grainy I'd say.   What a fabulous find in a fabulous neighborhood of Philly.  If I find myself in the City of Brothery Love (and great food) and someone exclaimed ""Indian"".. I'd know exatly where to go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What a pleasant discovery off the main drag.  The owner was a charming and most hospitable host, introducing herself to each of the four of us when we entered and giving us some background on how a Peruvian women came to be a wonderful Italian chef (the wonderful is my word, not her's). We ate in the enclosed outdoor dining area, which added to the ambiance. Service was quite good and the servers were pleasant and efficient. The food, for the most part, was excellent.  The special house salad was wonderful, as was the special combination shrimp and scallop dish and the fish entree (the chicken dish not so much).

"Hmm. I really wanted to love Bin 228. I might return eventually for a glass of wine but last night's experience didn't leave the best taste in my mouth (literally). I arrived with some friends for a 6:30 dinner reservation. Immediately, the hostess started arguing with us that my friend only made a reservation for 2 people while it was really for 3. Eventually, another (hostess? waitress?) admitted that she screwed it up when writing in our reservation and my friend really DID call in for three people. Just an odd way to start the night, and apparently the second time my friend had issues with reservations here. So they ""fit us in"" around 6:45. While small and a bit cramped, the wine bar itself is lovely with exposed brick walls, wine racks, local artwork, and a setting overlooking Bushnell park. Very nice. Our waiter was quite pleasant although not terribly knowledgeable about the wines. However, he was happy to let us sample two wines before making our decision. We ended up opting for a bottle of an Argentinian Malbec which was superb (around $35 for the bottle). The cheese plate was quite nice, although it would have been helpful to have a list of cheeses on the menu rather than a vague ""cheese plate"" option. Goat cheese, taleggio, and something rather smoky, paired alongside pickles, grapes, fig compote, and a lone strawberry. Fairly standard as far as cheese plates go. I was really bummed about the panini I ordered. So much so that I couldn't come close to finish it. Proscuitto, fig, caramelized onions and asiago cheese sounded like the perfect combination of sweet, salty, tangy (and I've had paninis with the same combo before) but what I ended up getting was just wrong. WAY too much salty prosciutto, the ""caramelized onions"" were raw onions BARELY sauteed, and the fig was practically nonexistent. Sad! The food took forever to get there and once we were done eating, we were essentially rushed out because they had a reservation at 8. C'mon. With so many great reviews on this place, I certainly had high hopes and perhaps I'lll make it back eventually. Although, I'm sad to say, probably no time soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I grew up eating homemade Mexican food thanks to my stepmom and I must say, this is Amazing food. We live outside the delivery area, so we treck up there for the delicious food. Outside of Mexican food in Jackson Heights, this really is One of the best MX eateries in Manhattan. The immediate area is a bit sketchy, but totally worth it. Don't let that fool you (and if it does, youre not worthy ;)). Also seems pretty clean, the service was pretty good as well. There was a bit of a delay when I needed salt and when we wanted our check because they weren't paying attention to us (you know, I waited 1 min instead of the standard 15sec), but service is very friendly. Cute inside! The only thing is, it's small, so be okay with that. The only reason i said not good for kids is because its small- big strollers, crying not happening. Also, bathroom clean (extra plus!!).","[0.0, 1.0]"
My experience was not good at all... me and my husband came to this cafe round 4p.m. and it was empty - no guests at all... the waiter was very rude. it was the first time we tried turkish cuisine and the waiter was not helpful at all... we orderer lentils soup... the waiter didn't warn that the soup was boiling hot and I burned my tongue!!!!! we also ordered Yayla Tava with lamb... oh my god... I cook much better!!! the meat was tough and the rest of the dish... simple as 2x2 and really nothing special... by the way... we had to wait for our dessert (Künefe) round 15 minutes while Yayla Tava and soup came out very quickly... Nevertheless I noticed that this cafe is very busy in the evenings and I guess it is just my opinion and personal experience... oh by the way - the bread was delicious,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"My husband and I came here last Friday. We ordered the potato and pancetta caramelized onions, applle and goat cheese pizza as our appetizer. Well, I know pizza is not an appetizer, but my husband insisted to order, so...Anyways, we really like the pizza! It's very different from all the other pizzas I've ever had! There wasn't too much gost cheese, so it wasn't very filling like pizzas in New York or Chicago. It was very special! I ordered Penne garlic scape cream, pine nuts and seasoned breacumbs as entree. The pasta was very well cooked! Quite chewy but not too hard! Love the texture, but I thought the vegetables in the pasta was a little too salty. My husband got the pork butt milanese, argula, balsamic pickled onion, and tamato. It was actually a large piece of fried pork chop. My husband and I both like it a lot! The pork butt was not dry at all, but I wish it came with some sauce! We also ordered the baby jesus cake was also good! It was also something very different from the cakes you usually get from a restaurant or bakery. Service was a little slow at the time, but it was a good experience overall.

"When you go all the way out to Queens for dinner, might as well make it a Bunker bang bang. The friendly waiter had assured us that we had more than enough food ordered the first time around, but when we finished, we decided we just had to have more! The usual suspects were good (crepe, summer rolls, curry chicken), but the winners for me were the Surf and Turf (perfectly seasoned beef and shrimp that I could eat for days) and the pork chop (prepared traditionally, but really well executed). Also, the tapioca dessert is a good, light way to end the meal. After the meal, I learned that it's only a 30 minute Uber back to lower Manhattan, which is actually not that bad considering it's the best Vietnamese food I've ever eaten...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A lot has been written about Little Owl's food (which was great) so I would just like to add that what I really appreciated most about Little Owl was the lovely service and homey feel to the place. We'd been given an hour wait, so the girls and I walked around the neighborhood for a bit. Just as we were about to walk in and tell the maitre'd that he needn't call my cell as we'd be hanging out at the (cute!) bench out the door, maitre'd comes out and addresses me by name to tell me that we would be seated shortly. Granted it was a Monday night and it seemed quiet, but I didn't think he'd remember exactly who was waiting for the next table. He also gave us the option of squeezing in a 2-top, or wait for the 4-top, but the party in the 4-top apparently tends to linger. I think it says a lot about the place that they know their frequent visitors so well! Oh, and the arctic char and the halibut were great- well seasoned. The asparagus risotto was nice and light, great for an app, and my only complaint about the calamari was that I would have liked to have more of it. Mildly disappointed to discover they don't have the burger on the dinner menu, though. Truth be told, I had my heart set on it all day. Can't wait to go back! I'd love to have brunch here, too.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I could cut and paste Bethany L.'s experience word for word. Even sounds like the same server. Same drafty table. I think I got that table because I opted to not use the coat check in case I got a drafty table! After that I was most likely  assumed to be a cheapskate.  Major attitude from staff and not even in a classy way like Lucy was treated at the Brown Derby on I Love Lucy Funny thing is I have a friend who is a well known singer who introduced me to Joe Allen a few years back. This was my first time there without her. We always got a great table and great service.  The big joke is as legendary as she is she is not an over-the-top tipper.  Last night I would have given a 40% tip since we only got the burger and soft drinks.  As a former server myself that's what I do for polite service. Not this time baby. Unless I go back there with a celebrity or someone who looks like one I will never go back!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

I have never been disappointed and love that they also add fresh coleslaw to the mix (which goes in the sandwich). The bar seating is more fun, whereas the table seating is really uncomfortable, the small metal chairs are hard to sit in after about 10 minutes (but maybe that's how it was designed!).

We tried both the Ani Ramen and their spicy miso ramen. Broths were good, but not fantastic and very forgettable. We ordered their chicken wing appetizer which was yummy but only came with 5 wings for the price. For the quality of the food I'd consider this the typical ""Montclair"" surcharge.

The mint pesto just didn't match the rest of the dish at  all. It was a very awkward combination. And the texture of the gnocchi was not smooth. The spaghetti alla primavera was lacking flavor. Very bland. I would not go back. I will say that the service is very good. Our server was very attentive and pleasant.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Yes - it is true, sometimes, food does live up to the hype in the press.  I refused to go at lunch time with all of the sheeple (ok, I am being rude, but lines down the block freak me out - unless the people are in vintage Star Wars costumes).  So, I waited until the week after opening and got a coconut tiger shrimp sandwich to take home for dinner. A short wait, where I watched the tall, cute owner/chef talk to the staff and customers.  This guy really likes his job, and likes to promote his good, fresh food.  I really hope that they sustain that outlook, their great ingredients, and that this little hole in the wall stays in the neighborhood for a long long time.  Yes, $8.00+ is a bit much for a 6"" sandwich, but this ain't Subway.  You are paying for quality and taste. Three days later... WOW!  On a whim, I ordered the grilled corn with chili mayo, coconut flakes and chili powder. It was amazing.  I can only wonder how it will blow my socks off when corn is in season.  I will try it again in July and you may hear my screams of joy echoing through the tri-state area. And the catfish is great as well.  Well seasoned, slightly spicy, moist, juicy with the home made sweet soy sauce.  Get used to these updates, because I am going to eat my way through the menu over the next month or so.  My only criticism - get the corn to eat in.  Having it wrapped in paper to go makes it really embarrassing when you are sitting at your desk and licking the foil - just to get that last drop, and some one walks into your office...  (take it from one who has been there!) Next, I'll try their big restaurant, Kampuchea. A month later... I am in shock, because I just paid $15.25 for a sandwich.  Their new Lump Crab meat Sandwich was advertised on the chalkboard on the side walk, and I missed the 1 in front to the five in the $15.00 sandwich....  Verdict - the sandwich is GREAT - but I am still kicking myself for paying $15.25.  Shudder... The only reason I am not docking them a star is because the sandwich is good, and it was my fault for not reading carefully.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a new restaurant on the LES that opened about a month ago.  In that short span of time, my husband and I liked Yerba Buena enough to visit twice. Great atmosphere, Latin food and drinks at a reasonable price and the service is top notch. On our first visit, we actually had reservations at another restaurant, and by chance, happened to look in. Giovanni, the extremely outgoing manager, welcomed us and invited us to look around. We decided to stay for dinner, and were treated to excellent service and wonderful food.

The cocktails were also alright but not particularly memorable either. The food itself would've probably been a 3-star level, especially given the stiff competition in this category of restaurants, but the bread cart is a really unique touch. A bread connoisseur explains what all the breads are, and you can really tell that he's passionate about his art; all the breads we tried (and you can try multiple) were amazing. Service is excellent as you'd expect, and as other reviews point out the decor is pretty trippy - it's almost a self-aware, ironic stuffiness that works well.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I would not rush back to Cafe Cluny.  A colleague and I had brunch here on a Saturday afternoon, and neither one of us was too impressed. Food: Average and not worth the menu prices.  I ordered a burger for $18 and was asked if I wanted cheese or bacon (each $2 or $3 extra).  I don't know, something bothers me about charging $2 extra for a slice of cheese on an already expensive burger.  I was expecting a really amazing burger for that money.  Fail.  The burger looked like it came out of a microwave.  The bun was very plain.  They should try serving it on a brioche bun or seeded roll.  Or maybe some caramelized onions instead of a raw onion slice like you find at any diner.  My colleague ordered a quiche which was extremely small (about the size of a flat muffin).  There was a lot of crust.  I felt bad that she had barely anything to eat and gave her half my french fries.  Instead of serving a tiny quiche, they should try making full-size quiches and serving customers a hearty slice.  That way people aren't stuck with a lot of crust.  Drinks are expensive ($15). Atmosphere: The whole restaurant is very tight.  I didn't put my coat back on inside the restaurant for fear of knocking someone's coffee off their table.  The servers were pleasant but not extremely attentive.  It was quite warm in the back room (probably due to the amount of people squeezed in).  We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table (they don't take reservations for brunch). I think there are better options for brunch elsewhere in the West Village.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The menu had about 15 or so dishes such as coq au vin, steak tartare, mussels,  legumes and then cheese and pate choices. Each dish was made to perfection. For the 3 of us, we ordered 4 plates, 2 cheeses, and 1 pate and we were pretty full. A great place for a date or a group of friends. I will definitely be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Some of the best food I've eaten. Popped in by chance with two friends from work. The Mussels are to die for, I'm going back just for those alone! But of course we didn't eat only those, the salmon, pork tenderloin not to mention the Profiteroles, yum. Atmosphere is just as lovely, intimate, friendly and laidback. Recommended in a heartbeat.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We had a business dinner at Carmine's back in August and I must say that the wait staff was 100% perfect. They catered to our every needs and didn't miss a step. Kudos to Carmines and there staff. The food was so exceptionally prepared and if you are looking for an authentic Italian restaurant while in New York, Carmine's is definitely a place you don't want to miss.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here with my cousin and we ordered way too much for 2 people but we finished everything! The servings aren't as big as I imagined. We ordered: - Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings - Comes in 8, the skin is a little thick but it was still tasty - Wonton Szechuan Style- comes in 8; differernt from regular wonton soup noodles, they add a sauce to spice it up a little. I personally love the taste of it. - Scallion Pancakes- I though this was just ok...what's scallion pancakes without enough scallions. Plus, it's not like scallions are expensive! - Noodles- I forgot exactly what I ordered but it had a layer of sauce on top of it but I liked how it had udon noodles instead of thin noodles. It was delicious! If you're on line to get into Joe's Shanghai, try this place, it's just as good!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Even though Di Fara's is overly saturated with rave reviews, I must add my two cents on this place. I LOVE DI FARA! Definitely some of the best pizza I've ever had. Although it is NOT convenient in any way, it is totally worth all the inconveniences for a real NYC pizza experience! Di Fara is located in an unsuspecting part of Brooklyn (Avenue J between E 14th and E 15th St.) and there are no ""cool"" areas to hang out in the area. The restaurant is small, with seating for about 15 people, so consider yourself lucky if you get a table. There is ALWAYS a wait so be prepared! Last time I was here we waited over an hour for our pie, so make sure you come with a fully charged phone! :) The absolute best part about Di Fara is Dom DeMarco, the owner/old man that makes all the pizza. He scoots around the kitchen, individually preparing each pizza with his flour covered apron and hands. He is a true Brooklyn legend! When it comes to the pizza itself, I recommend the Square Pie. The crust is thick, crispy, and a tad charred (the corner slices are the best!). The pizza is very flavorful, with fresh, high quality ingredients. Dom is very generous with the olive oil and fresh basil on top. He cuts the fresh basil with scissors, which I find so cute for some strange reason. The Square pie is baked 2-3 times, so expect a longer than normal wait time if you decide to order one. In fact, Di Fara's is SO good that a guy once offered me $15 for a slice! (I didn't accept his offer but I did give him a slice!)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Recomendo a qualquer um que for passear em New Jersey, conhecer o Delícias de Minas, um restaurante super aconchegante, com ótimo atendimento, comida deliciosa, drinks perfeitos e além do mais nos proporciona um ambiente muito agradável com música ao vivo. Um lugar ideal para ir com os amigos e a família, para matar a saudade do Brasil e dos pratos típicos de Minas Gerais. Quem tiver passando por NY, não deixe de ir a New Jersey e fazer uma visita ao restaurante Delícias de Minas, vale a pena conferir esse espaço e passar momentos agradáveis em boa companhia.....Super indico e pretendo voltar na minha próxima viagem a NY.....","[0.0, 1.0]"

Ive been here multiple times and every time I come I wonder why I came again. The wine is the  only saving grace of this place ~ the food is ok at best and grossly under delivering for what you would expect but the worst part is the service. Every waiter and bartender is too cool for school and cant be bothered with any opinions other than their own. I thought a place that was driven by a love for food and wine would be open to a dialougue that allows place for hearing what their customers prefer. Apparently here its eithere their way or the high way. This wil definitely be my last time at any terroir locaction.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food was good, but not worth the attitude of the staff, we were put at a table much larger than our party needed, and when we asked to move to another table the hostess gave us every reason not to move us, she  finally said it was because the next reservation was for  a party of 10 people, that's fine so adjust the table after we leave, also after 90 minutes the hostess started walking by our table and kept looking at her watch which was very rude, she has absolutely no personality. Our dinner plates started getting cleared  from the table before everyone's meal was done. Bottom line the food was good but the service was not and I don't want to be rushed out of a restaurant . Too many other good restaurants where the service  and personality of the staff is better.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"As one of the few establishments in Philly where you can grab a dosa (or uttapam, if you feel so inclined), Philly Chutney Co. runs a pretty unique niche. I consider myself a connoisseur of all thin bready type foods, from pancakes to crepes to tortillas to flatbreads, and it had been at least a year since I last had a dosa, so I was excited to try these guys out. We both got dosas, which were huge, paper-thin, yet still durable enough to hold a glob of chutney before making it to my mouth. Crispy edges, softer and moister on the inside, and a bit nutty. Mmmm, I approve! The chutneys were great, too. We loved the garlic chutney (which was seasonal) and the tomato chutney. The dude working the counter even threw in a coconut chutney for us--how sweet! Good for a light meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Half priced deli!?!?  Well, nearly!  Compared to the two deli's just around the corner on Broadway, this place is a bargain (and better too).  This is also a perfect hangout just after seeing a play, or for an early morning breakfast.

Decor - beautifully painted murals of NY landmarks, teardrop lights, and an artsy cylinder ceiling over the counter (yelp.com/biz_photos/U5hC…).  It feels more like a cafe or a nice coffee shop, but make no mistake - this is a NY deli.  With its super large outdoor patio, this is a wonderful bonus offering (yelp.com/biz_photos/U5hC…). Service - it's a busy place, well staffed, but there is so much movement of people coming and going - you may wait a little between visits from your server (think European), but just soak it in.  You're probably on vacation, anyway, so just chill.  Really enjoyed Gabriel (""Gabe""), a nice guy pursuing acting in film and stage.  Ask for him before he hits stardom.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"i came here on a first date.  it's not a good place for a first date (so awkward!!) so apparently we had reservations.  of course, a table wasn't ready and we opted to sit at the bar.  it took at least 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention and get a drink.  and i desperately needed one. then what felt like an hour later (and two trips by said date to hostess desk) we were finally seated. the food was pretty good.  better than pretty good.  it was tasty.  but i think i felt so awkward because date actually said whilst i am looking at the menu 'don't worry about the prices.'  who says that?? but the whole atmosphere was stuffy.  and the boat is tilted, so you feel like you're walking on an angle when you get up. but again, not a first date place.  or any place i'd take a date.  unless if i were 55 and trying to enjoy my golden years. not a place to blow your money on.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This all began with Jim Halpert. In The Office, Jim and Karen eat at The Spotted Pig and I've been wanting to eat here since then. Finally, for spring break 2011, I was fortunate enough to spend a week in New York and out of the 2 dozen places we tried, this is my favorite restaurant. The reason? Three words: Chicken Liver Toast Holy mother of God. This $5 dish (and one of my momma's dishes) are the foods that I'd request to eat before I die (oh, I should update my Yelp profile). And sadly, there's a side of me that wishes I never tried it, because now life is remembered and divided as Pre-Chicken Liver Toast and Post-Chicken Liver Toast. Please open a location in LA! The burger with Roquefort cheese was a delight, make sure you order the toast and burger! The deviled eggs were okay too, but the other 2 dishes stole its thunder. When I visit again, I'm going to order 2 chicken liver toasts for myself! Ok, maybe 3, they're worth the extra hour of cardio! If I lived in NY, I'd definitely come here regularly. Oh, and the service was superb! We arrived at 6 PM on a Friday night and there was no wait :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

Skip the beef - too ordinary - instead, order more Chicken. The garlic is a good complement to other skewers. Yaki Don (sp) was a good way to fill up, where the flavors of the grilled chicken is soaked into the short grain rice. Solid dish. Service was typical Japanese - quick, polite, efficient. Definitely the best Tsukune I've had in the US.  Give the Tontoro (pork neck) a try.....","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went here solo for dinner on a Sunday night. It was pretty much empty when I arrived, but more people trickled in throughout my meal. The place is small but welcoming. There are some seats that are cushioned along the window, while others are stools. By the end of my meal, the stool was becoming uncomfortable. I ordered tapas - fried calamari, patatas bravas, empanadas de pollo, and a plate of olivas. The food came out fairly quickly, although not all at the same time. First was the plate of olivas which was small but good. Then came the empanadas de pollo - they are two medium sized empanadas with a dipping sauce. The empanadas were good but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The fried calamari was ok, but a bit stringy for my liking. Finally came the patatas bravas, which is a staple among traditional tapas. I was not a fan of their take on it - I couldn't bare the smell... it was as if something was burned. I think it might have been the sauce drizzled on top. I left the plate mostly untouched. The waitress did not check on me during the meal, and only came a while after to offer me water. I drank the water and waited another 10 minutes (clearly finished with my meal) for the waitress to return. At this point I asked for the check. The check came and I was surprised at the amount. They had charged me for an extra $23 dollar pitcher of Sangria - the only drinks I had were the water and a beer. It was not crowded at all... so I was a little annoyed at that - I only had a few items ordered and they couldn't get it right. I might try this place again down the road, but was not impressed with my first experience here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been coming to Anella since they opened up a few years ago and it remains one of the few consistently delicious New York City dining experiences. This restaurant is my go-to for friends and family visiting from out of town or for a romantic date with my husband. The space is cozy, rustic and warmly lit with a wonderfully charming outdoor garden where it's not unusual to see the kitchen staff clipping fresh herbs for your meal! Food is mouthwateringly delicious and the menu is constantly changing to reflect the season. The meal begins with warm, fresh baked bread in a flower pot, which I start to obsess about as soon as I walk through the door. My current favorite dishes are the Homemade Burrata, the Spicy Corn Soup (it's to die for - I hope it stays on the menu forever!), Ricotta Gnocci, Strip Steak, and the Chocolate Tart for dessert. Service is always friendly, attentive and informative. Refreshing cocktails and a nice wine list with some local selections. A rare & special gem of a restaurant!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My husband and I have been to Korzo numerous times for dinner and absolutely love it. I am compelled to rave about it even in my hangover haze after an amazing experience there last night. We took some friends there for the ""reverse happy hour"" who had travelled from Harlem to hang out with us in Brooklyn. As usual, the attitude was chill and welcoming. The staff was really friendly and helpful with beer suggestions. A really large pitcher of excellent beer was only $10 and we had $1 shots of Jack Daniels - I just don't think you can find anything better in the area. They have this happy hour every night of the week - I highly recommend that you go check it out if you're feeling the need to down a few...

"Pizza is the first order of business at Saraghina's, a sprawling, charmingly rustic spot on an unassuming block in Bed-Stuy.  I realized only recently that I favor Neapolitan pies if I'm not going for vodka sauce.  Theirs is spot-on - we opted for the eggplant (& squash?), delicately flavored with lovely dollops of cheese, great sauce, and an excellent crust.   Their brunch menu is a bit sparse - the french toast was rich and tasty, but get the syrup on the side:  it's overly sweet with the bananas and strawberries.  Quality market salad, good house white & awesome cup of coffee.  A wee pricey for the 'hood, but definitely worth the trip.  The garden was a great place to be for the first muggy day of the year.  I'm so glad to see spots like this popping up.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What a find! We came here for brunch one day, after I asked hubby to find somewhere new for us to experience. He suggested Queens Comfort, telling me they change their menu daily. Sold! We walked in and were immediately seated. Mind you, it was around 11 am on Thanksgiving weekend, so there wasn't all that busy... yet. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla was on the screen and  I knew we were in for a treat. Their sandwich board outside listed a Tecate braised pork taco special, so that's what I got. Served up with the crunchiest, most amazing tater tots, those tacos were delicious! The corn tortillas were toasty, the meat was tender and the accompanying salsa and crema were spicy and flavorful. I opted out of the pineapple salsa (I'm allergic) and really think the sweetness with the spiciness would have been perfection on my plate. We had such a pleasant experience, I suggested a second brunch at Queens Comfort today. They did not disappoint! With an old Batman movie playing (old like Adam West was Batman, not Michael Keaton), I was a little distracted and had trouble choosing. In the end, at the server's recommendation, I ordered the Kentucky Brown and loved it! Roasted turkey breast, sliced tomato, and gravy topped with a fried egg and served up with a huge pile of those wonderful tater tots. The fried egg ran all over the turkey and mixed with that rich gravy - it was sinful and decadent. Oh! And I forgot to mention it was all on a locally-sourced pretzel roll. The crunchiness of that pretzel roll added just the right texture to the creaminess of the gravy and egg mixture and the tenderness of that roasted turkey. Unreal! Not sure how we managed, but we decided we had room for dessert. Thank goodness we ordered when we did because we score the very last piece of gingerbread bread pudding. When I think of bread pudding, I think bread with some sweet custardy stuff, but mostly bread. Their bread pudding (made by the owner's mom) was absolutely, insanely divine! It was creamy and bready and sweet like a gingerbread cookie. It wasn't heavy or dense, it was a fluffy, creamy mass of deliciousness. If you are lucky enough to have a piece of bread pudding, order it. Possibly before your main entree so you're guaranteed a piece.  But go. And go early because they do get busy. Just be warned, portions are very generous, so save room for dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stepping into Alta brings high hopes as it is quite an attractive restaurant.  There exists a good buzz about the place and the clientele is young and good looking.  Certainly a decent spot for a casual drink, but the food does not match the decor.  The first sign is the menu which contains every tapas dish ever conceived.  Like a greatest hits album, it has no focus and thus, nothing seems special.  They pump out the food quickly and, although some dishes are flavorful, most are simply lackluster and all are unsophisticated.  So, go for the ambiance, have a drink and a snack and then head out for dinner","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So glad I decided to visit Costanera again for a casual dinner on a Wednesday evening! I expected the restaurant to be empty but it had a decent amount of customers (this is always a sign that people love the food!). Food: My friend and I ordered the Lomo Saltado (Peruvian beef stir-fry) and it was delicious! The Lomo Saltado was juicy and tasty.The beef has this distinct taste to it, honestly my mouth is watering right now haha. Also, the dinner portion size was decent, I was so full once I was done. As for the green hot sauce, it's SO GOOD! Staff: I think the staff plays a big role in any business since this is one of the factors that would make a customer come back for more. That being said, I want to point out that Costanera's staff is excellent - very friendly and attentive! Price: The price for my dish was around $25 dollars with some change not including the tip. Establishment: Like I said in my previous review, the restaurant is dimly lit providing an intimate setting and the walls are decorated with tree rings which adds this rustic feel to the place. Also, it's BYOB which is always a plus! Tips: Make a reservation beforehand otherwise you might not be able to get a table. It wasn't crowded on the Wednesday I visited but have gone there on a weekend where they were not serving anyone without a reservation.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Hard to hear each other's conversation.  We waited quite a while for our order (we were six so that is understandable), but they definitely rushed us out.

"Having been coming here for more nearly 30 years since I was a kid, here is the real deal: The pizza is great.  This is why people come, and why you should go if you have never been.  No one else makes a Sicilian pie this good. The restaurant end of things, however, is seriously lacking.  Tonight was my second time dining in the restaurant, and it was truly sub-par.   The food in the restaurant is typical non-gourmet southern Italian, and the prices are a bit higher than many better local Italian places.  The house salad was boring, the baked clams were fresh, and the penne with vodka was drowned in what was basically a salty pink cream sauce. What really makes the restaurant a place to which I will never return, however, is the unendurable wait for a table, and the horrible service from the hostess.  At 7:30 on a Friday, the wait was a full hour, and you must wait in the completely freezing and unheated area where take out orders are served.  The hostess slips in the ""regulars"" ahead of you, and never seems to get to your name on the list unless you keep pestering her about how long you've been waiting. Even after being seated, we waited about 25 minutes for appetizers, and another 20 or so for entrees. Summary: Don't bother going for the restaurant.  Wait until the weather is warmer, get a slice and a spumoni, and leave it at that.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Definitely WAY overrated. Also a tad over-priced. ""Hipster"" friendly scene though. The wine list looked better than it was. Reminded me of the days when I first got into wine and didn't really know much other than, ""there's red and there's white."" And that's pretty much the wine options Tria gave; red or white (nothing special about them). The food was EXTREMELY disappointing as well. I don't know if the chef was having an off day or what. But the food was just sloppy and not thought out. Flavors clashing evrywhere... it was upsetting. - Roasted Beets with Bulgarian Feta Cheese: Just some beets and feta cheese thrown on a plate. - Tuscan Three Cheese Potato Chips with Smoked Paprika Aioli: Actually doesn't come with the aioli, according to the waitress. The chips were tasty, but you only are served two chips per person. - Gorgonzola with Fig Jam Bruschetta: Too much fig jam, not enough gorgonzola. I love fig jam too... but they slathered way too much on. - Smoked Mozzarella, Crispy Prosciutto & Tomato Brushetta: Best dish we got. The vinaigrette on top was very good. - Tomato Brushchetta: It looked like this dish was literally made by a young kid. The tomato was all cut WAY too big for bruschetta, making it very messy and sloppy to eat. Only good part was the vinaigrette on top. On the plus side, we had a very prompt and friendly waitress. But I'd just skip Tria and go somewhere worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm not a vegan, but this is quickly becoming my favorite coffee shop in town. Good coffee, super friendly staff. The sandwiches are tasty and hearty. The baked goods are delicious. The rooms are beautiful and tidy and spacious. There are interesting books and zines for browsing. There is artwork on display and for sale (at reasonable prices). You get the option of a bottomless cup of coffee for a few cents more than the regular cup. Oh, and wifi, naturally. This place has pretty much everything I look for in a coffee shop.

There are loud trucks going by frequently, but it's worth the nice breeze through the huuuuuge windows.

Came here last night after dropping off someone...been wanting to try this place. it was pretty good! decent and reasonable price as well. they have a small art gallery in the back that adds character to this place. very casual and fast food like ambiance. we got it to go and didn't had to wait that long! like how fast they are at it.  I like this place a lot and would def come back to try the other buns. some of the things i got. baozilla (fries..) - really good! huge portion too. def share with someone scallion pancake - a bit on the dry side but i don't mind! i got curry sauce on the side to go. it was good! next time i want to try their philly cheesesteak one. that should be interesting.. for baos we got the following the colonel bao - fried chicken one - the fried chicken is not super crispy but i guess its okay.. quite creative tho. the hungry buddha - the one with tofu. --- i didn't eat this one but it does looks tasty. baogulgi - like this one! very well seasoned and tasty! not too spicey as well lastly we got The O.G. which is the one with the slow braised pork belly. THIS IS REAL GOOD!! i think this is my fave. i wish i got more. we only got 2! portions are small tho pls excuse my pics as they don't justify the taste of it. since we did take out it might have been a bit in accurate on the taste and look. so nothing to complain for! oh and you can ask for some jalapeno on the side. goes well with prettty much all kinds of baos! ! they also offer deliveries now!,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Butcher Bar, a step below Dinosaur and definitely superior to anything else I've had.  The meat is all organic, local, blah, blah, blah, rainbows, blah, blah who cares.  I care about good food and if you have to cook the kid in it's mother's milk to make it one hell of a tasty meal then I am in!  Ordered the butcher's platter, ribs, corn cakes, mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, and green beans.  This was actually enough food for the two of us and for me to have dinner the next night with the leftovers. Service was fast and boy was the food good.  The mac n cheese was fantastic, super rich but not overly indulgent.  Everything in the butcher's platter was cooked to perfection.  I do wish however they had more BBQ sauces for everything as I felt like their food needed a little more zip. On the downside, their green beans stunk since they were way overcooked in the British tradition.  The ribs were not fall off the bone (my first judgment about good ribs) and the rub was not particularly flavorful (Famous Daves definitely has a better rib rub).  The sweet potato fries were not fries.  More like baked sweet potato wedges which was a major let down. So while there was some highs, I think they definitely need to work on their BBQ still.  I want my BBQ bursting with flavor, cooked to perfection where the meat just falls apart.  Prices were pretty steep but hey it's all organic, local, and meat sure isn't getting any cheaper.  I'll definitely come back to Butcher Bar however.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was still drunk when I waddled over at 3 am on a Saturday to try a slice, and while my judgment may be impaired by alcohol consumption, my tastebuds are not that affected.  The good thing at waddling over at 3 am is that there were no lines, so if you're looking to beat the crowds, go in the wee wee hours or in that midday slump before people get out of work. The artichoke slice is worth the hype, being one huge, cheesy, artichoke-y mess. Someone described it to me as it just being artichoke dip on bread -- pretty much a spot-on description.  The regular slice is still good, but after you've had the salty gooiness of the artichoke slice, it seems just average (for me, anyway). That said, people: it's just pizza. It's not worth these 20 deep lines. Hope they do delivery service soon...","[1.0, 0.0]"

I was hurt, shocked, and reminded me how grimmy people can be. After confronting the ""manager"" (I use that term loosely because they're all related and tight knitted group ... she confronted him and he denied.

"Absolutely awful. Given the paucity of good steakhouses in N NJ, we have relied on Strip House often, despite marginal service and food. After tonight however, we will not return. Portions are invariably meager and exorbitant, and the quality mediocre. $15 for a wedge salad with 1/16 of a head of lettuce started the debacle (and I should add that we are NYC steakhouse connoisseurs who do not typically balk at the prices at places like Wolfgang's or Porterhouse due to the superb quality). Sides were also crazy small. Shrimp was still slightly frozen. A small $50 ribeye appeared which was tepid and overcooked. The manager (the smarmy bald guy if you are interested) finally attuned himself to the fact that we were unhappy, but rather than try to acknowledge the disparity between quality/quantity and price, he proceeded to challenge us and was over-the-top obnoxious and out of line. Incensed, I lost my appetite for the sizeable remainder of what was left, and asked for the check so we could leave. Never, ever, again....and they just lost a regular, good customer.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I had amazing duck egg with a spicy yogurt and merguez sausage for my birthday brunch a few years ago which I still crave. The grilled octopus is awesome, but my favorite may be the ""manti"" which are spicy lamb dumplings! If the dips of the day include the pumpkin-feta dip definitely order it! It's amazing. Their baklava and cardamom ice cream are heavenly. Whenever I walk by and see people on the street enjoying their meals and wine, the corner is so inviting!

"The best way I can sum up Bar Tano is: the decor is beautiful, the food is mediocre, the service is so-so. I wish I had nicer things to say, since I can see the restaurant from my front window. Go for their sandwiches and pizza. Don't order the pasta. Although the pasta is cooked al dente, the pesto has no flavor and the red sauce is usually too salty.  The broccoli rabe is pretty tasty for a side. The last time I tried to go, the waiter would not let us eat at 10pm, saying the restaurant was closing for a private party the next day. Yes, I know you need to prepare for a private tasting  party, but the night before? At 10pm? Somehow, I think the wait staff wanted to go home early because it was a slow night. Thank god, the cheap chinese food restaurant on 4th Ave was open. I have a feeling my pork fried rice had more flavor than Bar Tano's pasta and meatballs and was $10 cheaper.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Blue ribbon re-defines late-night food. Think gourmet--full menu-- available to you into the early hours of the morning. We came here at around 1 am on Thursday night and it was absolutely packed, luckily scored the last table. The vibe was great, it was definitely happening. The restaurant was very dim, warm and dark and the attire was definitely dressy. People were still pouring in way after 2 am. We ordered two cocktails; my Lillipad Martini with cucumber was so light and refreshing but still very strong. From the menu, we got the beef tartar, pierogies and I got a chicken salad. The beef tartar was so well seasoned, the spicy mustard on the side complimented it well. The chips on the side were also a nice touch. The waiter asked us if we wanted boiled or fried pierogies. I decided to go with the fried but what we got were more like empanadas than pierogies because they were deep fried. The filling was still delicious though, but when he said fried I envisioned the old-school pan-fry way. Prior to coming to the Blue Ribbon, we tried both Vins et Fleurs and Balthazar and they were both closed, but I'm so happy we ended up here instead!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I eat here quite often when I go into work.  It's a local pizza place that is fast and pretty good (selection and taste). I will say the first time I ever had it, I would've given it 5 stars.  I had gotten the baked ziti pizza, and it was divine.  The ziti was perfect, the crust was flaky, fluffy, and the crust was not too tough, but not too soft.  The slice was warm, and it was perfect.   But as time has passed, they have just faltered a bit.  They don't leave the pizzas in the oven long enough, leaving pizzas that aren't hot enough to leave the pizza stringy.  They are more about speed rather than quality.  The spicy fries are amazing though.  They aren't spicy at all though.  But the seasoning on them - very very good. I wouldn't recommend the chicken fingers here.  They aren't so good, and the quantity isn't very good for the price.   I've gotten everything here - pizza slices (pepperoni, meat lovers, baked ziti, plain - don't get the meat lovers, it tastes old), to sandwiches (nothing special), to only appetizers (fish and chips - i've had better, salad - ok, spicy fries - not spicy, but good).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Best friend/favorite eating partner at my side, heat wave in temporary remission, Joe Jackson playing on the stereo, we got to sit at the chef's table - all the conditions were primed for a memorable evening and Amis did not disappoint. Mortadella mousse - creamy, smooth and porktastic.  Sweetbreads with fennel pollen - hot, crispy, organy and succulent.  A bucatini all'amatriciana that I described as ""the best drunk food ever"" was chewy, salty, meaty and cheesy in all the best ways.  And the meatballs!  You wonder how meatballs could possibly blow your mind? Just order them, sidled up to the potato/tomato mash.  Also have tried the veal tongue, carciofi, pork terrine, cacio e pepe, and strozzaprete alla vongole which were merely amazing. The only less than memorable dish was the beef carpaccio - solid, but it didn't blow our mind like so many of the other courses did. Desserts don't drop the ball - all of the semifreddos are amazing, especially the Amaretto, topped with fudge sauce and crunchy toasted almonds.  Because too much is never enough in my book, I adored the tartufo - chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo studded with cherries, resting on a spongy chocolate cake and covered with a thick shell of dark chocolate - then drizzled with chocolate sauce, as if you didn't already get the point.  I love gilded lilies. Yes, it's a little pricey, but if you're willing to splurge on a delightfully fun, memorable meal, it's worth it.  A meal at Amis is like a fireworks display.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Baoburg was a really nice find.  Attached to an upscale ramen restaurant, Baoburg is the smaller and fancier sister restaurant.  Serving an odd fusion of what appeared to be asian, thai, spanish tapas, mexican (? guac and chips), and american (french fries and wings), it was quite the shock upon first reading the menu.  Regardless, everything we tried was good. Among my friends at the table we went with the shrimp in oil dish, the wings, the sparkling ribs (ribs in a cola sauce), the truffle bacon and cheese fries (amazing), and one of the curry dishes.  Everything was fantastic.  The portions weren't huge, but it was enough to hold us over through the evening.   Price wise most of the entrees were in the $10-$15 range which I thought was reasonable for the quality and the size. The restaurant is very small so the service wasn't that bad.  It was a bit tight with 5 people at one table and the plates were a little large for the table size. The one thing that bothered me was that they served the wings on a flat stone for decorative purposes I'm guessing.  This led to the sauce from the wings running onto my friends pants.  A normal plate would suffice. Either way, it was a good experience and worth checking out again.  Cash only.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had the pernil (very good, a bit salty). Rice wasn't dry either, which I seem to run into a lot at Latin restaurants... odd. Service was just okay, but one guy was running the whole show.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love it here.  Came late one Sunday when Diner and Marlow had lines at the door.  This cozy little spot gave us a prime table in the corner on a cold rainy night. The waiter was full of love, accent, and enthusiasm.  I felt kind of sick and kept it simple with spagetti and tomato sauce - but that was somehow totally delicious and i found myself craving it for days.  My boyfriend, a chef, had the beet salad and lasagna, and while I didn't fill well enough to try them, he said they were great. I didn't know how I'd gone so long working in this neighborhood and never hearing about this lovely little spot.  So happy I found it. :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
This place stinks and we would never go back there. The food was awful and the staff was horrible. There were young kids running the place and the place was a disaster. There was hair in our food and everything came out wrong from what we ordered! They also DO NOT like kids in this place. They asked that our kids be quiet and that they stop spilling things on the floor. I would never visit this place again!!!!!!!!

"Normally I like eating at the Princetonian, but after today I will not be returning.  Today was a busy day at the diner and it took over 30 minutes to get my food.  When the food came it was cold.  The waitress gave the food to the manager and said it was cold.  On the way to the kitchen I saw the manager touch the food to check how cold it was.  This by itself is not a problem, but when the same food came back to me after being microwaved I was sick to my stomach.  The manager who touches menus all day and shakes hands with countless numbers of people touched my food and then tried to serve it .  This make me question how clean this restaurant really is.  I would think twice before eating here again!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I dined at PYT this past Tuesday 3/13/12. I was very excited to dine here because I followed them on Twitter and enjoyed their weekly burger special. We arrived to the restaurant a little after 9pm and were sat right away by the hostess who informed us that they were busy and to give our server a few minutes to get to our table. Although there were open tables throughout the restaurant I understood and we waited about 10-15 minutes for our server to come to our table. When she came I asked her about the burger club special and she said she would have the hostess come over to have us sign up (which he never did). She took our entire order, came back at least 5-7minutes later with our drinks (rootbeer and water) and we were sitting right next to the server station and by the kitchen door. After she brought us our drinks she did not come back to our table until we were all finished with our meal and we asked her for our check. When our food arrived we were not given any napkins, silverware or ketchup. I had to get up and get us napkins from the bar counter. I ordered the lasagna burger and was excited to eat it but the lasagna was ice cold inside. After we finished our meals and our server finally came back to ""check on"" us we asked her for the check and I once again asked her about the burger club, and finally I was able to do that but then it took her at least another 10-15 minutes to get our check and she walked by us multiple times before she came up and told me she was waiting for her manager to take 50% off my burger for the burger club. Being that I work in the industry I found this experience extremely disappointing.  The host watched 2 different couples sit down at a table in our section and wait at least 10 minutes for someone to come over to them and when no one did they got up and left. At this point a manager should have been notified or he could have at least took their drink order. Not once did I see a manager in the restaurant the entire night. I also observed a table get seated from the bar by the host, so they at least had their beverages, but he did not bring them menus for at least 10 minutes and they waited a long while for their server as well. Overall, I would not dine here again, the food was not worth the terrible service and experience. I would have liked to have been able to at least talk to a manager but tried to contact them on Facebook and Twitter and have received no response. Don't waste your money on their over-priced burgers....","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am so excited to finally get around to writing a review to this fabulous vegan joint! I have never, EVER, frequented any establishment as much as I do Champs. I've never had a disappointing meal here (which makes choosing from the monstrous menu so difficult!) and the service is perfectly adequate for the hipster community these servers are forced to deal with day-in and day-out. From the bro-wrap to the tuna melt to the cheesecake, it's all fantastic. And the prices are reasonable to boot.

"Came across this place at River Front Center with my girlfriend by chance and wow glad I did! The place has a modern build out that is very cool with a huge bar in the middle. There are huge chalkboards hung on the two side walls of the restaurant with nothing written on them. At first I thought they were just decorative pieces, but when I asked my server about them she said they will be writing happy hour and specials info on them in the future. They didn't have a happy hour when I was there, so I'm kind of curious what they are planning on doing and when. The service in my experience was excellent. My server was super friendly, and we got our drinks immediately and our food within 15 minutes. We got the Marinated Tomato salad starter, my girlfriend built a 1/3 lb grilled chicken, and I had the Red Eye burger with a side of vegetable skewers. Everything we ordered was awesome, and I highly recommend the Birthday Cake milk shake! The food was amazing.  It is not the cheapest burger, aka Five Guys, but it is the highest quality and best tasting I've ever come across.  You definitely get what you pay for in my opinion.  I am definitely coming back again!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The Skinny: Good meal, good place for quiet dinner, variety of Indian dishes to explore from. Great local place to eat for local or visiting people in Montclair, NJ. Price: low - mid-range Food: good for the price; ask for the naan, or the puri Service: great service Atmosphere: laid-back; family friendly The Long Review: The Bad Stuff: I suspect this is a family run place - as is many Indian restaurants - and as such they are more familial than professional. That is, managers and staff talk to each other as they would at home and openly discuss private matters without realizing that the quiet nature of the place makes everybody else hear what they are saying to each other. I felt badly for this guy whose credit card was declined and his friend working the register just yelled out ""your card was declined, dude...followed by embarrassing laughter"". That is the one thing that all restaurant workers from top down need to guard against: not embarrassing the patron when there is a discrepancy with processing payments. It also didn't help the fact that there weren't many people dining that night and so we all heard what was being said. Cringe! The Good Stuff: The staff really know the dishes well enough! The waiters are very patient and professional. They explain the description of the dishes well. The chef/cooks understand the level of spiciness that you want. I prefer mild to none and they understood and executed that in the delivery very well. It's easy to make Indian food hot but its the dialing down of the spiciness without compromising the flavor where the chefs and cooks find it challenging. Food: We ordered at least 2 different appetizers, and 5-6 different stuff. When it comes to Indian food, the intimacy is not just in the curry but also in the rice and bread they make and present. The Potato Pakora - an appetizer is crunchy on the outside and bitably soft in the inside; they were well cooked. So are the Somusas - the triangular potato appetizer that is the staple number one favorite appetizers to all children and adults in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Pakistan. The rice was cooked well; you felt the softness of it complimenting the curries that you mix with. The bread:  With Indian food, bread is a major factor in decision because there are so many types; the naan, the puri, the paratha are at least the standard three in most Indian places. So, I ordered the naan and the puri because in this place the paratha's are not made as I prefer them. Their style is a semi-crunchy and thicker as oppose to my personal preference of light and soft in texture. Having said that, the naan scored an A+. Fresh and rich in taste. I think I ate the whole thing. The Puri gets a B+ because as much as they scored high on the fluffiness, it could be just a little more crunchy - again, its a matter of preference on my part. The dishes: we ordered Alo-gobi (mild), Chana Masala (mild), Veggitable Makhni (semi-spicy).  The Alo-gobi (B-), the Chana Masala (A-), the Veggi Makhni (C+). The dishes were great in taste. My ratings come from years of experience in trying these dishes in many places throughout the country and abroad. But for Montclair, NJ, this is awesome! I felt eager to dive right in and eat when they brought the food. The Chana Masala was almost perfect! The ratio of sauce to water dilution (thickness and thinness of the sauce) is perfect! I felt that it could use a little more flavoring the Chana - just a hint more and that would have been a done deal; I suspect one supplemental ingredient was missing that would make the dish fantastic (coriander). As for Alo-gobi, their Alo-gobi was just potatoes and cauliflower stir-fried in flavoring spices and lightly drizzled in oil. Not exactly what I expected for Alo-gobi but still good in taste. The Veggi Makhni I felt had a little issue. The sauce was a bit watery; they need to boil out the water or put less water in making them. Dessert: We did not try any of their desserts. People: Management could use some professional training to maintain professionalism...even if their families are dining. But then again maybe its an Indian thing to make the place more homely? Either way, perception of the customers matter. The more I see management acting professionally, the more I feel they treat their employees right. Happy employees = good food = happy customers. The waiters and waitstaff are the stars! They get A+++ for the professionalism Overall: You want to go there for the food. Not the ambiance, not the presentation, not the expected experience in a restaurant. Advice to management: liven up the place with earth colors to infused brightness. More importantly, maintain professionalism even when your families are dining... especially when you have so few patrons that everything you do is noticeable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to the smith a couple of times now and I think I am ready to give it a review. I came here for brunches and dinners and the experiences have all been quite decent. I tried their mushroom omelet, BLT&E Croissant, Salmon Benedict for brunch and Roasted Chicken for dinner. The Salmon Benedict is definitely my favorite out of all that I have tried. The eggs are poached to perfection and the hollandaise sauce tasted very fresh. The dining experience is intimate. The noise level is quite high here but it is not too much of an issue for me for the past visits. One last note, if you are planning to come here definitely make reservation in advance! The entire group needs to be there in order to be seated. Otherwise be prepared to wait in line.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was really hoping The Ice House would come through for me and my dining partner but it just didn't do it. First, some of the good things about it: Private parking lot. For a Burlington establishment to have its own parking, especially near the waterfront is a huge plus! We were running a bit late for our reservation so it felt great not to have to spend a bunch of time hunting a street space for our vehicle. The host station seems very well managed. They place it on the front deck before you enter the front door with a bench seating area outside which is nice. It doesn't seem very large of a space especially when it backs up, we noted this when we left as there was a crowd of people practically blocking our exit standing around the host station. Hostess was very courteous and friendly offering us menus to peruse while they sat another party. Once inside the decor is actually very nice. It's a bit on the ""low light"" side but I enjoy that for a dinner out. We opted to eat indoors rather than on the back deck as the mosquitoes were making their rounds as we waited out front. It was good that we did opt for indoors as both decks (upper and bottom) seemed full of people. I do love that waterfront restaurants offer and outdoor option but when it seats somewhere around 30+ people it kind of loses that nice flair and just feels like outdoor bingo night. We got a table in the downstairs section which has nicely spaced tables and still offers nice views of the lake beyond the deck from plenty of windows. My only issue with the seating selection was as we were only a party of 2 they didn't choose to seat us at the only remaining window location that was set up for a party of 8. I understand you'd be wasting valuable seating space by throwing 2 people at a large table but I also saw a few couples at 6 table seating on the window. It also seems strangely wasteful to put such a large party seating on the windows where generally a larger group wouldn't care about view especially given the fact the table was oriented with only two chairs up near the window and the other 6 out into the restaurant. It seems better suited for a nice couple table like us, but I didn't complain and we actually liked the table they chose which was just behind a beam support but offered some view out of the windows. We were excited by the range of options on the menu. This includes the wine list. We selected a bottle of Old School Syrah which was delicious and aromatic without having a strong taste. For appetizer we shared fried calamari. The sauce was OK, we loved that the lemon half it served with was grilled. The breading was tasty but the meat tasted overdone and chewy. That was a disappointment since the menu indicated they were ""well known"" for their calamari. For main dishes she had the fra diavolo and I went with the grilled swordfish special. She loves fra diavolo and has had it in several other establishments. Turns out, The Ice House served the worst plate of it she has ever had. Overcooked shrimp and scallops. The sauce didn't have much bite (she had to order a side of roasted red peppers to up it some) but she did like the fresh tomatoes. I tried some of it and it seemed tasty but the meat was not enjoyable. It felt like we waited a bit longer for our food as other parties were served and done before we got our dishes. So it was assumed our plates may have been waiting under heat lamps as my swordfish seemed a bit too dry. I did like how well grilled it was with some nice char lines and the pineapple slice with it was nicely grilled as well. But overall it wasn't very satisfying.  Add to that the endless amount of ""easy jazz"" piped in and the parties of people traipsing through the dining area to get to the deck with multiple running toddlers the ambiance just kind of fell flat as well. I feel bad that such a long-standing establishment like The Ice House with such a perfect location didn't really pan out for us. We might give it another try but for the price I felt a bit ripped off and I won't be so eager to shell out for something like that again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm a fan. Solid cocktails and vegan fair. The space itself isn't personally my speed, but I'm from the gutter. It's small, which I do enjoy, and leaning towards swanky... but not pretentious. Like aforementioned, the cocktails are solid. They have an espresso based one named the Done and Dusted that is divine. Seriously, write this down... espresso / creme / liquor / lemon is ALWAYS correct. The lemon isn't a a part of their recipe, but add it, I promise you'll be happy. Bottom line... the Done and Dusted is one of my favorite menu items in Philly. Oh yeah... it's topped (dusted) with a cacao / nutmeg / cinnamon / salt... and whatever else I'm not tasting blend. This ish is divine. Anyway, the fair I've had is also nice. The meatballs were were outstanding and the kale-based pasta they serve them with are aldentelicious. The fried tofu was executed excellently... if they marinated the tofu first the shit would be godlike. I also ha the pickled veggies... they were just fine. The cocktails are done well, the food is done well... I like it here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"AVOID! I had lunch there today and waited 45 minutes for my burger with no apologies or updates from the waiter. Then the burger was so overlooked it had gone completely dry, even though I had ordered it medium-rare. It was also supposed to come with onion rings but they were inedible due to the fact that the outside skin of the onion had been left on. Even the mayonnaise i'd requested to go with it was forgotten. My friend's sandwich was supposed to come on brioche but came in a burger bun instead. I told this all to the waiter but only got a feeble apology and was still given the full cheque with nothing comped. This is the second time I've eaten there and both times have been bad.

"I've been here a number of times now, and have been consistently happy with it. Love that there is a small bar snack-type section to the menu, because the bar area (with a couple of tall tables separate from the actual bar) is a great place to have a happy-hour bite. The cocktail list is AMAZING. The ""Uncle Ralph"" is a winner. Appetizers are all really solid, but I have to say that the duck confit and the grilled octopus blew me away. I'm that person who always orders the grilled octopus when I see it on a menu, and this was right up there with the best I've had. Pastas are all very, very good, and all housemade. The bolognese and the rabbit rigatoni are faves - I always lean towards the meat sauces. I usually don't order meat entrees (I stick with appetizers and pastas) but the last time I was there I was really surprised by how good the chicken was (being that it was chicken, the most boring meat on earth). Someone at our table ordered it and we all tried it, because it was really surprising that it was a standout among the rest of our entrees. Our waiter was great, as is the ambiance--depending on where you're seated, it can be bustling and fun or cozy and private. I will keep coming back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"i think it was Nafeesa who's review mirrors my sentiments.  Perhaps the only difference is I did not have any preconceived notions prior to going this this establishment.  I actually read the reviews after dinner and was wondering if they were as bland as my experience. I'll start with the good:  the drinks were decent.  whether alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks (i had something with ginger) i'd have to say they were good.  We dined in the back outdoor area it was a great day and didnt want to sit indoors so that's a plus.  the lamb breast  was only decent and that's where my train stops.  The nachos were just ok, felt like it was missing something....and where are the rest of the nachos?  felt like a kids meal.  same for the shishito, just ok nothing to write home about. I decided i would also try the chicken and waffles.  big mistake.  the waffles were fried, i think, and the chicken was super dry.   the proportions were pretty weird:  two small waffle pieces and hilariously large portions of chicken.  the waffles tasted like fried mulch.  as hungry as i was i couldnt eat the waffles.  they were terrible. lastly, the mashed potatoes....ah the mashed potatoes.  those were edible but still  pretty bad.

I can't really describe the unique taste of Uni soba because Uni is such unique seafood that you either love it or hate it. There is really nothing in between. However, I have heard the reason Sushi is so popular among people is because it triggers your 5th sense above your tongue which is indescribable with words. It is called ""umami"", Japanese for ""savoury sensation"". Umami is a fifth taste we can perceive, along with sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Well, since no words can describe it, you just have to try it out yourself now. I hope you will enjoy it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A very unique and classy place.  The wait staff are particularly great.  There is a bar on the upper deck that is an experience in itself.  Dress very formally and be ready to get a valet.  Deep pockets will help because everything is expensive.  I went for a surf and turf and the steak was incredible.  The wine selection was great and the deserts are remarkable.  The ambiance is unique, it does not feel as if you are on a ship by the design of the interior , which is a sort of plush modern American style.  But if you sit near the walls, you get a great view of the Delaware.  Bring as many people as possible; if it even remotely seems like a special occasion, the wait staff will bend over backwards to ensure you have a great time.  Perhaps the best time to go is during lunch when the place is nearly deserted and your view and enjoyment are unadulterated by noisy young people and very long wait times.  The Moshulu excels when serving more people rather than fewer.  It is not crowded and the noise level is low.  Expect to pay 75-100 dollars per person including gratuities.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This is the greatest pizza I have tasted yet!!!! IT'S SO DELICIOUS. I keep coming back here with the intention to try the other pizzas they have but I just can't get enough of the artichoke pizza. It's definitely worth every penny. The slice is actually moderately big which compensates for the price. (it's not even expensive at all)!!! The pizza itself is so creamy and the cheese is fantastic! All I have to say is that sometimes, it does get a bit oily, but pizza will be pizza. This is a perfect place to go to if you're around the city and want something cheap and totally get your moneys worth. Just a heads up, if your pizza is fresh from the oven, please don't take a bite immediately, even if it's deliciousness is tempting. Pizza burns hurt like crazy!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

I swore I wouldn't come back but how could I resist a slice of the original artichoke every once in a while?  It's not as good as when they first opened but it's still better than 90% of the pizza joints in New York (now that's saying a lot).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The last time I went to Spumoni Gardens, I was seven years old. At that time, I thought it was the most magical place in the world, with its extra saucy pizza and unusually-mixed-but-delicious ice cream. Fourteen years later, not much has changed (although I don't know why, but I remembered it being located next to a highway...I was quite wrong about that). I don't need to say much about the sicilian and the spumoni; everyone else has said a'plenty prior. What I CAN say is that the broccoli rabe with garlic and oil is on par with my ex's father's recipe. That is a huge huge compliment, because that man makes an amazing rabe. The one complaint I have about the place is that the woman waitress who gave me and my friends our check had a huge attitude and threw a calculator at us when we were having a bit of trouble dividing up the bill. That wasn't very attractive, but the minor predicament didn't ruin the night.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I give bottle bar two stars for the mere fact that they have a large selection of beer at reasonable prices. As for the bar area, I am more unimpressed every time. Tonight, my sister and I purchased our beers from the bar, and then were lucky to snag a table. A waitress came by and asked if we were going to order any food, which we said no. About five minutes later, a guy came over and told us that if we were not ordering food we couldn't sit at the table. This is an understandable request for a restaurant, but this is bottle BAR. We pointed out the fact to him that zero of the people sitting at the other tables had food, but I guess since we already had our drinks when we sat down, and are two girls?? he felt we weren't allowed to sit there. So we chugged the rest of our beers and left. This all happened at 9:30 at night. No one was eating food. Maybe if this bar sold french fries I would have considered ordering something.

"SO GOOD. My attempts to beat a cold brought me to Saigon Shack, where I immediately got a seat at the bar. The friendly waitress accommodated my weird pho requests (veggie pho with chicken broth, add chicken, half noodles) with a smile and brought me one of the best bowls of soup I've ever had. The broth was delicious; the veggies were fresh, al dente, and varied (broccoli, string beans, carrots, potatoes, bok choy); the chicken was an actual sliced up grilled lemongrass chicken breast (not the sprinkling of mystery chicken bits you sometimes get). There were also 2 pieces of something incredibly delicious that I couldn't identify... I thought maybe bbq pork, but now I'm thinking tofu? It was sweet and smoky and salty and seriously delicious. If that was tofu, then there is a magician working in that kitchen!! I enjoyed sniffling over that pho so much that I ordered another round to go. My grand total was $24 (2($8 for basic pho + $3 for adding the chicken)). Worth every penny! My only pho-related request is that they get some of that spicy chili oil that some other places have. I love that stuff, but I definitely made due with sriracha and jalapeños. (Go away, cold germs!!) Yes, it is cash only, but there are signs EVERYWHERE saying so (including outside), so come with cash or be mentally prepared to walk away from an awesome bowl of soup.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to Pies 'N' Thighs excited to try their chicken and waffles, because I'd had chicken and waffles at another place and decided that it's my ideal brunch food. At Pies 'N' Thighs, though, I was sorely disappointed. First of all, the waffles are buckwheat waffles, not fluffy, rich, Belgian-style waffles, and not only were they extremely dry, they were also cold in the middle. They came with cinnamon-sugar flavored butter and a few blueberries on top, which was an okay touch, but since the waffles were so dry, by the time they'd been returned, heated, they'd absorbed all of the butter and tasted more like stale donuts than waffles. Since the waffles were so terrible, I was a bit disappointed there were two of them and only two pieces of chicken, since that was actually quite good.  It was very hot when it arrived at our table; the outside was crispy and the meat was tender. I thought the pieces of chicken were a bit small for the price of $10.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I knew something was not right because my ribs looked like they have been sitting for some time.  The ribs did not look fresh.  The bbq sauce was gooey and the ribs tasted awful.

"Saw this place on Yelp, and it's somewhat close to my neighborhood, so decided to give it a try yesterday. It's a nice place, and it was empty when we went since it was an odd hour between lunch and dinner. We were told to sit wherever we pleased, so we sat towards the back. I ordered the agua fresca which was recommended by fellow Yelpers. The flavor was watermelon & ginger. It was good and refreshing. Although I really wanted to try the enchiladas, I ordered 4 different tacos to be able to try as much as possible: carnitas, pollo al pastor, carne asada, and fish. All were good, but the carne asada and fish can use some seasoning. I wasn't expecting much from the chicken, but it was actually very flavorful. My favorite was the carnitas. I'm not usually a fan of fatty meats, but for some reason, the fattiness of the pork was so damn good. Definitely flavorful. I was most excited about the fish taco, but it was really bland. They need to season the fish, and step up the aioli. As for the carne asada, a little adobo goes a long way. My friend ordered the pollo al pastor quesadilla...she seemed happy with it. Overall a good place, but definitely still have some work to do. Although the waitress was very sweet, she was quite awkward...like she was scared or something. So she needs to work on being more personable. Would come back again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Today, my daughters and I went for brunch at Fare.  Since there was a 45 minute wait for a table we chose to sit at the almost empty bar/counter area.  Our waitress came almost right away to take our orders.  The coffees and Bloody Mary followed pretty quickly but, alas, no cream and no utensils.  Cream was requested but still no utensils appeared ... How to stir coffee???  We caught the eye of a passing waitress who brought us each a knife and fork wrapped in a napkin.  No problem, we'll just stir coffee with our knife or fork.   Then, likety split, and no longer than an hour or so we got our brunch.  My order was half correct with a salad instead of the requested sweet potatoes.  The orders were not hot.   Cold potatoes were cordially replaced upon request with another order of....you guessed it.....more cold potatoes.   The food was decent and probably would have been considered good had it been the right temperature.  The service was downright poor.  Neither our waitress nor the hostess seemed aware of our plight.  If I had to guess, I think our food was sitting up waiting for the server to remember to serve it.

Despite the slow ass snail service and eating in a cramped place, it's definitely a cute place if you want a latte or two... we both agreed that this confined space was making us a bit claustrophobic,  but perhaps the cute, quaint setup and the vibe you feel when you walk in made us change our mind. *shrugs* Average Prices: *~Gelato:  $12 & up *~Plain fruit, sandwiches:  $10 & up *~Dessert: $10 and up *~Cold dishes: $20 and up (such as classic pasta) *~Made to order salads and cold plates: $15 and up","[1.0, 0.0]"

While leaving, we had a small talk with the owner and other kitchen staff ...they started talking about how they make every dish authentic  not adding any readymade shelf powders and stuff...we got hungry again..","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My boyfriend surprised me with this place on a road trip to upstate ny.  We love hitting places from the food network.  It's a shame I read the reviews just now because it appears I should have had the good dog burger!!   We went really to try th empanada's.  The had cheese steak in them and great crusty outside.  I didnt  care for the dipping sauce.  Should have opted for ketchup.   I ordered the bacon grilled cheese sandwich.  there was something on it that i couldnt identify.  Even after picking it off and putting it on my plate I still couldnt identify.   We then finally realized it was apples.  I calmed down and then enjoyed the rest of my sandwich. I think the bread was tasty and the cheese but bacon could have been crisper. My boyfriend tried to talk me into he good dog burger but i really wanted grilled cheese.  Once again-wish i read reviews first:(.   We had this dessert tha was pretty good.  And different.  It was these chocolate, marshmellow, caramely (if that is a word) squares with coconut on top.  We decided there are enough things on the menu we would like to try so we will go back.  maybe next time i will get the burger.  but the empanadas where a  must.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sidecar, oh sidecar.. what would I do with out you? I have fallen in love with a bar, and it's name is sidecar. I find myself coming to sidecar to start my night, and typically to end my night. The best is the outdoor seating during the summer- you all should check it before the cold weather creeps up. Their bugers are tasty, as are their chili, salads, nachos, and so on and so fort.

"Waited over 40 minutes for our table, which is normally fine as long as you have good food and service after the wait. Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Once we were seated, we waited 10 minutes for our service who literally rushed us through our drink and food orders. We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and when we inquired with a different server, we were given a rude answer of ""they'll be coming"".  5 minutes later all but one of our drinks came. We patiently waited and then had to ask again to see where it was and were again given a rude response. In the meantime, we 1 of our 2 appetizers before the drinks  and when the calamari came, part of it was cold and it literally had no flavoring whatsoever. Fortunately, the side of chili sauce masked the incredibly bland appetizer.  Our main course was delivered at separate times as well, 10 minutes from the first entree to the last. 3 of my friends asked for sides of peanut sauce when they ordered their meals and had to ask twice after they received their food until they got it.  I ordered the spicy noodles and it was less spicy than their pad Thai which was extremely mild and  had no flavoring or spice whatsoever.  The only thing our server was quick at was dropping off our check (which unfortunately had a 20% gratuity already built in bc we had 5 people) and to take our money.   Also it is extremely loud and if you're a large table, you cannot hear each other speak. Truly disappointing meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A solid choice for Japanese food. Been here several times over the years and each time I come out satisfied. The decor seems to be aging though, taking away from the experience a bit and there are some things that never change (i.e. the underwhelming salads).

Also tried their omakase, well worth the experience, just phone ahead to plan it to your liking (yes...it's customizable).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If you want a cozy intimate place to hang out with a few friends, this might be the place for you.  It was fairly quiet because my girlfriends and I went for an early dinner on a Sunday night.   When you enter, you see the bar off to the left.  You immediately get a sense of tranquility.  Maybe it was the dim lighting or the quiet elegant decor.  While it felt hip, it was solemn at the same time.  This was due in part to the church pews in the back.  I sat in no. 216.   We got seated right away and there was hardly any wait time for anything.  The waiter was nice and answered our questions with surprising obsequiousness.   We ordered the crispy calamari with tomato chipotle jam for the table.  And I ordered one of the specials:  rack of lamb, rosemary potato gratin, and sugar snap peas.  The calamari was delightfully crisp with a hint of cajun spices. But you know what's going to bring me back?  The rack of lamb.  It could have brought a grown man to his knees.  It was oh so tender and not overly seasoned.  Potatoes and snap peas were similarly awesome.  And I would have gone for a dessert too if I had room. Looks like I would be a regular if I was in the neighborhood because they have All You Can Eat Mussels and Fries for $18 on Monday Nights.   They also have a beautiful outdoor eating area in the back for those who like to eat al fresco or in the sun. Even their ladies' room  deserves praise.  It was pretty, clean with a pleasant scent. This place hit all the right spots for me.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"1 word: Kopparbergs For Halloween weekend, I decided to ditch Miami for a few days and bring my talents north to New York, where my bff resides. So, I packed my 2-inch ""angel slut"" costume, some glitter and anal lube (kidding) and headed over to the lovely Hollywood International Airport. Before my flight, I had a bit of time to kill, so I whipped it out and started playing with it ... my phone that is. Yelp was my search outlet of choice of course and while browsing random restaurants, bars and the like, I had an ""aaahhha"" moment. ""I wonder if there are any bars in New York that serve Kapparbergs?"" Now, ever since returning to Amuricca after my time spent in London, I have scoured bars all over south Florida in search of Kapparbergs; I checked World of Beer, the Democratic Republic of Beer, Cervesas and countless others, but always to no avail.  So on top of the delicious flavor of the libation itself, Kapparbergs also offers the thrill of the hunt. Kapparbergs is my hot, leggy blonde that just won't put out. So yes, where America is great in that we have liberty and ""equal rights"" and shit, this fine nation of ours is barren of the golden beacon called Kapparbergs.. or so I thought. After a search on Manhattanbeer.com, I was quick to find a very short list of bars in the city that can supply my fix, one of those being Brickyard Gastropub. Before boarding the Jet Blue aircraft, I informed my friend that we would be taking a visit to Brickyard that night. After a short +/- 1000 miles traveled and thirst for strawberry beer growing on my tongue, I stepped out of Laguardia airport to be greeted with motherf*cking snow. SNOW. WTF global warming, it's October?! But whatever, nothing was going to get in between me and my hot leggy blonde. The time between arriving at my friends place, a trip for some grub and then the travels to Brickyard are all a blur, I think I went into hibernation mode or something. Once arriving though and be welcomed by the warmth and cozy setting at Brickyard Gastropub, I was back and fully alert. It was Friday night and where there were plenty of occupied tables and patrons sitting and sipping at the bar, it was not too loud or crowded. Just the right mix. My friend, her sister and I took seats at the bar and the bartender was immediately at out service. Without missing a beat, I excitedly ordered up my....wait for it... Kapparberg's Strawberry lime cider. aaaah bliss. Actually it wasn't as good as I remember, a bit sweeter than what my tastebuds recall. Maybe the transatlantic trip adds a hint of jet-lag to the flavor, or maybe its just because victory tastes so sweet. It was still so good though, extra sugary and all. If I were a resident of nyc, I would return again and again, not only for the Kapparbergs, but for the chill atmosphere and friendly service too. Right on Brickyard, right on.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And I've learned that other high end restaurants in the city buy them for the same reason too...

"finally tried this place and was seriously underwhelmed. got the ""brooklyn's best chicken"" and i'd like to meet the people who voted on this one. the chicken was not awesome. it came in three pieces, one of which was rubbery -- like it'd been waiting to be served for a couple of days. none of it was seasoned. the menu said the mashed potatoes would come with white gravy, but it came with brown. i hate brown gravy so that pretty much ruined the gravy for me. the potatoes were really just ok. they were garlic mashed, but seemed like they were missing butter. i have to say that the homemade donuts that they serve you when you sit down were downright divine. i should have stopped there and just had coffee. my friend got the veggie burger, the burger itself was not super. it was like veggie mush on a bun. but the fries were perfection. crispy, golden and salted well. i would try this place again if someone else wanted to go, but i couldn't see myself ever suggesting it. i should mention that service was great though. a nice treat in a city where service tends to be more of privilege than a right. ps. cash only, but has an atm.","[1.0, 0.0]"

But there might be some consistence issue: that my particular bowl was colder than my parents even though they came out about the same time.

"Wow, this place is really far west. Dumb me put ""Perry St"" in Google Maps on the BB, and didn't notice it just pointed out where the street was on the map... and not the restaurant. We walked over from Bleecker on a very windy night. The decor is kind of cold and modern. Despite having reservations, we had to wait a little bit at the bar. We each had a drink and tried the complimentary popcorn. I'd specifically reserved this place for Restaurant Week. The waitress gave us the normal menus and came back with the RW inserts (which was in effect after 930pm on Fridays) upon request. Our amuse bouche was a soup. We were starving at this point. The bread was a saving grace. We candidly asked the waiter if the food was enough to fill us and he said yes. He was right. Between the two of us, we tried: - House Made Burrata, with cranberry compote, olive oil, and grilled sourdough. - Sauteed shrimp with fennel, tarrgon, and chorizo sauce. The appetizers were good, but not amazing. We both got the fried chicken and it was as perfect as we expected it to be. The mushroom spatzle that accompanied it set it over the top. Dessert was pretty standard. We tried the warm valrhona chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and the banana and chocolate torte with chocolate gelato. The gelatos were presented at a very high temperature. Too liquidy. They say it enhances the flavor this way, but it was hard to eat. Also, our table was extremely close to the adjacent table. We got a good earful of someone's first? or second? date. The fried chicken was definitely the highlight and worthy of the 4 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It was a dreary, cold, and all-around terrible day when we decided to stop in and get some comforting, hot risotto. Despite living right in Rutherford for the last 15 years, we never visited this restaurant before. Inside decor is a nice pinky color, but it is pretty dimly lit. Maybe it's so all you can concentrate on is the risotto! The appetizer, stuffed eggplant, (sort of like a rollatini), was delicious. Four rolls (what a deal!) filled with gooey cheese, swimming in a delicious marinara sauce. I could have had much, much more. Salad dressing was good too- with just the perfect amount of acid. Then came the risotto in remarkably record time. They must have it prepared in vats... Mom got the three cheese risotto, which unfortunately lacked some saltiness and unction. I got the mixed mushroom risotto, which really had an amazing flavor. Layer and layers of mushroomy, brothy goodness that you want in a well-made mushroom risotto. I'd definitely get that a second, third, fourth time. I wish they had a way to ""make your own"" but I'm sure they'd accommodate you if you wanted extra/less items in your meal. They have a whole set of other non-risotto items, and judging by the quality of the appetizer, these items are probably equally delicious. I was upset by the cheese they brought to the table as it was clearly the dry menace of pre-crumbled, sandy, found-in-a-plastic-container, junk that costs a buck. I would have liked some yummy, freshly grated cheese to top my meal instead of what I had just described. That said, the risotto WAS very well made, the service was great, and the entire meal was affordable. I'd go again, but perhaps I'd bring my own cheese. Yum!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Don't bother trying to figure out their recipe because millions have tried and they have all failed. Possibly one of the best meals during winter because it is steaming hot and warms you up as you deal with that NYC wind... Very fatty and overall unhealthy, so you probably should not eat much before or after one of their plates... But do enjoy it and finish it... It's worth it.

"I rarely write reviews, but I felt extremely compelled to write this one after my experience at Nini's House of Tapas Sunday night simply because it surpassed all my expectations. I am a frequent patron of tapas and fine dining restaurants around new haven county, but this was my very first visit to Nini's. At first I was concerned about vast number of dishes available on the menu, usually this means quality and execution suffer. However, this was far from the norm. All 7 dishes I ordered were cooked to perfection and plated meticulously. ""Impressed"" and ""satisfied"" both fall short of how I felt leaving Nini's last night. In addition the price was beyond reasonable, I've never had food this good for the price I paid. I highly recommend this restaurant and it can expect my consistent future patronage. Because I couldn't choose just one, my 3 favorite dishes from last night were the Thai butternut squash soup, the duck drumsticks with yams and apples, and the fontina portabella ravioli. All of these were a taste marathon of delicious flavors that will remain a fond memory for a long time. A big thank you to Felix and his incredible chef.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Don't judge a book by it's cover. We *almost* decided to pass up on this place when we arrived to a desolate and creepy parking lot. From the outside Elixer looked small and a bit uninviting, but we [luckily] decided to chance it and go in for dinner. After traveling for a few hours from Boston on Friday night, we showed up at Elixer around 5:30 only to be told that we could not have a table because the restaurant was totally booked. I was pretty surprised, but we happily grabbed two seats at the empty bar. From the second we sat down the bartender was so incredibly warm and welcoming. He made great conversation, offered drink and food suggestions, and was attentive to a T. We started with some cocktails and the truffle fries. The fries were piping hot, plentiful and served along a delicious roasted shallot aioli. For entrees we ordered the salmon over spaghetti squash, which was perfectly flaky and moist, and the barley risotto -- a huge portion filled with crispy pancetta and sweet squash. I also am proud to say I ordered my very first dirty martini, which was delicious and filled with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Yuuuum! I'm not sure how much of this was an expectation game, but I was truly impressed by the food, drinks and service at Elixer.

"Okay, so i joined Yelp partially to write this review.  I've been hearing about Sripraphai for years - first from my friend, whose brother lives in Bangkok - and now from everyone else, so I have always meant to make the trek.  I guess things must have changed since the word got out, because it is very average and frankly not worth the trip.  In fact, the noodle dish I ordered was so below average, I left over half of it (which NEVER happens).  Most everything else was good, but not great.  Though, the dessert we had was also very average and the curry puffs were cold in the center.  Part of the reason you trek out to Queens is so you dont have a 30 minute wait, but here we had the wait.  I wouldnt do it again.  If you are in the area, can deal with the wait, and get to sit outside, go for it - but you wont be blown away.","[0.0, 1.0]"

He also has that rare and elusive staying power. Something that NYC doles out infrequently and with much caution. Minetta Tavern is him at his finest. I remember when it opened. Actually I remember before it opened. I was reading about it, stalking it online, memorizing its menu and dreaming about what I would order first. Suffice it to say, it did not disappoint. Minetta is cozy, a step back in the past with a constant din of diners waiting, eating, happy. If you don't have a coveted reservation, go early or go late. Or do what I love to do, eat at the bar. It is almost a better experience to be smack in the thick of it with access to all of the same ridiculously, ridiculously amazing food. Ah yes, the food. The menu is clean and fairly simple. At first glance that is. Meats, seafoods, a pasta, all with a french bistro flair. But dig in, stay awhile and you will soon see there is much, much more. On the starter side (which you may want to split, as the entrees are not to be missed) the roasted bone marrow is truly the star. That is if you like bone marrow. LIke I do. Rich, salty, bone marrowy goodness. If you want to go light, they have an excellent mesclun salad, as well as stuffed squid. But let's get to why you would really go. The main course. One of the most unforgettable choices is the black label burger. It is pricey, but worth every single cent. (hey the freeking thing has a facebook fan page, what says delicious more than that?) Pat LaFrieda provides the meat, a proprietary blend to be exact. Comes on a brioche bun with lots of caramelized onions. That is it. No cheese. No bacon. Just the insanity of the meat and onions. A simple, yet drool-worthy salute to the burger.  Also accompanying this mindbender are the frites. IMHO most of Keith McNally's places serve classic frites. The man knows his way around the art of frying the potato. Minetta follows in lock step with this. Crispy, salty, I want more. The cote de boeuf is equally mind blowing. It is GIANT with an equally GIANT presentation. It is grilled on the bone and comes filleted beautifully. If you prefer your red meat dinosaur style, this is your order. Another excellent option is the pasta za za. Imagine a pasta carbonara with a little more life, or, a little more za za. Hearty, soulful, excellent in every way. And please save room for the coconut cake. That will seriously consume your dreams for a good month to follow. And just when you think you are past it's fluffy white cake, puffy coconutty frosting, it will haunt you again, reminding you that you need another slice stat. Cocktails are fun, think a throwback to what Hemingway would have liked when he was holding court in the original iteration. The wine list (my fav) is delightful and offers many options for whatever it is you settle on. Don't miss this young NYC institution.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Fresh, delicious and probably THE best Ethiopian food in NYC.  Very nice, polite and informative waitstaff as well. We shared the chicken platter - the presentation and then selection of vegetarian and meat options we're so tasty. Really cool neighborhood as well.

"Mirands's is a poor excuse for a restaurant and a throwback to the days of tasteless overcooked 1950's style food. I will not be returning any time soon for a repeat performance. I was brought a dinner I hadn't ordered and asked that it be replaced with the meal I had ordered. What was delivered instead was stink eye by the manager and a cook who came out into the dining room to deliver hostile stares in our direction. Our apologetic server could not explain why after over 40 minutes there was still no replacement food to serve. The food that was served to the rest of our party was nothing special; as stated previously, a throwback to the 1950's. When our party finished eating we left with a bad taste in our mouths. I found dinner elsewhere as it was never brought to me.","[0.0, 1.0]"

This is in a class by itself.

"I'd been wanting to try this place since it opened, and when my birthday rolled around this year on a weeknight, I thought this would be the perfect place to go for a relaxed late-night birthday dinner with my boyfriend. I love French bistro food but can't stand the pretention that often comes with it at the U.S. restaurants that attempt it. What a relief that Chez Moi got it just right. This is no American restaurant putting on French airs. There are no cheesy Art Nouveau Parisian posters. Edith Piaf is not being piped in overhead. Save that for your college dorm room or other less-authentic French bistros you've been to. This is the real deal. The food was excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. The decor was casual but elegant shabby-chic. And the price point seems to be well-suited for the level of food, service, and decor. It's closer to the high end of my budget and so I'll have to save my visits for special occasions, but for many people these would be mid-range prices and you could easily drop twice as much for the same quality elsewhere. My spicy Pamplemousse cocktail was the perfect start to a perfectly tasty meal. There were so many enticing options, I couldn't decide on an entree, so I settled on two appetizers (escargot and tuna tartar) and a side dish (gratin dauphinois). My boyfriend ordered onion soup and steak frites. Every dish was delicious and beautifully presented. And we finished the meal by splitting a glass of port and a creme brulee, which I'm usually hesitant to order because it is so often poorly prepared, but I was encouraged to give it a try based on the rest of our flawless meal.  I was not disappointed by the crackly custardy sweetness that greeted us at the end of our evening. I'll have to try the chocolate mousse next time! If you're like me and you've been longing for an authentic French bistro on this side of the Atlantic, definitely check out Chez Moi.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Visiting from out of town and found this place in a warehouse/gallery district.  Had a lovely Sunday morning brunch all the way from the cappucino to the cream cheese/apple compote stuffed French toast and a little side of sheep's cheese with fig paste.  I like both sweet and savory for breakfast--can't have one without the other and luckily my boyfriend ordered Eggs NOLA which was two poached eggs on cornbread and Tasso ham along with lemony, parmesan-dusted fried potatoes.  We also tried the sausage and bacon to round things out--a lot of good food--all very clean and healthy tasting and feeling.  Reasonably priced, very nice and helpful service. They serve French press coffee in-house--to-go I got an Americano.  Decent inside albeit a little chilly in temperature. Would definitely return again for a snack, dinner, or another brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Having lived in Israel for a few years, I have become very picky about my falafel and hummus. I am giving three stars because I found more wrong than right with this establishment. My friend suggested we meet up there for a bit of nosh and I was gong-ho because I could get my humus on. At first I was happily surprised that they served burekas ($2.50 a piece!) and ordered a piece, what I got in return was something much smaller than how it looked and it was barely luke warm after having them throw it in the oven. Secondly, we decided to share a large red pepper roasted humus. The humus was so so, nothing to rave about, but they only gave us 1 piece of pita (and it was whole wheat after I had said white). You need more than 1 piece of pita for a large serving of humus. On the bright side, they had ample seating and the place was very clean. However, I don't think I will go to this establishment at another time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Add a tecate for $2.30, and you've got a great quick bite put together for yourself, whether it's on your way into Union Square, as a quick time out, or on your way home. One thing to note: if you like hot at all, don't be scared off - order the Extra Hot Sauce. It's full of flavor, and only stings at first!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ok so, I ate here just a few days ago. Dont get me wrong, the food is pretty good. I personally got the mussels, or moules whatever. They were excellent. And like, mussels are so plain, so to make them taste this good was pretty impressive. The frenchfries on he side came with a mayo type dip. I didn't even use it because I just dunked all the fries into the leftover broth after I took out all the shells. Yum. OK, And I drank a Bloody Mary which is my favorite drink that I always order. I'm a bit of a bloody Mary snob so I actually have opinions on this drink. It was spicy, which i like. I'd watch out if you are sensitive. They also put a small pickle in the drink which I thought was a nice touch. You can tell them make it fresh every morning, which I even asked the waiter, and he confirmed. The only thing I didn't like, which i why I only rated 4 stars, was the way the outdoor tables were set up. They all face towards the street, even if you are 4 people, you all face outward. It is as if the sidewalk is a runway. I guess if you are a people watcher, you'd probably love this place. But I found it a little uncomfortable. Over, all, good food and good atmosphere.

"I have been in and out of West Philly since about 2008, so I have seen this building in it's last 3 (..3 1/2) incarnations. RX was bangin'. RX under the second owners was meh. Il Rimedio was pretentious, overly expensive and honestly not that great.  I am really happy about The Farmacy for a number of reasons: 1. Local/Farm to Table/Organic/All that Good Stuff 2. No Pretense 3. TASTY breakfast potatoes... seriously. New potatoes with crispy skins. SO GOOD. 4. The ambiance is super cute. I love the new paint job and all of the foliage. It also seems like they fit more tables in there than RX and Rimedio... but it's not cramped at all. Just an excellent use of space. 5. I love supporting businesses in the 'hood. If it were up to me, I'd never venture east of the Schuylkill. The fiance and I had a mid-week Brunch there last week when I was on vacation. We were the only people in there (it was 11:30am on a Wednesday, most people have jobs I suppose) but we felt welcomed and very well tended to. Coffee was decent and quickly refilled, which seriously my fave part about a brunch. I had the Eggs Benny, which was solid - yolks were fantastically runny. But those potatoes really blew my mind. The man had the omelet of the day- which I think was cheddar and kale. He loved it - said the cheddar was delicious. Service was friendly and efficient. It's super nice to have a nice brunch spot around the corner from my house.

Ricotta Gnocchi was delicious - silky, light little pillows in a cherry tomato & pesto cream sauce. The Orecchiette dish was superb! with house made pork sausage, escarole, garlic roasted cherry tomatoes & Parmigiano broth. Service left something to be desired. We arrived @ 11:50am & were told by the tween hostess that it would be 10 minutes before we could be seated. A couple came in as we were walking out & got seated right away.

"okay i heard about this place in philly mag and thought i would give it a shot so one night me and my husband went to try it we got a small buffalo chicken thin square pie it was amazing but thats not why we gave them one star the following week we took some friends there and we wanted to try the pasta i got the pasta pescatora my husband got the linguine and clams, my two friends got the baked ziti with broccoli and the other got the penne rosa everything was okay but i thought the best part was the salad the pasta was way too bland and the garlic needs to be sautéed more. the garlic knots need to have more garlic as well. another thing that bothered me was the fountain sodas they had black mold floating in them i think you guys need to get people who know how to clean. the other thing that made all of us upset that night was the owner all he did while we where eating is how was everything? and insisted to continue talking to us about stuff we really do not care about. im the type of person when im sitting there with people to eat and stuff please leave me alone. thank you other than those things i would definitely recommend trios for pizza only!!!!! a few helpful tips: hire people who know how to cook hire people who clean better and pay attention for detail stop talking about yourself so much design a better more inviting environment","[0.0, 1.0]"

The Fries where amazing and crispy, but the burger was borderline inedible being smothered in a pound of blue. I scraped as much off as i could however the residue remained.

"3.5 stars. I came here with a large group of friends on a Sunday evening, and we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to get a table. While the place is large (it occupies both the first floor and mezzanine level of the building), I could tell that it's quite popular and gets filled up rather quickly. I got the pork soondoobu soup, a staple dish in Korea. It was pretty good, although I was a bit disappointed with the lack of enough pork meat in the soup. I also enjoyed the Nurungji (scorched rice) that was served afterward. One of my friends got their bibimbop, and he said it was okay but not anything impressive. Overall, I liked the venue and service, and the quality of food is decent. I would say their soondoobu is on par with those at Chodang-gol, another famous Korean tofu place in the area.

"We went here due to all of the great reviews. The wait wasn't too bad, surprisingly so for a Saturday morning in Burlington. The dining area is nice and the hostess was friendly. Our negative experience began once we were seated. Our waiter was especially rude and patronizing, and at first we thought it may have been an odd sense of humor. No, he was just a dick. We ordered the eggs benedict, seasonal hash, and the portabella mushroom sandwich. The proportions were meager at best. $12 for a single orange slice, a palm-sized serving of hash and eggs is ridiculous. The sandwich was equally small. The taste was fine but not extraordinary. The eggs benny were surprisingly good. During the course of our meal our waiter was nowhere to be found. He brought our check before we were even finished eating and did not give us the opportunity to order additional food, which we had intended on doing. Don't get me wrong, I am not stingy and have no problem paying for a quality meal but this was pathetic. Don't waste your time here. Sure, it's Vermont's first ""green restaurant"" but you'll have an all around better meal and experience at places like Penny Cluse, Mirabelles, or Sneakers in Winooski . Those restaurants will undoubtedly have a significantly longer wait (with good reason) but it's worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I grew up with Junior's, and it was always a yummy way to go... Maybe because I was a kid I thought it was the hottest coolest spot... Unfortunately for this location,the menu is ""meh"" (BLT best way to go), the lunch portions are big and sloppy, c'mon pasta on the plate that runneth over, negative on the food  presentation and I think the quality is lacking... I think that the cheesecake itself is still stuck in an era prior to pastries becoming influential... Don't dislike it, but don't like it either... I give it a 3 because for others it's a cool place... As for it being called ""Jewish Food"", seriously NOT.... Check out Katz's or Second Avenue Deli, Zabars.....then you will know what a party in your mouth is...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I live downtown is this is the only pizza I order, and I have a place right outside my building.  The pizza is always fresh and yummy.  I typically get the Maragrita which is delish.  If you're going to eat there, the place is small but nice.  The drinks are strong and you'll most likely catch some bankers if you go during the week.  I'm a repeat visit and would recommend it if you're in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A 2/3-star split, this place has been a press darling in recent months, but why? It seems to resemble little more than a Manhattanite's vision of Brooklyn culinary fashion.

And this is food--smoked Southern? haute carnivore?--that has no business being busy. The whiskey cocktails are an interesting novelty, but that's all. I wouldn't take anyone here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is THE Halal Cart in the five boros, forget about that 53rd and 6th BS. This the best chicken and rice cart on Earth. Not only do they make chicken and rice but they also make Kofta, Shawarma, Shish kebabs, and also lamb chops. I have had the chicken and rice, lamb chops, and sandwiches. The style is different from most Halal carts that take a spin on South Asian curried chicken, this one is Middle Eastern style. I used to live near this cart and bought food from it several times a week, never got tired of it. Its pricier than other carts, $6 for the basic chicken and rice dish and $10 for the lamb chops, pricey but you get excellent food. And the salad you get with your food is real salad not some lame lettuce leaves. There are a lot of fairly pricey sit down restaurants in the area but this cart beats them all on their superior food and friendly service.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I had been to the Farmhouse once before, for late-night only and was not impressed. I went Sunday night and was blown away. I had a poached pear salad to begin, which was lightly dressed with a delicious dressing. The salad was huge as an appetizer however, and I recommend splitting it for two. For dinner, I had a lamb burger which was delicious. It was perfectly cooked medium rare and very juicy. The french fries were delicious, perfectly salted. Just enough to keep you eating them. One of my dining companions ordered the Nitty Gritty Corn Cakes, which was delicious as well. They made a very bland-sounding dish extraordinary. She also ordered the Glean Salad, which was nice, but ask for only a bit of feta, unless you want the salad drowned out by the feta. I would highly recommend going here any night. We went early on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated right away. But at the end of our meal there was quite a wait for a table however. Also, for the beers: they get their beer on Monday, so the selection is not as great on a Sunday night. I had the Trapp Lodge Vienna, which was hoppy, but really good. Overall, I had a great experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is an amazing little breakfast-brunch place up in East Rock. It's dirt-cheap for what you get . . . I ordered a chocolate chip pancake for $2.50 or so expecting to receive a small (like Eggo) sized serving. Instead, I was treated to a massive pancake that covered a good-sized plate, which tasted delicious. Because I'd expected it to be smaller, I'd ordered it as a side to a fuller breakfast and found I could barely finish what ended up being a massive meal.

"Ippudo Westside is a welcomed addition to the Ippudo family. What's more alarming is that this location has moved right in the turf of Totto Ramen (perhaps shorter lines at dinner then). This may be good for some, but not for others, The ramen market is a zero sum gain. The new location clearly has done a lot to differentiate itself from the original location, few things worth mentioning: -Brighter entrance and bar area is considerably larger -Larger communal table seating option (main room behind the hostess station) -Separate dining room for group seating that's has nice decor like exposed brick walls Some minor downsides: -Small waiting area with no seats shared with the bar area -No text messaging system to notify hungry customers when table is ready -Acoustics in the main dining room were not ideal because if there's a large group getting loud, everyone will hear it. (There were speakers in the ceiling but I could barely hear the music) The food was inarguably the same quality as the East Village location. I went here with a group of four and the total wait time for a Friday evening at 6PM was just under 1 hour. We got seated in the main dining room. I ordered the Tako Wasabi for starters which is raw baby octopus in fresh chopped wasabi sauce. Very tasty, but the portion is barely enough for 2 people to share. For the broth style, I tried out the Karaka men which was the spicy Dashi broth. The noodles were cooked to perfection and firm enough for my tastes. The char siu pork in the soup was nice and fatty, adding more flavors to the rich broth. I always make sure to leave enough broth to get a second helping of noodles or ""kae dama"".","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My long awaited visit to Locanda Verde! We had a 9pm reservation on a Friday - the place was packed when we arrived. Definitely a cool vibe inside. We ordered our faces off (yay corporate expensed meals!) so I'll give you the run-down of our fat fest. Crostini/Apps: Sheep's milk ricotta - recommended by other Yelpers for a reason, its outrageous. Cotechino sausage crostini - put this in your mouth. Frito misto - delicious calamari with yummy pesto sauce. We also tried the kale salad, salumi misto, steak tartar, and crab crostini. The above three were really the stand outs though. Pasta/Secondi: The pasta course was the highlight of our meal by far. We had the Pumpkin Angolotti, Parpadelle with lamb ragu, and the Girondole (octopus in red sauce). Hard to pick a favorite but the girondole got polished off first. When I go back, I will likely just stick with the pastas. For secondi we ordered fire roasted chicken for one, pancetta wrapped veal, and the wood fired dorade. Nothing really bowled us over in this course. The chicken was delicious - but paled in comparison to the pastas. Dorado was probably our least favorite dish of the evening. The pancetta wrapped veal was good but super rich. Sides were the rustic potatoes, creamy polenta, and the brussel sprouts with pancetta. Get the brussel sprouts, skip the rest. Dessert: (told you we ate a lot) Sheep's milk ricotta cheesecake and pear and ginger crisp. Both good desserts that hit the sweet craving. The cheesecake is worth a repeat; pear and ginger crisp was just okay. Overall, an awesome evening. Have to say though, the waiter was definitely channeling dazed and confused. He spaced out on our wine orders a few times and our least favorite dishes were his recommendations. That aside the food more then made up for it. In conclusion, go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Hoboken roll - tasted very fishy and that's it.  The Hoboken roll I remember was flavorful and was so good I ordered another serving of it.  This time around, I could barely finish it.   I'm not sure if they have a different sushi chef or if management has changed but, it was very disappointing to say the least.  For the price you pay here, sushi needs to be on point not bleh.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We had a great brunch last year with our daughter who was 1 1/2 yrs old at the time. Good food, good service. Naturally, when we met up with another family who schlepped all the way from Manhattan for a playdate at Prospect Park, we immediately thought of bringing them to Applewood again. When we went to the restaurant it was before 12:30pm, with lots of tables for 4 open, not busy at all. They said that they didn't have a table for 6 open (for 2 sets of parents, 2 tots) and the wait will be 1/2 hr, we said, that's okay, since you have a lot of table for 4 open, we could sit separately. Then they started hemming and hawing and would not give us a clear answer why they couldn't give those open tables to us. Uh, we were not that dumb Applewood! You didn't want to give away those 4-seaters because you would loose money on just 2 1/2 persons. Well, that was true, but why were you turning away customers when there were empty tables around? You really want to burn bridges with all the parents in the Park Slope neighborhood? As we went back and forth with the staff, and decided that it was really not worth the fight, the staff decided that it was okay to let us sit. By then the kids were cranky and ready for a meltdown. We relocated to a more kid-friendly restaurant nearby. We really wanted to like Applewood, but today's incidents left a bad taste in our mouth.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Super comfy booths and the table was glass filled with little drawings and notes. The bathroom has an old fashioned toilet and decorated with colored lights, a pail bucket sink and a radio. Very cute. My friend had the chicken and waffles banana fosters, I had the Sugar Freak breakfast and my boyfriend got the chicken Mac and cheese sandwich. No complaints. So good. The wait for the place was really short. 10 mins for Saturday brunch. I can't wait to try out their dinner menu. It's located ideally in my favorite part of Astoria. 30th Ave. Not too far from the train. One thing I think that would make this place perfect would be an unlimited drink offer for brunch.

"What can I say everything from the space to the drinks/Food/Service and so on is incredible. We went for my friends birthday and were given an excellent table right in front of the of the large loading dock door overlooking the park, They transformed the space beautifully preserving elements that existed previous to their build-out. We shared various appetizers including the Foie Gras on french toast and the white sardines on Quinoa croquettes. The Foie Gras isn't the most original dish but it really was done well and the flavor was great. The fried Hama oysters with Shiso were definitely a standout. For my entree I had the roasted lamb sirloin with the wheatberry, romanesco, sweetbread salad. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the salad was flavorful with great texture from the sweetbreads. Overall there some great values in terms of wine from their extensive wine list. It was a hot day so we opted for a crisp and clean French Rose' which the Sommelier helped us pick out.

"Came here for an engagement party and had a great time. How much of that being be attributed to GURU PALACE.   I suppose could be debated but certainly their food is delicious. Normally I need meat with my meal but the party was a vegetarian affair. However, I have to say, I didn't mind at all. If you're gonna do vegetarian only, Indian food is the way to go in my (admittedly biased) opinion. The standout appetizers in my mind were the bhelpuri (which the server did a great job of mixing together with just the right amount of everything) and the gobi manchurian (for some Asian fusion flavor). Delicious. When it comes to vegetarian Indian food entrees, there are two things that I LOVE- Paneer makhani and malai kofta. Both of these dishes were phenomenal. If you're a vegetarian or giving up meat for a period of time, try these dishes here. They were among the best I've ever had. The only dish that fell short for me was the saag paneer. Lacking in spices and salt. Not terrible but I can make it better at home, which shouldn't be the case when compared to what an actual chef puts out.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I expected a lot more from this restaurant.  My wife and I are foodies and went here because of DDD and the other reviews.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations. The wait staff and environment were very friendly, the meal was moderately priced, but the meal was just OK. The pretzel was quite good, but the cheese sauce was just OK. The Caesar salad was good, but the caviar hush puppies were not great (not worth the calories). The fried chicken was cooked perfectly, nice and moist with a good crust, but no flavor.  The sauce that comes with it is quite good and I enjoyed the biscuit.  However, the Amish Country fried chicken is way better. The shrimp/andouille sausage/grits entree was good, not great. The shrimp were medium size and not a lot of sausage.  The flavor was good. We took a bag of the peanut bacon brittle to go - mostly just peanuts, not much brittle or bacon.  I thought it was OK, my wife did not care for it. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, a unique menu, but just OK in the execution.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Its always so sad when you have to say good bye to a friend - especially one that's moving to bumble-frick middle of nowhere Minnesota to work on an organic farm for the next couple of months. So we decided to take him out for a last hurrah/happy belated birthday at Standard Tap since he'd never EVER been to the Northern Liberties (and yet grew up in Philly). Arrived a little before 7pm, perfect timing since we snagged one of the few remaining tables upstairs. The poor suckers behind us had to nurse their beers by the bar and watch us order. The two boys next to me opted to order the exact same thing - the burger - while I opted to treat myself to much needed oysters on the half shell and their beet salad. The interior is lovely, I was really digging the red painted walls and red light right above our table, and I'm always a sucker for some dark wood accents everywhere you turn. Mostly I was amused by the enormous group of guys that absconded a whole wall's worth of tables - we kept trying to guess why there weren't any girls with them. Anyways, on to more important things - like the food! Oysters arrived mere minutes after our waiter took our order, and I scarfed them down as quickly as they shucked 'em! I loves me some oysters. My salad arrived with the boys' burgers and I was a wee bit surprised at the...size...of the...salad.......I dunno, maybe I just need to become more familiar with their menu, but when a salad is listed on the menu, even as an appetizer, its usually about twice the size as what I got. I'd compare it to a tapas portion rather than appetizer. Still tasty, though. The burgers were huge and came with those darn tasty fries. The awesome thing about boyfriends is when they let you snag a few bites from their plate without caring :) Some things seem to be priced well, while others *cough*salad*cough* are just not worth it. But the food is definitely good, as is the beer on tap, and when your laid back waiter is nice and VERY attentive to your table, a good meal is had by all.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am so excited that I discovered this hidden GEM!!  Upstairs is extremely POSH! Great for a first date night.  Also, they have a full BAR (which is rare in Montclair due to the lack of liquor licenses) The atmosphere is exquisite.  They covered ALL details when establishing this restaurant from the stairs, chairs, light fixtures...etc.  Definitely has the ""wow"" factor.   Price:  In comparison to all the other restaurants in Montclair, yes more expensive.  However, this is a high-end establishment so expect the same with their food.  Its affordable, just expect to pay more than $27 for an entree They have a very limited menu....very limited.  However, I find this a plus because they can really focus on the entrees at hand.   **Due to ""lent"" my guest and I only consumed drinks (which were reasonably priced).  I will have an update on the food within 7 days.  I am very eager to return.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I liked the Akamaru Ramen, but it didn't rock my world. The broth was rich, but not the best I've had and I realized that with putting all the suggested add-ins my simple bowl of ramen turned out to be over twenty bucks, add an extra serving of noodles and while tasty definitely not worth the price. Go to LA where you can get a combo of the same rich, pork based broth with a small bowl of fried rice and it's still $10 bucks cheaper. The pork buns though, were tasty, slightly sweet hot sauce. Good yes, $10 bucks worth? Well, if you savor it v-e-r-y slowly, then yes. We managed to show up a little after they had opened and once we got to the counter it took another '45 minutes' to get our table. My gf said that was a good time. The people behind us had to wait almost two hours. Service wise once you're seated is the same kind of professionalized negligence you get at the host's table. The staff fly around at all angles, and it's hard to pin down someone to order if you're not ready right away. So: * Go there * Wait a while * Eat some pretty good ramen * Pay too much for said ramen * Say you've been * Never return","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really don't know what to say about Charcoal. My wife and I ate there tonight and there were parts that were good, parts that were bad, and parts that were just... weird. We parked along the river thinking the entrance was near the giant sign that said ""Charcoal"". Nope. Other side of the building. So we walk around, walk up, and as we enter, someone we presumed was the hostess greeted us, asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), asked if we wanted a table or booth, and then just DISAPPEARED. Thirty seconds later, a second presumed hostess appears, asks the same questions, and seats us. Given the projected atmosphere and menu prices, imagine our surprise when we were seated in a just-above-Burger-King-quality molded plywood booth. Getting this out of the way now -- barring the odd exchange upon entry, the servers and staff are awesome, and our waitress was no exception. Our waitress took our drink orders, explained the dishes well, and took our meal orders. She asked if we'd like a basket of house-made bread. Sure, why not. The ""basket"" here refers to how she brings it out -- you're only getting one piece, with some (fairly tasty) garlic- & chive-infused butter. The bread was good, but, c'mon... one piece? After a bit of a wait -- a desolate, bread-free wait -- our entrees arrived. My wife ordered hanger steak with chimichurri & pickled chorizo and potatoes. I had scallops with pork belly. Portion sizes were somewhere between ""small"" and ""lilliputian"". The $32 hanger steak was five slices (about 6ozs of meat), maybe half a dozen quail egg-sized potato halves, and at some point, chorizo was briefly sent past the plate to convey some sort of essence but never actually placed on it. Charcoal's $27 scallop plate is three silver dollar-sized scallops on a bed of cous cous and chick peas, with a slightly unmanageable-sized piece of pork belly. The plates were good, but you don't get any choice as to the doneness of the steak (hope you like medium), and the scallops were inconsistently seasoned, though expertly cooked. Dessert is where an already jittery train ride sailed completely off the rails. The menu said ""Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake with a Pretzel Sauce"" which implies, and indeed was described when we asked, as something rich and sweet with a salty kick. Nothing, not the menu or the waitress, said anything about the dry piece of crumbled chocolate cake served with a shmear of peanut butter and a quenelle that was placed on our table. Seriously, that cake was Entenmann's level. Other various notes: - I just want to reinforce that the service here is great. Really good. - There is no ambient music being played, and there's no curtains/acoustic tiles to absorb any of the noise. You will inadvertently eavesdrop. A lot. - The rest of the interior is really weird. Laminate floors, bargain booths, quality tables, bright blue walls, and bright lights. This setting is begging for dark colors and some sort of ambiance, but doesn't get it. - The ""$$"" price rating is incorrect. We dropped $95 for two entrees, a dessert, and a 20% tip. That's high. Final note: This was the weirdest, most inconsistent dinner I've ever had. But at the end of the day, the food was good. Docking stars for the ought-to-be-embarrassed dessert and the miniscule portion sizes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Quite possibly  my favorite restaurant on the upper west side. I would have given it 5 stars but for the noise level - it can become quite jarring on a weekend evening.

Try the ceviche - either one, both have a clean, crisp, fresh kick.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to the oyster house a few times now and just finally decided to post a review. The atmosphere is pretty casual. As for food, I really like the new england clam chowder. My son, who is 5, loves the snapper turtle soup. It is quite tasty. I have have tried the shrimp and crawfish boil and it was a generous plate of shrimp, crawfish and keilbasa, espeically for the price. I noticed on the last review that they were disappinted with the portion size but I almost didnt finish my plate. Among the other dishes that I have tried there, the mussels are one of my favorite. The garlic broth is amazing. You'll want to ask for more bread to dip into it. The sardine dish has changed a couple times but I really liked the one with pickled radish and orange segments. I love calamari but I am not a big fan of the one they do here. The fried lemons I dont really get. The onions and jalepenos I like but that s about it. Last but not least, my favorite part of dinner is the desserts. I have been disapppointed many times with the desserts at other restaurants but I always have to try them. At the oyster house, I absolutely LOVE the lime semi fredo. It's not too sweet or too tart and comes with a dulce de leche sauce. They have a new dessert I just tried this past tuesday. A goats milk panacotta. The waitress explained that the chef gets raw goats milk to make yogurt and from there it is made into panacotta. there is a sprinkle of pistachios and candied citrus zest. Definately super awesome. To wrap up, the raw bar is alway nice. they have a nice selction of oysters from a few different areas. The bar has some new items. I dont remeber the name but I like the tequilla one. For the type of food that I got, I think that they are pretty moderately priced. Cheaper than most in the city.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I didn't have a typical dinner at Pig and Prince. Instead, I booked my husbands 30th birthday party in their lounge. We had somewhere around 30 guests possibly more throughout the evening and the staff tried their best to accommodate us. While I will say they were not prepared for a group our size, I will give them an A for effort. The grilled cheese and poutine were pretty delicious. I had a Deck The Halls cocktail which was so good! I also had the bartender make me a French Gimlet with St Germain and it was heavenly!!! Our waitress was definitely nice and ill say she tried but there were definitely some issues. I guess the biggest being the wait for drinks. Some people waited 45 minutes for a beer. Other times drinks would just be set down and no one would know who it was supposed to belong to. Or an order would just end up at the wrong person and I would be figuring it out as opposed to our waitress. They just really needed a second person helping out. But illl end this review on a positive note- we have probably 10-20 separate checks and I know it was really hard for our waitress to keep it straight but she somehow DID! Everyone paid before they left and only paid for what they had and all that. Def a difficult task. Oh and we also had an awesome coconut cake made by their pastry chef. Yum! I would recommend this place for a birthday party but definitely with a smaller group. And I wanna try their dinner for sure.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"An ultra modern, ultra hip nightclub/small bite Asian Fusion restaurant.. I kid, I kid, this place hasnt changed in the 70 years they have been opened.. In fact, I am not even sure they changed the prices.. We arrived last night at 830 to a packed house..We waited 20 minutes watching enormous plates of food roll out of the kitchen.. A 5 pound plate of fried calamari (galamad) brought to a table of Firefighters over here, a tray of square pizza for a family of 8 over there.. The food just keeps read more » whipping out of the kitchen.. The room filled with the smells of roasted garlic, wine, and butter.. Just when we think we can no longer wait, ""Daniel, Daniel, your table is ready"".. With much relief, I stop chewing on my hand and walk up to the counter.. On my way up, i am casually met by the owner, Lenny.. ""Hey guys, thanks for waiting so long.. Don't worry about ordering, I am gonna set you guys up"" ""Set us up?"" i think.. ""What does set us up mean?"" Now for the past 20 minutes while we were waiting, we labored over our choices from the menu.. We had decided on what we wanted.. Miss K was ordering the lasagna, I was ordering the veal Sorento, Miss A was ordering rigatoni vodka with prosciutto, and we were going to split an order of clams and try a square slice of pizza.. Non of this frou frou Italian dining, we were going for Italian American, with Sicilian influences, classic red sauce, open for 70 years, type food.. But again, all this kind of went out the window once I hear, ""don't worry, we are going to set you up"" So, with that, the waiter comes to the table.. A very pleasant looking guy with a thick accent.. He comes over and takes our menus away.. He says ""don't worry, my boss says he is going to take care of you"" ""Does everyone at the table eat meat?"" ""Yes"" I say ""We all eat meat, I want veal sorrento, she wants lasagna, and......"" ""Don't worry"" he interupts, ""My boss is going to cook for you"" With that, he brings a bottle of red wine to the table and the food starts coming out.. A plate of pasta (Cavatappi) in a red sauce (san marzano) with potatoes, mushrooms, ham, mozzarella, and tons of basil comes out.. The pasta was good.. Especially when added with the salt from the fresh Romano they left at the table.. The potato was a little thicker than match sticked.. It was most likely poached in a deep fryer but, could have been boiled.. It had a really nice chew to it.. A very interesting dish.. As we were eating the pasta, the owner Lenny comes over.. Now at this point, i am assuming he thinks i am someone else.. i am getting kind of nervous that he is going to be disappointed when he sees that it's just us.. But, no, the guy is as sharp as he is friendly.. He comes over and puts his hand on my shoulder. He introduces himself, he jokes with Missie k, he tells us about the neighborhood, about his families restaurant.. He is honest, he is so welcoming, I immediate think something is up.. It's not, sometimes nice people are really nice people.. He is a true sweetheart.. A sweetheart that is trying to kill us with food.. So, as the pasta is sitting on the table out comes a plate of shrimp.. Half are fried, half are poached, served with house made tarter and cocktail sauce.. The poached shrimp are amazing.. Shockingly good.. They are butterflied.. They taste of some really nice poaching liquid, the cocktail sauce is amazing. The breaded and fried shrimp are done so well also.. A really great version.. With the plate of shrimp, out comes a salad.. Tons of red onion, shredded arugala, shredded romaine, lots of cheese, a really nice salad dressing.. And again, we are talking L&B portioning.. Just the amount of lettuce looked like it was some how fattening. We are drinking our Chianti which was an 07. It was a simple table wine.. I think it was like 13 or 16 bucks on the menu.. I am thinking, ok, the storm is over.. We get might get a meat course and we are done.. Not a shot.. Lenny comes by to drop off a dozen baked clams. Breaded little necks sitting in a plate of butter and lemon wedges.. molto buono.. We get the cavatappi to go, keep the salad on the table and the rest of the stuff we finished... Out of the corner of my eye, I see a dozen cops sit down for dinner.. Plates are cleared.. The waiter without asking comes by and drops off a carafe of sprite for Miss k.. Apparently, there are free refills on soda.. So, round two starts.. This is when it got over the top.. Cause, at this point we were finished. Out comes the parade of food.. A huge plate of lasagna for Miss K.. A plate of broccoli rabe in garlic, veal in a white wine sauce with potatoes and eggplant, and a huge plate of french fries with parsley and garlic.. Oh My... I am beginning to feel a little relief when I see tables of people, leaving with bags of food..

Entree was the hanger steak, medium rare and yeah! - it came out that way. It comes with bearnaise sauce which was good - not too salty. The fries were okay - but they give you way too many. And not because the steak was small, it was just right. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate was the dessert - most of the rest of them weren't that interesting.

I was first brought to Rucola by friends who were so excited to have this great new addition to their neighborhood. I have since been back no less than 3 times! (in the short time they have been open, this means I'm a HUGE fan). The menu that some described as being too short is entirely seasonal and fresh, has been different every time I have been, and is quite complete as of my last dinner. Last night,  an amazing Pork Loin  was the perfect combination to a rich and unctuous Bucatini. The salads are to die for, and this might be the only place in the city where you can have a delicious wine for less than $30! Speaking of price, I have never paid more than $40 per head (appetizers are around $9/10 and entrees $17-20), including wine and desert (so good! save some room). Portions are straight out of Italy, enough for a normal appetite, might want to go appetizer, entree and desert if you are feeling ravenous. I recommend 100%. Dining here is wonderfully pleasant, service is great. Mosey down to that lovely corner, and open your eyes for the beautiful plants that decorate their facade. Love it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The best gift I ever gave myself and well worth the two month wait for my chance to actually taste Nick's creations.  Each course was a five star experience.  I went by myself so that I could devote all my attention to what I was eating.  I started off with the Foie Gras and each component of the dish fully complemented the entire dish.  I would have been thrilled just to eat that all night.  Next I went with the gnocchi and I swear it melted before it touched my lips and the sauce - OMG.  I forced myself to close my eyes and completely savor every bite and to make it last as long as I could.  I then went with the beef and had no disappointment except I would like to have had a few more of the mushrooms - they were sensational.  And the sauce for the beef (which was perfectly cooked) was to die for.  Lastly I finished up with the White Chocolate Pudding, and another OMG moment. Sweet and tart were perfectly done and I just wanted to lick the plate. I am also a chef (Personal Chef) and not in my dreams could I create these four fantastic courses.   It is easy to see why Nick won Top Chef - the man is a genius in the kitchen.  I was very touched when I looked up and saw him standing at my table.  Yes he is intense and yes he is filled with humility.  I will most definitely give myself this gift again. I should also mention that the service was impeccable - so knowledgeable about each dish, so warm and friendly and they made me feel like I was an important part of their night.  I did not feel like I was alone at all all  evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Our waiter was very attentive. They don't have a kid's menu, but one child just wanted side orders for her meal. The other one only wanted one egg, which is only offered as an add-on to an entree, but they considered an omelet an entree, so they just added it to an adult order, and she got the egg.

At the same time they offer drink as you go bottles (on select wines) so if you only drink half a bottle they only charge you for what you drank. That's pretty cool!

"been to this place 4-5 times, some of the food is great, some like the mac and cheese not so great...the service has always been a little on the not too great side, but i can deal with that as long as i have good food and get my drinks quickly at least.  last night was the worst dining experience i have ever had, we were sat by the waitress, where we sat for at least a good 5 mins before i looked at the time wondering if anyone was going to bring us water, or a menu for that matter.  after i looked at the clock we tried to get someones attention and anytime we made eye contact, the person would look away, finally 10 more mins pass and the waitress comes over and asks if we need menus, get menus, wait another 5-10 mins still no water, or drink order taken, no one has come back to take our order. a couple gets up from the bar, so we figure maybe we can get some service if we move to the bar. as soon as we sit, the waitress appears, and instead of apologizing for us waiting at least 25 mins, kinda questions us about moving to the bar, now at this point we have been there half an hour and finally got water, and our order taken! now we try to order drinks, the bartender takes our order, and then just never makes the drinks, i actually timed it, and it was 17 mins before she started our drinks, and we were just sitting there watching her talk to people and not really do much else, finally a couple service tickets came in and she finally decided to start our drinks...at this point 3 girls that sat 5-10 mins after us were finishing up their meals...needless to say i am really disappointed because the drinks and the meals i have eaten there have been pretty good, but i will never go back there again","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Apparently, the wait here can get pretty long, but we must have hit the off-peak jackpot because there was only one other table being served when we came here for dinner.

"WOW! I am so glad I found this place. Lets start off with the great things. The steamed dumplings were the perfect meat to dough ratio. My wife said the chicken chow fun was the best she's had in years. The veg lo mein was delicious. The bbq spare ribs were meaty and not overcooked, with a really nice sauce that wasn't just grease. The good things. The scallion pancakes were crisp and just the right thickness. They could have had more scallion in them though. The general tsao's sauce was good, but the chicken was a little on the soft side- I like a little crisp in mine.  The crab rangoon had a LOT of filling, and were very sweet. I didn't like them, my wife did. The not so good things. The egg roll was disappointing, nicely fried but not very good filling. I know they just order these frozen, but this one was not good. The sauce for the dumplings was oddly sweet and not very good. As you can see, we got a lot of food to try.  They gave me a free 2 liter soda and cookies (almond maybe?). All in all, this was the best chinese take-out I've had in a long time. I definitely support this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been here about 5 or 6 times since my last review and I have always been pleased, bordering on orgasmic.  I just love it--the food couldn't be better, the service couldn't be better, the atmosphere couldn't be better. Some recommendations: 1) talk to your server about the oyster selections in detail--I had some that I never would have tried (from Virginia!) and they were sensational 2) maybe you think you don't want the meatballs, but YOU DO 3) if you are hungry, the fried chicken is huge and every bite is heavenly 4) the escarole salad is still among my favorite salads on the planet 5) the french fries may only be french fries but they are outstanding 6) yes, deviled eggs! 7) sazerac! I suggest just accepting the fact that you're not going to get a 9pm table and come earlier or later.  The last few times I've been here it's been around 11:45 when we arrived (on a Friday or Saturday) and we got seated within 15 minutes (groups of 2 or 3).  Once, they wanted to give our table to some other folks, so they bought us a round in exchange for moving to the bar--yes!   Count me among Walter's' biggest fans.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I just went to Oaxaca Kitchen for the second time. The first time was shortly after they opened in 2011 during restaurant week. The idea is that the restaurant offers authentic, up-scale Mexican (Oaxacan) food. I have eaten really good Mexican food as served in Rick Bayless's restaurant in Chicago and at the Frontera Grill in Austin, Texas. I have also eaten at Rosa Mexicano in New York, although I was disappointed there. I have eaten great food at a place in Houston too.  And I have been cooking authentic and very good food at home for the last 20 years (and am the proud owner of 8 or 9 classic cookbooks, necessary for a Gringo like me to do this right). I was very excited by the prospect of really good food Mexican style, with work executed by others. I AM DISAPPOINTED here: the presentation is alright, but the food is bland. On the first visit,  I had gazpacho with ice cream floating in it. This is a  cool idea, though that is how gazpacho is often served these days (at home we sometimes make a mustard ice cream to serve with the gazpacho as per P. Wells)--except usually the ice cream or sorbet isn't cloyingly sweet. Then I had a rather undistinguished/bland red mole. Mole is supposed to be amazingly complex and a touch spicy!, but this one was nothing like that. And the cheesecake for dessert was overcooke, burnt on top and curdled otherwise. Just now I had a small lunch, giving the place a second chance. Nice chips and two salsas: the tomatillo salsa was tasty enough, but the red salsa was rather watery. Management should do something about that!  I had seafood in a mole amarillo. There was no hint of either ancho or guajillo pepper or in fact any other chile in the amarillo. It was a vegetable puree. Service was very good: friendly and attentive. Notably, however, I was the only customer. Maybe this is because there didn't seem to be a lunch menu? Or maybe prices are a bit high for lunch by New Haven standards, or at least if your food is not in the Union League or Ibiza league. There are plenty of places in which the food is not any better that are fuller. While I commend that there is an attempt to cook good food and not to cook American-Taco-Bell style slop, as in most restaurants in the Northeast, they haven't quite pulled it off. Maybe this is because they are catering too much to what clientele already knows. But why not try to educate us by offering us something spectacular: spicy and carefully spiced?","[0.0, 1.0]"
"There's no place for zero stars, if there were, ""Tattooed Mom"" would certainly be listed.

With a bitter, scalding and trivial staff mixed  with a  tinge of ""Jim Crow""  thrown in (four Blacks seated in the rear, after 30 minutes of dining the lights miraculously were turned down...happenstance or intentional?)  All you have to do is show your face and find out for yourselves why I'll never recommend or come back to ""Tattooed Mom.""","[0.0, 1.0]"

I had a lovely experience.  Our waitress was vibrant and fun, the food was delicious and we even went home with that little bag of Biscotti another poster talked about... Then came today, we arrived at 12:45 for lunch and waited nearly 15 minutes for a waitress.  We then waited another 30-minutes for our meals and not even the garlic bread could hold us over.  To top it off, they didn't stamp our ticket for validation and we had to pay full price for parking. Not sure they'll get another chance to disappoint me.  The food is good, but the waitress was invisible, service non-existent, and the parking situation pushed me over the top.  It really is unfortunate... the gnocchi is almost too good to pass up.

"For quality, service and sheer yumminess, Blue Point is my favorite restaurant in Princeton. The only drawbacks are that the atmosphere is casual (in contrast to the quality of food and price), and it can get a little loud. The casual atmosphere is endearing in its own way. As others have noted, the busboys (men) seem to be much more on top of things than the waitstaff. My husband and I have had to ask them for help a number of times when efforts to catch the attention of the waitstaff haven't worked. Once their attention is snagged, however, the waitstaff is friendly and helpful. And the management is excellent. They've helped us out a number of times on short notice.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife and I took the girls to Lombardis for dinner last night. We don't normally have dinner outside the uptown area very often, so we thought it was time to venture out a little bit. A work colleague of mine recommended we try this place. We arrived relatively early, and before the line to be seated got too long. So we were lucky enough not to have to wait too long, and were seated and served within the hour. The place was like Tourist City.... The food was delicious. My wife and I shared  a calzone with meatballs, ricotta, olives and mozzarella cheese. Fresh home-made tomato sauce was served on the side. We both really enjoyed it. The girls shared a cheese pizza - they loved it. Our server was very efficient - to the point where he noticed that I had ran out of sauce, and replaced it without asking. I thought it was a little over-priced for pizza, in comparison to your standard price of pizza in NYC, but I guess you are paying for the name and the reputations of Lombardi's Pizza.

"In celebration of Bastile Day, we returned (very overdue and we'd be there every week if we lived nearby) for Brunch.  Absolutely delicious!  I had the short rib hash and my husband ordered the steak and eggs.  The meats were perfect - the steak was juicy and had a lovely crisp char.  The short rib hash was like the beef version of pulled pork, but hit with classic French flavors and a hit of star anise.  Best of all - the most perfectly poached eggs we have ever had.  Fantastic! The whites looked like fluffy whipped cream and the unctuous yolks blended beautifully with the steak and hash. I saw a fellow diner ravishing the juicy burger - thinking of how one of those poached eggs would bring the burger's perfection to an obscene level of pleasure.  We arrived early and the place filled up quickly - we lucked out on scoring a table by the west facing windows.

"The best place to eat in Philly that I've found! I've been here a few times and have had a good number of things on the menu, including: Caciovallo Stuffed Meatballs, Sheep's Milk Ricotta, Grilled Skirt Steak, Grilled Meditteranean Octopus, Pan seared Gnocchi, Roasted Chickpeas, and the Roasted Beet Salad. The steak is one of the best things I've ever had. The flavor is amazing. The pickled fennel that comes with it is really good. The ricotta is very good. The bread is a bit to buttery for my taste, but that is only a slight nit pick. The meatballs and gnocchi are excellent. The beet salad is phenomenal. The pistachio pesto pairs great with the kale. I want to keep going back until I've had everything on the menu........and until I've had the skirt steak at least 20 times. The only problem, if I had to come up with one, is that it is not a big place. You could be sitting very close to other guests, and that can be a little annoying, but the food more than makes up for it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"On a recent trip to NYC, we were on a mission to find this place ... we were a little thrown because their neon sign wasn't working ... but in the end, this dining experience became the highlight of our weekend. The space is narrow but accommodating with three levels uniquely decorated. I especially enjoyed the large, fully functioning hourglass on the second floor which they turned frequently in keeping with their theme and mission (cleverly written on the front of their menus). The tavern's owners, Beth and Josh, were very friendly and spoke with guests as if they were long time friends (and I believe some were). ~Go Steelers~ = inside joke for Josh. All the staff that we met that night were really outgoing and added to your experience. The food was incredible. We started out with the potato mushroom soup, bread and spanikopita. I have to admit that we didn't eat the bread because we didn't want to get filled up too quick, but Beth says they make their own bread in-house ... so I bet it would have been great. Just wanted to mention the soup again, it was so creamy and earthy and hearty -- a perfect comfort food for the snowy weather. Our entrees included the bourbon braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes and asparagus and the penne pasta in a creamy marinara sauce with sausage & gorgonzola. WOW! Both were excellent. My mouth's watering thinking about this stuff. For desert we had a chocolate layer cake and a Greek inspired, nutty, custardy, crunchy confection. Aside from the building itself, the folks who run it, the good food and the drinks, the patrons were equally as friendly, inviting, interesting, and hospitable. I would highly recommend the Tavern to anyone and I hope that you will become enchanted by it as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After the first appetizer, Marigold flirted with being a truly excellent meal, but ultimately the restaurant came up short. My fiancee and I greatly enjoyed the various amuse-bouches and found some of the initial appetizers extremely praise worthy. But, the chef disappointed us with the main courses. The duck came out partially cold and the beef tasted fine but not special. If we could somehow have ordered only the appetizers and various amuse-bouches I would be singing a very different tune. On the positive side, we loved the soup with Cinnamon foam on top. We also enjoy the liquid nitrogen popcorn and the fois gras in chocolate.  Dessert was also really good. The service fell well short of what I would have expected. They cleared the table too fast between courses yet we waited too long for the next course to arrive. The decor can be described as old Victorian residential house in which they removed the beds and added tables. They skipped all other renovations. The cheapest option for dinner at Marigold is the s $65 four course tasting menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Pat's Steak was overcooked, dry and had absolutely no seasoning.  I tried provolone cheese which was slapped on the bun and never did melt.  The only additions you can get are mushrooms and onions.  No mayo, lettuce, tomato or lettuce.  So I guess those are not typical toppings for Philly cheesesteaks.  Ketchup and mustard and some ridiculously whole hot peppers are all that are offered.  And these condiments you apply yourself from an outdoor stand where cleanliness is absolutely not a priority(allI can I can say is ""yuck""). So needless to say $10 for each tasteless sub is way too much. I bought an extra sub for my friend that went to Geno's so he could compare and his opinion was that they were equally gross.   I can say that they serve you very quickly.  Although maybe they should take a little extra time to put out a better and tasty product. Next time I'll listen to the locals and try THEIR recommended stops.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Planned a trip with my family in July because I wanted to taste an authentic Philly cheesesteak.  8 of us split up between Geno's & Pat's.  I was at Geno's and the guy accused me of being a ""napkin stealer"" because he saw me get napkins from his place and I was wiping off my brother-in-laws leg who had just come from Pat's.  So I said to the guy I with them meaning the rest of our group who was a Geno's and he just gave me a look.  Their steaks were alright could have used more meat on them.  I've had better in Jersey!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I mean, I don't think the fried dumplings are AMAZING but where else are you going to get 4 for a $1? They're also really oily, so I wouldn't order more than 8. I'm super in love with their sesame pancakes though ($1 for a slice). It's not as good as my mom's, but they're on par with the street food I've had in China. The duck pancake isn't worth the $2.50, it really only had fat and skin. I love how they add carrots and basil leaves though, it makes me feel better to eat veggies. If you're not comfortable speaking in Chinese, just say the order #s and they'll know what you're talking about. (PS There's a park nearby if you want somewhere to sit and eat!)","[1.0, 0.0]"
Great for take-out.  Their rolls consistently have nice sized pieces of fish in them and are tasty and fresh.  We have their sushi about once a week or every other week. We've dined in with our baby.  They were friendly and sweet.  The atmosphere is relaxed and very casual.  It's good as a dine-in lunch spot.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hi. Let me rave about how amazing this place is. every single one of the tapas we ordered was just perfection. If you have to only get one thing, let it be the fried goat cheese with lavender infused honey. It tastes exactly as delicious as it sounds. I recall getting the Lamb tangine which was very tender and a surprisingly larger portion than expected. We also got the mussels which were very flavorful and lemony. Definitely check this place out if you are in the area and are looking for a romantic ambient tapas bar.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a new place that opened not too long ago that serves a pizza type very common in SI: thin, cracker crust pizza.  Its got a great location not far from the ferry, its decor are classic, and the people working here are nice and hard working like most of the good pizza places in Staten Island.  Furthermore, this place was opened by a former employee of Joe & Pat's, which is another older pizza place of the same type.  While this is definitely solid pizza, I have to give the nod to the original.   Like Joe & Pat's, the crust is cracker thin with no rise to it, with a bright, flavorful tomato sauce and good cheese.  The main difference here is that Joe & Pat's is more balanced.  They used too much mozzarella here, and even though it was good quality, I much would've preferred more of the delicious tomato sauce.  Also the crust here was not as firm as the original, but this was minor even though it was the result of there being less char.  These are two very similiar pies, but you have to know how to make your individual ingredients shine as well as the whole; I think Joe & Pat's did a better job in this regard.  However, I'm sure some will disagree as my issues were somewhat subjective, and besides that this is still solid pizza thats unique and well worth a short walk from the ferry.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was fooled! Beware this is no Totto ramen or any other ramen place. It's a hole in the wall place and it's not that they have bad ramen..it's just the fact that their ramen is somewhere between okay and good. It makes me angry, especially coming in here hungry and expecting rich, fatty, and delicious broth and what you're getting is not what you're expecting. Gyoza was good! The egg that comes with the ramen was not buttery texture it was borderline overcook. I have to disagree with the reviews of 4 stars for this place....unless i went during an off day then again it raises the question of consistencies!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went there for brunch with my girlfriend. The hostess/possibly owner was extremely friendly and welcoming. That put us in a good mood. I ordered the goat cheese, chicken and veggie crepe, and the filling was very good and had great flavors. They use buckwheat batter for the savory crepe options. I understand it is a traditional batter for savory crepes and I get that. I am usually one who likes sticking to the way things are supposed to be done, but I have to say it's not my favorite. The buckwheat is a bit grainy, has a strong flavor and sticks to the teeth. I would prefer plain flour. We thought the dessert crepes were outstanding...everything you expect from a good crepe and they are better than you'll find elsewhere. Definitely recommend this place. Overall great place and the people working there are very nice.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Best diner in Hamden!!! Way better than Acropolis or IHOP. The food is always fresh, delicious, and well-prepared (even in the middle of the night). It always comes out fast and the wait staff is very good. They always notice if your coffee is running low and will just bring the pot over (and always remember more creamer) without asking! Yes! The wait staff isn't ALWAYS friendly, but they mostly are, and I've never seen them be rude. They have a huge menu and everything on it I've had is good. They also automatically total up your order in the cheapest way possible, so you can just blindly order your breakfast however you want it without worrying about being charged too much for the extras. It's also quite clean, except that the un-carpeted section doesn't always feel the cleanest...a little gritty. So if you're in sandals and it's been raining, just ask for the carpeted section. I've also never had to wait for a table even when the other places are packed. This place is truly a hidden gem. You can even call-in takeout orders and I think they do delivery too.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I visit NYC every 4 months or so, my home for 10 years. The craving for pizza was present more than ever since I moved to the warmer coast. I had a mission. And it had to be from Brooklyn, NY. Great reviews? I had to see what the fuss was all about. Four of us sat in the patio, which had soothing natural light at a partly cloudy 12:30pm. It was covered which suits NY random weather. The place was just starting to fill up on a Monday. I can't imagine weekends. DRINKS: -I had to have beer so: Left Hand Pole Pilsner from CO. Amazing beer, soft nice flow. great pairing. My friend who is also into beers agreed. What a tasty one. Order it! -Intelligentsia iced coffee, black, no sugar. One of west coasts finest coffee shops. Tasty, refreshing. Cream and simple syrup on the side, help yourself. Try it! -New Orleans Style Iced Coffee. Nice soft coffee, refreshing as well. Order it! -Roberta's Grapefruit Basil Soda. Very refreshing, not very strong basil taste. Interesting sip. Not too sweet. Only good for hot days.Try it! PIZZA: -Famous Original $13: (tomato, mozarella, caciocavallo, parmigiano, chili flake) Simple, gloriously thin, hot and crispy. Slightly charred crust from the brick oven. The dough wasn't too flavorful, but the textures were just right. -Da Kine $16: (ricotta, prosciutto, thin pineapple slices, thin jalapeno slices). Also very thin crust. Think juicy sweet bite from pineapple with a mini kick of spicy jalapeño, fresh cheese, then slightly crunchy when you finish the bite. Good but not my favorite. If you don't eat it quick, the juices from the pineapple softens it. GREENS: -Roasted Lettuces: Olive Oil doused romaine lettuce halved heads, softened pistachios on top, Blue Cheese on bottom of the plate. Too greasy for my likes, Lettuce not crunchy enough. Flavors were decent. The ambiance was great, the have a radio station in the back, the wait staff attending and rustic just how i like it. Very Brooklyn. Go only on weekdays, get 1 pizza per 2 people unless your BMI is 28-30. Reviewed without the cost factor as always.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I stopped by Sketch this week with a friend when we were looking for a quick bite in Fishtown. I ordered a burger with bacon and she ordered the chicken sandwich. There is a large variety for people looking to pick and choose how to build their burgers or sandwiches. It should be noted that the fries are AMAZING (and Belgian style). And they come with a free dipping sauce of your choice (the sandwiches come with free sauce as well). You can also order cheese with the fries. The burger was tasty but not the best burger that I've had in Philadelphia. It was good though. I would definitely stop back in here again if I was in the neighborhood. The service was fast and the burgers were big (so big that I had to take most of it home).,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I haven't been good at keeping up with my Yelps so when I saw this restaurant in the Times today, a little guilt set in. My girlfriend works in the same building so I convinced her to pack a little black dress with her to work one day in early November and we hit it. I'm a Craft fan so I had high expectations. The Times review made it sound like it was inconveniently remote. I mean it's removed from the hustle & bustle but I got there from work in MidTown (north) in less than 10 minutes....at 7pm. I have been to the building before to meet her and have always enjoyed the outdoor atmoshere (have been to the 'wichcraft there a few times) and the evident but friendly security guards that are present. Loved the interior of the restaurant: chic but warm with great night time views. Our service was spectacular: friendly from my arrival on; helpful and knowledgeable even when I tested them on the wine list. Speaking of the wine list: affordable! I'm sure they'll build on their selection over time (not that it was lacking). Lots of choices to make good matches with our food.......(3 for 3!) Food: my standout was the Squab Mole: sublime (I could NOT believe that my favorite dish of there actually got knocked by the Times......which was probably the impetus for me to start typing this!). My cohort's fav of the nite was the Duck. I tried it but it cam in 3rd for me behind her Mackeral Escabesh. One complaint.....and it's a pet peeve: enough with the Branzini already. Every restaurant seems to have it lately. Are there any left in the sea! That out of my system, we skipped dessert in favor of cheese and german sweet wine which we reodered...and reordered: yummy I was really going in looking for the silver lining because they were only open for like a month when we went. They impressed. It's on my radar for a next date place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We stop at Lui Lui's whenever we travel.  The restaurant is an hour from our house and a good place to stop for lunch or dinner after a long day on the road.  So, nice location. In the past, the restaurant has always been consistently good.  Not so last night. First, when we pulled into the parking lot, we were all dismayed to see a very tacky neon sign hanging over their front door.  I love lighted signs but this sign belongs on the streets of a red light district. We were quickly seated...  this, too, was good since there were many people waiting ahead of us.  I can only assume they were all together looking for a big table.   It took 15 minutes for a waitress to come to our table to tell us about specials and order our drinks.  This is completely unacceptable.  So, since this initial wait was so long, we ordered our entire dinner since we had more than enough time to look over the entire menu.   We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks.  It was obvious our server forgot about the drinks because she saw our table and then did an about-face and headed back to get our drinks.  Then there was confusion about the drinks...  wrong drinks...  no lemon which we asked for in our waters...  etc.  For some reason, the server had difficulty understanding our frustration at these simple requests.  Waiting for drinks is NEVER acceptable...  getting the drink order wrong is even less acceptable.  This was POOR. The bread was as good as usual so that was pleasant.  The oil that accompanies the bread, however, seemed very different than we remembered (we were a party of three).  We remember the oil being a nice olive oil, warm, with chopped garlic and some fresh chopped basil.  This oil was COLD, had absolutely no garlic in it nor even a hint of garlic taste, and was filled with fresh chopped basil.  It was 'different'...  not good, not bad, just different yet a let-down since we all loved the garlic oil of past visits. The food arrived rather quickly.  Once we bit into the food, we understood how it came out so quickly.  The lasagna was COLD and still frozen in the middle.  It was inedible. The eggplant parm looked like two burnt in-soles to someone's old ratty shoes.  It tasted just as bad.  This too was inedible. The chicken parm was 'okay'...  again, not bad, not good.  The breading was gooey...  there was entirely too much sauce over it...  and the cheese tasted like tough, chewy skim-milk cheese.  Overall I would rate this chicken parm dish a 3/10. The pasta that came with our eggplant and chicken was crispy from being put in the oven.  So, the pasta was POOR.  Additionally, there was entirely too much sauce smothering this burnt pasta.   It seems to me that either there is a new owner here, and/or a new head chef.  The changes we experienced last night were terrible starting with that tacky neon sign hanging over their front door and ending with shoe in-soles being served for dinner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been here a half-dozen times with my family and the food is always quite good. BUT, two of those visits were spoiled by very slow and inattentive service, including tonight. The previous time, we waited 10 minutes before one of the two regular waitresses came to our table. Tonight, we walked in, sat down and waited 20 minutes. There were two other tables occupied in the main dining room.  In fact, there were more staff in the restaurant than patrons. Despite the fact it was a slow night, we were never given menus, and in fact, neither of the two regular waitresses EVER came to our table.  I watched as one of them chatted behind the counter, while occasionally glancing at our table, but then continuing to chat and pick at her nails. She eventually came into the dining room, grabbed cleaning spray and a rag and cleaned some of the tables, again glancing in our direction, but NEVER offering help. The other regular waitress also saw us numerous times, including coming into the dining room, looking straight at us and then grabbing a container of utensils before going back to the kitchen. We eventually gave up and walked out. Needless to say, I will NEVER go to this place again.  The food is good, but just not distinct or great enough for me to put up with the horrible service. I can get routine Italian dishes at 50 other places nearby. Which is why it is so abhorrent that the staff at this place just do not seem to care. You'd think they would try harder - especially if they are not getting crowds through the door, which it seems they are not. I would urge all of you to steer away from this place. In my experience, poor service and generally apathetic staff is a sure sign that there is something much worse going on.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Was excited to come here for a couple of reasons - 1) having a friend who was a Tabla alum, and 2) a new restaurant that was within a 5 minute walk of my apartment is always a boon.   The service is excellent without being overly obtrusive; the waitstaff moved effortlessly from the kitchen to the table, and while you could see the army of people in the kitchen, the activity was far from chaotic - extremely well choreographed.   We began with the Cod Throats Meuniére (recommended by our host), the Orange Ricotta with Beets and Grilled Bread, and the Pumpkin Crab Soup.  Since there were 4 of us, my friend requested that we share the soup, which they graciously did.  My other friend ordered the Grilled Sardines with Frisée aux Lardons (which I decided to avoid, since I am not a fan of sardines).  The soup was brought in 4 espresso sized cups, well, technically, the room-temperature crab was brought out, and then the soup was poured over the crab, and the small spoons allowed us to savor every rich creamy bite, with a hint of warmth (perhaps ginger?).  The ricotta and beets were tender and flavorful, and were excellent served on top of the grilled bread (multi-grain from Sullivan Street Bakery, grilled with a touch of olive oil).  I could have made a meal from the shared appetizers alone; a lovely balance of rich, yet light enough not to make me feel sluggish.  The Cod Throats were the most decadent of the appetizers, and I only needed a few bites to taste - excellent sauce to accompany the cornmeal-breaded fish.   My friends shared the Bacon-Shrimp Burger with Spice-Dusted Fries, ""BPC"" Melt - Bacon, Pear and Cheddar Toast with Arugula Salad, and I ordered the Seared Diver Scallops with Cauliflower.  The scallops were glazed with a sauce that had a sweet/tangy tamarind base, and the cauliflower had a slight taste of cumin (presumably a throwback to Tabla).   The  entree was perfectly portioned, and filled me up, which made me skip dessert, which was my only regret, since my friends ordered the Chocolate Pecan Layer Cake with Pecan-Chocolate Chip Ice Cream and the Butterscotch Pot de Crème with Chocolate Streusel and Single ""Maltmallows"" .  They favored the Pot de Crème, even though one of my girlfriends commented that the sauce looked like cheese *grin*   I have to say I forgot the name of the cocktail (non-alcoholic) I had with the meal, but it was a cucumber-based drink with a slight bite of pepper at the end of each sip.  Very refreshing, and honestly, even if they were to serve it non-virgin, I would still order it without booze.  The lemon verbena tea is also a nice lunch option. Looking forward to coming back and tasting the desserts (interesting combination of sorbets - in particular the grapefruit-tarragon).","[1.0, 0.0]"

The decor is really cool, the pizzas are fantastic and creavtively named after some surrounding neighborhoods (the brighton beach bacon is heaven). The bar is eclectic and versatile . The bartenders mentioned to someone i was with that they all the components of their hand crafts drinks are made in the house (simple classic cocktails similar to Clover Club). Very classy and unique for the area. The guy and girl behind the bar had great chemistry together and were on point. The servers were very friendly and kept it all under control despite the rush. This was by far the most organized opening I have seen. Just to warn everyone now: get there early.

"originally we wanted to go to Totto Ramen, but because of timing we were not able to go there and found this place on yelp! =) my friend and I are glad we gave this place a try! the wait was not long. the place is busy and loud with music and the shouting from employees about dishes? it got a bit annoying, but eventually you can learn to ignore it. anyway, there were many choices on the menu and everything sounds so delicious! my friend and I ordered a lot of food for two people, unknowingly that you CAN NOT doggie bag any food! so please make sure you can eat all the food you ordered and not waste food! ;) the appetizers of fried shrimp was ok normal cocktail kinda dish, the pepper could have been better, but the BUNS! my friend had the veggie and i had the pork, man they were delicious!!! we even craved the buns everyday for 3 days! it was that good. Though the pork bun was a bit too fatty- at least the ones i had, a bit more lettuce than one sheet would make it 200% perfect! I'm not a ramen fan, so the ramen was alright, but the soup was very tasty! ahh, dessert: we had the green tea brulee and anin tofu w/ green tea ice cream, both were delicious! i cant wait to come back again!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So the only good days to go to Emerald Corner are Tuesday nights. I've been there on weekend nights and it's too overly crowded to even move around!  I only like going there on Tuesday nights for their Dollar Beer Night, but I haven't even gone to that in a while.   A lot of people who live in the Clifton area end up here because of dollar beer...So, after waiting over fifteen minutes to place my beer order, no bar tender came to our table so I decided to go up to the bar and waited for another five minutes,  I then asked ""Can you please take our order?"" and the bartender, a big-baldhead bloke called Chris responded back with very loud ""Do I f**king look like I want to take your order?"" and then he said to the female bartender, ""Do not to take his order!"",  so I then asked him, ""What did I do to warrant this?"", and he then angrily reacted ""Get out!""  He then pushed me and said ""I will call the cops because you are now trespassing!"" and I am like what's his problem, I didn't do anything wrong and I was thrown out for no apparent reason. I felt really embarrassed because Chris (the bartender) disrespected me in front of everyone in the bar.. Would I ever come back here?  NO WAY!  I call this extremely unprofessional and terrible customer service! If he can't work in a crowded location then he shouldn't work there at all! He should be fired for sure! Seriously, this place epitomizes everything on my list of ""can't stands"" in the of city Clifton.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My husband and I were so excited to come here to try the pizza. We had just taken ""Scotts Pizza Tour"" and Scott totally recommended this place and based on all the positive reviews, we had to stop by before we left New York. When we got there, the place was pretty packed. Its a tiny pizza parlor with 3-4 tables. We waited for close to a hour for our pizza. I think I was expecting the best pizza I ever ate but I must say that we did not like the pizza at all. We ate about two slices each bc we waited so long for it and at close to 30bucks for the pie, we did not want to waste it. Yes the pizza is thin but thats about all it has going for it. The pizza is really salty. Im not sure if its the cheese or the dough but it was way salty in a bad way. It was also really oily and greasy. Compared to all the pizza I have had in New York, this place had the worst. It just was not that good and totally not worth the long trip down to Brooklyn and the long wait.

"Decent food, good selection of draughts, terrible event management, bearable acoustics, friendly people, and overall a decent place to settle in for a mediocre night. If you're thinking of playing here, I've had only terrible experiences. The last time I played here, we had to leave for a friend's surprise birthday party at midnight the night of our show. We asked the door man if there was any pay for the event, and he said that we would have to wait for the end of the show in order to sign a contract to be paid. Not trying to do that, we asked how much it would be, and the door man 'estimated' about 5-10 dollars for the entire band. Now, in my experience, the person working at the door has only one job: to know how much money is coming in. Later in the evening, we received a text from one of the other bands letting us know that we had actually earned $60. This would have been a nice addition to our recording fund and worth waiting another hour. We played for their venue, we brought them beer-loving customers, and we spent money at the bar for drinks; yet, they did not even have the courtesy to give us to money that we earned. I don't play for an extremely popular band, but we are very closely connected with the following that we have.

"So wow! We had high expectations when we read other reviews about this place and we left fulfilled. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was a very quiet, small place to eat. The staff was very polite and did a great job. They tried to speak tagalog to me, but they unfortunately didn't know that I speak more cantonese than i do tagalog (I'm  chinese/filipino). I had the ""crispy chicken"", which I would describe as a a Thai/Malaysian coconut curry chicken dish. I kid you not, I ate that dish clean! The one thing I did not like was the small serving of rice it came with. I'm sure if you're Asian you would understand since it's the staple of most Asian dishes.

Also, the dessert portions were very manageable - a trio of sorbets was the perfect finish. The space is really pleasant - not too loud or too crowded, and the plant lined skylights do an excellent job of opening the room up and bringing the outdoors in.

"A group of friends and I made a reservation  to eat here for our monthly dinner. After drooling over the menu for a week, we were very excited. The food was 5 stars. At the table we ordered the mac n cheese, mussels, crawfish pot pie, an app of the day (fried beignet), spinach salad, chopped salad, and the ribeye steak. All of which was delicious. Appetizer portions were very large, so many of us were satisfied with having them come out as an entree. Desserts were so-so. The beer and pretzels dessert did not taste like either, better described as a chocolate torte but overall bland. The winning desserts of the evening were the bread pudding and sweet potato duo. The service was 3 star. Our waiter was very condescending towards us. Perhaps he was frustrated dealing with a large group of women whom were attempting to catch up. One of their signature cocktails had a displeasing taste so we asked if it would be ok to replace it. Our waiter made an obvious facial expression of annoyance but did bring us another option. From that point on he made sarcastic remarks all evening. At one point in the meal, a couple of our diners did not like the sauce that accompanied the steak and asked if there were other options available. Upon returnig from he kitchen, he then proceeded to give us a lecture on the aging process of the meat and how it should taste. We reiterated that the meat was wonderful but inquiring after sauce options. He returned with hot sauce. Then when we politely declined and continued with our meal.  He made a production of going to a corner store to find some A1, bolting from the restaurant and then doubling back through the kitchen. Perhaps he meant it as a joke but he took a simple request and turned it into a situation. Unfortunately will not be returning here. There are many other amazing spots with amazing customer service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let me first start off by saying that I LOVE Steven Starr restaurants! The experience I had most recently at Continental Mid-town was beyond disappointing. I have been to Continental more times then I can count over the years. I have been there for dates, dinner, cocktails, parties, work gatherings etc. My experience was on Friday September 5th in the evening. My boyfriend and I were out with another couple when we decided to get dinner. Why not Continental? It's a great go to place with multiple people. The evening started out as normal. Our waitress was very kind. I didn't even think to complain when I received my mid-town mocha and it wasn't to normal standard. (Instead of looking more chocolate-y, it was a clear brown). We ordered about 6 to 7 dishes. One of those dishes being the cheese steak egg rolls. Which are always yummy. Well, this is where the night turned. I went to try the cheese steak egg roll and as I took a bite and went to pull away something VERY tough was between my teeth. Thats when I noticed I was pulling out of the spring roll a large piece of plastic. In shock I looked to my boyfriend and placed it on my plate. Our waitressed happened to be walking by and he grabbed her. She immediately grabbed the plate, said I am so sorry and walked away. About two minutes later she came back to the table with a new plate of spring rolls. That seemed a little bit to normal for me. I honestly was so disgusted I could not eat any longer. After sitting there for about ten min and not having the waitress or a manager come speak to us to apologize I decided to speak to someone.   I waited at the hostess station for a manager. I see a man running the down stairs towards me. I say hi and he asks, ""you are the one that found a small piece of plastic in your egg roll?"" I said small? I said it was a very large piece. He then proceeded to show me with his hands and say ""So you mean it was this big"" placing his hands shoulder with apart. I said no but any piece of plastic is large enough. (Mind you the piece of plastic was 3-4 inches long and an inch wide). He then went on a rant where 1 in a thousand times something like this happens and I happened to be that thousandth person. That these things happen all the time working in food. That all their food is fresh and they have some old woman come in every morning making those egg rolls with love. He was very patronizing and dismissive. He seemed overwhelmed and clearly does not know how to speak to people. He said that the spring rolls would be free (haha, ok) and my drink would be free. I returned to my table and explained to everyone what happened and they were all taken back as to how condescending the manager was towards me. The waitress also brought over a random blue moon for anyone to drink at our table. Umm ok, thats weird. No one was drinking a blue moon. I will not return to Continental Mid-town ever again. Living in a city like Philly there are endless places to choose from for drinks and food. Continental Mid-town will NOT be one of them. The manager did not help the situation and made my decision so much easier to never return. I work in customer service myself and we all know that no matter how stressful things are and crazy they can get that we always need to stay professional and calm and treat our customers with respect. Bad news travels to so many more people then good news. This manager did not do his restaurant any favors that night.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I do not recommend Above Restaurant and Bar.  The thing about it is that it tries hard to have fancy cuisine, with a nice atmosphere and nice service, but it just fails.  The prices are high, and simply don't justify the food, which is really nothing special.  The service really bad.  They neglect you and are very inattentive, and in fact act pompous.  I went there recently and we sat FOREVER waiting for our food.  The waiter didn't even come by to assure us that the food was coming, it seemed like he forgot about us.  The space is fairly nice, I guess, but that's really the best thing you can say about it, unfortunately.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Our food (braised pork quesadilla and queso fondido) came out ice cold. Like literally, cold, with hardened cheese. We let the waitress know, she took it away, but never came back with new ones! There was a competent looking man who seemed to be managing other issues/tables, so we asked him about our food and minutes later were presented with new dishes. But honestly, they still weren't that hot. Warm. Very tasty though, I could have eaten two more of the pork quesadillas.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I went with the Sicilian, and could not have been happier. This pizza does not need cheese, I'm convinced there is nothing that could make it more delicious than it is. My stepdad and boyfriend additionally scarfed down nearly 30 wings, which were large and meaty. Not only is the food amazing, the owner was working the register and phones and he was extremely nice.

"So here's the deal. I think that a chef of Bobby Flay's caliber and innovative ability has to know that in today's day and age, you've got to cater to a very diverse palate in your eating establishments. And when even Burger King has a veggie burger, you've got to wonder how BBP has missed out on the $$$ from the hungry vegetarians out there who want some grub too! Like seriously, believe it or not, we love a gourmet burger too (just with a different patty)! That being said, the shakes, the fries, and the one veggie friendly option that they have, the grilled cheese sandwich, are all pretty good, if not great. I think that the environment is perfectly done - capitalizing on today's hip and trendy scene, and the location in the middle of UC Philadelphia, along with the name of a legendary Iron Chef and accessible prices to most college students (especially UPenn ones) makes this a good place. Again, though, I'm just aghast at the oversight that left out a veggie burger offering in their lineup (and I religiously tweet @bflay demanding an answer about the same).

"Really?  A 4.5 rating?!  C'mon Yelpers.  There's better pizza in NY than Lucali for sure.   For the crust, I wasn't impressed.  I'm a big fan of thin-crust pizza but it had too much of a charcoal/burnt taste for me.  You're probably saying, ""Yeah, it's cooked in wood-fired brick oven.""  But that doesn't mean I want charcoal flavor on my pizza!   Also, I feel like they take too much time getting the pie to you after it's taken out of the oven.  I swear they spend 5 minutes sprinkling stuff on it after it's done...I prefer the pizza to be piping hot right out the gate.   From a devoted pizza fan, I would recommend Grimaldi's or Lombardi's over Lucali if you're looking for a good NYC pie.   And if you're ever in Los Angeles, check out Pizzeria Mozza, probably the best pizza I've ever tasted.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There was a nice selection of gifts, as well. There were some beautiful, affordable ($3) cards. I was impressed by the atmosphere in the book area. Today I tried again. I ordered a half hummus/veggie sandwich and a small soup, and it cost $10.01. I was surprised that when I ordered the food I was expected to do take-out. Turns out, it's not like other bookstore cafes where you order and then go sit at a table. You have to be seated like a restaurant here. The sandwich was delicious!

"This is one of our favorite restaurants to go to! Every time we have eaten here the service has been outstanding, the food is always fresh and delicious, and it has a great atmosphere. I spotted this place by accident one evening when we were trying to figure out where to go for dinner, and we have been hooked ever since. The first time we came here, we didn't realize it was byob, and the owner of the restaurant offered to have someone go get a bottle of wine for us- now that is service. Their kabaps are fantastic (personally Selcuk's is my favorite), their appetizers are all very good (hummus especially), and their baklava is the best I have ever had. You can also sit outside, which is great now that the weather is nice, and enjoy a well-packed hookah after your meal. I can't say enough about their service (at least all the times we have eaten here- which is maybe 7 or 8 by now) and we have enjoyed every meal we've tried.

"I should have written this review months ago, so let's just pretend for a moment it's, say, November of 2009. The burgers here are pretty small, but they're GOOD. I love the potato roll, I love the fries with tons of black pepper, the special sauce is awesome. I love it, I do. The first time I came here (2009), my friend had a stomach ache and the waiter gave her a free ginger ale with bitters to try to make her feel better. He was quick with our orders and really friendly. He doesn't work there anymore. Flash forward to last week. The people that do work there are inconsistent. I've have good service since my first visit and I've also had awful service. The hostess is usually distracted by her friends, and the food runners/bussers confuse me and are pretty spotty The last time I was there our table was cleared, I mean CLEARED (they took my water!) 10 minutes before we even got the check. I understand not rushing with the check if someone is hanging out and drinking, but it was early and we weren't. When the waitress did come up to us at our totally cleaned off table, she just asked us if everything was okay. When we asked for the check she seemed confused/startled. The girl was very nice, but she didn't seem to be trying at all. We weren't in a hurry so we found it more amusing than anything, but it really is unacceptable to be stuck that long waiting. The food here is good, but it's pretty pricey for what it is. And the service is, well, pretty frickin' bad. I'll still come here because I think the Piazza is fun and I have a magnetic pull to burger-joints, but there is definitely room for improvement.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I found Egan & Sons on the internet when I searched for restaurants in the West Orange area that serve Sticky Toffee Pudding. My husband and I went for the first time tonight.

He said the spinach was garlicky and awesome and the sweet potato fries were great and he wants to go back again and again. I ordered the ""Toasties - Reuben"" which were 2 toasted reuben sandwiches and were also quite good. However, I was very disappointed in the sticky toffee pudding which was not very moist tonight. I admit to being spoiled having it in Scotland many times. Tonight's didn't even really taste like it did before.

"I was born in Bungsar Maternity Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I grew up in Bukit Bintang and went to  grade school at the Good Sheperd Convent. I can vouch for authentic Malaysian Cuisine and the quality of food at Penang is as good as it gets! I highly recommend the Satay dishes and Beef Rendang. You have to grow up in Southeast asia to really appreciate the Sambal and Belachan Dishes as this I think is an acquired taste ( a cacophony of pungent, salty,bitter, sour and spicy tastes). The best Char Kway Teow I've tasted was in the Four Season's Resort Beach Restaurant in Pulau Langkawi in idyllic Andaman Sea off the NW Coast of Malaysia. The Penang version comes in a close second! The Hainanese chicken rice is very delicious as well as the ginger and scallion  dish variations. Malaysian Cuisine is a blend between Indian and Chinese Cuisine but less spicy and less greasythan the former and latter respectively. The Service is very cordial and swift. You should all come and enjoy this magnificent place right in our backyard!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"As I realize the cloverleaf is an institution which supports great craft beer I felt obligated to update my review. Average food is definitely a drawback, however they maintain a solid bar with friendly and knowledgable tenders. As I love craft beer and all of its intricacies the clove provides ample room to sample some of the best brews from around the globe in a comfortable and friendly environment. It's a local bar with such feeling, but the regulars are warm and friendly from all of my experiences and will not hesitate to strike up conversation regarding the latest seasonal or small batch brew that they skipped out of work early to taste before the keg kicks. A model beer program deserves three stars; however I wish they could step up the food offerings so I could make this my go to bar. Instead I have to eat dinner elsewhere and stop by for the brews.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went to the Cranbury  Inn on 13 May 2012 for Mothers Day brunch we took our mother, grandmother and grandchildren. We made reservation the week before mothers day. I asked would they have an omelet station and was told yes , I felt this would be grate because my mother and grandmother could only eat egg white somelet. When we got to our table we were told sorry we have to many  people we are not making omelets today. So our mother said we  would eat something else. We all end up getting the scramble eggs from the buffet table and they were cold . I told management about it and his response was that when they put them out  they get cold. This was a very poor comment for management to make. Every time we asked to bring us coffee was also cold, then we got the check, we paid the check and the waitres asked how was everything my reply was service was good everything else was dreadful.So we paid and left the inn and were talking and taking pictures with the mothers outside,.then the owner  came outside and said to me we put you in and you should be glag we served you today.  At this point my response was, sir we did not ask for anything from you or your restaurant but a proper meal with quality of over quantity .We feel the owner and management working that day were very rude and obnoxious and unproffesional.  The good folks of Cranbury NJ should not let this restaurant operate with this type of management.

The hostess immediately sat us (we were a bit late for our reservation) and our waitress followed soon after.  We took a good 10 minutes to thoroughly check out the menu before placing our order.  We started with the goat cheese gnocchi, tuna tartar, and the oysters.  All of which were fantastic.  We then placed our orders.  3 out of 6 of us were anticipating their lobster dinner.  Unfortunately, the waitress failed to inform us before hand that they were out of the Lobster AND the Pork Chop dish (my second choice).  That was a huge blow to me, but lucky for them, this place is rather exceptional, so practically any dish would do.  It was definitely disappointing to hear the waitress say, ""well next time, come earlier.""  What can I say though, she's a rude New Yorker and I'm just a simple southerner from the most powerful city in the world, D.C.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A one way ticket to noodle heaven.  Nan Zhou sits right across the street from the not so secret Hop Sing Laundromat, and is probably the best noodle soup you will get in Philadelphia.  Each bowl is extra large, piping hot, and stuffed with hand drawn noodles (you pick how you like them).   Based on reviews I ordered the brisket noodle soup and the boo ordered the special meatball.  We started with shrimp pork & chive dumplings which we demolished in a little less than 4 minutes.  We ordered our dumplings steamed, and inbetween bites we examined the bright green chives mixed in with the pork...what I'm trying to say is that they're very fresh and very delicious.   When my soup arrived I was hit in the face with a fragrant cilantro steam.  Who would've thought that cilantro was used in Chinese noodle soups?  It's a wonderful addition, and I'd also recommend having the spinach added as well.  You can even go as far as putting a fried egg in your soup, but for even the regular bowl you are going to be stuffed.  When I go back I think I'd have the lamb or shrimp.  The brisket was indeed delicious, but extra fatty and ripping off those fatty pieces with chopsticks is difficult. No shame in being awkward with the sticks here.  I swear there was no judgement as I munched my way through a hanging chunk of noodles clinging to my chopsticks.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Umami Burger, thank you for taking my burginity. That is, I haven't eaten a burger in about 5 years. (Born again burger virgin.) I got the original and my friend got the truffle burger with the egg. We ordered both of ours medium rare, and it was done perfectly. Let me start with the meat, so juicy and falls apart right away once its in your mouth. It has the perfect fat content. And unlike your typical burger, (Shake Shack, I'm speaking to you...) it wasn't too salty. The original is the perfect balance of savory and sweet. Can't really name all the components but my three favorite were the shitake mushroom (what a creative and delicious touch!), the parmesan cheese crisp (added the perfect amount of salt), and the bun. Oh yeah, those soft, fluffy potato buns are amazing. so so so good. I really enjoyed the burger. We also got a pickle platter, and I definitely recommend if if you're a pickle slut, which I am. There were 4 different kinds of in house pickles (cauliflower, cucumber, okra, and string beans!!) I wasn't a fan of the fries, and in my opinion, they could be skipped.

"For how measly the appetizer portions were, we were blown away by the quality and amount of the main course. The Suckling Pig (""Why don't they just call it a piglet??"" was a 5-min topic of discussion...) with chimichurri sauce, sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts was SO. GOOD. Way exceeded our expectations. Get it. Even the brussels sprouts were amazingly flavored with a slight crunch on the outside, and 0 bitterness inside... Note to brussels sprouts fans: The brussels sprouts that came with the Suckling Pig rank in my top 2 all-time brussels sprouts incarnations... The chili lime fried brussels sprouts at Rouge et Blanc, but that is a more occasional flavor (and fat content). Peekytoe crab + uni + I think cauliflower puree? was very tasty, but also very tiny. One of those hook-em-by-putting-uni-on-the-menu things. My eyes had seen the word and could not stray to any other menu items until we settled on trying it. The grilled octopus with chorizo/potato was very tender. The octopus was good and flavor, its texture was consistent, not at all rubbery. The chorizo and potatos were cold though. Came here for lunch for 4 on Christmas day. Props for being open and filled to a comfortable capacity, and having good service even on a high holiday.

"We arrived early and without a reservation.  The restaurant was maybe 15-20% full and they seated us in a weird location near the stairs.  Most other tables were empty, and when we finished our meal 45 minutes later, most of those tables were still available.  Patrons and restaurant staff bumped the back of my chair as they walked by.  Overall the service was good though. I ordered the striped bass ($30), the watermelon salad ($12) and the kangaroo app ($14).   I mostly ordered the Kangaroo just for fun, but it was overly salty and generally hard to chew.  The watermelon salad was the best part of the evening, although there wasn't much to it - watermelon and a bit of feta cheese.  They went well together, and other than the price, it wasn't a bad dish.  Unfortunately my main course, the  bass, wasn't prepared as well as it could have been.  Too salty for one, but also somehow too bland and a bit fishy. (reminds me of a Jim Gaffigan quote: ""I like fish....As longs as it doesn't taste like fish....I got news buddy I don't think you like fish"")  If I took a bite of the fish and made sure i was  getting a bit of  the skin, it was much better, however the skin was over-salted.  Paired with the fish was a fried green tomato which wasn't very appetizing either. I added an extra star for ambiance as this place is really amazing looking.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Witherspoon Grill received mixed reviews on Yelp so I put it on the back burner to test out.  I had heard...""Good but very pricey""  I would say at their price point they are just decent.  Witherspoon presents themselves as a fine dining experience and while the ambiance and service do live up to that reputation the kitchen certainly does not. I ordered the pear and blue cheese salad to start based on the recommendation of the server and it was truly a great salad.  The combo of the brown pear and blue cheese was a wonderful blend.  For my entree, I had the special risotto and my BF had the Strip Steak.  While I realize risotto is made with large amounts of butter and rice...it is usually made with other ingredients which contribute flavor to the dish, but this risotto just tasted like a block of butter with some rice thrown in.  My BF ordered his steak medium rare but was given a steak cooked medium well.  If you are a steakhouse...you really must cook steak right.  I want to give Witherspoon another chance but when you pay out $200 and you just don't know what you are going to get its hard to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I mean is it just me? How did this chick even make it to Top Chef? Honestly, I'm not here to burn and and will get to the point in a second but I used to know a bunch of Asian chicks from San Fran that loved this place and used to invite me there for happy hour. Never went because it seemed out of the way. Then, my girlfriend saw Leah Cohen on TV, said she wanted to go and when we happened to walk by it, by chance, a few nights later we decided to give it a try. So.....here's the deal: Service-perfectly fine. We walked in on a Saturday night without reservations and they sat us Menu-server indicated it was a family style and that all plates were meant to be shared. Menu divided into two categories: small and large, with the emphasis being on small. Irrespective of category, the main missing component was flavor. The red curry wings had zero heat and a taste more reminiscent of grocery store bottled curry than anything else. The crispy pata won points for the texture of the skin but was as flavorless as the two boring sauces that were served as accompaniments. Better off going to a $10 Puerto Rican spot if you want pork like this. The saving grace was the dessert but then again you could find something remarkably similar to this for less money in Chinatown or fort lee. Super disappointing Booze-do I expect to find in a place like this an offer for serve yourself unlimited pbr draft for $15? If this is to do compensate for the poorly conceived menu, then at least offer something more tolerable than cheap college swill. On the other hand, the pigroni was a nice drink....if only they could offer it to go. I just don't get the hype surrounding this place. I worked in the restaurant business for years and inherently want to see small restaurants do well but the food here was just a tremendous letdown. Do yourself a favor and don't go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I may be a minority in saying this but on an order delivery on 1/25/13 I waited two hours for a delivery. When the food finally showed. it was cold and I refused to take it. Who in their right mind would take a delivery when the food they ordered, was cold. To their defense, it was lightly snowing so. I did take that into consideration, Two hours.....Come on! I ordered from them in the past and their food is decent!! But, screw me twice..................I think not   Anyhow, the BRUNO OWNER called to ask way I refused the delivery and after stating my displeasure he said "" Montclair State University is off our delivery list"" So, to all of you fellow MSU alumni, Please keep this in mind when you need to order pizza from BRUNO'S, that there are many within the range of MSU that is just as good  or better. BRUNO'S GETS A BIG FAT THUMBS DOWN FROM ME and its not because of the late delivery but because of the way he treats the customers......NO RESPECT and HOW CAN SOMEONE RUN A BUSINESS LIKE THAT ?

"One of my favorite new restaurants to crop up in Manhattan over the past few months. Danny Meyer is truly a master and to that point masterfully combines the perfect atmosphere, with superstar service, and of course delicious food. Step 1: Atmosphere With low amber lighting and room to breathe, the Maialino bar and dining room really deliver something great to Manhattan. The tables are spacious and spread out and the bar has multiple areas, each delivering a comfort rare to new restaurants. I highly recommend coming a bit early to have some prosecco at the bar. Step 2: Service The service at Maialino is truly refreshing and amazing. Friendly, knowledgeable staff all around. This might sound strange, but I love that they all seem so happy! No pretention whatsoever and simple genuine conversation happens easily with your bartender, server and anyone else crossing your path. Step 3: Food Of course, the food is the superstar here and does not dissapoint. Everything was very fresh, very tasty and excited the taste buds. We even shared the Maialino and it was so juicy and tender -- we also were eating the leftovers all week long! Just make a reservation and make it happen.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What's wrong with people?? People go bananas over Freemans, and finally after many many months, I am now able to say to these people, BLAH! Maybe there was just too much hype but this place is okay at best. The environment is kind of fun and hunting-lodge-ish and feels like only really cool people eat there, but my number one reason for going to a restaurant is to have awesome food. The food here was not awesome. But before I get to that, can I just say I had to wait an effin hour to get a table? I know brunch is beloved by NYers, especially NY hipsters, but it was cold outside and there was barely any waiting space indoors. The good thing was that it was only a few blocks away from shops so I was able to pass the time and ignore my rumbling tummy by buying shoes! Anyway, onto the food. Well, there's not much to say about it. It was very buttery and way too rich for my taste. I ordered the skillet eggs with gruyere and spinach and all I could really taste was butter and the oil from the cheese. The sourdough toast it came with was good but would have been better if it didn't also have a spread of butter on it. My friend ordered the soft-scrambled eggs with sausage and potatoes and it was eh. The one saving grace of the meal was the side of cheese grits which were quite delicious. They had lots of texture and flavor and was 100x better than our entrees. I didn't have any of the specialty drinks so maybe that's what I missed out on. I got my fill of Freemans after one visit and I doubt I'll be coming back here again. The combination of the wait and the lackluster food gives this place a 2 star rating.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We'd called ahead to ask them to hold the table but they gave it away and didn't really care (""well, you could go to Ella down the street""...).  More galling was that another group also arrived late and they got given their table, despite not calling ahead.

"I am not sure which TV show I saw this on, but when the taxi from Newark airport dropped us off at the New York Hilton across the street, I just knew I recognized those yellow shirts from somewhere. My mouth remembered even though my brain did not and I started salivating immediately remembering the show talking about lamb, chicken, salad, sauce and it is some good eatin'! Our flight from Dallas that morning was an early one so I was so hungry, in a new, and yes scary city so that looked like a quick option. The line was 15 deep, so I told Mom to go and check us in and by the time she was tipping the valet in our room for handling the bags, I was walking in with 2 chicken/lamb combos with salad/rice, pita and extra sauce. We unpacked, chowed down and it was the perfect lunch to fuel us to explore this crazy city. The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned. Creamy and flavorful, fresh and quick. The chicken had a tasty little char on it and the juices got all down around the rice.. mmmMMM, but it was really the pungent white sauce was the thing that brought it all together into a balanced bite. We had a blast and ate at some amazing places during that trip, but my spontaneous run across the street to get some real New York city street food was awesome all the way around, y'all! Go get some!

"I came here Friday night for dinner. I ordered the pad Thai (mild), which in my opinion was not mild at all. It was unbearable to eat so they gladly took it off of our bill and I ordered something else. I then ordered Sushi - which was made very sloppy. Every piece of sushi would fall apart as soon as I picked it up - annoying. The worst part of the night was my bf finding a sharp piece of plastic (2 inches long) in his salmon. Our waiter claimed it was from the food thermometer - Ummm really, so the chef didn't notice that the thermometer had broken off as he pulled it out of the salmon? They bought him a new salmon, and to my surprise when the bill came they still charged us for the meal. In my opinion it should have been a complimentary meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had pretty high expectations for Vietnam, as I really enjoyed my meal at one of the sister restaurants, Grill Fish Cafe in West Philly. Our meal had high and low points. We started with the Crispy Crepe appetizer - which was seemed part omelet and part crepe. It was filled with onions, veggies, and shrimp (I believe.) It was a generous portion for an appetizer, and was split very nicely between two people. I ordered the Lemongrass Soup, replacing the Chicken for some fried tofu (a request that could be accommodated.) After some deliberation and questions with the waiter (some soup has small/large size options), my boyfriend ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup (only available in large). Mine came out first, and had this bright, beautiful, colorful broth that tasted as good as it looked and smelled. The tofu was fried perfectly, and the noodles helped to soak up the incredibly flavorful and slightly spicy broth.  I definitely would order this again. My boyfriend's order comes out and it's a smaller bowl than mine. The waiter sets the soup down and we both see no seafood at all, but only a few pieces of broccoli. We call the waiter over and explain that he had ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup. After a moment of hesitation, the waiter scoops the bowl up and leaves. A solid 10 minutes later (I am halfway through my soup - trying not to eat every last drop before his soup comes out) - a new dish is put in front of him.  It is the same bowl.  With the same broccoli.  With maybe 3 or 4 shrimp on top. He ate about half of it. It was 100% not what he ordered. It was flavorless (unless steamed broccoli water and tasteless rice noodles sound appealing) and unexciting. Service otherwise was acceptable, and the atmosphere was pretty nice.  It's just a shame that he ordered and was charged for one thing, but received another.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"With Warren's mother in town for the Westminster Dog Show, and always presenting an interest in this place, we thought that it was the perfect time to check out Gramercy Tavern. It was a Saturday night, and after a couple of drinks at The Maritime Hotel's La Bottega Caffe, we jumped into a cab and booked it over to the Tavern at a time we thought would be reasonable to get a seat - we opted for the Tavern, instead of the dining room (where reservations are required). Once we entered, I was met by a very nice hostess who said that our table would be about two hours.  Not to be perturbed (usually the wait times are much less), I saddled up to the bar to get us a couple of drinks that I was able to take back to the foyer and the one, lone table that we quickly snatched up. I noticed that the bar was packed, and after having some difficulty getting an arm in, a bartender immediately noticed me and took my order.  I noticed that a lot of couples were eating at the bar - something that would probably be for the best if you were just a party of two. After about an hour of waiting, our table opened up and we were escorted into the Tavern. The Tavern (I did not see the dining room, so this is really only for the front part of the restaurant) was large with sweeping murals, flower arrangements overflowing their pots, water cans, and old, antique barrels, and bronze, candlelit scones that hung from all the walls and ceilings.  It was dark, cozy, and immediately American. The service was fast, attentive, and the server easy to answer any questions that we may have had about the menu. I started with 5 oysters on the half shell.  While I am not sure what variety of the oyster was I had, I knew it had to be from the East Coast - the flavor was both brine-y and smooth.  It felt like I was eating the ocean. For my entree, I ordered the Red Snapper with braised squid, leaks and heirloom beans.  The Snapper was cooked to perfection and the squid was sliced into long, tiny strings that almost acted as noodles in the white wine broth.  The broth was so amazing, that I could have had that for a soup and have been satisfied. To finish off the meal, I had a glass of amaretto, on the rocks, that came in the most precious miniature wine goblet. If you are ever in the mood for a most wondrous and excessively delicious meal, than I highly suggest the Gramercy Tavern.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Where is a girl from Montreal to go? I'll be honest, every time I move into a new town, I find myself scouring the streets for a French restaurant, a good one.  How could I not?  I am as French culture bred as they get.   Union League Cafe is most definitely worth a detour and a great place to bring your parents when they're in town, especially because of the price tag.  If you're expecting a casual, tightly packed, cozy French bistro serving up beef bourgignon, os a moelle, or delicious moules frites - this restaurant is not for you.   As you walk in, you're greeted by an elegant decor reminiscent of an old European club house, with white cloth tables glistening with fine dinnerware.   The service is swift, sharp and dripping in professionalism.  Indeed, this is a fine French restaurant and at the helm is chef Jean Pierre - and the food, his food, is the undeniable star.  From perfect french baguettes (crisp crust on the outside with a warm chewy inside - you will NOT find a better one in New Haven), to the infinitely silky rabbit foie gras terrine, impeccably seasoned bouillabaise and smartly chosen cheese board - I was absolutely delighted.  Given the care and cooking skills so evidently displayed on every plate, you can not help but admire how Jean Pierre exercises great restraint in keeping the food simple, authentic and delicious.

"After doing a search for some quality rib joints in the northern nj region I kept coming across the baby back ribs at Obal Inn. Obal is a neighborhood bar, think Cheers, with a large local following. They have about two craft beers on tap, with mostly your typical big brew offerings. Not really my kind of place to grab a beer, but that is because I usually go for micro brews. Obal is known for their rib night, offered only two nights a week. Wednesday and Thursdys. I have been looking to try Obal's fo close to six months now and finnally made the trek with two amigos, Adam M. And our friend Jay. Adam and me specifically made the trek to try these renowned ribs Jay decided to go with their bacon cheeseburger. We started our adventure with some wings and decided to go with the teriyaki honey garlic wings which were really really good, kinda reminded me of a saucier version of KFC, Koren Fried chicken wings. They had a really balanced flavor of savoy and sweet. A bit saucey yet the wings were really crispy and meaty. Adam and me both ordered a rack as I Mentioned earlier, which is priced really well at $9.95 a plate. Each rack is a bit bigger then a half rack, yet very meaty. The ribs were pretty tender, yet I found the ribs on the end and ESP on one side being extremely dry. To dry for my taste. I did not find the sauce to be anything special either, but then again I have been spoiled by the sauces from Baileys smoke house, Houton's in Hackensck, Bistro 55 in Rochelle Park, RUB in the city and Dinosaur BBQ. The fact the ribs were pretty dry and over cooked throughout half the ribs and the sauce tasting more of ketchup then anything I give the ribs a two out of 5. I will probably get heat for the low rating on the ribs, but there is no reason why the bid should have been so dry. The reason why I believe is as I read in other reviews is BC they prepare the ribs on Wed, and finish off selling the ribs on thursdy from what they cooked from the day before. My second criteria is the sauce, it's ok, kind of reminded me of the sauce from Jim dandys, very ketchup centric. If that's your thing you will like this somewhat tangy sauce. The ribs lack any form of smokiness, as I believe the ribs are first boiled or braised. They are then finished over a grill. Perhaps they are less dry on Wednesday. They were not bad, but def not the greatest I have had and did not blow me away. My fav nj ribs still have to be Houton's although its not the biggest rack, they are super tender and just amazingly fall off the bone goodness, but they are horribly expensive over $30 for rack. My next stop for ribs is the wood pit down the street on Bloomfield ave in Montclair where they smoke their ribs in applewood and said to have amazing homemade sauce. Jay's burger looked pretty good had what looked like a nice char and would be something I would opt to try next time I stopped by here again. I opted for onion rings for my side, the beer battered variety, not bad, run of the mill o rings, Adam went with the sweet potatoe fries, which looked to be hand cut. Fried to a nice crisp and served with horseradish sauce. I liked. Service was very friendly nd reliable. Would I recommend Obal? Yes, def check them out, they have better quality bar eats. As Pete Genovesse from the Star Ledger states, ""it's like Cheers with good food"". If you want to go to try the ribs I suggest trying it on a Wednesday night, likely they are more fresh and less dry. Otherwise depend on great wings, burgers and great pour of Guinness any night of the week.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So far, they are my favorite spot in NYC for fried chicken. Like many places, their chicken is fried perfectly. The meat is juicy and tender; the thickness and the crunch of the crust is just right, not too thick as if you were just eating the batter. What makes their chicken mind blowing is their seasoning on the Hot or Extra Hot. It is spicy but I can't stop eating it. Must. Have. Another. Bite. Arrgghh, hot-hot-hot! Put that on repeat. Their Shrimp and Grits are also great. The grits are cheesy and creamy, they are so good I can eat just a full plate of that. Their sides are fantastic: The collard greens are probably the best ones I have ever had, not too salty nor bland. You can taste the slight smokiness in the broth it was cooked in. Mashed potatoes, perfect if you are a garlic lover. Bacon-Potato Salad, well it is bacon, potato, salad. No imagination needed. The staff of Peaches Hothouse are unpretentious and they are always nice with a smile even when the place is packed. The restaurant is small and serving the food like they do (delicious and well priced), it is guaranteed to attract a crowd. So fyi, there might be some wait if you come during the rush hour. p.s. Thanks to Wing L. for putting this place on my radar.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My family and I have been frequent patrons of Raymond's for almost 10 years. Our party of 3 was there for brunch on Sunday 4/20. We first noticed that the menu's format had been changed and some familiar dishes were no longer listed. All three of us ordered the MIGAS egg dish and it was inedible!  It was smothered with 75% cheese on a 3 egg omelet, chopped up peppers, onions, soggy strips of taco shell and diluted salsa. I was very hungry and made the mistake of eating a little less than half of it, but the other two members of our party immediately complained and asked to have their dishes returned. One of the two in my party had lost his appetite after tasting his dish and passed after the server asked if wanted something else. My girlfriend did take the server up on a replacement and ordered the ""safe"" french toast. Since the MIGAS was prepared so differently from the dozens of times that we had ordered and enjoyed it,  I asked the server if the restaurant had hired a new chef? She confirmed that they did. So I guess that partly explains why the food was so awful.. So about an hour after I consumed the the MIGAS, I started to feel a rumbling in my stomach and sparing ya'll the gory details, let's just say that I spent the rest of the afternoon dealing with severe abdominal distress in the bathroom! Over the many years that I've frequented this restaurant, the food had been consistently been above average (for the exception of the over ambitiously prepared Mediterranean Burger). The only consistent complaint that I've had with Raymond's was the ear bleeding noise level. Since the restaurant was designed by the same firm that designed Keith McNally's Patis and Balthazar in NYC there is an abundance of sound reflecting hard surfaces: tin ceilings, ceramic tile floors, bare wooden table tops and acres of mirrors lining the walls, the cacophony enabled by all of the sound bouncing off all of these flat/hard surfaces is enough to drown out a conversation between people sitting across from each other that in turn causes everyone to end up shouting at each other thus increasing the sound level even higher! I would also like to take this opportunity to make a suggestion that the owners do something to isolate  and reduce the sound of crashing glasses, plates and silverware that occurs just outside the kitchen where the bus station has been set up, as this only adds to the sound level turning it up to the level of unbearable if you happen to be seated anywhere near the back of the restaurant.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I would not recommend wasting your time. You will be waiting to be made fun of at this restaurant. My wife and I have been coming to NYC from Louisiana for 5 years to visit my daughter who lives in Manhattan. We look for all the top rated places to eat each time we come to visit. We have always loved the people and the awesome food all over the city, but we've never been treated so rude as we were the morning of Tuesday March 26, 2013 at this restaurant. Waiting an hour and a half for a table is not a problem for us, but once we got inside we were laughed and gawked at by the two waitresses and the water boy the whole time. All because I asked for a glass of water. If the owner would have been monitoring his servants that day he would have fired these 3 people. It all got started when I asked for a glass of water after the orange juice had been delivered to the table.The italian in me wanted to lash out at these people but I am not about making a scene in a restaurant. The highly rated taste of the pancakes does not reflect the attitude of the servants in this place whatsoever. I was so ready to leave that I could not tell you whether the food was tasty or not. I ended up spending 75 dollars plus a tip for 3 orders of pancakes and orange juice for my wife, daughter and myself. What a huge let down to my daughter who wanted my wife and I to be treated to a place she has been a few times. All of us were telling friends at a social the same night, not to waste your time going to this place. But if you are ok with extremely poor service then go ahead and give it a try.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Lovely little brunch spot, the patio in the back is also perfect for dining al fresco on a summer's night. Staff is always friendly, interior and decor is warm, rustic yet modern. Love the enameled tableware, very french farmhouse. Many of the items of Martha's menu have been infused with some sort of Asian flavor, usually Vietnamese or Thai in my experience. The brussels sprouts are actually THAT good, and the celery salad is light, refreshing, and really tasty - even for people who usually don't like celery (myself included). Other favorites include the sunny egg and spicy pork (brunch) and the broken crepe (dinner). I like that they adjust the menu according to what is in season/available. There are a very few dishes that fall short for me, and the coffee is always way too bitter/sour for me to enjoy, but overall this is my go-to for brunch in my area. And when they get a dish right, it's really, really good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've gone to Thai O'Brien a few times now and I have to a good amount to say about the place. They have a great selection of pan-Asian food (mostly Chinese and Thai). Staple dishes like Pad See Ew are pretty good. Beef and Broccoli is really good, but every time I have ordered take out it's been a letdown. Nothing wrong with delivery or food prep time, just the quality of the food seemed lacking. Not sure, but I've never had a bad dish while physically there, so that's that. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. To sweeten the deal, the portions are huge for the prices. Perfect place for a date as you can split a soup and entree and that will definitely be enough food. In addition, there is an upstairs area that touts a full bar with TV's, Ms. PacMan arcade (hell yeah!!), and Tuesday night Karaoke!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Wine was ok. They do it Sicilian style in glasses which is quaint but if someone asks for wine glasses, a restaurant should be able to produce them. Not so here. Oh and did I mention a TWO HOUR wait and the bouncer-style lobby where areas are cordoned off.

"My my is this place busy on the weekend..l lucked out arriving at 6:00 pm Saturday night and was promptly sat. I have to say though, everyone else that arrived after us were on the waiting list for a table. I understand they were very busy but service was pretty bad.. They didn't acknowledge to take our order for over 15 minutes after being sat. I'm big on service so that made me feel a certain way already about the restaurant, but I stuck it out since I read a lot of great reviews. I have to say, food is very affordable and filling!! We got the complementary mussels which were over cooked and undesirable. Sooo, I ordered the spicy girl roll which consisted of shrimp tempura, cucumber, kani, spicy sauce and crunch. I asked for it to be Extra spicy but it wasn't, I had to use siracha sauce to enjoy to my liking. It was an OK roll nothing I would crave, matter fact, my first 2 rolls had no shrimp in them which was a disappointment, I thought they forgot to put it until I saw the shrimp towards the end of the roll. The bento box was good overall but again not amazing. For dessert, I ordered the mochi greet tea that came out frozen solid. As the waiter was placing it on the table, he advised that its still frozen from last night shipment, as soon as he said that I said no thank you. One, if its not freshly made I can easily go to the store myself and get it. Two, it was frozen solid, sorry but I like my teeth, don't want to lose them over this..haha anyways its an ok place but I wouldn't run here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Waste of time & money! My wife and I were visiting Burlington and decided to go out for some sushi... we chose this place based on some of the reviews from Yelp. Big mistake. To start with the place was cold and drafty. Once we were seated, it took the waitress about 20 minutes to take our food and drinks order. My wife ordered one roll for an appetizer and the chicken teriyaki for her main course. I just ordered three rolls of sushi. After about 20 minutes of waiting (this is in addition to the 20 minutes we waited get our orders taken), we finally asked the waitress about our meal. Five minutes later my wife's dinner came out, the chicken teriyaki. The chicken was warm, not hot, rubbery in texture and without much flavor. The vegetables that came with her dish were not even warm, just room temperature. She never received her appetizer. When we asked about the appetizer, it seemed as though the waitress had completely forgotten about it. Finally, about 10 minutes after my wife's dinner came out, my dinner was served, the three rolls. Simply put, it was nothing great. It was just okay. This place scores below average on atmosphere, service and food, in our humble opinion.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I can't really describe the flavor ...it was simply amazing! They had just the right amount of juicyness, texture & flavor. Also, I found interesting how they coordinated each of the plates to match one another, meaning that ex: the soup that they crafted would complement the next dish, etc. I definitely recommend this place.

"Great cold cuts, great cheese, great pizza, great beer! Barboncino (""Poodle"" in Italian), is a restaurant where the quality matches the price. It's more expensive than what we are commonly used to from a pizzeria in America, but Barboncino is no common pizza joint. The dough is soft and crunchy, the results of an excellent oven and a knowledgeable chef. The sauce tastes like it's made from succulent tomatoes. The toppings are what you would expect from a pizzeria in Italy: sparing, balanced and first-rate, starting with fior di latte instead of the typical low-grade pizzaiolo one finds piled high on American pies. In short you get quality instead of quantity. Don't overlook the salami board appetizer! The waiters are friendly and eager to please. The outdoor picnic-style seating out back has a cozy feel to it, but it's not for intimate dining. (Stay inside instead.) Barboncino ti voglio tanto bene!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Was really excited to try this place out. Went on New Years Eve-Eve and I feel like they may have packed it in for the holiday. The food we had made Maggiano's look like a 5 star restaurant. Chicken Parm tasted like I made it (i'm not a cook) The fried mozzarella tasted like it was from the freezer aisle... I will say though that the Fettuccinni(sp?) Alfredo was probably the best i've ever had, that was the highlight of the meal along with excellent service from our waiter Luis. every dish was served lukewarm however, white sauce in the linguini with clams dish was borderline cold. We ordered ceasar salad for the table, everyone ended up with one measly portion that cost us $45... $45  for some lettuce and dressing in a bowl is aggravating Again, I chalk it up to the hysteria surrounding times square on New Years. I'd more than likely give this place another shot because the wait staff was so friendly which left somewhat of a positive vibe Oh..... the Sangria was solid as well, $26 for a pitcher that fills about 6-8 glasses, not very strong however. You'd need to drink about 4 or 5 glasses to get a good buzz going.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love this cafe. It's my favorite place in New York City. I'm not from NYC, and I've never lived there. However, I used to have plenty of cause to visit, and whenever I was there my stomping grounds were the Village and Chelsea. I've been north of 34th maybe a  half dozen times; but I can navigate those neighborhoods, Tribeca, downtown, etc. pretty reliably. Anyway, I don't go to NYC very often any more. When I do, though, I'm often left with whole days to myself and what do I do? I tromp around the neighborhoods that make me nostalgic. Le Grainne Cafe is a landmark in that tour. I sit and drink espresso and write and soak in the light hearted self-seriousness that characterizes the median patron. I've done some of my best writing there. That's not saying much. I wrote this there.

"It's takes a lot of effort to cause someone to go from evangelist to hater, but, sadly, this is where I now am with Barbuzzo, and here's the down and dirty as to why: 1) The menu was designed for ""twice a year"" diners: for all intents and purposes, it hasn't changed since they opened and has become boring to anyone who has been more than three times.  It's super heavy in the summer and much more appropriate in cooler months. 2) It's hard work cooking on a line.  I've done it.  But it has become clear that some of the kitchen staff don't have a respect for the food, and actually are quite content pushing out undercooked plates for the sake of turnover.  (If you read closely through other reviews, you can see this as a trend, even on otherwise positive summaries.)  They are simply pumping out the dishes as quickly as possible to turn over tables, and this has taken a toll on the quality of what is being served.  This phenomenon has ruined three meals I have had here in as many months. 3) This is the main reason I probably won't ever go back: the service is inconsistent.  And I'm not talking ""efficient but not warm""...more like ""I'm going to treat you like crap and not even pretend you are spending money here"".  When kitchen mistakes happen at Barbuzzo (as they do at every restaurant), I have been treated as though I have no idea what I'm talking about despite spending a few thousand a year on dining in Philly.  Forget an apology.  There is no admission of wrong doing as if they are afraid they might have to comp you something!  Very classy way to run a business.  I have no idea if this is from top down, or just a rotten serving culture at this place, but the attitude is PALPABLE.   This isn't detectable at any of Barbuzzo's competitors like Amis or Garces Trading.  If they make a mistake, the KITCHEN is embarrassed and sends out a new plate fast, no questions asked.  Here, the kitchen either doesn't care, or I don't know... there is no management!  It seems likes the guys making pizzas call the shots.  And to be honest, it doesn't take kitchen experience to know when something is room temp on arrival, folks. I dislike Stephen Starr, but I have never encountered misdirected attitude from his servers like this.  And yet it has become a common occurrence at Barbuzzo.   I have dined here at least 15-20 times since they opened, but I'm afraid this place needs a reality check.  You are no longer the only kids on the block, and you need to start treating your customers with some respect.  If I had efficient (but never rude) service with consistent experiences with the food, I could live with an unseasonable menu and cramped seating, but why should anyone endure verbal insults from servers expecting 20% tips regardless of how they treat you or the quality of what they serve you?  It was nice knowing ya while it lasted.  Good luck with ""Barbuzzo 2"" when it opens across the street...","[0.0, 1.0]"

I must say, I was extremely impressed. Not many restaurants would be so generous to make up for their mistakes. All I'd expected was a refund for the small charge ($4). Glad to see their management prioritizes their customers' satisfaction!  As parents to small children (without regular babysitting) who get to go out alone maybe 3-4 times a year, our dinners out are precious events, so it's nice that our slightly disappointing experience has turned out nicely in the end.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"While I haven't had the pleasure of dining at the Tap Room yet, I have had the displeasure (on several occasions) of terrible bar service. On one hand, I did receive my beer in a clean glass, and it was nice and cold, but that's to be expected. But the staff are less than pleasant or polite. When I asked how the bartender was doing, a friendly ""hi, how are you?"", (before I ordered) she gave me a long (unanswered) blank stare, and grumbled ""What do you want?"" She had the angriest look on her face, was slamming things down on the bar to convey her anger to whatever customer must have aggravated her that night, rolled her eyes at patrons, and pulled me a nice Newcastle Brown Ale. Moving on, there was no where to sit, however the kitchen was closed, so we asked another employee politely if the dining area would be open for seating. She snapped ""The kitchen is CLOSED"" and we quitely interjected that we understood this much, but that we would like to sit and drink at a table, if possible. She complained as she cleared the forks and napkins from that table (set up for breakfast for the following day.) As she walked away she muttered more complaints under her breath, sneering at other customers who'd done the same as we had. I understand, people have some bad nights at work. But on every single occasion I have been to the tap room, the staff were the same. Never delightful. And what a shame it is that they're so grumpy, because otherwise the bar has a beautiful cozy atmosphere, historic feel, and a decent amount of space. They could have told my friend and I that the tables were not available for bar seating to avoid the task of clearing the table for us. We would have gladly accepted that, and stood. And afterall, we were thankful it was cleared for us to sit, but the server's attitude was apalling. As for the bartender, her personality may not be the happiest, but she's always there with a sour-puss on her face, no matter what. If you can put up with rude and unpleasant staff, then this bar may be worth checking out, once. But probably just once, as I made the mistake of giving it the benefit of the doubt a few more times than necessary.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The best kept secret in New Haven. It's been delicious every time I've gotten pizza...the crust is absolute perfection how they do it. It's none of that thin crust stuff but thick crispy goodness. As a Chicago native, I can appreciate the non-wimpy crust that's not too doughy. THe amount of toppings is always just right and SO GOOD! The only major downside is...cash only. They do have an ATM in the joint but it's still a pain. Pizza House, I swear you would surpass Alpha Delta, A1, and Yorksides popularity with the student population if you would just accept credit cards and sell slices.  I wish I had discovered you sooner... GO get some cash and get piping hot pizza, I promise your taste buds will go to heaven.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Tika S.'s review is right on! I went to PJ's and was expecting a life-altering experience, judging by the long lines and it's star status. I was pretty disappointed. We had to wait a bit, but probably only 15 minutes. The restaurant is unique on the inside, with names carved everywhere, some even from decades ago. The service was bad but the food came out super quick. The pancakes were a little above average, but not the best I've ever had. The bad part was, it was VERY overpriced. Leaving full but somewhat ripped off, I would probably never return to PJ's.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Impresses every time. Straight to the chase with food (we went overboard) Showed up at 10PM and sat by the chef's bar (really great, you can watch the linecooks preparing each dish and can annoy your server by asking her repeatedly what each dish is). Razor clams - 5.0 stars THE BEST - generous portion, large and fleshy, oh but the roasted garlic was amazing - J sopped up all the garlic oil with bread and wouldn't let the server take away the plate until it was completely clean. Foie gras with onions - 5.0 stars, must get, so delicious, the pickled onions complement perfectly Pulpo - 4.5 stars - really great crispiness, flavor, acid from the fennel and grapefruit works great Paella risotto croquetas with uni and sungolds - 4.0 stars - mainly ordered this becuase of the uni, but didn't get much of the uni taste even though they give you a decent dallop of it on top. J compared it to a smaller, less tasty arancini bros. ball. Still really good. Oxtail Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - 4.0 stars. a favorite of mine, but a little too salty for my taste, more sweetness from the mango would have made it better Pork belly - 4.0 stas. Had iberico ham sprinkled on it, and really delicious fried plantains. This came out toward the end of our meal and I was stuffed, J said this was his favorite dish, though I thought it was a little too salty - loved the plantains though Iberico ham platter - 4.0 stars - great, and great with the wine we had, but nothing mind blowing I thought Cod cheeks - 3.5 stars - great with the chili slice, but kind of fishy and not amazing - would have been better if more chilies were on it or if it were more fresh Rabbit - 2.5 stars - we were told this was a must, but it was very very average - prepared 3 ways, fried, bbqed and a skewer of innards or such like (that probably needs an acquired taste to be fuly appreciated..). J smelled it and didn't touch it. Yes, ate all that between the two of us. Server was shocked. While the food was great, it wasn't spot on, given the michelin star and prices. Very creative though, and I really love the service, the wine, and the atmosphere - always 5 stars in my book!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was tipped off about Quick Fixx by a friend of mine who used to live in the neighborhood.  This cozy yet spacious South Street lunch spot has fresh salad and really delicious, unique flatbreads.  The staff is courteous and friendly, and if you get the lunch special, it's actually a really good bang for your buck. I decided to get the lunch special (affectionately known as a ""ten spot""), which entitles you to one of several combos for just ten bucks (cash only).  I opted for the Fun Guy Flatbread (truffled mushrooms, fontina, arugula on rosemary dough), side house salad, and a canned soda.  The side salad was simple: lettuce, onion, and two cherry tomatoes.  It was pretty good, nothing to write home about. However, the flatbread was definitely worth the trip down here.  It was more than enough for me, and tasted really good.  The mushrooms were fresh, the cheese was creamy and flavorful, and the arugula provided a nice contrasting crispness and brightness that balanced the dish.  I only wish the flatbread itself was a little crisper and that the arugula didn't carry so much of the truffle oil. Aside from the food, it was great that the weather was so nice, as I was able to sit at a table directly facing the large, spacious windows opening onto South Street.  The staff was also very courteous, and they bring the food right to your table after you order at the front (and clean up after you too!).  I also had a really tough time deciding what to get originally: there were so many delicious sounding options, it's definitely worth a revisit just to try the other menu items (I can't wait to get the gnocchi lasagna the next time I come back).  And they deliver. Overall: a good, modern space with simple, fresh, delicious food that's fairly priced.  It's a welcome change from the same old same old lunch spots in Center City.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Nice little spot in a good neighborhood. The location is great and it has a nice cozy feel to it. Service was on point which is always appreciated. I found the food to be good with some highlights, but the overall meal wasn't out of this world amazing (especially given the price). The squash dumplings are a must try and a huge pleaser, I'm still thinking about them even today. The mason jar dessert gets better with every bite and is a generous portion you can share. I wasn't amazed by my half chicken entree but perhaps it's because I'm not the biggest fan of chicken on the bone. It was definitely tender and a generous portion. My friend enjoyed the bolognese and that also was a good size portion. We also shared the pot du creme which was decent but nothing to write home about. I was impressed with the wine list which was extensive and included many many items. There was a good crowd of people and my favorite was the servers let us take our time and catch up our leisure. I think we were there for almost 3 hours with no push out the door. Prices were definitely high for what they offered though it is Union Sq and we are in NYC. I may come back but probably just for a drink or that amazing dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My favorite ramen place so far, even better than Ippudo ! This place was packed when we got there and it took us a little while to get seated so for those who are planning to visit, make sure you are able to control yourself while waiting because this place has the great smell of ramen, broth, and spices in the air once you walk in. My mouth was watering just standing there...   We had seats at the counter and was able to watch the ramen masters at work. Such a small cooking area but yet so synchronized like watching dancers in a ballet. I ordered the Toroniku Ramen with the Minca Mix Broth. The ramen was cooked to perfection, the broth not too salty, and the slow cooked pork was DELICIOUS ! I wanted to order the larger size and good thing I didn't because I was stuffed. In fact, for once in my food eating days I did not finish the entire bowl ..yes I know, shocking even to my girlfriend. I have to warn you guys though the pork was extremely fatty. I am a lover of all fat meats but those was a little overwhelming to eat in one sitting. We had the shrimp gyoza, because according to Emily C. you can't go to a Ramen place and not order gyoza.. that was also a home run hitter! Wonderful experience and will definitely visit soon again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am writing in follow-up to my prior review of 7/20/13. Since that date, I received a concerned call from the proprietor/manager who seemed legitimately concerned about the subject matter of my dissatisfaction. He explained that he was cooking in the back while everything had transpired and, unfortunately, he was not apprised of my complaint until he saw it on Yelp. From the outset, I was pleased that he reached out. While I do not back down from my prior review, and my experience should have never happened, I will credit him with making efforts to salvage the customer relationship. In fact, I WILL now return because he simply did the right thing. I don't expect every restaurant experience to be perfect, but when its not, all I ask is for some acknowledgment. Once again, food is good, and I will give it another shot. For that reason, I have added another star to my prior review.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My girlfriend took me to Illili for my birthday dinner, and we might just have to return for Christmas. We ordered two appetizers and called it a meal. In fact, we were so full we had to take the complimentary pita to-go. Following our server's advice, we split the rice topped with melted haloumi and the yogurt Brussels sprouts and figs. Both were delicious and filling, but the sweet Brussels sprouts were life-changing. I recommend sitting in the bar area, where the atmosphere is candlelit yet after-work casual. Also, while you're there, do find an excuse to use the bathroom. The superfluous spread of hair gel and cologne they have set out for customers is worth a laugh.","[1.0, 0.0]"

For dinner I got the El Vez Enchiladas Mixtas which is a tasting of all three of their enchiladas. They were all distinct, delicious and flavorful. I loved it. The portions were hefty, too, which is always a plus :) The music was a little loud - I could barely hear my brother speak and we had to shout the whole time.

"My husband and I went to dinner at the Philadelphia Ocean Prime with another couple for the first time. The four of us have been dining out  together for years in Philly, New York, Europe, etc. We usually wouldn't go to a restaurant so new, preferring to wait til they work out the kinks, but we decided to take a chance. We were greeted by a bevy of friendly hostesses and sat promptly. The restaurant is beautiful. Dark wood, colored glass accents, and a glass enclosed kitchen create an elegant atmosphere. Our waiter, Chris was outstanding. Extremely personable and knowledgeable. He recommended and explained their house special cocktails in detail. We all took his advise and had four different drinks. They were all great. My gimlet made with cucumbers was soooo good. Chris went through the menu items, explaining preparations and making recommendations in every section.  We asked some questions about some of the dishes and ingredients and he had the answers to them all. They all sounded so good that none of us could make up our minds. After much hemming and hawing he suggested we let him put together a tasting menu of what he thought the best dishes were, and what wines would pair best with them. We left it all up to him and I'm glad we did. All the appetizers, main course and desserts were really, really good. The wines paired perfectly, and he didn't over order for us. (Which I've had happen with other waiters) A few of the standouts were the tuna tartare,  and a Scallop and braised rib appetizer. The sea bass and a bone in NY strip with black truffles were the main course favorites. The chocolate and peanut butter dessert was divine. We will be back. This is our newest Philly favorite. Make sure you ask for Chris if you want great service.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"i think this has become my new go-to place whenever i visit my gf in CT.  they have a diverse taco selection, but each taco is cheap enough that you can try pretty much try everything in one meal - great value. i enjoyed the pork belly taco, because let's face it, you can never go wrong with pork/fat, but i was particularly blown away by the duck taco. the rendered duck fat makes it that much more savory. even the desserts were excellent, particularly the chocolate tamale, which is basically a chocolate lava cake wrapped in a tamale. eat with a side of icecream, it's a great combo. we actually got the 2 desserts ""on the house"" because it took a while for them to come out, which is a good segue into the service there: very attentive. i also really liked the ambiance there...it's quite cozy. unfortunately their next door neighbor barcelona has been disappointing my last few times there (ridiculously slow service), so i think that again, bartaco will be my new go-to place for a satisfying meal when i'm visiting CT.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have to be honest I was sad to see Almanac close it's doors, (the former tenant). I ate there a few times a week for lunch and shopped for fresh groceries in the process. They had GREAT local fare that's hard to find just steps from your front door... It took me a few weeks to stop in and try the new Cafe Chismosa. Upon first glance I noticed a VERY clean look. Definitely leaning towards minimalist. Comfortable tables spread throughout with a couch and coffee table in the back.. Nice Surprise! Their special the day I visited was a spicy mushroom soup. I immediately indulged and I was NOT disappointed. I'm the person who has the entire top of my stove lined with ghost pepper hot sauces. This soup is SPICY and amazing! My second small dish was a tostada topped with ceviche, home made guac, and some other latin accompaniments. I was floored, so fresh, so tasty, so YES! I washed everything down with a homemade hibiscus tea that had the most awesomely peculiar flavor. Do I sound excited! I am.

Because I *really* love bourbon.  Mmmm....bourbon.... What was I talking about?  Right, noodles.  The noodles at Lan Zhou are hand-pulled to order and totally delicious, especially the dry noodles in pork sauce--essentially one of the most savory bologneses you'll ever have, and at $4.50, definitely the cheapest.   The dumplings are excellent too, with thinner wrappers than at nearby competitors Vanessa's and Fried Dumpling.  A word of advice, though, if you're eating them in-house:  there's a guy standing a few feet away from you swinging a large piece of noodle dough around.  Occasionally he's going to slam it down on the table, which is a ridiculously loud noise, probably because of the lack of soft surfaces in the restaurant.  If the slam happens to occur while your dumpling is en route to your mouth and, startled, you drop it back into your plate, it's going to splatter soy sauce and Sriracha all over you.  You will then have to send this text message to your friend whose party you were about to attend:   Srs wardrobe malfunction, need to return to BK.  How late will party be going?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Discovered I don't like Tecate marinade and brunch doesn't have to come with an hour wait. A long wait at another LES establishment led us to Mother's Ruin, whose ready-to-go outdoor table sealed the deal. The menu is an interesting assortment of variations on brunch favorites, and I opted for some pulled pork biscuit and gravy and my friend got the tri-tip steak and eggs. Less than 10 minutes later we were chowing down. My dish reminded me of a heavier variant on eggs benedict. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, solid whites and yolky center. The Tecate however threw it off for me. Some of you may like it, but the consistent citrus flavor cut through the meat and gravy and dominated the entire dish. I would've preferred it without the meat because the biscuits were quite amazing: fluffy, buttery, and easy to slice through. Service was great and our entrees were more than reasonable. I definitely recommend to anyone tired of waiting an hour for a brunch table in LES.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Second - menu.  As others have stated, it's a limited/small menu primarily focused on soondoobu and few others things.   Third - food.  We ordered the nengmyun and soondoobu with pork.  I think one reviewer said the food is homemade, and I would definitely agree with that comment.  Although we're not Korean, it was apparent that all the banchan was homemade-like, rather than restaurant quality.  Not that it's a bad thing, as the banchan were pretty good except for the kimchi.  I like my kimchi more crisp, and this one was rather limp.  The soondoobu was good.  Not much else to say about it.  Sadly, the nengmyun came with ice in the broth.  And quite a lot of it, which made it hard to get the broth to taste just like I wanted it to after mixing in mustard.  There was quite a lot of noodle as well and I actually couldn't finish it. So, for now, I'm giving it only 2-stars.  It may change one day when I get a chance to try out the soondoobu on a cold day.  But for what we wanted, it didn't live up to our expectations.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The bf took me here for date night.  We weren't overly hungry so we just ordered some small bites at the bar area since the wait for a table was about 45 mins. We ordered the omu soba (yakisoba wrapped in omelet), the atsuyaki tamago, the kakuni (pork belly) and the Hamachi appetizer with red onions.  The food came fairly quickly.  The yakisoba was sweeter than I liked but the presentation was nice.  The Hamachi went really well with the red onions.  The pork belly was hit or miss.  Some pieces were really dry while others were fatty and melted in your mouth.  But the tamago was my favorite dish of the night.  Perfectly flavored and seasoned and delicate.  I dare say, I would come back just for this.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Jones used to be the perfect place: cheerful kitschy 60s interior with comfort food appealing to both guy and girl headed down to see a movie at the Ritz. But then, like Don Draper's household and the offices of Sterling Cooper, things started to change. The atmosphere and service are still delightful (hence the three stars). The server was welcoming, came back several times to fill our iced tea glasses, and asked us, along with someone else, how our food was. Unfortunately, I had to offer some constructive feedback (OK, complain). I used to LOVE their turkey burger. Ordered it every time for the buttery bun and freshly ground turkey topped with a dollop of melting boursin cheese (similar to one of the burger preparations at Monks). Sadly, the burger this time was a thick patty more similar to the one they serve at Marathon. And the beef in my father's beef brisket sandwich was poorly seasoned. Perhaps I'll be back for some grilled cheese and tomato soup or another basic they probably do well. But unfortunately I think my burger broke the Jones' spell.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My boyfriend and I were searching for a new place to try for Philadelphia's restaurant week and stumbled across this gem. The restaurant itself doesn't take OpenTable reservations, but takes them from UrbanSpoon. If you are planning to try this place, MAKE A RESERVATION!! We had an 8pm reservation and did not get seated until 9pm. Proceed with caution. The restaurant is tucked away on a side street off Rittenhouse Square and is located right across the street from Helium Comedy Club. It's decorated beautifully and is a perfect place to wine and dine for a date. The hostess was unbelievably pleasant and was very accommodating for the larger parties we saw. When we were seated, our server was really sweet and brought water and break instantly. She took our orders and brought the food.. but never came back again. This is my only gripe about the place. Everything was perfect aside from the service, but only for half of the time. We didn't get food until 9:30, so I assume the lack of attentiveness can be attributed to a long days work and exhaustion on her behalf. Regardless, we still had a wonderful time. The meatball appetizer was to die for, the marinara was probably the best I have ever had. The entree I selected was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I was presented with a GIANT pork chop that was cooked and seasoned perfectly covered in a pomegranate reduction sauce paired with creamy polenta. The polenta was prepared perfectly. The pomegranate reduction really tied the dish together. I was very satisfied. My boyfriend got a chicken breast covered in mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula. He said that it was absolutely delicious as well. I had the creme brulee with fresh berries for dessert and it was fantastic. My boyfriend had a chocolate tart filled with a cinnamon chocolate lava paired with vanilla ice cream. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will be coming back soon!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The beer selection is awesome and generally the place is a great way to spend a Friday night, I've done it many times but read the reviews about rude staff and be weary.  I have experienced it most recently with an unfortunate event.  I went there on a Friday night (06/06/2014) to watch a band and left my phone on a table.  The band found my phone and gave it to one of the staff who supposedly gave it to a manager.  You guessed it, the phone disappeared and not 1 single person was willing to help me but they were very quick to pass the buck to the next manager.  I went back 3 days in a row in attempt to track down the waitress or speak to the manager and just found myself being dismissed, like I was wasting their time.  I've been a long time patron and have looked past sometimes spotty service that sometimes can't be helped because of capacity, but can't get over this latest episode.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came here for my birthday dinner and loved everyting about it! The wait staff were perfectly attentive,  the ambiance was dim and romantic and the food was fabulous! We started with salads because we both wanted something savory for dinner. So we tried the roasted beet salad with mache, worn walnuts and goat cheese (I love beet salads) and the Heirloom Tomato Salad with Watermelon in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Both were delish and super refreshing! Oh! The (warm) bread with assorted butter/cheese/salt spread was great as well - never had corn butter! So yummy! For entry, we tried the rabbit and the pork chop! Both were awesome and in generous portions! The rabbit was so tender (just like how rabbit should be) and the hazelnut crumbs added the perfect flavor to the pork chop! As stuffed as we both were, I still had to try their desserts, especially bc it was my birthday! The market cobbler was strawberries and raspberries, it was a bit too sweet but the ice cream balanced it out.  But you have to eat it quickly, it melted super fast! We also had the chocolate bar pops, which had a layer of rice Krispies, chocolate cake and some sort of cream (?) all covered in a chocolate shell! Yum yum yum! Can't wait to come back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Awesome food, but what made me write in was the awesome service.   I'm out to dinner with 4 friends, and 3 of us were cool with family style, but two of us had eating restrictions, so ordered their own thing.  Plates and plates heaping with delicious food come out, and we are chowing down.   After awhile, I notice one of my friends who ordered solo hasn't gotten her dish yet, but they are starting to clean out the kitchen for the night.  I point out the issue to the waiter, and he takes care of it, no problem. Should we have been on top of order more quickly (if only to get some food in our hungry friend)?  Could they have pointed out the order wasn't on the original ticket, that they had cleaned the kitchen for the night, that they couldn't make the dish, that they wanted us to pay and get out so they could go home after a long night?  Yes to all of those things.   But they were polite, got delicious food in my by-then-starving friend, and let us hang around while the closed and cleaned everything else so my friend could finish.

Absolutely delicious sushi! Freshly cut sashimi prepared by a real sushi chef! Water and green tea served immediately after being seated. We started our meal with the Seaweed Salad which was a nice mix of iceberg lettuce and fresh ocean seaweed. There were two kinds of dressings that came on the side in tiny sake cups: Japanese soy ginger dressing and the other was a miso based. Vegetable croquette is one of those appetizers that doesn't show up on every sushi restaurant's menu.  Two very hot and perfectly fried pieces served with katsu sauce. Our main meal was the Sushi Basic that came with 7 pieces of nigiri sushi (we added 2 more: salmon and ikura). The spicy tuna and spicy salmon maki were also very delicious! It is a bit pricey but both the food and the service are fantastic! Highly recommend!,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"After a long wait the Peacock in is finally open once again after  massive renovations. I stopped in for dinner only 6 days after they reopened on 5-23-2010 not knowing what to expect. They have done a beautiful renovation of the building both inside and outside. Parking is a bit tough (we had to park on the street on 27 and make the walk as the lot was full) and the location a little far outside of downtown, but worth the trouble to give it a try. I had the tortellini and my dinner guest the lobster special. My tortellini was excellent. Portion size was on the small side though so don't come too hungry. I tried a bite of the lobster which was very fresh and nicely prepared. For dessert definitely have the peanut butter mousse if it's still available - it was amazing! Portion size on dessert is much larger, just what my diet needed!  The service was good, better than I would have expected for only 6 days open and bound to improve. Wine list is a bit limited though, which hopefully will improve as well. Overall a good meal and a place I will be visiting again. Also toured the hotel while there, rooms are on the small side but very luxurious, wish I had a reason to stay there to try the hotel out as well!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Come here and expect: Limited seating during peak lunch times, long lines but quick service, simple menu with delicious food What I got from it: We were desperate for food.  A Philly cheesesteak sounded good, so I asked Yelp for help.  Not really knowing any sense of direction, we also asked a local about their input for a good place for food.  We walked into the Reading Terminal and found a plethora of options.  It was as if we had died and then entered food heaven!! So many options, but I wanted Yelp to tell me what was the best.  Tommy's was coming up as highly rated, and when I saw the line, I knew the reviews weren't a lie!   We thought our tongues might be hanging out of our mouths for quite awhile, alas, the staff was quick and efficient!!  It's a simple menu and reminded me of other great places that just offer what they know they're the best at: you want a sandwich, just tell them what meat (choice of 6 I think), and whether you want toppings (choose 1 of 3 or 2 or all 3). Mind you, I'm from the Westside.....far West.  The Wild West of OC.  So I don't know what a ""real"" Philly cheesesteak is.  Here are a couple of pointers for novices like me: -don't call it a Philly cheesesteak.  It's just a cheesesteak.  (Thank you Captain Obvious.) -expect to get cheesewiz and onions -DON'T come to DiNics for a traditional cheesesteak.  They specialize in making a delicious sandwich.  Big difference. I ordered the pulled pork with hot peppers and cheese.  The cheese on that pulled pork was divine, and the peppers kicked my head for about an hour after eating. YIKES!  But delicious.  The sandwich wasn't dry or soggy; definitely a high recommendation!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

First time I tried their 2nd floor, I thought they are unique filled with graffiti seals even their windows are covered with graffiti so you do not see outside.   To me this place is very south street bar, you can see the connection to for example Magic Garden. Even the painting of female nude model at the bar kind of  looks like one from Modigliani that you can find at MoMa Museum. Things I like about here is that there is 2 hours happy hour everyday from 5-7p.m. I only know few bars and here is pretty much only place I tried on south street if not South Street Diner is included. I also like that you are not rushed by bartender to have second drink to stay longer. Tattooed Mom is like a Cafe to me, anything from the tables and fancy lighting and little cars and airplanes here and there, and even wall color which is green on 1st floor, everything is somewhat not very ""adult"", and people come here just like coming to cafe with friends. I like the fake-ness they have, make me think of memories of one of my old friends. I picked this place for tonight because it's my neighbor, and not too scary to go in by myself and wait for friend to come, unlike other bars.

"I went here with a die hard ippudo friend because i had heard that this place rivaled ippudo as best ramen in nyc. in the end, his opinion wasn't swayed, but i actually thought in some ways i can see why i could like i more. only in some ways ;) the menu is divided into a broth base (pork, chicken, mix, soy), type of noodles (thin, thick, wavy ), and soy or garlic flavorings.  this kind of confused me bc i don't know much about ramen so how do i know if what i'm picking is good?? well i ended up getting the pork broth (how can u go wrong with pork right), shoyu flavored with thick noodle (bc it was recommended..but i kind of like the wavy ones). my friend got the same broth but salt & roasted garlic flavor- which he ended up up not liking. honestly it wasn't that good when i tasted it either. both of our broths were VERY rich and i think his was TOO rich for him. but in my opinion, it was the flavor of garlic salt that prob ruined it. mine was very good, but i can understand if some find it too rich & heavy. so basically- VERY RICH broth..not for the lighthearted brothy ones. I would def come here again and get a soy-flavored ramen...if i was in the mood for a rich, flavorful ramen....without the wait of ippudo.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It seems to get 5 stars review from NEW yelpers with less than 5 reviews but mostly below average from elite yelpers!

We sat the bar and clearly told the bartender that we would liked to be out within 60 minutes and we didn't order anything complicate but just appetizers. Instead of getting us what we ordered, the bartender tried to upsale us on entrees and wines which I thought was funny. It took 20 minutes for the spring roll to appeared and when my friend asked why it took so long, he told us that he couldn't control what the Chef does once he sent the order ticket!!! Are you serious, dude? How about informed the manager or check on the order yourself? BTW, the restaurant was empty since we got there at 5.30 and if it took that long for an appetizer then I can't imagine what would happened if we stayed for the whole meal. The drink prices was ridiculous for bottom shelf liquors and the service was horrible, so I am not coming back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of the best in town. Update August 13: Fourth time here. 4 out of 4 excellent food. I have to say they have stepped up the level of service. The 4 formaggi pizze is probably one of their best. Next to the nutella one. Home made cannolli makes the top list as well. They have actual Italians cooking or suppying ingredients, which is a plus. More important than any of these is that the owners actually care about being there and learning. John stopped by again and offered us a complimentary cannolli, and boy was it worth it. 1st review: I went with my wife last weekend because of all the great reviews we'd seen and they were not wrong. Probably one of the best pizza doughs ever made by man. Service was a bit slow, I believe it is because they just started and are getting the hang of it. That said, our dinner delicious and was graciously paid by the owner because our orders took more time than expected and one came out wrong. He also gave us a dessert, the chocolate pizza. Order that, you wont regret. Bottomline: great service, amazing food and much better than American Flatbread","[0.0, 1.0]"
"KenScale: 8.0/10 Rubirosa is a cozy Italian restaurant in Nolita area. While it hasn't received as much buzz as the nearby Torrisi Italian Specialties and Parm, I've had a very solid meal on my previous visit. The dishes at Ruborisa will not wow you, but you will not have a bad meal here. On my recent visit for a weekend brunch, all the dishes I tried were carefully prepared and displayed the rich, rustic flavor of Italian cuisine. Ruborisa is well known for its pizza offerings, and the best way to go is the vodka pizza with vodka sauce and fresh mozzarella, a thin crust pie that is pure delight in your mouth. Among the pastas, I sampled ricotta ravioli with tomato, basil and parmigiano and liked the rustic feel of the dish. For panini, try the Chicago style Italian beef panini with slow roasted beef, spicy giardiniera and provolone. I was impressed with the juicy beef that worked very well with the spicy kick of the giardiniera. For dessert, a simple tiramisu with mascarpone, lady fingers and espresso will end your meal on a very sweet note. Given the tiny size of the dining room and the restaurant's reputation as a very good neighborhood joint, getting a reservation at Rubirosa can be quite a challenge, especially during dinner time. Getting a seat for weekend brunch should be easier, but make sure you show up within 15 minutes of your reservation time or they will give your table away (I was running late and ended up having to wait until another table opened up). The restaurant has some solid Italian wine selection, so savor the dishes with a glass or two. The restaurant's charming decor makes it a perfect place to go on a casual date or hearty meal with friends before strolling around SoHo area. Rubirosa is one of those Italian restaurants I would love to come back over and over again. The dishes here will not disappoint.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Nice touch: when we mentioned how bad we felt that there was so much we couldn't finish, they mentioned they package up leftovers and take them to the homeless. Glad it doesn't go to waste. The wild mushroom gnocchi was rich and melt-in-your mouth delicate. The seared tuna was the best I've had. Even the salad of dandelion greens with cubes of roasted butternut squash was just heaven.

The past three times I've gone, the price for chicken over rice has gone up every time without any explanation. There are two signs with different prices for the same food, and when my friend and I asked the cashier about it she just rolled her eyes and pointed to the more expensive one. Her demeanor is generally brooding and needlessly hostile. They also seriously decreased the portion sizes despite upping the price. It used to be a solid two meals' worth of food in one order, but now it's about one meal's worth. Plus, we stood around waiting for over 30 minutes until the food was finally ready. They screwed up my friend's order and then made someone else's food before hers, even after realizing they'd forgotten to start her food. They didn't really seem to care that they had messed up. Then, icing on the cake, her falafel was still uncooked inside, and she found a hair in her rice. Why the sudden change, Papa's? I used to be your biggest fan girl, but now I vow (Girl Scout's honor) never to buy your shawarma again. We're breaking up: and it's not me, it's you.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am giving Bar four stars solely for the pizza!  I tend to not like many pizza places.  It is not that I am a pizza snob or elitist, it is just that pizza's not  one of my favorite foods.  Well, Bar's pizza was pretty good.  The thin crust was a bit on the well done side which I like.  I was curious about the mashed potato pizza that I have heard so much about.  In my mind I pictured it to be loaded with mashed potatoes and extremely heavy.  The only experience I have had with potatoes on my pizza was at Willington Pizza, and I hated it. With Bar's mashed potato pie I was pleasantly surprised.  The pie was white and loaded with garlic and onions and a light layer of mashed potatoes.  I didn't try any of the salad as bleu cheese is on my pregnancy no-no list so I can't comment on that. Service was good for  Friday night.  The waitress checked on us often but was not at all annoying.  My only minor complaint was that my ginger ale was completely flat.  Other then that I had an enjoyable meal with great company.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Not one complaint. We all had  peach ciroc cosmos which was also good. I would highly recommend Soco to anyone. Great spot for a date or a night out with friends.

"So I came to Philly and took the cheesesteak challenge.  After watching a special on the food network, I knew I had to take the Pats vs. Geno's challenge.  After a short drive from the philly airport I found myself at Passyunk and 9th, the home of Pat's and Geno's.  I chose Pat's first, avoiding the mass of neon lights across the street.  I picked up my cheese wit, put it in the car and moved next door to Geno's where I got yet another cheese wit. I then ran back to my car, split them in half and dove in for the taste test that had been years in the making.  After a bite into each, there was an obvious winner, Pats handsdown blows geno's out of the water.  Although the meat from pats may have sat around slightly too long, it was still full of flavor and just plain delicious.  I know where to go when I come back to philly now.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let me just say, I received better service at the McDonalds on 40th and Walnut than at Lovers and Madmen. I came in at 4pm, and every single table, windowsill, and couch was full. That having been said, there are less than 20 seats available in the place, so you better hope that you go when nobody else is. I ended up sitting down at the table for children with those miniature chairs. It was not comfortable. I opened up my laptop to check my calender and to finish up some work. I had a meeting there in 15 minutes with a friend. After 2 minutes, the barista came over and told me if I wanted to use the free wifi, I would have to buy something. I was not using the wifi, I was writing a word document, and checking my non-internet calender. I considered buying something just so that I would have a place (albiet uncomfortable) to sit until my meeting, but after one glance at the overpriced menu, I decided to wait outside instead. It was cold, and there was nowhere else nearby where I could go to sit, so I just went outside and leaned against the wall to finish up my NON-INTERNET work. The barista then came outside of the shop, and started to yell at me for stealing their internet. He didnt even let me speak, to tell him that I wasn't, in fact, using internet, because he couldn't stop screaming,""DON't PLAY ME!"". I ended up having to just walk around for another 15 minutes. I did not end up buying anything off of the overpriced menu, and the barista was a pretentious, self-important jerk. I would definitely NOT recommend this place to anybody.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Oh Cafe Gitane! I was So excited. In a neighborhood with an insane amount of great restaurants in a 3-block radius, I chose you! My friend raved about the sheperds pie (called something else) and the avocado toast and the way the chairs outside face out just like in Europe. Even when we walked in on a Sunday night I was sure I chose right. The waitress was so bubbly and sweet. She gave us a few minutes then took our orders -and our teas came out almost in an instant! I did notice my friends teapot was a bit larger than mine but no problem. In a very quick amount of time, our mains came out. Mine was the eggplant and hers the sheperds pie. No complaints from her. And mine, it was ok. I typically only order eggplant when it's grilled (such as this was) but these were quite thick slices and retained some of the 'rubbery' texture. Somehow the avocado toast never appeared. We were keen to ask for it but it seems that after the initial greeting and order taking, even though the restaurant only had a few tables and was not busy, we weren't called upon again. No checking in to ask how our food was. Before finishing our plates, we decided maybe we'd just forego the missing avocado toast. But I was pretty keen to get more hot water. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, finding it challenging to get attention. I think this was when I realized we weren't going to be successful in asking for anything further, except to try for the check. As we're waiting (no we did not get up from the table to go and tap someone physically) bangs start. Bang, bang, bang. A cacophony of BANGS. I get it if you need to scrub a pot. I get it that restaurants need cleaning. But to do this at 9 pm on a Sunday with customers STILL THERE (in the MAIN ROOM - not behind a wall in the kitchen) is Absurd. I wish I could say we got the check quickly and left. It took one waitress another 10 minutes to understand when we gave her a $20 bill on a $45 check that we needed 'change' to recognize this meant breaking the bill, not trying to underpay. The banging continued. We didn't even tell them they failed to put in our order of avocado toast. We went to my friend's flat, bought a box of tea on the way, and enjoy a kettle of hot water for unlimited water and quiet to calm down after the racket.","[1.0, 0.0]"

There are 2 drawbacks to this place. 1) the menu is on the wall which is a pain if you're seated with your back to the wall. 2) it is small which is somewhat of a double-edged sword as it makes this place cozy and intimate but also forces you to get cozy and intimate with the table next to you. The food however is more than enough to make me come back. The creole wings were the best wings I've had in NYC by a long shot. Everything else we had was delicious and they certainly gave you enough so you won't leave hungry. Had the chocolate pudding for dessert which was awesome and the perfect way to cap off wings/gumbo/bbq etc. Great place.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Everybody is right about those Dan Dan noodles.  Spicy, chewy, tasty good. Also ordered the dry pepper chicken.  Wasn't a huge fan of how small the chicken was chopped up and how little chicken there was.  The strangest thing was that despite the fact that there were twice as many dried chilies as there were morsels of chicken, the dish wasn't that spicy. It was flavorful, yes, but based on the reviews, I was hoping for something that would knock me on my rump.  (I've actually had Southern fried chicken that was tastier and spicier.) Go for the noodles, though.  I would come back for those alone.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Cocktails - several choices for the rye/bourbon lover always scores points in my book.  We went with the Manhattan Mescaline and found it to be a solid choice. Shared several appetizers for the table - magic mushrooms took top honors, you should order them for sure.  Baked eggplant was very good, as were the mozz chips. Pastas - penne/vodka pretty standard.  Pollo/fusilli/broccoli rabe was better, and Norma (rigatoni/eggplant/ricotta) was the best.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The food is incredible, and if you truly are in the mood for a tender delicious steak this is the place to go. My two favorite dishes are the porter house and the rack of lamb. The creamed spinach will never let you down and for dessert I would HIGHLY recommend the apple bread pudding with rum raisin ice-cream.

"The girl at the counter couldn't have been any nicer.  Very sweet and perky, she went through the menu and told us what people liked the most.  I had the salted caramel, which was the perfect blend of sweet v. salt, as well as the bada bing which was a great version of chicken parm with the gooey cheese stuffed under the breading.  Both were absolutely delicious and I wouldn't change anything about either.  Things take a while to come out but I don't mind because they are making it fresh to order and they also use quality ingredients. My friends ordered theirs ""naked"" or grilled and raved about them even without being fried.  Fun music and atmosphere. I paid around $9 bucks for 2 chicken fingers, although I will say I was full enough after just eating those as there was a lot to them.  If you have a huge appetite, the only downside is that it might get a little pricey.  Even so, it's worth a trip.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went there to meet some friends. No one acknowledge I was even sitting at the bar. I waited 15 minutes before I asked the bartender with the pig tails if she could get me a drink and was immediately given attitude and told Kevin would be with me. I waited another 10 minutes until I could get his attention. Finally got a drink. Another gentlemen came in and got the same lack of service. Once my friends showed up we had to ask yet again to be served and for menus. I hadn't even finished my drink, nor had the gentlemen next to me, and Kevin went to take our drinks and asked if we were done. Clearly we were not we both had half a drink left. Extremely rude. Once we got our meals the wrong meals were served to us and had to be sent back. Finally got the correct order, my friend order mild tenders and got sweet and sour instead. No one checked on how our meals were. Again I had not finished my meal and Kevin took the plate right from me, which my friend was eating off of since her meal was incorrect. It took 20 minutes to just get a second drink after I had ordered it. I've worked in Boston as a bartender, as well as, Vermont and from experience both of them would have been fired on the spot. Probably the worst service I had gotten in a long time, very disappointing. Clearly the are not experience bartenders because if they were they would have known to provide decent customer service since that is how they make their money and not focus on the quick and easy in and out customers that walked up to the bar to just grab one drink.

"My sister's and I decided to try Pat's cheese steak.  One sister liked the meat, the other said it was okay and I could have passed.  Asked for cheese and onions - hardly and cheeses and had to request that the mushrooms be removed.  While I was charged for the mushrooms based on the attitudes and freezing temperatures not worth the time to get the money refunded.  I do not understand why there is so much hype about these tasteless cheese steaks.  Overall not worth the time or effort.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This was by far the best restaurant I ate at while on my east coast road trip. Make no mistakes about it, if you are trying to watch what you eat for health reasons, then don't eat here. The food was rich and flavorful, obvious amounts of care and love went into creating it. Lots of the dishes include in house fresh made pasta and all the desserts are home made. This is the kind of spot you eat at to get away from the hustle and bustle of our life or you would take a date. When you look at movies and see all those intimate date restaurant keep this in mind, this place blows them away. Know this in advance, if you eat outside on the patio, then do it before sunset. As the sun was setting the bugs seemed to enjoy my flesh. But while the sun was shining, I did not have any problems. Also, this is a BYOB establishment so if you do BYOB, make an effort to bring something better than domestic beer.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am inclined to order food from the same places repeatedly.  When my husband first suggested S & H Kebab a little over a month ago on a lazy night of ordering in, I was reluctant because I hadn't heard of it - now - it is one my places on the rotation.  In fact, I have ordered dinner from there 5 times since.  The food is absolutely delicious. The dressing used on the house salad is very tasty-has a lemon tang to it, and the veggies used are very fresh.  The eggplant salad (under cold appetizers) is the BEST. I suggest taking the warm laffa/pita bread (delivered warm), dipping it in the hummus and then the eggplant salad (under cold appetizers).  The falafel dinner is delicious, but filling as well.  I definitely have a few meals for the week from it. I recently introduced my mom to S & H, and now she drives in from the burbs. craving their food.  If you love mediterranean food, this is your place!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"2 stars We went to Enoteca Maria because of the real good reviews. To be frank, I was disappointed by the look of the restaurant.

"Unfortunately, there were a good number of quirks in our service and meal that kept this from being a good experience. First of all, we made a reservation, but were still asked to wait for 15 minutes. I understand that overbooking happens from time to time, but it's still annoying. More to the point, our food matched the generally disorganized service: it was definitely a rushed and messy ordeal. We had to send one plate back because the dish had not been washed properly. Ick! The ravioli was okay, but kind of heavy and it somehow had not been cooked evenly. The pizza was nothing special, though certainly not bad. We were gonna stick around for dessert but decided not to chance it and headed out. One thing's for certain, if you decide to bail on Emporio, there are plenty of other great places in LIttle Italy to check out!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Bite is a tiny window into a tiny little kitchen. I enjoy getting a sandwich here from time to time. I've only ever had their sandwiches (never the salads, soups, breakfasts, paninis, cookies, etc.) and they have all been fantastic. For the Middle Eastern sandwiches, I usually don't get one that has eggplant because I don't like it. Although the menu says ""spicy or not"" next to the Middle Eastern sandwiches, I cannot for the life of me taste the difference. For the other sandwiches, you have four choices for dressing. My favorite of these is the smoked pepper mayo -- which is spicy. If you don't like spice, the next best dressing is the sun-dried tomato-basil mayo, followed by the sweet mustard. Never gotten the balsamic vinaigrette. The staff is very nice and the service is fast, but you customers have no idea what you're doing. You walk up, you order, and you stand there, or you move back to where you were waiting to order, or you move to the other side, or you wander away to lalaland. PLEASE: Line up in front of the window. Don't block the menu on the left. Order, move to the right side, stay close enough -- and take your earbuds out -- to hear when it's ready. THANKS. Anyway, take a bite out of Bite (haha) and you'll be one happy camper.","[1.0, 0.0]"

As someone said below, 'Uhm...this place is so weird"".  The pasta came out raw - not al dente - uncooked. Yes, raw pasta.  They offered to fix it, but since we had already been sitting for 90 minutes and had to get to a party across town, we declined.  The check arrived with no adjustments, but after a short conversation that went something like ""Seriously?"", they took the pasta dishes off of the check.  To be fair, the waiter tried hard and the pulled pork was good - but I'm not sure how this place can still be in business.  I guess open table availability will get people in the door - once.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was here for dinner with family in April.  I beg to differ regarding the vegetarian options.  This place is terrible for vegetarians.  The ""vegetarian plate"" was described as having sauteed vegetables.  As this was the only dinner entree for vegetarians on the menu, I ordered it.  What I got was two thin round slivers of a carrot, two previously frozen florets of cauliflower, one floret of broccoli, a tiny pile of rice and a tiny (like salad-dressing size) container of black beans, a very skimpy amount of greens and yucca - the size of what you might call ""a taste.""  There was no ""sautee"" on anything.  Just plain black beans, plain white rice, the four pieces of vegs I received were steamed.  It cost $15.95 for this.  I am a small person with below average appetite.  I did not have enough food. Besides does this chef have an idea of how to prepare vegetables?  They just do not care to bother.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I enjoy coming to Pete's Sake for weekend brunch. I'm not huge on brunch, but there's just something about their french toast. It has seasonal fruit with it along with whip cream.

I would recommend if you come on sports games night, be prepared to wait for a table, and possibly not even get one. I would advise coming over an hour before or after games. It's a really nice place. The bathrooms are clean, the staff are friendly. It is not a rowdy place. Patron's are mainly local and they enjoy to sit and eat, so will stay a while. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Burgers are cooked to ordered, the hummus is a typically rotated with 3 different kinds per plate. Their chicken nachos have quite the helping.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here with my aunt, uncle, and their two young children. It was a bit of a squeeze as we were at the front table and one of the chairs extended a bit into the walk area. Between us, we got three of the smoothies (Green Alien Quencher, Almond Protein *Raw, and Coco Peanut Brain) all of which were delicious. For food, we got Black Bean Sweet Potato Cakes, Wild Salmon Burger, Macaroni & Cheese, Eggplant Veggie & Tofu Lasagna, the Farmers Omelet, and the Pancakes. Both the cakes and lasagna were a weird kind of mushyish texture, although they did taste pretty decent. The Wild Salmon Burger was really good, as was the Farmers Omelet. To me, the pancakes were a weird flavor, but I'm pretty sure that's just because they were buckwheat (I think). The Mac & Cheese was different, but good. The one thing I really have an issue with is that my uncle asked our waiter if the pancakes were vegan (he eats vegan and wanted to check) the waiter told us they were, but after he'd already had a few bites the waiter came back and said the pancakes actually had egg in them. That's seriously not cool - waiter's should know their menu and if they don't know, they should check instead of just making something up.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Oh, Prime.  Your combination of delicious beer, savory, mouth-watering burgers, and friendly bartenders and waitstaff is difficult to criticize.  In fact, the only knock on Prime 16 is that it's so popular, it can be difficult to get a spot at the bar.  But am I really going to knock off points for being too good? Let's start with the beer.  Prime has a constantly evolving list of beers, each more delicious than the last.  There's a little bit of everything, and the big board in the bar area even shows the style and alcohol content of the beer.  Which is a good thing, cause some of those barleywines will knock you on your butt. The beers can be a little expensive, but quality costs -- and if cost is a huge concern, their Happy Hour is perhaps the best in the city.  Half-price craft beers?!  Have I died and gone to Hops Heaven??  A few beers are excepted from this special, but you will have no problem finding something which suits your needs.  It runs 4-7 on weekdays and 2-4 on Saturdays.  Just be forewarned: this kind of cheap, delicious beer can lead to some poor decision-making. Given that it's such a beer-centric place, you'd excuse them if their food was mediocre or only pretty good, but they have, in my humble opinion, the very best burgers in New Haven.  I haven't had anything on the list which didn't hit the spot, and the Lamb Burger and the Badlands Burger both hit spots I didn't even know need hitting.  I generally get the sweet potato fries, which are very good, but the truffle fries are also excellent.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu due to the overwhelming excellence of the burgers, however. The vibe itself is pretty chill.  I admit the crowd is pretty male, so it might not be the best place to pick up girls, but you're not here for the women, are you?  You're here for the beer!  And beef!  And friendly bartenders! Speaking of the bartenders and waitstaff, if you aren't a beer expert, they're more than happy to help you make a choice.  Just give them an idea of the kind of beer you're into, and they'll make a recommendation.  They're all pretty chill and friendly, and I've never had a problem with service. Prime 16 remains one of my favorite places to hang out in New Haven, and I look forward to visiting again and again in the future.  I hope to see you there.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went on Valentine's Day. Food was okay but overpriced. Was NOT happy that they arbitrarily decided to not honor a Living Social voucher I purchased in December. NOTHING in the fine print excluding any days of week, etc - only restriction was that it couldn't be combined with another offer (and there was nothing ""special"" or ""offer-like"" about a date on the calendar - in this case, February 14). Made reservation about two weeks in advance (nothing about not being able to use voucher), showed up, sat down, show waitress the voucher and she says ""Oh yeah we decided not to accept those vouchers today. There's a sign on the front desk."" I looked and there was a tiny sign - which, in my opinion, is a terrible way to do business (esp when people make reservations in ADVANCE and are not told their vouchers won't be accepted). If there were exclusions/limitations, they should have been CLEARLY stated on the advertisement/promotion they sold and that many people purchased in good faith. At that point we felt stuck - every other restaurant in the area was super crowded and had no tables available. So we stayed and ended up paying for overpriced drinks and an ""okay"" dinner. However, I would have rather spent the $125 at a better place like Bricco Trattoria, Flemings, etc. Won't be returning to this place - they are dishonest and shady.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I stop here maybe once a week for lunch, usually to take a soup back to the office so I can work while I eat. Sometimes I get a sandwich. My usual choice is the veggie chilly. It's quite good. My favorite sandwich is the Delhi, chicken salad on raisin bread. Quite good and not something I'd ever make for myself (one of my measures of a place). My usual choice is the veggie chilly because that's almost always the best soup offering. (There are other viable ones on a very sporadic basis.) I like soup at lunch because it's filling and it's fewer calories than a sandwich. I gave this 3 stars based on the prompt - it equals ""A-OK"". It is indeed, A-OK. As a lunch place it is not more. On the other hand, it you're after baked goods (I'm not) then I suspect there are socks that it starts to knock off.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went for the movie night featuring The Princess Bride and left a VERY satisfied customer. First of all, the place just makes you smile. It's bright and colorful and there are lots of diverse people enjoying themselves - it's a great atmosphere. Even while waiting in line to order my food wasn't such a bad experience, although I did wait for about 35 minutes and then waited another 15 for my food. It was crowded and finding seating just for myself was difficult- I had to resort to going inside, even though I wanted to stay outside. This whole part of the experience wasn't terrible, but annoying enough that I docked a star. But onto the good stuff- the food! I wanted to try a bunch of things since there were so many great recommendations, so here's what I ordered: ~ Pork Taco : very tasty and lots of pork! :) ~ Sweet Plaintains : so good, I ordered another batch to go with my frozen 'rita! ~ Corn : If you get anything here, please let this be it - SO GOOD! ~ Lemonade : really refreshing and flavorful! ~ Frozen Margarita : Everything you've read is true - it's delicious and STRONG! :) The movie was the cherry on top! It seemed like they were having issues with the projector, so it didn't start until around 9, but the crowd that was there to watch The Princess Bride had a great time - there was cheering and clapping and laughing - seriously fun! Next week's movie is Coming to America and I may have to go back to Habana Outpost and brave the crowds because the whole experience was fantastic!

"As I was walking inside this little place which looked from the outside like a train car, I thought I had stepped into 1925. The place has just a dark industrial cramped feel and the big metal chairs against the wall look like thrones! I opted for a cheese works with salad and a birch. AKA a burger with cheese, tomato, onion on white toast along with potato salad and a birch beer. The potato salad came in a styrofoam cup and it was pretty good, it thankfully didn't have much mayo, and the addition of hard cooked eggs added a good texture to it. The burgers do take some time, but cooked in those ancient cast iron grills, they're worth it. I absolutely recommend the onions, they're grilled into the burger and they complement the juicy beef so well. The burger was nice and thick and though I got it medium rare, which is the custom, I might recommend getting it more well done. The inside was pink, but if it had been cooked any less, I wouldn't have felt comfortable eating it. I like that they do the burger on toast because it lets the beef stand out as the star of the show. That's exactly the way it should be. I live in the midwest and looking back, I'm glad I went here, and I believe I would return.

"I dont understand customer services these days. One of my pet peeves are stingy restaurants. For example, today I stopped by Sawatdee for a thai iced tea.

So I left with my drink, filled 3/4 of the way (picture attached), since I requested less ice. I even made a comment regarding to how much was filled, and they merely just added more ice. If you eat here, don't order your drink to go because you will be left feeling jipped. Also, their thai ice tea is terribly sweet!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I was hesitant to try Dinosaur again.  I had it a few times when they first opened in Harlem and was unimpressed.  I went because friends from Queens were visiting and they wanted to try.  It is accommodating for a large group - options for everyone - not many BBQ places have salads for those trying to eat healthy!  I feel like the food snob of the group but I couldn't believe the low quality of the meats - how are they making any money selling a rack of ribs and four sides for $30 unless it is the lowest quality ingredients available.  I feel like now that I eat higher quality meat I can really taste the difference of cheap meat.  What I like about Brooklyn is small neighborhood non-chain restaurants with personality that are creative and use high quality ingredients -- so this place is really not for me!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's great that this place takes reservations! We were seated as soon as we got to there. What's also cool is that if you go for your birthday your meal is free :) I went a day before my birthday though so not only do they check your ID but they also check to see if you have brought a cake/some kind of dessert also as verification of your birthday (interesting system haha). We had some trouble communicating with our waiter because unfortunately people in our group spoke Cantonse not Mandarin but he was very, very nice and attentive. Every time someone would drop something he would be right there with a new chopstick or spoon before we even knew what dropped! He also even offered to give me a hair tie so I wouldn't ruin my hair while eating. We did the AYCE hot pot AND Kbbq ($5 more- about $30/each after tax) and we definitely got A LOT of food! We were actually a little worried because they do charge around $14/lb of food that you waste/don't eat. There's also a 2 hour time limit. The portions are big! I really enjoyed the basic beef and lamb for hot pot/bbq but there are other things like grilled eggplant and mussels for kbbq that were really good! I also liked the seafood pancake. AYCE is usually on the pricier side but considering this was both hot pot and kbbq the price is a really good deal!

"I've been eating my way through Chinatown with a buddy who is a long-time resident.  He swore that this is one of the best, and I'd have to agree. The soup dumplings were great!  I'm glad my knowledgeable friend showed me the proper way to eat them, as I would have had a messy and scalding experience otherwise.  Apparently you're supposed to sort of nibble at the pouch and let the majority of the soup flow into the oversized spoon.  For my fellow uninitiated honkies:  DO NOT just pop one of these into your mouth!   I also recommend the spicy beef with sliced jalapenos; I'm used to these dishes being long on spice but short on flavor, but this version had plenty of both. My only knock is that it is pretty crowded - but I probably wouldn't want to eat anywhere in Chinatown that isn't.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We had dinner here on it's opening weekend.  The food was very good but the service only so so - inattentive for too long.  The owner, Olivier, became defensive when one in our party noted that the untouched bread on the plate was overdone.  Sensitive soul, not the right attitude for a neighborhood spot when your are trying to build business. The street side seating is a rough bench with an unfinished wall that is MEGA uncomfortable and can damage clothes/skin.  He needs to do something about that - cushions at the very least.   Here's hoping that they make some changes other reviewers have mentioned and soon  serve wine.  We want them to succeed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"For the majority of my college years at UVM, I had the ultimate pleasure of routinely joining my friend and his family whenever they went out to breakfast at Penny Cluse.  Arriving hungry and hungover (so college, right?!), I would help myself to the extraordinary coffee and indulge in the many breakfast dimes they have on the menu. (the black beans and anadouille sausage scramble is bomb!) Let this review be extremely clear: Penny Cluse is one of the best breakfast places in Burlington and probably in New England.  Portion sizes are solid, ingredients are very fresh, service is routinely great, and the menu is creative enough to make you want to try everything on the menu, while still containing the more traditional breakfast plates. If you're visiting Burlington, get up early and beat the line.  It's well worth it.  But, if you wish to instead sleep in and end up eating an over-priced uninspired breakfast sandwich from City Market, that's cool too I guess...","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came to this restaurant after finding a good review online. The staff there were a bit on the rough side, lack of customer service was definitely present but if you are looking for something really quick, cheap and extremely delicious, this is the place. We ordered four large items and paid $9. We could not finish our entire meal and the dumplings were some of the best we ever has. Check out if you are on the Lower East Side. I've had a lot of dumplings from a number of dumpling shops throughout NYC and other areas Prosperity Dumplings gives you a lot of food for your buck. I bought a bunch of dumplings cooked in a variety of ways, plus two large soups for just over $10.00. It is your normal Chinatown take out shop. What this shop lacks in size, you get in quantity. The food has a fast turn around. The food has to be good, when the shop is always packed with locals as well as visitors. You can always tell a good place to eat, when you see the locals packing the place We go here everytime we visit New York. The place is super small. There are 4 bar stools with small counters in case you are lucky enough to grab one. We got 20 Dim Sum (1 order of vegetable and 1 order of lamb) and the total was $7.20. They steam them, don't boil or bake. It started to pour so i wads lucky and got two of the bar stools and chowed down. Dang it was good. i ate the rest in the hotel room that night. You aren't here for the ambiance, you are here for the food. There is a line out the door and folks stand outside eating their dumplings and chatting. Don't miss Prosperity Dumpli.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife and I ate here a few days ago on the way out of BTV. Both of us were fairly pleased with our food orders. We both ate the steak kabob pitas, that were made in a timely manner of a portion size that is standard to its competitiors. They were both a little messy which I didn't think was a bad thing,  since pitas can have that characteristic, just an observation. With two bottled drinks, the price came out to just north of $20. To me this is a little overpriced. However, it is in the city so take that with a grain of salt. People seemed to comment about the cleanliness and to a small degree, they are correct. This place isn't spotless and has a dinginess to it. This is mostly contributed by the interior materials used and is close proximity to the sidewalk/street with little frontage of eating space. The restroom is satisfactory. For a quick bite instead of the other typical options out there and you go in with expectations that would match its typology of a quick-stop street fare. I would recommend Ahli Baba's Kabob shop.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It wasnt like the pizza had an entirely different taste that made it exceptional...i think its just everything about this pizza was slightly better in each angle of criticism....like the crest had a good bite to it, toppings are fresh and simple, good amount of cheese and sauce just made this the best NY style slice i've ever had, hands down!!!! the life changing perspective was a huge overstatement though!!!!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I promise this third review update is worth the read.... After I posted my last review, stating that I was underwhelmed with the inconsistency of the food and the suffering service, I got a very nice email from the manager at bartaco, Todd. He is a new manager there and said he is making every effort to insure 100% satisfaction of every guest and fix the problem areas they are facing based on customer feedback. He truly cared about the negative feedback and apologized for the experiences that we're subpar. He invited us back to try again and the service and food were excellent. The food has always been good, my problem was more with the delivery or portions at times. He went out of his way to prove that he, and the staff, were working hard to make everyone's bartaco experience a good one. I can honestly say that is it rare for a manager to reach out and whole heartedly want to correct the problem for their customers. For some reason, if you experience any issues there (which seem to be dwindling), don't hesitate to reach out to him or any of the other managers (Kevin is also wonderful). I wish I had reached out earlier had I known how eager they are to address any customer issues. I value good customer service above most other things. Even great good can be soured by awful customer service. Through reviews, I've learned that bartaco really values its patrons, and that says a lot about the company! Also, the duck tacos (which I had never tried prior) made my jaw drop. 48 hour glaze/marinade before cooking....need I say more?","[1.0, 0.0]"

You will most likely be taking things home. For dessert I had the serradura (saw dust) which is my fave Portuguese dessert & it was phenomenal. My only two complaints are the ""Filet Mignon on a hot stone"" they they offer.... this is a steak they give you raw to cook yourself on a hot stone which I must say is pretty cool HOWEVER, if your at a table where two or three people order it or in a room where a few people order it, it gets very smokey!!!

"Walked into this interesting noodle place in Bishop's Corner on the 2nd day of opening and was impressed. Interior color and design looked fantastic, visually it felt like a great setting to eat in. However, it did feel a bit cramped when i made it to the cash register line. They had a lot of people working for the 2nd day of opening, it looked to be around 15 people. The menu was well presented and had calories, spice, and vegetarian indicators. It also even had pictures of all the main dishes. It gave off the first impression of being cheaper than it actually looks being around $5-6 for noodles without meat, but around an additional $2.50 for chicken, breaded chicken, steak, meatballs, shrimp, or tofu. You'll spend around $11 for a full filling meal, a good price. I ordered the Pad Thai, with a side soup of the Thai Curry Soup. My girlfriend ordered the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese, side order of Caesar Salad, and a fountain drink. After Ordering, we sat down and I continued to look around. The spacing between the seats and tables were pretty tight, and the eating area felt pretty small. There was some nice music, but i couldn't hear it due to the noise level, it was the 2nd day since opening though. They had a Coca-Cola Freestyle Soda Fountain, which was pretty cool. Within a couple of minutes our food came out, (that was fast) and we enjoyed. My Pad Thai looked well presented, with a little bit of everything, the noodles were a bit thicker than i expected since they were rice noodles. I tried the Thai Curry Soup first and the soup itself tasted delicious with a little bit of sweetness, i found that the noodles in it were a bit unnecessary, but that's how the full size soup comes. I then tried my Pad Thai which also tasted delicious having also a similar sweetness. However, after a few bites i realized how dried the dish was, i ended up having to share a drink. It still tasted terrific though. My girlfriend's Wisconsin Mac & Cheese was served with all the cheese sprinkled over the top it seemed, she had to mix it up and let the cheese melt, the dish itself was nothing special, it was good. The service their was friendly, and it seemed most of the workers were hired from the high school community. Our server was friendly, and dishes were cleaned very quickly, which was okay. It was nice that the owner of the place (I think)  was welcoming people during the dinner rush and helped explained the menu. After we ate, we packed up the Mac & Cheese in a custom take out box, which was cool, and i grabbed a take home menu. Overall the experience was good, I will defiantly be going back to try some other dishes. If business continues, hopefully they will find some way of expanding, or i'd have to order takeout more often than i would like. 4/5 P.S.

"If everything  on a restaurant's  menu often sounds good to you and you are unwilling or unable to commit  to a single entree, Artusi 's your solution.  The small and medium plate format ( both larger than tratitional tapas offering but smaller than full entrees)  along with sharing should satisfy your curiosity and appetite in as few as 4- 5 dishes for two people.  Encouraged by the generous pour drinks, a missed lunch and interesting menu listings we shared 7 dishes (high points were moist and flavorful veal cheeks, a savory wagyu tartare and luscious tomato bruschetta) less palatable were a glutinous orecchiette with lamb sausage and bland grilled eggplant.   The Italian pudding for dessert was flavor-packed  and  just the right portion.   The wine list has both heavy hitters in grape, vintage and price as well as more modest offerings.  We went for the latter and for $45 had a wine that held it's own across all the dishes we ordered. The enviroment on the first floor is kinetic and the ambient noise not for the faint of heart, but entirely in keeping with the contemporary approach to Italian cuisine.  Table service was efficient, but shy of professional and the butcher block (laminate?) tables w/o  cloths correctly signalled the casual experience that we had.  The banquettes need to be re-stuffed to avoid losing shorter diners.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I used to love this place whenever I had a craving for parathas, but after a rather unpleasant experience recently, I have resolved to take my business elsewhere. Where do I start?  When I entered the restaurant, the man behind the counter was on the phone and never bothered ending the call while taking my order.  I was told to wait 10 minutes.  Initially, I stated that I would take my order to-go, but then after 2 minutes, I changed my mind and went back to the counter and told the man (who was still on the phone) that I would eat there.  He nodded and turned away from me. After watching several people come and go, I noticed that it was now 20 minutes after the time I came in, so I approached the counter for my order.  The same man, who was STILL on the phone, reached down and gave me a bag, mumbling something about it just coming out.  When I reminded him that I wanted to sit down and eat it, he yelled for someone to bring it out to me.   A minute later when it was brought out to me, I immediately noticed that the paratha was lukewarm and not what I had ordered.  I didn't want a fuss, so I figured I would just finish up, but I grew more annoyed when no one brought me napkins or a cup for water.  I left my food on the table and gave the bill to the guy at the counter and paid since I had eaten some of the paratha.  I explained everything that went wrong and he was barely apologetic, and he took my money anyway.  (I was stupid and shouldn't have offered to pay in the first place, to be honest.)  He mumbled something about making me a new one, but it was a half-hearted offer and I did not want to wait any longer, so I left the restaurant without an apology or refund.   Went right up the street to Volga and had a hot, obviously fresh paratha.  It wasn't as good as I've had in the past at Khasiyat, but the service was far better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went to Portofinos' on a Saturday night last minute essentially because the other heavy hitter Italian restaurants nearby were booked. We expected a compromise experience and compromise meal and were actually very delighted at the quality of the food. We consider ourselves fairly experienced Italian diners and were pleasantly surprised by the Mussels appetizer, ceasar salad, fettucini in with claim in a red crab sauce and the veal marsala. These all had super sauces to dip the crusty bread into. Portions are fairly good size, certainly not smallish. The atmosphere is very classy although just a bit sterile, it could use an infusion of color and they could possibly lower the lighting to advance the romantic mood a bit more. When a table of six on our right and a table of eight on our left came along to dine next to us, the sound level went far too high and we felt a bit overwhelmed. Strange to see parents lugging their young teenagers into a fine dining place on a Saturday night without proper attire (sweats and T-shirts!) coming maybe straight from the tennis club (they were carrying a huge tennis bag which was parked next to our table). We would definitely like to get back to Portofino again and try some other menu items as I'm sure they do other Italian dishes very well there.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My husband and I live by.  We used to eat at Meme regularly and at Melo Grano before that.  We also eat all over the city sometimes with our kids and sometimes with out.  On this particular night, my husband went in and asked if there was room for 4, the host gave him in the once over and said no in a tone that implied ""how could you even ask.""  I too went in (not knowing that my husband had already tried) with our children, I and I felt I was actually at some sort of velvet rope situation in which they decided we didn't measure up.  A shame!  We love the food at Pub and Kitchen and I think the food is probably decent at FDR.  At least the neighborhood has Vernick nearby (which if you go early enough, we find they will seat you without a reservation as we are not good planners).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We went down to grimaldi's in Coney Island and it was okay.  The ambience was a bit like any other chain restaurant.  I assume the original joint is little more interesting.  The pizza was solid.  But not earth-shattering.   As we were leaving I noticed a white-pizza that looked and smelled amazing.  If we go again, we'll check out the original location and try something other than an original pepperoni pie.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My husband and I came here after having a bad experience at Little Fish. This is a small BYOB in south Philly. Luckily, it wasn't too busy on a Friday and we were seated immediately. We ordered the grilled calamari (delicious), marinara gniocchi (bland to me, but very tender- perfect texture), shrimp risotto, veal saltimbocca (both very good). Prices were very reasonable and our server, Gary was very polite and attentive. Our only issue, and it was enough to knock a star or two was the inability for the restaurant to manage their 12 top in the same small space. It was a very loud, obnoxious group yelling over each other. Clearly, they were having a great time but it was so disruptive to our meal. Most of the time, my husband and I couldn't hear each other speaking without having to yell ourselves. We complained but it didn't change anything. Such a shame, too, as this really affects people's experiences.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After rennovating my brownstone for the past 4 months, my eye goes to the details. So I find myself commenting on their choice of shade of colour on the walls and debating if it is indeed revere pewter or stonington grey! Sitting next to us is the chef's girlfriend's mother. And let me tell you she gets the attention! Every 2 freking minutes ""are you ok?""....""is everything ok?""...""do you  need anything else?"". She also gets special order. from the chef of course.

"This is a strange place that's part long and narrow white-tiled retro diner (where you place your orders) and part low-lit, spartan dining room (off to the side). It's kind of confusing. Is there waiter service at some point? I don't know. There's a line cook and a guy manning the cash register. It took me a while to place my order with the guy at the register, because he seemed distracted by something and didn't want to take my order right away. I got the seitan hoagie (~$9), but they didn't offer Daiya vegan cheese, so I skipped the cheese all together (they use some old school soy cheese which didn't engender any faith in me). The hoagie was decent, but nothing to rave about; the best part, in my opinion, was the wholewheat roll it came on. Other than that, it was just strips of seitan, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms in a piece of bread. I also had a slice of chocolate cake ($5) which was atrocious. It looked good in the cooler case, but in actuality it was heavy, stale and had a weird aftertaste. What a waste of money; I took two bites and threw the rest out. This didn't seem like the type of place where complaining about the food would get you a refund. Be warned that long lines quickly form at the counter. A group of five came in right after me and it took easily 20 minutes for all of them to get their orders in; to make matters worse, there's no room to linger, so everyone gets cramped by the counter and a line starts to form. This is not a sign that Govinda's is any good and worth waiting for. It's just a sign that they don't have enough space. In summary, Govinda's did not impress me. If you're looking for a vegan cheesesteak, I recommend going to Blackbird Pizza which does a decent one with Daiya. For desserts, I'd go to Grindcore House or to Sweet Freedom Bakery.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went here around a month ago and I saw a poster that says they're moving, so some of the things I will mention might not be true any more. First off, the place doesn't look very clean, but is pretty much acceptable in my standards. I ordered a steamed dumpling and a beef noodle. For the price alone, the dumpling was very much worth it, it was packed with meat and the price/quantity ratio is very reasonable. As you would expect from cheap noodles, the meat toppings are a scarcity, but the amount of noodles served is pretty huge. I normally would have preferred to eat a balanced protein and carbo meal, but I will forgive this one for the tasty soup and chewy noodles. Overall, I would say that this is the kind of noodles I would expect from a good Chinese noodle store and top that with affordable prices, this place is definitely a good place to check out for noodle fans.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It's only since I  left Burlington that I realized how truly special Flatbread is. The bar is beer-only, and a very carefully selected. The pizzas are thin and cut into skinny strips. The ingredients are selected and prepared with love, and the place is ALWAYS cranking out amazing food. My favorite day here was spent sitting by the fire after a long day snowboarding at stowe. There is nothing like a belly full of beer and pizza (i mean flatbread) to push you towards a nap.","[1.0, 0.0]"
A good steakhouse should offer quality and service. Thie Alexus Steakhouse offers neither. I came with my gusets for a Sunday dinner. We oredered onion soups. The soup was delivered lukewarm not hot. We had to send the soup back. When the soup was returned the server did not know the basics for serving. We oredered Porterhouse steaks. The waitress delivered the steaks but literally disappeard. We wanted to have steak sauce but the waitress was nowhere to be found. At a steakhoiuse you would expect to have have glasses of glass not plastic glasses that would be served at a diner.  The tableclothes were not ironed but wrinkled with stain marks. The clothe napkins were old with holes in them. It They apepared to be like rewashed rags. Perhaps this is more of a restaurant for hamburgers and beer. This should not be called a Steak House.

"Definitely a unique experience with large, wide cut Belgian fries and a wide variety of dipping sauces. We got three sauces: Mango chutney, Vietnamese pineapple, Honey mustard, and of course Ketchup. While the fries are fresh and served (very) hot, the dipping sauces didn't really taste spectacular. In fact, they were just average tasting and didn't really make a big difference. The restaurant itself is kinda dingy looking with very limited seating. Our table was dirty with a spilled drink and fries! It's not a great place to bring friends - not even sure you wanna hang out there with just two people.

"I visited The Pickled Heron with my sister when she was in town during Thanksgiving weekend. I was in the area for another function so we decided to eat dinner. I had heard rave reviews from locals in the area, but was none-the-less disappointed. Food: App: Mussels with fries - delicious and definitely a good app to share. The portion for this appetizer seemed ridiculous when we got our mains. It's very filling and could be a meal on its own. Me: Quail with mushroom (and foie gras?) risotto - The risotto was rich and nice but didn't make up for the dry and flavorless quail, which was rather messy and difficult to eat. Her: Grilled steak with some greens and what I believe was a yam pave drenched in truffle oil. Compared to the mussel app, this dish was absurdly proportioned. There were four bite size pieces of delicious steak done perfectly next to a gigantic slab of yam pave. My sister polished off the steak and greens, but barely touched the pave which filled up half the plate. I like truffle oil as much as the next person, but this was overwhelming. One thing to note is that unless you can find a very recent menu before visiting, it is likely that the menu in the restaurant will be different. They change the offerings frequently, and none of the dishes I had been hoping to try were actually on the menu. Service: Our waiter started out great at 6:30pm, we were one of two tables eating. Nice and observant, maybe a little too much. By 7:15, a few more tables had come in with larger groups and he couldn't handle the rush. We had finished our meal and were staring around us, it was too loud to have a decent conversation without shouting, but the waiter wouldn't stop by for another 15min to bring us the dessert menu. It took him another 15min to come around before we could tell him we didn't want dessert, and just wanted to leave. Final notes: The food is hit or miss and so is the service. For the prices they're charging in the neighborhood they're in, I expected more, and also maybe the ability to take plastic. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Steak didn't impress me at all. The eggs did come out over-easy the way I like, perfectly runny. My sister wanted to try eggs benedict.

I was told they don't have a ""full kitchen"" so everything is baked in an oven. The toast was great, and the recipes sounded delicious. But I got the eggs with the tomato, basil. I realized it was just a hard boiled egg with spagetti sauce on it. Yuck. The waitresses were rude, bitchy, and it took FOREVER to get our food. It was just fruit salad and tea and they took forever!

"Came with a group of 6 and had a pretty unpleasant experience.  The dishes were mostly strikeouts or singles, but there were a few home runs.  The service, it should be noted up front, was absolutely horrific, but I'll talk about the food first, since that's really all I care about.   Smoked potato gnocchi, lancaster co. lamb shoulder ragu, pecorino-- The gnocchi were heavy, gummy, and so smokey that they basically ruined the dish, overpowering the gamey lamb/tomato sauce, which on its own was pretty delicious.  It was also over salted, which made the pecorino's presence unpleasant.   Porchetta-filled agnolotti, sage, butter, black truffle, crushed amaretti.  The filling was dull and under salted, the agnolotti were clunky and poorly executed (way too thick and under cooked at the pinched edges), the butter sauce was heavy and needed more acid, the truffle was barely noticeable, the amaretti made the dish inappropriately sweet, and the sage didn't help a thing.   House cured goat salame with Caponata-- The highlight of the night.  The essence of goat meat, artfully heightened and distilled.  The flavor was powerfully game-y, but still completely pleasant, and was artfully balanced by a checkering of creamy white fat with a more delicate goat flavor reminiscent of fresh chevre.  The texture was awesomely unctuous.  The caponata was the perfect compliment, and turned this from a great item into a great dish.  The ""grilled rustic bread"" was scorched in places... why is this so often the case at otherwise competent places?  Maybe I'm just not ""rustic"" enough to appreciate the flavor of carbon? Guitar Pasta with rock shrimp, lemon, mussels, zucchini, zucchini blossoms-- Another highlight.  The rock shrimp were extremely high quality, and perfectly cooked.  The tiny mussels were exceptionally intense, clean and oceanic.  The strips of zucchini in the sauce were fine.  The outstanding olive oil (delicate, floral and green) that anchored the sauce tied everything together with its suavity, and the lemon lent the dish a nice brightness.  The zucchini blossoms advertised on the menu were nowhere to be found-- a definite disappointment, but not a deal breaker considering this pasta's perfection.   N'Duja, spreadable spicy pork salame--Just as addictive as it sounds.  It comes with clove-y pickled carrots that take it to the next level.  The ""grilled rustic bread"" that came with this was even more scorched than the ""g.r.b."" accompanying the goat salame. Affettati misti, Salame selection--  Everything was excellent, especially the spreadable pork pate jawn and the various vegetable accouterments.  It's impossible not to respect a kitchen capable of house-curing this many varieties of salame this well.   Tagliatelle Al Sugo Di Coniglio, ribbon shaped pasta, braised Lancaster co. rabbit ragu--The rabbit meat and the tomato in the sauce combined into an amazing compound flavor, delicately sweet.  A completely pleasant dish. Taccozzelle All'Aquilana- house-made abruzzese-style sausage, porcini, black truffle, navelli saffron--  Very interesting.  I would never have expected the flavor of truffle, porchini, safron and sausage to go together as well as they did in this dish, but in the end the combination was still a little strange, and in the end I think the dish added up to slightly less than the sum of its its parts.   The deserts all sucked, except for the semi-fredo.   As for the service... We got there 2 minutes before our 7:30 reservation time, and were told to wait at the bar until our table opened up.  46 minutes later (we kept count) we were finally able to sit down, and maybe 10 minutes after that a server finally made it over to our table.  By the time the first ap touched down it was almost 9:00. While we were waiting at the bar the hostess didn't once check in with us .  I had to keep tracking her down to get a report on her non-progress.  Each time I was told ""10 minutes"".  I've worked in restaurants and completely understand how such a situation can come up, but not how it can go on for 46 minutes.     While we were waiting at the bar people were piling up behind us wanting to sit and drink, so we had to look like dicks because we weren't willing to wait outside in the 45 degree weather.  Of course the bartender didn't explain the situation to anyone, so I had to.  At the bar we ordered about $45 worth of drinks we wouldn't have wanted if it wasn't for the wait.  Of course nothing was comped-- in a place this obviously understaffed you can be sure that the priority is milking the customer for every drop.   Seating situation aside, the service was still pretty bad.  It was almost impossible to get a server to answer questions about the menu, and when the plates were brought to the table, she couldn't identify many of the items on the plate.   To add insult to injury they tacked on an automatic 20% tip.   Do yourself a favor and go to Osteria instead.","[0.0, 1.0]"

And I don't even like pasta much and I am dreaming of having this again); the calamari appetizer; and the branzino...AMAZING.  Even the fresh bread they bring to the table with this AMAZING caponata and olive oil.  Did I mention this place is AMAZING? :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

If I could give no stars I would! Food is disgusting. Waitress even told me certain things I should not order b.c they were nasty tasting. I would recommended B's on Springdale avenue in east orange for real southern soul food. 1. Its owned by Haitians who have no business cooking soul food. 2. Owner is unprofessional. Argued with someone he owed money in the resturant also One lady came in to order and was standing in the front for 10mins was finally approached by the owner who asked what she wanted when she began to tell her order he cut her off complaining that she wanted to much and had to wait for a waitress. 3. Owner raves about the food which is terrible. Had whiting fish (frozen bag fish) macaroni with disgusting cheese and potato salad with a hard miniature corn muffin. Originally wanted greens but they ran out. What soul food restaurant runs out of greens? 4. A friend of mine used to work there and told me just about all there food is canned or frozen! 5. Charged an outraging price for a wannabe uptown which was lemon juice and bottle tea. 6. Also took an hour to get one dinner meal for take out.

I thought the service was great, and I like the decor - it's got a quirky feel, and I liked looking at all of the posters and toys on display behind the bar.  The regular seating looks like it might be a bit awkward, since you sit at these long wooden tables, sometimes next to people who are not in your party.  Overall, the food was tasty and filling, and the service was good, so I'll be back to try the delicious-looking chicken and waffles next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I got a lamb belly appetizer which had an ok flavor but I couldn't stomach the meat.

"I made plans with a group of  females friends to meet for a BYOB dinner. Three of us arrived at 7:05 pm. We put our names down for a group of 8 and went to the back room to wait.  Upon learning that our friends were running an hour late we asked to be seated at a table for three or four ( one friend was very close).   Long story short, the  owner/ host was inconsiderate,  inflexible  and accused us of trying to work the system to tie up his tables until the larger group came.  We were flabbergasted by his rudeness, , yelling at his staff, and unwillingness to seat us in a different group (4 top vs. group of 8). He was unfriendly, yelled and screamed at us and was completely uncalled for. I can honestly say it was completely uncalled for behavior, like a lunatic. We were asking to change our party size  - politely - and he basically went cuckoo on us. He proceeded to call the police and no less than 5 Montclair police showed up in 3 police cars as he reported the incident as a fight.

"I couldn't get reservations at Carmine's on-line but when we came out of the theater we walked right across the street to the restaurant and got right in.  The place was very crowded but the service and the attention was good.  We had the gigantic steak pizzaoli (sp?) which was a 45 ounce porterhouse steak with mounds of red and green peppers, onions and other veggies all in a fabulous sauce.  The meat was sliced off the bone but the bone was on the plate (my husband could not resist and had at it) and it was tender and juicy.  We also had the large stuffed artichoke which we shared (3 of us) and we left nothing but the well scraped leaves on the plate. Although we were stuffed out of our minds, we ordered the cannoli which consisted of 3 small and perfect mini cannolis.  The ricotta was fresh and the presentation was beautiful.  This is an absolute must go to restaurant so don't listen to anyone who tells you that this is a tourist trap.  If it is, who cares?  Natives and tourists are lucky to be able to eat here.  This is not for the weight conscious of faint of heart - big portions, lots of noise, lots of fun.  Make sure you pay attention to the fact that one order generally serves 3 - 4.

"Made a reservation for 8 PM on a Tuesday night a few weeks ago.  It started really filling up around 9 PM.  All dishes with one exception were realllllllly yummy (more on that in a sec).  My bf and I enjoy savoring our food slowly, taking our time with each dish, feeling unrushed.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers' reviews I knew ahead of time that they typically bring the dishes out quickly - so we ordered our dishes a few at a time.  Our waitress was really nice and understanding about it - and she didn't hover and try to rush us along at all.  Here's the low-down on the dishes: 1. assorted olives - 3 kinds of olives, one type was very small and round (these had the most flavored), one was pretty stadard, the third type was the largest olive I've ever eaten! 2. fried goat cheese - as everyone else has said, YUM.  light, surprising, delish. 3. crispy brussel sprouts - also YUM.  a little heavier than I expected, much more filling than I would expect brussel sprouts to be.  Great blend of flavors. 4. fritto misto de mare - this was the big DISAPPOINTMENT of the night.  a mix of shrimp, calamari, a white fish, and two kinds of small silver fish.  the shrimp was juicy, but the rest was a bummer.  I enjoy calamari tentacles but this didn't come with the tentacles - in fact there was hardly any calamari.  There were far too many of the little silver fish, which were much like semi-dried sardines or anchovies.  The whole dish was greasy - and trust me, I love a good calamari, but this just came out oily and greasy.  It was also really bland, although fortunately it came with lemon wedges and a pile of nice sea salt - but then it just ended up tasting lemony and salty but no underlying flavor.  We are seafood lovers but we regretted ordering this dish. 5. seared foie gras - WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE.  so delicious.  melts in your mouth, great blend of flavors, savory and sweet and salty - tasted like pure luxury.  This was our favorite dish. And because we ordered slowly, we savored our food and didn't over-order and get too full..... which meant....  two desserts!!! 1. the molten chocolate cake - SOOOOOOO good, the ice cream accompanying it was awesome, the cake had the perfect combination of crisped almost caramelized exterior and molten oozy delicious center. 2. the cheesecake - this was not your typical cheesecake by any means - less sweet, a pleasant tartness, a silky almost gelatinous texture which reminded me of panna cotta, the sour cherry garnish was a fantastic complement - and the presentation was eye-catching and whimsical. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, the waitress was nice and very patient with our purposefully laid-back pace of the meal.  She didn't hover but occasionally checked to see if we wanted anything else.  Sitting on the second floor balcony was fun because we could look down at the people on the first floor and see what they were eating.  The paella looked yummy!  I can't wait to come back here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We visited Costanera last week on Friday. Very crowded. Interesting menu. Food was only so-so. Service was mediocre. Waiter was not very knowledgeable. One person in our party ordered the grilled whole fish and when it arrived by itself with nothing else on  the plate....asked to have it filleted. The waiter said sure. Then another waiter came out and said that the restaurant's ""policy"" is not to fillet a fish for anyone. He tried to tell us how to do it and not well at that. We later learned from the other waiter that the chef really isn't good at filleting the fish. What? If you can't fillet a fish then don't serve it whole. And what kind of Chef can't fillet a fish!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have been eating at Sazon for about two and a half years now, and the food is fabulous, creative, and inexpensive.  A hidden jewel on Spring Garden, Sazon boasts home-cooked Venezualan cuisine, including arepas, empanadas, platanos, and the most delicious chicken soup I have ever eaten.  The entrees are exceptional, and the hot chocolate is out of this world - I rate it up there with my best orgasms.  I also enjoy the fresh juices such as passion fruit. I recommend this restaurant highly, and I am proud to be a loyal customer.  The chef, Judy Suzanna Campbell is humble, but very dedicated to bringing her traditional food to a wide audience.  Her husband, Roberto Campbell is known for his amazing innovations in Venezualan chocolate desserts, hot chocolate, and other sweets.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Giving 2 stars  because the service is excellent. Went this Sunday for restaurant week, although I have been here before and it's always been superb. I had the roasted chicken since the special menu restaurant week menu was SO limited.. The chicken first off was not even organic, it was the lowest quality ever- I dare even say frozen. I really expected it at least to taste good. Anyway as I cut into my small low grade chicken thigh and leg (not even breast)  I realize that it's not cooked.. What a turnoff!!   By then I lost my appetite, the server was very apologetic and nice about it. My friends entree the pork was ok. 5 minutes later I received my new chicken - which I swear was microwaved because it was steamy and not roasted or crispy. The dessert and drinks were on point.. And again service was great.. So all in all - don't order off the restaurant week menus lol...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"RIP OFF!!!! This burrito, that claims to be in the San Francisco mission style is lacking one important thing: SIZE.   The chicken burrito that I got tasted decent, but was about 1/3 the size of those I have gotten in San Fran.  It was considerably smaller than Chipotle, and didn't taste much better.  In fact, I ate the burrito with one hand while standing on the R train, and finished in two stops.  If hungry, I would need two of these to satisfy me, which at $9 a pop, is NOT worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've heard a lot of great things about Talula's Garden so I decided to check it out. My friends and I had a reservation for Friday at 7pm, there was three of us. We walked in and it was packed. We decided to wait a little longer than our reservation time so that we didn't get seated in the bar area. We did have a drink at the bar. The bartenders were friendly, made recommendations, and most importantly made the drinks well. If you didn't have a seat the space was quite crowded and you were constantly doing a little dance to get out of the servers way. We ordered the abstract and their version of a margarita. We waited about another 10-15 minutes at the bar before we were seated. We were seated near the back of the restaurant. Which I don't mind because I like to be able to see what is going on around me. We were greeted and given water. Our server although visibly busy did not seem perturbed when greeting us and discussing the menu. He made solid recommendations on appetizers as well as entrees. We had the Winter Cauliflower Ravioli's as well as a Cheeseboard for apps. For dinner we went with the Seared Day Boat Scallops, Pan Roasted Chicken, and Gnocchi. The food was cooked perfectly and everything was delicious. The food did take a little long to come to the table. However, understandably so since it was a busy night. We also had dessert to share the Chocolate Parade and the Baklava. Overall the experience was great. It is a little pricey but the food and drinks are consistent and well worth the spend. I'd like to visit again in the summer to sit outside.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I would love to give this place more stars but simple cant - I enjoyed visits to sister restaurant Bozu a lot more. First off, you can't make a reservation here. So we came one weekend and put our names on waiting list and were told 1 hr. We hit a local bar, came back after 1 hr and still had to wait another 20 min. They were nice enough to give us a bottle of sake on the house while we were waiting. Second, the venue itself. Basically, one square room with communal tables where you have the privilege to sit next to hipsters some of which lack basic hygiene. That night they were playing old school hip hop. I love old school hip hop but it was completely out of place... Third, the food itself. Basically, it's the same menu as in bozu. I've ordered sushi bombs and a million appetizers to try a few things. I thought a lot of them were good but them my gf couldn't eat any of them as EVERY SINGLE DISH HAD WASABI. I love wasabi, but they should add to the description of the dishes that they contain it so people who don't like it don't order it. Last, it's cash only. It's not small change so IMO they should accept credit cards. Save yourself the hustle and go to Bozu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great Fish Tacos! Who would've known!?  I moved here 2 & 1/2 years ago after spending about 5 years on the west coast.  The first thing I missed was the great mix of flavors found in the fish taco.  Logically, in the past 2+ years if I see a fish taco on the menu, described as the traditional baja style, cabbage, lightly fried white fish, pico de gallo, corn tortillas, lime... my mouth starts to water and I get my hopes up...but every single time I've ordered one in this city, I've been completely disappointed.   Frankly, I've oft times been grossed out by what has come out of many a kitchen, claiming to be a fish taco. So, you can imagine my surprise when I had an good one, finally,  just down the street from my house. I went to K&K for the first time this week to reconnect with the girlfriends...honestly we just picked it because it was a mid point for everyone. The atmosphere was pretty quiet.  Not bad but not great either, with a decent beer list.  This place would be pretty unremarkable if it wasn't for the food.  Our hummus plate app was great, and the fish tacos did not disappoint. So, as odd as it may sound, if you are craving something remotely close to the fish tacos you get in Southern California...Kite and Key is the place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Tempted to knock off a star for the resting bitchy face at the front desk, but the food is just too good and the service (other than them) is great. Drinks: the Sangria & the Bourbon ginger drinks are delicious. (skip the one with rum and marshmallow- it tastes like diet cola). Apps: Must get the truffle tortellini--one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Also the oysters and autumn salad are amazing.   Main dish: The chicken for two. We also had the steak and arctic char, but I stand by my original recommendation...the chicken is perfection.

"Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first! If I had eaten the dessert, the glorious bacon donuts with dulce de leche and coffee ice cream, first, I would not have eaten another bite of anything else. The waiter delivered our bacon donuts to us and I was still eating the cinnamon-strawberry spare ribs. As the other Yelpers dug into the dessert, I asked how it was. Cassy S. answered, ""It's terrible! Awful! Don't even bother trying it. I'll eat yours for you."" At that, I immediately stopped eating my dinner and my fork flew to the soft pillowy donut that was bathing in sweet heavenly dulce de leche, dotted with very crispy bacon. I scooped some of the rich coffee ice cream with the donut. OH, HEAVENLY NIRVANA. I saw stars. I saw light. I saw truth. I saw a thousand wonders of the world. If you are lost and weary, feeling forsaken, EAT THIS for this must have been the apple of knowledge that is in the bible. You will never look at dessert the same way again. When the other table got their bacon donuts, our entire table yelled out in chorus, ""It's really really terrible. Bring it here. We'll save you the trouble."" Will C. immediately attacked a donut. After eating his dessert, he wandered over to our table looking a little annoyed at us because we tried to trick him out of this delectable treat. Yelpers are generous people. We love to share and there's nothing more than what we love to do than share good food. But the bacon donuts are just that wonderful. We do not want to share. Oh, no! Go get your own. Actually don't. Leave them all for me, please? PLEASE! I only have 6 months to live! DON'T TAKE THE DONUTS!!!!!!!!! *********** What is Traif? Traif comes from treif, which is Yiddish for torn. It refers to all forms of non-kosher meat, pork being famously one of them. Traif serves all different manners of delicious ""dirty"" non-kosher meat. They also have meat that could be kosher (beef), but I'm sure they cooked in delicious non-kosher ways. Traif serves up incredible gourmet delights in small plates with generous serving sizes, so that a table a four could comfortably have a really good taste of a dish. Best of all the prices are incredibly reasonable, nay cheap, for food of this quality. If you're looking to impress on a budget, you can do no better than Traif. This isn't good food on budget. This is GREAT food that just happens to be very budget friendly. I enjoyed my little bites at Traif. They were very tasty, but the style at Traif is not quite my thing. If you love offal, Traif would be the first place that I would recommend. Knowing that you're doing something illicit, forbidden, and dirty makes the act just that more thrilling, daring, and fun.

We also had 2 pitchers of their white sangria - YES. YES. YES. I literally chugged an entire one on my own. Oops. Their clam pie was mind blowing. I'm not a huge fan of clams, so when a friend ordered it, I was hesitant. However, I took one bite was was in food heaven. The crust was crispy and perfectly browned. The clams weren't fishy. It was delightfully garlicy with the perfect amount of sauce. We also had their M.O.R. pie. The flavors here were a bit more subtle.

"The food here is really good, definitely one of the really good feijoadas in New York (I know my feijoada from frequent visits to Brazil with my wife, who is from Sao Paulo). The service, though is horrific--truly a disaster and disrespectful to diners. We had to practically beg for everything--it is no exaggeration to say we ordered every round of drinks and plates at least three times. I will give them a break that everything took 30min to an hour arrive because it was packed for the final of the Confederations Cup and Brazil was busy beating Spain 3 to 0. After we'd already spent over $250 and waited for the closing 20 mins of the game, the waitress came and said 'you either need to consume more or I'm closing your check and clearing your table.' of course they showed up promptly when it was time to cash in and get our bill, which only suggests the lousy service was more a choice than anything. When the check arrived, they'd mischarged us for two pitchers of caipirinhas (adding $15 to the total) and then charged us for four instead of three pitchers (bringing the extra charge above what we consumed to $45). When I brought it to the waitress's attention, she even tried to argue with all 5 of us, which was, obviously, insulting. I've never had such terrible service anywhere. It's a real shame, as the food is good. We won't be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

This is probably my 3rd or 4th review of Little Fish.  The atmosphere is always great and very chill.  The menu changes constantly which is something that I love because you can go to this place over and over again and it would be hard to have the exact same dish twice.  We started off with the octopus and the lobster apps followed by the striped bass and skate wing entrees.  Everything was excellent and the portions were great.  Even though we were quite full we ordered dessert which was a chocolate brownies with ice cream and a few other tasty things with it.  It was enormous so definitely plan to split that baby because I would have had trouble taking the whole thing down by myself even if I was still hungry.  Fantastic dinner as usual.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cool spot in Red Hook.  It seems like a nice cozy little restaurant in the front area, but if you make your way to the back there's a very nice outdoor seating area with a very chill atmosphere. The food was pretty good and they have an interesting Asian fusion because the place doesn't seem very Asian/Korean from the name and most of the menu.  It's mostly American style food so I wouldn't come here looking for a true fusion-type meal.   I like the down home local atmosphere and one of the best experiences from the wait staff I've had in awhile.  We ordered our food, but apparently the kitchen got backed up and it was taking very long (+40 minutes) for 4 dishes.  We were getting a little annoyed, but aren't the type to complain so we were going to just relax and get another round of drinks to kill time.  The waiter and manager apologized for the delay even though we didn't say anything and comped us a round of drinks which I think speaks volumes for the type of customer service they have.  I've been to plenty of other places that just blame problems on the kitchen (because it's easy) and that's it.  I know it's a very cheap and easy way to keep customers happy, but so many places miss that kind of simple stuff so I appreciate it more and will recommend it if you're ever out in that area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The curry came with pineapple, string beans, red bell peppers, and kabocha squash. We were surprised at the amount of soft shell crab and the curry for $16! The batter for the crab was delicious and the crab tasted fresh. In addition, the curry was not sweet, but very peppery. We miss this dish! I ordered the lunch special with tom yum soup with shrimp, papaya salad, and pad thai with shrimp. Nom nom nom. The tom yum soup was really spicy, and I liked how there were large shrimp and mushrooms. The papaya salad was awesome! Love the spiciness and the freshness of the papaya with the peanuts and dried shrimps. The pad thai was good and not saucy. I prefer pad thai back at home. Overall, this restaurant knows how to make thing spicy. Yum! Service was very efficient. You should visit the bathroom since the toilets automatically change the plastic toilet seat cover. Really nifty. Cash only place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My first yelp review ever...Have been a few times for coffee and hot chocolate during the day (the hot chocolate is excellent by the way) but went the first time for dinner this evening. It was amazing! I have spent time in Italy, and this is the most authentic Italian food I have had in a long time. The fresh pastas are incredible, as are the salads, and the tiramisu. Very good food for the price. Highly recommended.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"What can I say? I love their wings. I go to Archie Moore's when I'm craving good, not too hot, buffalo wings. I order them extra crispy and always ask for extra bleu cheese.

Aside from the wings I have tried burgers and nachos, but both paled in comparison to the wings.  The nachos are hit or miss - sometimes filled with cheese and pulled pork and sometimes empty.  Burgers are good, but there are better options in New Haven. The drinks are cold and if you sit at the bar you get them more quickly than at a table.  I've never been overwhelmed with the service there, but its usually adequate and speedy enough. The place has character and great wings. Try it out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wild edibles is a delightful seafood spot in a neighborhood that offers very few comparable options. While the space is tiny and they don't take reservations, we were able to find a table without any wait on a Thursday night (though we were quite cramped). Oysters were great, but mussels were our favorite! They have about 6-7 different ways they can prepare them, and they're accompanied by delicious bread. Next time, we'll try more than just one of the options. We also ordered some staple dishes (fried calamari, some vegetable sides, clam chowder, etc.), all of which were up to expectation. I think Wild Edibles primarily functions as a market, only turning into a restaurant at night. Assuming they have the same stuff available raw that they serve in the restaurant, this could also be a great option when trying to purchase less common seafood.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Juniors in Times Square is the third NYC outpost for this Brooklyn institution. It's actually divided into two separate parts, the restaurant, and a to-go bakery (which also has outside tables). The location is right next to Times Square but on a side street without much on it so it's relatively quiet and peaceful considering its location. Juniors has pretty mediocre savory food and service and I already know they have the best cheesecake in NYC so I came to this location to try their black and white cookie. The guys at the counter couldn't tell me if they make them or get them from an outside source but I bought the $2.50 treat anyway. Turns out in addition to the cheesecake, Juniors has the best black and white cookie in New York. Well they're tied with Barney Greengrass and Ess-A-Bagel anyway as all three tasted exactly the same. I wonder if they all get them from the same place but no one would tell me. The cake (""cookie"") part was incredibly moist and fresh while the chocolate was chocolaty and had a good texture as well. The white frosting wasn't too sweet and although it was a little softer than the white part should be, it was still the best so far.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Bagel bistro is a pretty Okay bagel shop. Right on route 23 in Little Falls, Bagel Bistro offers a decent variety of bagels, coffee and sandwiches.

The quality of of food is on par. Nothing too special, but it hits the spot especially if you are hungry. The taylor ham egg and cheese sandwich is not too shabby, however it will leave you feeling like you've committed a greasy sin.

The food there continues to remind you that ""you feast with your eyes first,"" appearing thoughtfully arranged on simple plates that allow the food to quietly show you everything it has to offer: various textures, complimentary and engaging colors, depth, and a general sense of harmony and balance. We also love that this is a place where New Yorkers and visitors go, making it an ideal place to linger over a great meal in a lovely place because the food, service, wine list, and people watching are always wonderful.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My first impression of this new offering in Williston was excitement, as I walked in the door on Sunday of opening weekend and was met with a pub style atmosphere and friendly faces. Upon being seated, my table was informed the restaurant was out of pub fries/chips, and the grass fed beef.  I ordered a cup of chicken soup to start, and was extremely disappointed when, after having to wait 25 min and then ask where the soup was, it was served to me at room temp.  For my meal, I ordered chicken pot pie...again, extreme disappointment. Not only was the pot pie NOT traditional pot pie (it was chicken and gravy with a triangle of philo dough on top), it too was room temp at best. The manager and owner aplogized, chalking it up to opening weekend, issues with the kitchen staff and not having enough outlets in the kitchen.  I left wondering if I would ever return.   This past weekend I had company in town and decided I would give this place another try. Huge disapppointment. I felt as though I'd made a mistake when, while waiting for our meals, I saw two women having to send back their Sheppard's pie for being cold. We ordered burgers - one well done grass fed beef, the other a medium 80/20 beef burger.  Both came out black on the outside and so overly cooked that they were barely enjoyable. One was sent back, in hopes of getting a medium cooked burger. It came back out close to the state of the original.  We left very disappointed, and with a rumbling stomach. I knew instantly something wasn't right. I was sick from that evening through the next evening with severe abdominal cramps and a headache. The only thing different about my meal being the grass fed beef. Suffice it to say, I will not be returning.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great food, but sadly Rose Water has one of the rudest, most unprofessional servers I have ever encountered and unfortunately I've encountered her on two separate visits. I've read that Dine-In Brooklyn is not a favorite among the local waitstaff (bad tips, packed tables, etc.), but at Rose Water it appears the waitstaff use this as an excuse to let their pent-up frustrations out on the paying (and possibly good tipping) customers. As a former waitress, I understand the challenges of a busy night/week, but our server was incredibly rude: eye rolling, huffing, tossing menus, grabbing. It was a bit like being served by a surly teenager. I love the food at Rose Water, but will not be returning until the waitstaff learn some basic manners-- or at least this one particularly rude server finds a new career path.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Good lettuce on your gyro, hot off the spit that you can see through their glass kitchen. The gyros are what we all come here for. I only buy the lamb. The tzatziki Sauce is wonderful. I've also gotten salads as well as spanikopeta, and I have even ordered breakast from them. The meals are always filling and I never regret ordering from the Greek lady. If the desserts aren't sold out GET ONE. Every dessert I've had from these guys is amazing though if you order after dark they'll tell you they're all sold out since they must be making them in house.

"Tria's sultry sophisticated sister moved in a few blocks west and is doing amazing things. For those that know me are aware that I love the following in no particular order... House music , champagne and all things Tria. When the rumor mill began a few months back about a brand new Tria I was more that intrigued. Based on my first visit to Tria Taproom I'm sure I'll be a repeat diner/imbiber. As others have stated its ecxactly what the name states a tap room. Don't come expecting a bottle of anything. Both the beer and wine list are equally impressive and I had a chance to sample the Tempranillo as well as the locally made cab franc. In comparison to the other tria locations I will say that wine list is more purse friendly, but still offers amazing known varietals and something you may have never tried. I'm sure the wine list will rotate but I will say the cab franc was a 5oz glass of jammy goodness and I would highly recommended it. The food options are very different from the other locations more kitchen fare is how I would describe it. Options range from flat breads, wings , ribs and a few dips sprinkled in. I think everyone will have options here if dining. I opted for the garbanzo purée to accompany my two glasses of wine. It had a slight spice and came  inside a jar layered with feta and roasted peppers. The grilled flatbread served along side it was chewy and still crisp, exactly how I like my flatbread to be. It was the perfect dinner and very filling and well priced at 6.00 for the jar. The atmosphere is still very tria awesomely seductive , with low lights and instead of candles there are  lots if industrial lights scattered throughout. There's plenty of seating along a 8-12 seat bar and a few high top chairs, the back space has a few high top tables and a long bench that would be  perfect for a crew the size of the former team fun. I think this tria tap room is a great addition to this neighborhood and though i lost my favorite gayborhood tria manager Chris I can visit him a little closer to work at Tria Tap room. Go . sip .

"I originally gave Donostia four stars, but I've been back twice since my first post. Each time with other people, and once with a group. I know that they don't represent themselves as being a restaurant. They offer conservas, Spanish canned seafood. I was disappointed that they've been out of mackerel, and that when they serve tuna--that's it-- a lump of tuna out of a can. They make no effort to provide garnish or make some kind of presentation. The main players here seem to be detached from their role as those making this a culinary experience you would want to revisit. It's not like they appreciate your business. The only redeeming reasons to come back here are that my wife loves the puréed artichoke hearts and their outstanding selection of Spanish vermouths. I would go back for the latter two, but management should be aware that hospitality and visual presentation of even high end canned goods are a key to developing a regular following. I'll be back, but only to see if you can step up your game. I now know where to get the vermouth retail--so I need a reason to keep coming back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food at Charlie Was a Sinner had some highlights, like the  potato croquettes with the smoked paprika aioli and the pappillotte of sunchokes which was delicious.  There were also some dishes that did not transcend the ordinary such as the marinated asparagus. Something I enjoyed about the experience were the very attentive serving staff, host and hostess. While the space is cozy and even a little tight at times, the busy staff manages to politely step out of the way of guests, allowing them to pass. It looked like a choreographed dance.   One of the things I liked the least about Charlie was a Sinner was the ambiance.  I would prefer to visually see the presentation of the food and to enjoying the conversation of my companions in lieu of the background audio noise which was concert level loud and the flickering visual projections which reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock hallucination.  The combination created a sensory overload which was not an enjoyable accompaniment for a delicious meal or good dinner conversation.  Before we had finished eating I was very ready to leave.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My wife and I stopped in just before 9 PM on Saturday the 9th to celebrate our anniversary.  Having never been to any of Marc Vetri's restaurants, we didn't know what to expect.  In my opinion it lived up to the hype.  The ambience was nice, a little loud, but we liked the feel of it.  The food was very good.  I definitely recommend trying the swordfish meatballs. It was packed when we arrived but there was minimal wait time before we could sit down.  We had a table closer to the door but it turned out to be nice as we were a little more secluded.  While our server Eric was checking in on his other tables, we had management stop by to check in on us and ultimately take our order.  I was impressed.  I could see the restaurant was very busy and had no problem waiting for the server to make his rounds but it was appreciated nonetheless. Our server Eric was attentive but not overzealous.  He took the time to check in on us but gave us plenty of space to celebrate our evening.  He was knowledgeable and gave us a few good recommendations but he was also able to loosen up and joke with us which made the evening more enjoyable.

We also had the bison burger, and while the establishment is known for crepes don't be afraid to order the burger, for it was delicious. My wife fought with me for more of the burger I'd ordered.

"After a long, impatient and tiring day at school, I decided to bag some Chipotle and call it a day. Supposedly, my friend was supposed to meet up with me in the school library but he over slept; when he woke up, he called me over and when he called me over, I just so happened to have my chipotle in hand ready to take the train back to brooklyn. So let's just say he got lucky for two things: 1. He caught me before I had no service and 2. On my way to his apartment, I spied Cafe Himalaya. After I became such a huge foodie, I started searching yelp for good eats and woop dee doo, hellllllllo Cafe Himalaya. Based on the good reviews, I was expecting this place to be packed but to my surprise, I was the only customer. I ordered the ""momo"" chicken pan fried dumplings with the salad and 2 smoothies, the tropical sun and the peach lover. The peach lover was a delight! Better than the tropical sun in my opinion. It took them around 20 minutes thank god talking to the guy who took my order wasted some time or else my impatience would've gotten the better of me. The dumplings definitely had a unique taste to me although they can be evidently similar in taste and looks when compared to typical dumpling shops (besides its shape). I still wonder why the meat is a bit yellow but nonetheless, besides a little twang in its taste, nothing else was that special about them. I definitely wouldn't mind stopping by here again on a beautiful sunny day, maybe then there'll be more customers so I can spy on the popular dishes every one is ordering. :-)","[1.0, 0.0]"

My wife and I try to eat here whenever we get the chance.  The food is fantastic and the service is top notch.  Just like the old school Italian restaurants the owner walks around and greets just about every table.  After only a few times in there he greeted us remembering that we didnt have our kids with us the last time.   Two dishes which I can highly recommend are thesSalmon and the veal amalfi.   Just remembering that my wife booked a small lunch time party for a friend and the service was great.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Holy Hell are these beauts delicious. Fresh lobster piled high on a perfectly toasted, buttered roll. There was just enough mayo to taste, but was applied sparingly to allow the flavor of the lobster to shine through. The roll is topped off with some melted butter and you're left with a sweet, meaty, buttery masterpiece. A combo will set you back about $17, which includes a lobster roll, pickle spear, bag of chips, and a soda-- an insanely good price considering the excellent quality. We also tried the New England Clam Chowder and it perfectly complemented it's lobster companion. It was thick and creamy and was chock full of giant clam chunks! There is no table service but the girl that was working the register the night we went was incredibly personable and was a pleasure to interact with. The inside of Luke's is charming. A nautical theme reigns supreme with wood furnishing and metal pipe details. I loved it. I will definitely be showing my face again here soon to get my lobster on.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My visit to this restaurant yesterday managed to effectively ruin my appetite. I was there with 5 friends and we took up three small tables. There was a small line waiting so the waitresses kept pushing us to order faster. After doing so they said that we had not ordered enough as they wanted each one of us to order one of the lunch specials. One waitress declared that she would give us 15 minutes to eat. When they brought out my soup it was filled half way in an obvious attempt to kick us out quickly. They also ""forgot"" our drinks. The food (especially the pad Thai) made me wish that they had saved some of their sweetness for their staff. Being a group of teenage girls DOES NOT mean that they can treat us less than other paying guests.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First things first, if you are going for dinner then make a reservation. This place is popular and rightly so! The food here is superb. I've read other reviews that mention the paninis. So fresh, so tasty, so amazing! The bread is also homemade, which you can feel. If you're going for the whole nine yards then get a nice salad and try the Burrata Cheese as an appetizer, it is divine. For entrée I would wholeheartedly recommend the Spinach and Ricotta Gnocchi. There is nothing else like it within a 50 mile radius. It is that good! And finally, Gaia is just delightful. She puts her heart into every meal and it shows. On the only small downside, the service is a bit slow, but it's because they pour their heart out to make everything perfect.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Hole in the wall to say the least. Probably one of the smallest joints I've been to in town but great none the less. A free cup of coffee, pancakes, and a side of bacon for 5$. You can't beat that. Good food, friendly staff, and saving a few dollars is 2 thumbs up in my book!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"During the warm season in particular, when the huge yard out back is open, Roberta's is a pretty wonderful dining experience, to be frank. You can plunk down with a group of friends at a large table outside, or in the airy indoor dining room, knock back a couple brewskies and generally chill -- and it's good that the atmosphere is so laid-back, because you'll probably have a lot of time to ""chill"" while waiting for your meal. That said, once your pizza arrives, it'll be perfectly cooked, with a light and toasty crust and ingredients that are unusually fresh and flavorful. Do note these pies aren't cheap, but if you consider you're getting quality ingredients (see: vegetable garden on premises, no kidding), you may be able to justify the price, especially if you're here to mark a special occasion and not just to sop up a hangover on a Saturday. Don't waste Roberta's on a hangover pizza fix. It's unfortunate, then, that I can't bring myself to patronize Roberta's this summer, on account of the restaurant's new-ish policy of hiring unpaid ""interns"" to staff its urban farm. (Here, let me fill you in: bushwickdaily.com/2013/0…) I've spent my career working in the media, where the exploitive practice of taking free labor and passing it off as an educational experience is far-flung and cancerous enough as it is, and to see ""intern culture"" spread to the food service industry (where I've also worked, and worked really hard, because working at a restaurant is almost always hard work) is simply horrible. I know it costs a lot of money to operate an urban farm. I always expected that's why Roberta's ""artisanal"" (or whatever) pizzas were overpriced. But if you run a wildly successful restaurant and there's no room in your business model to pay for the labor you need to properly farm your garden, maybe you don't deserve to have a garden of your own.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We went on Saturday night with a group of six. We had reservations and were seated right away. While this made me happy, I agree with eveyrone else that this place was not busy by any means for a Saturday night. Also agree that wine list was lackluster. We ordered the special appetizer, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and prosciutto. It was HUGE and really, really delicious. It was $16 and probably would not have ordered it if I saw it and the price on the menu, but it was absolutely worth it. Just make sure you share. The cheese and prosciutto were very high quality. My boyfriend got the pasta e fagioli. I had some and it was very good. A tad much black pepper, but hearty, hot and yummy nontheless. I ordered chicken parmigiana (boring I know, but I love tomato sauce). It was good. I asked for more sauce and it came out immediately. For dessert I got a lemon tart that was lovely. My boyfriend got red velvet cake that he did not like which was a disappointing way to end the night. But overall I enjoyed myself and the food and so did everyone else.","[1.0, 0.0]"
You would expect a BBQ place to have the aroma of BBQ but not this place which was my first warning. I tried the rib/wing combo $10. The ribs had no flavor & had the texture as if they were boiled.  The rib sauce was more like ketchup & stayed on my tongue for another hour after the meal. The wings were not much better also flavorless.  I ordered spicy which was not the case. Hands down me & my buddy agreed these were the worst ribs we ever ate.

As soon as we walk in we thought we wouldn't be able to sit because we didn't have reservations and the place was packed. However, the staff was cordial and told us it wouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. After we sat we ordered the sangria pitcher which is delicious! For appetizers we shared the Salpicao, this flavorful Brazilian salad with shredded chicken and ham, yummy! For main course I had the Bobo de Camaroa, sorry can't spell the name of the dish, but what does matter, it was simply great. My husband went for the Picanha, and he was extremely satisfied and happy with his choice. Then came dessert. Our daughter tried the passion fruit mousse, which is unique and very delicious. Our experience couldn't have been complete without the excellent service we were given, the staff was attentive, friendly and prompt. Even with the restaurant being so busy, we never felt neglected.

"Second attempt at Spice 28: delivery via Dining In. An order of dan dan noodles, spicy cucumbers, dry pepper chicken and hot sauce style chicken came to just over sixty bucks, including a tip for the driver. All I could think was that dinner had better be good, for the price of dining out. I will say that the delivery time was on point, and only about forty-five minutes, which is on the low end for Philly. Props for that.   The food was good, but I think the prices are a bit steep, especially for take-out. I remember thinking everything was such a steal when I dined in the restaurant. I'm wondering if that's just because I went with a huge group and we shared a bunch of plates? Either way, I liked our second meal from Spice 28 but I didn't love it as much as that first time. The hot sauce style chicken was not really my thing (intense peppercorn flavor in the sauce but no breading or crispness to the chicken), though I really enjoyed the dry pepper style chicken. It's hard to know what to order because the menu descriptions list the ingredients but not really anything about the preparation or cooking style. That would really help. The dan dan noodles were great, but the portion size was definitely smaller than Han's. Same with the spicy cucumbers. Sorry to compare the two yet again in this review but I feel like it's unavoidable. While I wish the prices for delivery were a little lower, I'd still probably order from Spice 28 again. I'm also looking forward to getting back to the restaurant sometime.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Num Pang. I never heard of this place until i saw a thing on BlackBoard Eats where you get a free 30% off coupon code. Obviously, i used it here. First off, this place is next to my 4th fave steakhouse, Strip House. Secondly, this place is a hole in the wall!. The place where you order, the main floor can fit like 4 people. There is an upstairs portion where you can eat, but I didn't check it out. The service here is pretty fast.. Unfortunately the prices are kinda hefty. I guess because when i think of Num Pang, i think of vietnamese banh mis. However, you are a fool to think that. The sandwiches are smaller length wise, but they are thicker here. In addition, the ingredients served here are top notch and much better than ones served at traditional banh mi sandwiches. Num Pang is like your high-end gourmet south-east asian sandwich shop. I ordered the grilled skirt steak sandwich and the five spiced pork belly. OMG AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. I took these to go, and pretty much i had to wait an hour before i ate them because i was waiting for my gf. It didn't matter. the food was still great. The bread got soggy, but i just toasted them back up, and it was AWESOME. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly to a medium. The veggies were fresh and added a nice crunch to the sandwich. THe amount of steak was a good amount, and it was marinated perfectly. The steak was so juicy. I couldn't get enough. The Five spice pork belly. OMG. THe pork belly was so fatty and juicy and yummy. The pickled asian pear that came with it was sour and sweet and helped cut the fattiness of the pork belly. It was perfect bliss. The 2 sandwiches were enough to fill us both. MMMMMMMM. Yes the prices sound a bit hefty, but it's well worth it. I def want to try their other sandiwches!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It's bougie, I get that. The ambiance is nice, the food is good, the patrons are presentable... but still: OVERPRICED ALERT. Let me explain... Now. I'm definitely not a novice when it comes paying a pretty penny for a great meal BUT $14 for their peach cobbler cocktail? Yes, it did taste exactly like a peach cobbler and yes, it was delicious but um, where was the rum?! I was left wondering if there was even any alcohol in my drink at all! For the amount of alcohol in this drink I would say a fairer price would've been $9. Plus - this is BROOKLYN, not Manhattan, people.. It may sound petty but those $4-5 extra they charge for this makes a different in my mind. Make your drinks a LOT stronger and I'll be fine with paying $14 for it next time. I think the entrees are also priced a few dollars more than they should be, because it's not like the portions are all that generous and it's also not like the food is mind-blowing although it IS good. $18 fried chicken & red velvet waffles is a creative idea and it was good but the waffles were a little more of a pancake-y than the traditional waffle (which I actually liked, but my boyfriend didn't). I've had an $18 fried chicken & waffle dish at another place (in manhattan, but I won't name where because this is not their review)  where the portion was HUGE, the waffle itself was to die for, and the fried chicken was unbelievable crispy on the outside-juicy on the inside (not exactly the case at SoCo, although their fried chicken is not 'bad' by any means). The $24 lobster shrimp and grits was actually VERY good -- it came with 3 shrimp, 1/2 a lobster tail, and the best grits I've ever had (though I've only had grits maybe three times in my life). If this dish came with just 1 more shrimp/more grits I would've said the pricing for this one was reasonable. All said, if it wasn't for the ridiculous upcharge of everything I probably would have given this place 4 stars. I'd still recommend it though - but I do suggest going at night rather than during the day (i've been here twice), since the scene is much more alluring and therefor a better value for your money: dim lights, a live electric violinist.. definitely a good place for a date.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The most delicious home cooking you've ever eaten out! We were there on Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving) for breakfast and in spite of the crowds, were seated in about 15 minutes. In the past, I've had their blueberry pancakes which come overloaded with berries. Today I ordered a simple egg, the best turkey bacon I have ever eaten and a cup of creamy grits and *real* fresh-squeezed orange juice. My husband ordered creamed chipped beef on toast and said it was great. The woman next to me ordered french toast which I think I may get next time. The vanilla and cinnamon smell was intoxicating--not to mention it arrived slathered in powder sugar and butter. Always a *must* visit when you're in Philly.

"Very, very good, and very, very interesting. Beer-based macaron with caviar filling? Check. I've only eaten at one other Michelin rated restaurant, and that was the former 3 star Robuchon in Las Vegas (it's no longer ranked, but I've heard not because it was stripped, but because Michelin no longer writes a guide for Vegas). Atera is ""only"" a two star, but in terms of technical skill I feel Atera completely blows away Robuchon, while being a better deal as well. As is normal for creative foods, you may not *love* everything, but you'll be hard pressed not to recognize the creativity and artistry. There was really only one item that I thought was lacking - the heart of palm with bone marrow ragout, but the rest were pleasant or interesting surprises. I'll have to post up the menu later, but there were far more tastings than I thought. At around tasting #7, I thought I had made a terrible mistake, thinking that I had overpaid and that the meal was soon coming to an end. Nope. By tasting 15, I was getting pretty full, but it keeps on going well into the 20s! Service was excellent. The restaurant is cleaned every 3 hrs or so, and it's just very cool to watch the staff do their thing. Disciplined, like a fine, precision watch. After the meal, I was invited to tour the downstairs kitchen, where there is another set of staff that do prep. After nerding out over the chef's copy of The Modernist Cuisine, I nerded out over the overhead heavy duty, reeled power cables, and the racks and racks of Oxo-housed ingredients. Definitely cool.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This has been hands down one of my worst dining experiences in Park Slope.  I've been here 3 times.  The first two times the food was thoroughly mediocre and the price was pretty high.  The last time, the food was just awful, including the salad.  IMHO it's pretty hard to make a bad salad, but Blue Ribbon managed it.  I kept going back because this place always gets great reviews and some of my friends like to go, but after my last experience, I'm never going again.  Not only was the food bad but the service was slow.  They brought out cold food intermittently, didn't want to answer basic questions about meals (my GF has a nut allergy and trying to find out if a dish had nuts in it was painful), and took forever.  (The bus boy filling up water glasses was great though).  I had the hanger steak and it was awful.  Started with a goat cheese salad which not only was terrible, but the portion was ludicrously small.   There were literally 4 small lettuce leafs on the plate.  My GF had some kind of pepper shrimp appetizer that she ate as an entree and even though it was small, she didn't bother finishing it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hamburgers, Shakes , Beer, Music, Girls- Would that be something that you would be interested in? ... Well I am, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Went on a Saturday night and it was very busy this tells me I'm on to something. Ordered a P.Y.T. burger and onion rings. I was expecting for it to be a minute or two but I took the time to enjoy the views. Understand what the server went through based on some reviews because I could hardly find my own table when I returned from the bathroom, and the other people jumping from table to table looked like they wanted to play hide and seek from the waitress. Anyway the burger was amazing and the rings tasted like delightful little laser beams touching my lips ( really good). Unfortunately the only shake I had was when I was killing it on the dance floor, another bonus here because I can loose some of those cals and make room for the alcohol.

"If you suffer from a major salt deficiency and  you're having a medical emergency this is the place for you! For about $100 Bucks you'll get the same amount of nutrition and enjoyment as you would from a  piece of rock salt available from any fine equine feed store for $2 bucks. We ordered two entree's, a salad and a side dish. Presumably there was a little food mixed in with the salt, but if so, it was so well disguised by the salt (and sugar) that it was impossible to discern what exactly it might have been. Luckily they ply their patrons with overpriced liquor, so most of them probably attribute the stomache aches and blinding morning-after headaches to hangovers instead of the additives. This joint is yet another attempt at trendiness in the the most tragically unhip little town in America. It takes a lot more than simply snapping pictures of the interiors of restaurants in Los Angeles or New York, then replicating them with similar sounding names, in the hopes that customers in 'the provinces' won't notice the lousy food. Far and away the worst dining experience we have had in this town - quite an achievement! There's more honor in mugging people than taking money off them by hawking  this sort of junk - at any price.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place gets credit for creativity: they took something uniquely Korean -- rice on ""ssam"" or lettuce with beef -- and made it a trendy, choose-your-ingredients dish. The Bibb Lettuce Ssam that I ordered was decent and the red kimchi puree was not gross as I had envisioned it to be. It was just soft ground-up kimchi that still retained the spiciness. I don't think red beans go well in ssam, in my opinion, and the tofu puree, while interesting because of its oddness, just looked and tasted like bland mayonnaise. Seating is limited there and the long tables are not open on each end -- meaning, you can pull up an extra stool to only one end of the table because the other end is a wooden board. What was lacking in condiments was the absence of gochu jang, or hot pepper paste, which make ssam truly and pleasantly spicy, more so than the sriracha sauce that was sitting at the utensil bin. The beef I had in my ssam was good enough, though, and I like the fact that the lettuce they gave you was palm-sized, not huge lettuce leaves that you have to split in half to fit in your mouth. I can see this place lasting for a little while, but it needs to liven up its ingredients & condiments to be a great establishment.","[1.0, 0.0]"
It was a NewPort Mall day in Jersey City. On our way we saw traffic build up going into Manhattan.. So we decide after a few hours mall shopping some good sustanence at Seabra Marisqueira was in order. Off to Newark to 'Little Lisbon'  I love this place. The food is hearty and delicious. I am into 'seasonal foods' I love the 'dry' soup but that is a winter food so we ordered a seafood dish in a light tomato base. and watercress salad.  Can you say I am in heaven.

"I have to say I'm a fan of this place; the staff are trying, REALLY REALLY trying to make the dining experience enjoyable despite having to run around like chickens with their heads cut off. I was in there maybe a month ago on a Thursday night with a craving for sushi while my laundry was drying at Spin Cycle Café (a cool laundromat you should try).  I was surprised that all but one table was full and there were about 12 tables in the place.  I chose to sit at the sushi bar because I was alone. I was given a menu right away upon seating by the waitress, but I was forced to wait about 15 min. before she could come back to take my order. The reason why?  In a restaurant with about 30 dining patrons, a ringing phone, and a steady stream of customers coming in for take away meals, they had ONE SERVICE PERSON!  Excuse me, but ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!?!?  That's right, they have only one person working as a hostess, waitress, cashier, and telephone operator.  That's pretty outrageous and it doesn't speak well upon the owners.  It fell upon her to seat customers, take orders, bring the food out, refill drinks, bus the tables, answer the phones for takeaway orders, and cash out the customers.  Most restaurants use 2-3 people to do these tasks. After the 15 minute wait, I ordered the Seattle Roll and an order of veggie tempura.  The Alaska Roll was great and was the best sushi I've had in the past year.  It had raw salmon, cucumber, shredded carrot, and avocado.  Everything tasted like it was of the highest quality.  No complaints about it whatsoever.   The veggie tempura was decent, but a little overcooked.  The batter on it was good, but I felt they fried the veggies for maybe a minute or two too long because they had lost their crispness.  They were a little soggy, but definitely not totally saturated in oil.  They were passable, but not the best.  I've found that Chinese restaurants fry their veggies the best; they are almost always al dente in Chinese-American cuisine. However, I cannot give this place a 5-star rating because of the service.  The girl working as a server here was very efficient and nice, so this criticism is not of her, but of the owners of the place.  It took about 25 minutes after I entered before the sushi entrée was brought out because there is only so much one server can do when she has so many tasks to bear at once.  With one more server I`m sure it would have been cut in half.  Sushi doesn`t take that long to prepare. I felt sorry for the girl and on my way out I asked her if it was normal for her to have to do all of these duties at once or if someone had called out sick.  She said she had to do this every night.  I have a strong sense of empathy and she seemed to be trying to make the best of it and put on a happy face but I could tell by the tone of her voice and her facial expressions she was overwhelmed.  She did as well as could be expected. HIRE MORE SERVERS!  They are trying but one person is not enough!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here for the first time over the weekend.  Lived in williamsburg for years but rarely ventured into Greenpoint. I have to say I am a HUGE fan of the lobster claw spicy bloody mary.  The lobster eggs benedict was delicious, but sadly accompanied by a over dressed yet bland salad. The bus staff were pushy in trying to get us to leave, which put a damper on our groups brunch. Still, the food and beverage were so good I would definitely go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Honestly, its a bit overrated. I mean the food is good, not going to lie. But the way everyone raves about the soup dumplings makes it seem as if its the greatest soup dumplings mankind has ever made. The soup dumplings are good, a bit small, but good. Nothing too fancy. The sauce that came with it was a little strong for me, but everyone has their own preferences. The restaurant was definitely cramped since its so popular. I was a bit disappointed that my friends and I had to situate ourselves in the same table as another couple. Kind of awkward and not too pleasant of an experience. Their food in general is pretty good if you're looking for a more authentic Chinese food tasting experience. But don't be hyped up coming in about the soup dumplings or you may be disappointed.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here for the Mesibah dinner with the roasted lamb shoulder last year. Lamb shoulder itself was good but did not live up to the rave reviews I'd read of it -- I'd been expecting excellence.  Some parts of lamb were very tender and nice, other parts of the shoulder were on the dry side.  It's a huge portion of lamb.  The rice that it came with, however, was totally dry and undercooked -- inedible. Crispy Haloumi with date paste was great!  Love that date paste. Fried cauliflower was good -- wonderful yogurt sauce. Smoked sable with fried egg and challah was okay -- too salty for me. Hummus with laffa was good.  Laffa bread was especially great. The salatim - selection of 8 little salads was nice to try, but it's quite a small portion of each thing.  My faves were the double cooked eggplant and the red beet-sesame paste.  Absolutely delicious!  The rest were solid but nothing special.  I probably wouldn't choose to order this unless you're satisfied with just a little sample -- you end up getting a lot of okay stuff, and not enough of the stuff you like. Restaurant has nice lighting and decor.  The tables are a little crowded together, though.  It's not as quiet as I'd like it to be.  Service was warm and friendly. A great dining experience in general.  I'd look forward to going back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Believe it or not there is a definitive bar for halal cart street meat in the city and this is THE place.  When someone mentions 53rd and 6th, you either know it or you're immediately introduced. Stand in line (even when it's 4 AM), pay $6 and your only choice is chicken, lamb, or combo and white sauce, hot sauce.  If you have extra time, you can even observe how a single business (halal cart) inspires an entire economy to serve the needs created by that business (competitor halal carts, beverage carts, taxi lines, etc). Oh, and be warned, I personally love spicy food but their hot sauce is really, really hot.  Be judicious and go easy with it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Devil's Alley strikes you at first as a fun spot to go for some drinks and bbq.  I decided this last Sunday to give it a run for brunch.  The menu comes across as spicy and greasy with fun drinks to go with.  Once we finally got our servers attention we ordered the shrimp hash with andouille sausage and chorizo scramble with grilled tomatoes.  I can be a little tough on service sometimes but I would have to say this took the cake.  Not only was our server rude and unavailable, she seemed wildly irritated with a nice server that filled our long empty coffee.  The food came under-seasoned and overcooked, though pleasantly hot and greasy.  We finished with full stomachs from the large portions.  The mediocre food was the only saving grace for our terrible service.  Our server only appeared to drop the check.  Once we had paid she only reappeared to tell us she had given the wrong check which she through down and walked away.  We will visit again, but probably just stick to the bar.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Manu's is at the heart of the Ironbound, close to all the best bars & lounges in town, BUT disappoints me every time I go there!  The sushi is overpriced & honestly not that good.  I LOVE sushi, have it quite frequently, but haven't yet tried anything here that amazed me.  The one thing I probably liked the most was the shumai. The drinks are not very good either...I tried 2 different mojitos & another fruity drink. Service tends to be super slow.  The staff is nice though, I must admit. The best part of Manu's is definitely their ambiance.  In my opinion, it's the ONLY thing they have going for them.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Everything a Belgian pub should be plus hipsters.  It helps that the owner seems to hale from Brugge (according to the menu).  Their beer offerings are second to none.  (I highly recommend the sour ales, especially duchess since it's on tap).  Between Monk's and Eulogy, I ultimately can't decide which is better in Philly.  The mussels tend to be ever so slightly tastier at Monk's and the drink selection and prices better at Eulogy.  You can't go wrong with either though.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I didn't try much, but what I did have was great.  I got the mint lemonade by a recommendation of a friend.  I don't usually like lemonade but this was really quenching especially for the hot weather that day.  No overly acidic bite to it. I also got the poached egg on a grilled tomato and haloumi.  It was delicious.  My poached egg was a little over cooked (I like mine runny), but my friend who ordered the same thing had hers cooked just fine.  A little inconsistency, but it's okay.  The grilled tomato and haloumi were both delicious pairings to the egg.  And that green shashouska (sp?) dolloped on top is deliciously savory.   All in all this is a pretty cute restaurant.  Very clean, very bright.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
The food and music here is awesome. The price for what you get is just right..same for the portions.

"I needed a place to stop for a quick and cheap dinner before a movie, so after some quick Yelping I came across Nanzhou. Glad I did! The place is pretty small, but has also been uncrowded every time I stopped in. The menu basically just consists of appetizers and soup, but the options within are varied. I've only been twice and ordered the duck once, and oxtail once, both with the hand drawn noodles (as opposed to shaved). Both were excellent! Big piles of thick and imperfectly cut noodles in the middle of a big bowl of broth surrounded by hunks of meat still on the bone and topped with scallions and some vegetable that looked like celery but had a pickle flavor. (Sorry, don't know my exotic veggies very well, but it was a great addition.) They also have Sriracha chili sauce which I love adding to give it a kick. My method is basically to get chopsticks in my right hand, spoon in left and just scoop up whatever I can get with either one. This can lead to a bit of a mess but it's well worth it. Tasty and filling soup that hits the spot when you want something wholesome and hearty. Super cheap, fast service, and air conditioning so you can enjoy it year round.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ok, but just Ok. We arrived around noon on a Saturday.  The place is huge, so it seemed empty.  They sat us a hi-top 4-top near the bar.  We waited for the waitress to come so we could order drinks.  And waited.  And waited.   One of our party went over to where the waitresses were standing around nattering amongst themselves.  They ignored him, and he ran away.  The bartender curtly told us he would send over our waitress when we tried to order from him.  I guess he did because not long thereafter (by the geologic-time they use to pace service here) a waitress arrived.   After that, things moved tolerably well.  We still got left hanging a few times, but it was bearable.  The food was decent, the interior is nicely-done, and the beers they make are ok.   With a little better service, this place could be really great.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've had Dos Toros several times and to be honest, it's pretty similar to Chipotle. Its only redeeming quality is that the food seems a little fresher (the rice and beans especially).

And since the portions are always too big for one person, I usually bring a friend, load my plato to to brim with salsas and guacamole and then use tortilla chips to share it like a dip.

"Nolita is officially my new favorite neighborhood.  Why you ask?  Because of Rubirosa. When we arrived on Wednesday afternoon, around 1pm the place had plenty of customers, but we were still able to score a nice table in the 2nd room.  The first has a big ol beautiful wood bar top and several 2-person high-top tables.  The back room has an open-air feel that allows you to take a look at the pizza being made.  And the middle room is just right with a long row of banquet seating divided into a few tables.  The entire restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and charming décor. Our waiter popped over as soon as we sat down to start us off with drinks.  A few minutes later we placed our lunch order.  Up first - meatballs!  3 huge (veal/pork/beef) balls covered in tomato sauce for $10.  Rubirosa's meatballs are top notch.  Loved every bite. After we finished off the balls our pizza arrived - large, half Bianca, half Supreme and completely scrumptious.  The Bianca Pizza is an amazing combo of ricotta/mozzarella/parmigiano and baked up to a bubbly golden brown... and on the other side- the Rubirosa Supreme - tomato/mozz/pepperoni/ mini meatballs/ roasted garlic.  Ah-mazing combo and the sprinkle of fresh basil was the perfect topper.  I wouldn't hesitate to order this exact combo again. Service was good, food was excellent.  I have nothing bad to say Rubirosa.  Cannot wait for another lunch-time visit.  Rumor has it they have slices available for lunch too.... best believe I'll be picking up one soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went there recently with the most interesting person in the world - no, not the fellow from the dos equis ads, but my lovely date and S.O.  We had heard and read rave reviews and have had to cancel several reservations at the last minute in the past so we were excited to finally try Modo Mio.  Got there, let our workdays slip away, sat down in the lively and attractive room, and it all went downhill from there. In reviews I generally expect myself to discuss the food and the dishes, but I just do not see the point.  This was not an off or even bad night.  The problems were in the flavors, the design of the dishes, the choices made long before the cooks showed up that morning.  In light of all the fabulous reviews of this place all I can think to say is WTF (and no, I do not use abbreviations like that regularly) is everyone thinking?  Seriously, WTF?  I guess there must be folks with an appetite for their food who they are catering to.  Certainly ain't me.

"I don't have a yelp account. I didn't (!) until right now! That's how moved I was by our experience. We sat and waited a while to be seated, which was fine. The most magical part of our lunch was our server. She first arrived to drop the specials board and lean it on the table next to us, which we both thought was a joke and then realized later definitely was not. She didn't point out the brunch specials board--which was unfortunate, since I didn't see it until after we ordered, and had some stuff that sounded great (cinnabun pancakes!) They were out of the soup (thanks). Wildly inconvenienced by our presence, she somehow managed to withstand our company while taking our order. Once the food came (which, in the kitchens defense, was good), she disappeared, never to return, until she took our plates after we had been waiting for some time to get the check. Here comes my favorite part: we had already discussed how awful the service was, how cold and rude the server was, and that we, people who have both worked in the device industry and NEVER leave less than 15-20% tips, would reward her with what she deserved: barely 10. When you use a card to pay for the check, it's run through a little tablet, which the server brought to our table. You're then made to select 15, 20, or 25% tip. Nope, nope, NOPE. This would've been okay to customize if she hadn't been STANDING OVER THE TABLE WATCHING. It was horribly, horribly awkward, unprofessional, and just....awful. She threw the card down on the table and said ""have a good day"" with some of the most impressive levels of disdain and sarcasm I've seen. Decent food, some of the worst service I've ever experienced in my life.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm not one for ramen shops or noodle bars, primarily because I think that I make a great home made ramen and find it hard to justify paying so much for it but this is the first time I was surprised, amazed and left longing for more when done with my meal.  I've tried Momofuku Noodle Bar (HUGE disappointment), Totto and Setagaya before finally finding this gem.  All were quite disappointment for a multitude of reasons.  I had pretty much given up on trying any more ramen spots but since my wife is such a ramen lover, she brought me to Minca and it was an amazing revelation.  The place is small, the service is great and the kitchen staff all greet their customers coming and going.  I ordered the spicy ramen and it was spectacular.  Not too salty, just enough spiciness, and the noodles were perfectly al dente.  The pork, mushroom and other garnishes were fantastic.  Bottom line, I think I'm probably the hardest person to please when it comes to paying nearly $13 for ramen but Minca has given me a reason to look forward to eating ramen outside my own home.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The first 2 times I ordered take out, the food was delicious, fresh and definitely worth the money I spent. This time I ordered something different and had it delivered and it was not even edible. I ordered the spring rolls, which are basically a mush of breading and overcooked cabbage. I also ordered sesame chicken and fried rice. The rice was the only thing I ate because the chicken was filled with breading, and compeletely soggy and once you remove all that, the chicken was so hard I couldn't even chew it. Sesame chicken is supposed to be lightly coated and crispy. I am so disappointed.  And the worst part is, there is no manager available to talk to about this, only a kid who answers the phone!

"Best sushi in the world bar none! I just sit at the bar and let Chef Yasuda take over. Each piece is a morsel of heaven in your mouth. Nothing is ordinary. Sometimes there are 5 types of yellowtail and each is different. I think I must break omakase etiquette because when the chef decides it's over and I'm not full, I ask for more. After all it's not prix fixe like the overrated Masa. Can't comment on the service because the chef does all the work and some waiter brings you tea and that's it. They are obsessed with time: will you be able to finish in an hour and a half? (on the phone). I was late because the taxi driver was a moron so they docked my time. Also it is helpful to kiss Yasuda's ass to get the best sushi and his attention. He does serve the pieces quite fast which diminishes the enjoyment and again is designed to increase turnover.

"Hi, My name Hinoria & I from Japan to write great review about Devil Alley Bar & Girls. First time I come to the Philadelphia city, I stopped in the Devil's Alley very hungry for American like food and pork like foods. I order the bisquit sliders and the pulled pork sandwitch for my wife. So sweet was the sauce and smooth and silky. The pork meat melted in my mouth so warm and tender, like baby bottom=) The bread rolls between the pork & bisquit sliders was also so fresh and so tasty, YUm in my tummy=) this something we not say in Japon. Next, we have ah the slaw. Yes, the coal slaw. Again, very filled with ah the vegetables and sesame seed dressing. Perfect, went like a shock matches a shoe sorta, what I mean is that the slaw compliment perfect the slider rolls. Next, I order the beer on the tap. I think it was a pumkin or squash season beer. Very different that Asahi, but smooth all the same. Kind of hurt my throat a bit, because of the bubbles. Next, I order another beer, something from the city. Maybe called Yards or not, I am not recall properly. This beer kind of make me feel a little sexy. The beer made me very happy & so I kiss my wife right in front of people. I never had the beer make me feel like a little funny in the trouser area. Whatever as you American might say. Who cares right? Next, we ordered a duck quesodilda. I think duck, maybe it was a chicken quesodilda. Still good. Cheese yellow, but taste like milk. This was different to me, the duck with the cheese smashed with onions and peppers. Make me want to drink tequila, but wife said no. I might want to kiss her again... or  even make baby when we get to hotel later. Ha ha, I say to her. Last I think maybe we ordered the desert plate. Some chocolates. Nice. The waitresus very nice & something little sexy with a smile. Next time I come to the city Philadelphia, i know with or without wife, I come to the Devil's Alley. This time, I drink the tequila and make love to the bar stool.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I luckily came when there was no line, but even if there was a line I would wait on it cause its just that good!  If you havn't been here yet, you need to get here ASAP..","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Vegan Pizza? Gluten Free Pizza? Yah, that got that here and it's all pretty decent. It's not a huge space but it's big enough for a little pizzeria - before deciding on Backstage Pizza we tried to go to some other restaurants and they all had over an hour wait to be seated.. The staff was friendly and the pizzas came out quick. Thin crust, fresh veggies, overall good pies - not new haven or new york style, kind of unique. Good to have another option in West Hartford.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Bought a groupon for this place and figured I'D give it a shot. The ambiance is this place is very nice, chairs are quite comfortable and waiters are very friendly as well as willing to recommend any of their favorite menu items. We ordered the SHREDDED BEEF STUFFED IN PLANTAIN CUPS for an appetizer and for the entree we ordered FRIED PORK CHUNKS. My entree was the best part; the pork was soft and flavorful. For dessert we had GUAVA SHELLS. Guava shells are pieces of guava with cream cheese or ice cream. Very usual combo but the taste was great. The combination of the two things was very appealing to my taste buds....","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I don't know how this place stays packed every single night.  We came on Valentine's night and were extremely disappointed on how everything is DROWNING in olive oil.  3 days later I am still disappointed and below are all the reasons. The hour and a half wait was not bad since I placed my name and went back to my gf's house around the corner.  Totally not worth the wait if you do not live near by. Apps: Bread- Tasty, but nothing special Grilled Octopus- This place is the only place that knows how to tenderize octopus.  It came floating submerged in olive oil.  I can't imagine how much it absorbed.  Terrible flavor. Entrees: Pork Kebabs-  Hardly satisfactory taziki, somewhat hard Grilled Baby Shark- By far the best part of the dinner.  Nicely grilled, good flavor. Sides: Lemon potatoes- I still cannot imagine how people can rave about these.  Using the plate of lemons on the table, we made them better. Horta- It felt like someone was gagging me with terrible tasting leaves soaked in olive oil.   Service was good, but annoying tip policy. I am glad I did not bring my off the boat Greek friend here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I preface this in all my vegan restaurant reviews but again, im not vegan. My sister and I went hiking and got back to the city looking to FEAST. Fortunately for us, Yelped pulled through once again and pointed us in the direction of Champs. Took the L to Lorimer and it was a really short walk to champs. Their decor is cute- quintessential 50s diner set up and they have outdoor seating, too. We didn't want to wait so we opted to sit outside. We ordered the Drunken Cowgirl, the Cuban Sandwich, and the red velvet pancakes. The Drunken Cowgirl was DELICIOUS. The best tofu scramble Ive had (I think I will start eating tofu scramble over regular eggs now it inspired me so much.) The chili was hearty and had a great kick to it. The toast was prefect compliment and the pieces of avocado really balanced it out. The cuban sandwich got pretty close to the real thing. I think Ill stay carnivore on this one but it was a good substitute. My vegan sister was tearing up because she has not been able to taste a cuban sandwich in a long time. But the star of our feast--the Red Velvet Pancakes. WOW. We got the portion of 3. Light and great flavor. The put these decadent chocolate chips on top and tasty whip cream on the side ( think I might like their vegan version of whip cream more!) The girls sitting at the table next to us kept staring at the plate and asked what we ordered. We definitely encouraged them to order these pancakes. They're great for break fast or dessert. ALSO, I experienced some of the best service Ive had in a while there. The waitress was super chill. We told her we were going to be sharing the dishes and she brought out on extra dish for us without asking. She refilled our bottle of water and was attentive without being overbearing. Even charismatic with us. Im SUCH a fan of this place. Recommending it to everyone. ALSO, BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY. WIN. One thing that I didnt like but wont dock a star for-- the delivery people were hanging out on the bench next to the outdoor seating just smoking away, putting their bikes right on the fence next to where we were seated (there was space on the bike racks right across from us but wanted to lay their bikes right were we are) and kept just blabbing on about the tips they were going to make. I couldve done without the smoke wafting in my direction and the slamming of the cycles against the metal fence right next to me.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The location is right near Times Square, the service is friendly, the range of food options are good and the prices are reasonable for this area. It lost one star rating due to the fact that when I had breakfast there my potatoes tasted and looked like they had been sitting for a while; they were chewy, with lots of burnt parts. I told my waiter and he quickly replaced them with a hot and fresh batch and these tasted great. My waiter was Sean and he was friendly and attentive. My husband had tried their cheeseburger for lunch and he thoroughly enjoyed it and rated it the same as me.

"THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  Rude owner/manager.  They had a large party (sports team and parents) from out of the area who took priority over everyone else in the restaurant.  The group was extremely loud.  We could barely carry on a conversation without raising our voices to each other.  Our meals took 1 1/2 hours to be served.  The waiter, however, was excellent - apologizing for the delay and trying to help make a bad experience better.  After waiting so long for the food, our group's consensus about the meals was that they certainly were NOT worth the wait.  While we were eating, some of the individuals from the large party finished their meals and began pitching quarters into their glasses, standing a few feet from their table.  That caused them to get even louder.  They were allowed to carry on like this without anyone saying anything to them.  When the volume got unbearable, we asked the waiter to get us the manager.  When the woman came to the table, she said she was also the owner, and told us she could get us a quieter table outside!  She said she would not ask them to quiet down as they were paying customers (and what were we??? we were a party of 7 - their party was larger, so I guess $$ was her priority)  We were courteous with our complaint, and certainly did not deserve the offer to be sat outside.  We were offered free deserts due to the 1 1/2 wait for our meals; however, they were stale!  The waiter was the only good thing about this experience.  We will NEVER go back to Zinna's!!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have been to this restaurant multiple times and have had delicious food on every visit. First, the restaurant is adorable-clean and cozy- and the wait staff is attentive. Food highlights for me have been a corn and shrimp summer soup that was out of this world. Light and full of flavor, I am not sure if this is always on the menu but it should be because I would order it every single time. Grandpa Tony's Escarole salad is a very bright tasting, simple, refreshing salad. Clams casino over angel hair pasta, basically all the ingredients used to make clams casino but in a saucy over pasta version-delicious and satisfyingly flavorful, so much more than a regular clam sauce. Lastly, the handmade cheesecake with strawberry balsamic sauce-Yummo is the first word that comes to mind! Definitely a must try!","[0.0, 1.0]"

It's a little hole in the wall in the middle of NYC's Chinatown, and sure, it does have handmade noodles, and sure, you can see them handmaking the noodles, but it was kind of disappointing. Nothing bad, but I think I was just expecting more from it. I've had handmade noodles in China, in Boston, and in the Chinese markets of LA and San Diego, and all of those were better than these. I think a large part of it was the way it was cooked- it was very greasy (the stir-fried ones) and the soup noodles were nothing spectacular.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Than they think they are being generous when they give you a small container of salsa with another small dish with a few chips. That's just a tease. If you want more, you have to pay for it. When I go to a Mexican restaurant, I expect Mexican food otherwise I can just go to one of those tex/mex places and be satisfied with that.

"Buddakan has so many things going for it that I couldn't figure out why it took me so long to get here.  First, it has been a top rated restaurant since it opened back in the late 90's.  Second, it consistently gets onto the ""must try"" restaurants on every foodie's list.  Thankfully I have now filled this food void in my own culinary CV! Atmosphere is very modern looking, almost stark if you don't count the giant Buddah.   My husband, not being a huge fan of Asian cuisine, left the menu up to me.  We started with the edamame dumplings which were simply divine.  The edamame was pureed finely into this delicate paste, the dumplings were very light and well seasoned.  The rock shrimp bao was also absolutely perfect!  We then split the curried cauliflower (INCREDIBLY GENEROUS PORTION HERE) and the spiced pepper beef.  Those beef cubes were enormous and coated in a delectable sauce.  The plates were aesthetically beautiful, too, which made it slightly hard for me to pull them apart for devouring (well, not too hard). Oh yeah, almost forgot, the chocolate bento box is to die for.  Totally share-able.  Though you may not want to. . . the lychee and passionfruit combos were delightful! The service deserves a major A+, too.  We had a great chat with the knowledgable bartender (who made me some very awesome cocktails).  Then we were ushered quickly to our seats by a very pleasant greeter and taken care of by a very nice waitress.   We enjoyed our meal, this was well worth the hype.  I took off one star not because the meal wasn't fabulous or anything, just that I don't know when we'd come back.  The menu isn't super extensive, there aren't too many other things I was dying to try, plus there are so many fantastic other places to eat in Philly.  Still, it is well worth a meal here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"L & B is always a fun place to stop off.  It's best feature is the super low stakes - you can always find a table in the outside seating area and the line for squares moves nice and fast, so you are pretty much guaranteed to be stuffing your face within a few minutes of arrival.   Now, let's be honest here -- describing the Sicilian squares as ""the best in the city"" or anything like that is misleading.  It's total junk food and somewhat inconsistent.  However, the way they've flipped the standard formula by dumping the sauce on top the cheese is brilliant, so what you get is a chewy, gooey, saucy mess.  Usually, it hits the spot, and if your piece sucks you can always toss it, get back in line, and try again. The counter inside for heros and salads and such can be pretty frustrating.  On a busy day you might end up waiting a half hour for their (delicious) pear salad or some other item you didn't realize would be back-ordered. And since everybody goes here the people watching is absolutely superb.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My buddy and I found this place after shopping at Ikea. Cute place, decent beer prices and if you love seafood go here. They only have a few choices for the non-seafood lover. Loved sitting outdoors with wonderful sun and great breeze from the water. Also, nice selection of hot sauces. The hostess and waitress were über friendly.  It was nice to feel so welcomed since the workers at Ikea were less than helpful.  I ordered the kids chicken fingers since I am not a fan of seafood. My friend was on the hunt for seafood and beer. The basket only came with one chicken finger and a bunch of fries. I know it was for kids but for $8 not worth it. My friend got fried belly clams and fries. He really enjoyed it and it was a good size portion.  They have seating indoors, rooftop and outdoors.

"My friend had a birthday dinner here for a group of 10. I wouldn't say this is the best place for groups since we were put at a table tucked in a corner between the bar and the wall. When people were sitting at the bar behind us, it was very tight as well as having little space between the stools. It was difficult to get in your seat and made it awkward for the servers to do things like refill our water. For appetizers, we enjoyed the flatbread and Mezetto Trio of dips. We ended up getting two orders of flatbread since there was way too much dip left yet. Of the dips, I think I liked the hummus the best but they're all great so I would get the trio. The falafel buns were phenomenal and big enough to share. I thought the margherita pizza wasn't anything special. I was super stuffed by the time our entrees arrived. I wasn't too impressed with the lamb burger but others were. I may have been too full to enjoy it. I would not recommend the gnocchi. The pasta was way bigger than the norm and resembled ravioli more than gnocchi. The sauce was good but the pasta is just too much. If coming with a small group, I'd recommend just doing a tapas style dinner only without entrees. For dessert, we got the creme brulee and the restaurant gave us the halva parfait on the house for the bday girl. Both were good but I couldn't get enough of the creme brulee. It was a little softer than your normal creme brulee but still delicious. Pretty noisy ambiance even in a tight space but the service was very welcoming and I don't have any complaints about the timing of the dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Honestly, the food and service is terrible.  One of the first downturns, was that my plate was dirty!  Two other people in my group also found them dirty!  After that instance, I couldn't trust their utensils and cups. Also the food wasn't delectable.  The calamari was salty, the lo mein was salty, the shrimp was dry, etc.  All I can do is complain about this restaurant.  I even found a piece of plastic in the spare ribs. The service as well seemed uncoordinated.  It took ages to get our bowls of rice, and it wasn't worth it.  The rice was dry and not fresh.  In fact, none of the food was fresh.  It didn't come steaming hot, it came cold.

"Despite the warnings about Di Fara's far-flung location, slow pizza-making, formidable lines and poor organization, it turned out to be incredibly simple to get pizza here. It was a straight shot on the Q from our hotel in Tribeca, and we were there in 30 minutes. We meant to line up before 12, when we thought they opened, but didn't make it there until around 12:50. Turned out they open at 1 on Sundays, and there was a modest line waiting for Di Fara to roll up the grate. The first few pies went to the groups ahead of us, and in no time we were at the front of the line, being offered slices from a steaming cheese pie. We had intended to order an entire pie ($28) but happily forked over $15 for three slices and ate them standing outside as a long line quickly formed. The sauce, blend of cheeses, drizzle of oil and scattering of basil atop a thin, chewy crust were just perfect. The crust's blackened bottom was imparted a beautiful charred flavor. Instant pizza at Di Fara - we felt like we had gotten away with something!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm shocked at the five stars of this place- La Marco is just OK, nothing extraordinary- nothing stands out, and on top of it all they are pricey for what they give you. They prob get all their cookies and stuff from bakeries in Brooklyn, sadly not even the best bakeries, just the average ones, then they sell you one for a dollar- total rip off. The bread is nothing special. The pastas are OK, but I came three times and each sauce I tried is sweet!! I am convinced they add sugar (a lot) to their sauce and a touch of cream, for a real Italian- not a good experience. Sorry guys. For being nice and having a nice selection of things to eat, cheeses, breads, veal dishes, etc. I gave them three stars but based on the food alone I would give two.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"got back from one of the worst dining experiences i've ever had at a japanese restaurant.  the soda was flat in all respects and warm.  my friend and i asked for water instead - it came back with floaters.  the fun doesn't stop there.  ordered the katsudon (which was piping hot, score??).  there was no taste to it unless you added soy sauce and then it just tasted like soy sauce - blech!  i will never go back there; let alone recommend it to anyone else.  i've had better japanese food at a strip mall than at this stand alone.  needless to say, don't waste your money here unless you like fruit flies lingering and poor food/drink offerings.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Something about the biscuit, canadian bacon, perfectly poached eggs, and the best creamy hollandaise sauce really works.  It also comes with a perfect tiny glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  A glass of orange juice that almost made me go out and buy a juicer!  The cappuccino is also good.   I have tried other brunch offerings from my companions' plates, but I will always find myself going back to the eggs benedict here.   Dinner here is decent. Many hearty pasta choices.  May be a good option for big groups. Service is eh.  Not the warmest staff but decent.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Passed this place a couple of times and noticed the line snaking out the door. Something in there has got to be good, right? Decided to stop by today to investigate. They sell ""sushi burritos"" which is essentially a whole sushi roll, wrapped up and cut in two like a burrito.  The place has very few seats so plan to take you food to go. They wrap it up in a cute little box for you.  I took mine to a shady park bench in Rittenhouse Square. I ordered the ""Crunch"" was a delicious combo of tempura shrimp, lettuce, cucumber, pickled mango, topped with some spicy mayo. It was just the right amount of crunch, freshness and spice! My only complaint is that the filling is a bit ""wet"" which made for a bit of a messy eating experience. The wrapping paper soaked through a bit and disintegrated at the edges. For a drink, I tried the hibiscus iced tea and liked it very much. Overall, a nice addition to take out lunch choices, especially for the health conscious!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I remember passing this place when I was visiting a friend at UPenn.  Before I met up with her, I looked inside the place.  Seemed like a pretty decent place since it was in a hotel and a lot of people were dressed up.  Looked like a pretty good place to eat  some freshly made noodle soup... And pretty good it was. I ordered the Taiwanese Noodle Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  Wanted to try something else, so i saw it on the lunch special menu.   Literally in 2 min, the food was at the table.  The soup, literally, started glistening...(no joke, i've never seen food light up like that, and no it AIN'T THE OIL). okay, okay. maybe it was the oil...but that's never a bad thing, for all the FOODIES out there. The beef stew was so tender, the moment you ate it, it would just melt to the sides of your cheeks.  the noodles were perfectly cooked with the right amount of elasticity... And the spiciness of the broth...perfect 10.

"What you get: - excellent sandwiches - brusque, perfunctory service from a somewhat surly owner, who may or may not be in the mood to talk to you. Brancaccio's is a small shop that makes a limited amount of their specialty ingredients, so keep in mind that you might have to settle for your  2nd choice of sandwich. At least, they never seem to have the caponata when I'm looking for it. It seems like most people order the ever-popular lard bread or BLT. IMO you could pick any sandwich that includes that delicious broccoli rabe and you wouldn't go wrong. The bread is always great - fresh and soft. These really are a step above the typical sandwich you'd get anywhere else in the neighborhood. It's a wee bit too pricey (and busy) for me to go every day but whenever I need a ""treat"" or lunch reward, it's straight to Brancaccio's I go.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went for our office holiday lunch, sight unseen. The ambience was quite comfortable but elegant. Our waiter was generally quite competent and polite, but we had one minor slipup. It was loud and he heard 'medium well' instead of 'rare' or else slipped when entering it. Either way, I didn't need to make a fuss or even find out what happened, I just mentioned it and he whisked it away, brought me a fresh plate in a matter of moments with a perfectly done rare steak in time for me to finish with everyone else, and it was all completely fabulous. That grace and quick action would have warranted 5 stars in itself. If I could give 6 stars I would, because in keeping with the best of the most expensive restaurants I've been to, the manager came the moment he saw I didn't have a plate in front of me, apologized profusely and quite sincerely to my ear, gave us a sizeable cut from our bill, and everyone involved was as polite as could be. And I assure you this was far from expensive in comparison to the service I received. I have absolutely no complaints, a minor and very reasonable hiccup showed us just how amazing this place's service really is.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Every Bahn Mi I've ever had before has been better, including the ones on Grand Ave, Bedford, and the ever awesome Num Pang on University and 12th St. I had a pork sandwich, and it was just horrid. The flavors were all good. The sauce, the pepper, the cilantro, bread and carrots were all just fine. The meat was the worst quality meat I've ever had in a Bahn Mi. A mouthful of gristle was in every other bite. The bites without the tendons and cartilage were yummy, but gack! I had a plateful of chewed up crap left on my platter when I was done.

"I was stoked to come back after a long 3-year hiatus.  Last time, I was at the Sheraton around the corner from this place so I tried the cart during lunch and dinner time and I think they are both good even though they are different carts (the one at night has no tomatoes).  The price is still the same, $6!   We came here for dinner after going to the Moma on Friday (FREE from 4p-8p on Fridays - Thank you Target sponsor!).  There was a line but it went quickly.  We sat on that building thing next to the cart and there were a lot of people sitting there alone or with friends despite the light rain.  We ate our leftovers later that night at the hotel and it was still good!  Combination plate is the way to go!  If you can't stand spicy, only get a little bit of the hot sauce for taste.  If you have a sensitive stomach, use the white sauce sparingly.       YOU MUST TRY ONCE on your trip to NYC!  Even if you're not hungry, come and split the dish with someone for a snack!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The manager was super friendly and even bought a few us birthday cake shots. They're so good! they even top them with whip cream...definitely recommend asking for it! The place got really crowded around midnight on Saturday (again though there was a b-day party being hosted there). The bar does take up half the space of the room.

"We made a reservation for six people at 8 PM on Saturday, March 12.  We arrived on time only to find folks who had 7 PM reservations waiting to be seated.  We were seated by 8:30. No waitress came to our table for twenty minutes.  It took another twenty minutes for the salad and appetizers to be brought to the table.  It's now 9:10. Dinner itself wasn't brought to the table until 10PM... 90 minutes after we were seated.  The waitress apologetically had brought us a second salad free while we waited. My pastichio was dried-out and browned from sitting under a heat lamp too long.  In contrast, my friends said their dinner was barely warm.  Apparently, the kitchen staff cannot keep up with the volume of orders. The hard wicker chairs, formerly from their Pitahari Taverna restaurant in Highland Park, NJ, has found a new home in the Monroe location.  They are very, very uncomfortable to sit on, especially for two hours. Our friends told us that if they had come by themselves, they would have cut their losses and left after thirty minutes. The long, long wait is a deficiency with the staffing and kitchen that's been occurring in their original Highland Park location and has been brought over to this new one in Monroe.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love Martha. It's one of the most beautiful restaurants in town-- fantastic ambiance, original and inspired meals and drinks, genuinely friendly, warm, and attentive staff, and never so busy that you can't get a table or have to scream across the table to be heard. I would have given it five stars except for this reason, and I hope that the owners are listening: I understand their reasoning behind changing from Brooklyn Sandwich Society, but I truly miss BKSS. I think it was a better restaurant then, for brunch anwyay. And Martha is a better restaurant at night. As a compromise, I would love it if at least the brunch had a better sandwich option than the ""breakfast cheeseburger"" or whatever it is. It's just a little overboard, and too large and too messy and greasy to enjoy as a sandwich anyway. It tastes good, but for breakfast, I'm just not really into it. At least do something else-- there used to be this merguez breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg on a delightful brioche bun and I could never get enough of that thing. Also, I miss the picked jalapeños that came standard with every table. Now you have to ask for them and I'm not even sure if they always have them anymore. And lastly, their menu has changed to almost be a menu of nothing but dishes inspired from China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam. I like that they borrow ideas and techniques from those cuisines, but their menu is almost becoming a fancy Chinese restaurant more than anything. I miss some of the more New American options they once had on the menu; at least to have some variety. If I want Chinese food, I'd rather just go to a nice Chinese restaurant. Seems like they are going through a slight identity crisis and I am not sure what I think about it because, admittedly the food is still excellent. I just miss the stuff New American that used to be on the menu that they did really, REALLY well. But, all things considered, I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner. It's a really special spot and would make for a unique date place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Its a shame when you patronize an establishment several times, have a good experiences, then you have one that is so bad that it cancels out everything positive. If you run a happy hour special until 7pm, it is until 7pm. Dont cut it off 5min before to your customers just because one of your bartenders wants to be out exactly at the end of her shift. I had my heart set on a beer and sliders when I walked in at 6:50 pm Wednesday May 14th. I hope that the bartender (you know who you are) will take this initiative  and get retrained.

Over the years I have come to realize Chili's is not one of the better chain restaurants I have been to. Their quality of food has been going downhill. They have a good 2 for $20 promo going on. They even have a $35 promo as well where you get margarita's as well. Both try to cater to the casual eater. On my last visit the burgers lacked the quality I once remembered. They also were cheap on the fries which the server apologized for but nonetheless they weren't all that great either. The service was better than expected (based on previous reviews). Prices are inexpensive if you take advantage of their promo's. Food quality is average chain quality.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"It isn't often I write a review the next day, and even more rare the same night.  Alta deserves a next day review as its vibrant flavors are fresh in my mind. Logistics: - Accept CASH and Amex only.  You don't want to be caught off guard.   - It is a tapas restaurant.  This means, small plates that are meant to be shared.   - Typically, an average appetite can comfortably consume 3 dishes.  I would consider dishes with heavy starch and carbs to be listed as worth 1.5 plates because they would fill you up faster.  I would include the Paella, Spaghetti, and Pizza dish in this category.   - If you come with a group larger than 4 people, the big table you will be seated at will make conversation very difficult with the person across from you.   - Decor is very traditional and rustic, but the ambiance is loud as everyone else is talking over each other. Tapas: - Crispy Brussels Sprouts are like Christopher Nolan, they live up to the hype.  All I can say is our party wanted to order more if we weren't trying to taste different dishes. - Roasted Pork Belly Confit is a crispy skin with fatty goodness. - Spaghetti Pepperoncini had a creamy texture and a spicy surprise that furrowed my brow and put a smile on my luscious lips. - Roasted Hudson Valley Rabbit did not taste like chicken.  It tasted like rabbit and it was freakin' good! - House-Made Pizza, surprisingly was good even though it was without meat. These were the dishes that stood out for me, and even though we were sharing amongst 5 people, I tried my best to sneak in a little extra for my portion.  Yeah I'm a glutton. By the end of the entire service, 6 people shared 15 tapas and 4 dessert dishes.  This would include 4 girls and 2 guys who were pretty satisfied.  The bill split evenly was about $52 per person, so this is about what to expect with a similar party.  I would have to say most of us were average stomached individuals.  I would definitely come again, and the first thing on my list would be the Brussel Sprouts!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love Mulberry & Vine!  I've been going there for a while, but it just dawned on me to write a review.  Such a cute place and great lunch spot, but they serve a great breakfast as well. I'd have to say my all time favorites are the southwest quinoa and the roasted cauliflower with their housemade green sriracha.  But they have a wide selection that meets every diet (vegan, gluten free, etc.) The staff is super friendly and accommodating as well and always available to answer any questions.  I'd definitely recommend this place, especially if you love good, fresh, healthy, and clean food!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had never eaten in Chinatown in Phila before so after asking my brother and friend who live in Philly for a referral I decided to check out tripadvisor and found out this seemed to be the top rated Chinese restaurant. I checked out the menu and when I saw they had scallion pancakes, I decided this was the place to take our Chinese exchange student. He seemed to like it. He ordered a few types of dumplings, soup and noodles. We ordered scallion pancakes, General Tso chicken and sesame chicken. All were DELISH!!! The fruit smoothies were yummy! I would definitely visit here again! The ambiance was beautiful and the waitresses friendly...which go a long way.... FYI it is a CASH ONLY place...glad I had enough left over for parking!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The best Chinese food between Montreal and NYC's Chinatown, regardless of the idiot from Columbus. All food is prepared fresh for your table, that's why it all doesn't show up at once.  A tasting menu is available at lunch, I think it's $15/diner, little bites of anything the chef thinks to put out, I have never been disappointed, and I LIKE good food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

3* for the atmosphere but be warned it could get really loud in here. 2* for the foods as it is not an authentic Mexican & u can get it much cheaper elsewhere. 2 1/2 * for service as most F.O.H staff either don't cared or know about the menu. If you wanted quicker service then I suggest you sit at the bar. I've been here twice & may give it another try but not anytime soon,"[0.0, 1.0]"
Definitely get the soba when you come here. It is so soft and fresh and you can get a really good lunch deal. I ordered the shrimp shumai ($8.50) for the appetizer. I had one piece and it was cold and my dad had a piece as well and confirmed it was also cold. We went it back and they brought a new one with the full 5 shumai pieces. It was super delicious. I ordered the Sake Oyako Don ($14) which is salmon sashimi (about 5 pieces) served over rice with salmon roe. It was so fresh and tasty and I really enjoyed it though I usually do not like roe for its salty. It came with a small appetizer dish which had three tiny tastings. The first was carrot and daikon with black sesame seeds. It was really good. The second was two pieces of lotus with a sweet-ish sauce. They were ok not my favorite. The third was Japanese sweet potato which was the best out of the three. It also came with a small plate of pickles which were good but nothing special. The special also came with soba (I picked hot) Super filling and really delicious. Would nightly recommend.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
The dumplings themselves were great. I had the pork and crab mixed with pork dumplings. A little bigger than I'm used too but tasty! The dumplings themselves are 4 stars but the atmosphere and restaurant facilities suck. Who wants to be crammed in a table with random other people. But its New York City chinatown so you can't really be expecting 5 star amenities and service. The standard that I compare all dumplings to though is Din Tai Fung in LA and in Taiwan. So compared to there the dumplings are just a notch below and they don't offer the dessert dumplings that Din Tai Fun does. Overall Joe's Shanghai is good but no reason to make a special outing there if you are there on vacation with precious time to spare.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Kalustyans doesn't open til 10am and I was in dire need of a bathroom and breakfast, so I popped into Penelope to have breakfast and wait it out til 10am when the famous spice shop opened. It's cute inside - very shabby chic - but the seats aren't as cozy as the decor. No cushions anywhere which lends to a sorta cold feeling. Oddly the guy that seated me asked, ""So would you like a single or double espresso?"" assuming I wanted espresso. It was an odd way to seat a person. Presumptuous at best. Limited breakfast entree menu - I settled on the 2 egg breakfast with toast and ""home fries"" and a cup of ""decaf"". There are some interesting sides on the back side of the menu  - one was a coffee cake that sounded intriguing. Coffee wasn't very good and was not hot. They give you milk rather than cream, so you wind up diluting your already cold coffee to sub room temperature. My breakfast arrived served with ""french fries"". $8 for two eggs with FRENCH FRIES? Please, if you're going to call it ""home fries"" on the menu but they're really ""french fries"", for god's sake, tell me so. Getting french fries with my breakfast when I am trying to eat somewhat healthy makes me a bit mad. But I was hungry so I ate them, resentfully. Took forever for a 2nd cup of coffee and also had to ask the guy that seated me for jam - waitress just never checked back with me until it was time to clear the table and bring my bill. For all my griping, it's cute and the food ""tastes"" OK, but there's just nothing special here that I saw today. I'd give it a 2nd try to see if anything else on the menu was stellar, but it's just not a breakfast destination spot. I don't ""get"" why there's a massive wait for breakfast unless there really isn't anything else in Murray Hill. (Maybe that IS the case?)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This past weekend, I had brunch at Cookshop in Chelsea. With summer weather here, whether you sit outside at their outdoor patio, or inside in the airy, open, modern dining room, your experience will all pretty much be the same. Amazing. Their American cuisine is focused on humanely raised animals, support of local farmers and artisans, and seasonal availability of foods.  To start, I had their Grapefruit Brûlée (ruby red grapefruit, brown sugar, creme fraiche, mint). So, yeah, you gotta get this if you're there for brunch. It's the perfect, light starter, or, makes for a great, healthier dessert. The tartness of the grapefruit is cut from the crisp brown sugar and the whipped, creaminess of the slightly sweet creme fraiche. Everything goes so well together, and leaves you wanting some more.  For my entree, I ordered the  Frittata (roasted oyster mushrooms, stracciatella, basil-walnut pesto). This was another amazing dish. Served with a little bed of perfectly dressed mixed greens atop the eggs, this frittata was a slam dunk. The roasted oyster mushrooms were the star of the dish for me, tender and flavorful, and, when combined with the other components, each flavor and texture enhances the next. The stracciatella cheese marries the mushroom and the herby and nutty pesto so nicely, it's a bit of a sad moment when it's all gone.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Walking in on a cold fall night, it is not hard to understand why this popular Brooklyn Heights' neighborhood restaurant is a big hit. Noodle Pudding simply oozes warmth, good Italian food and friendly service. The prices are more than affordable, and you are dining in a romantic golden colored candle lit room. The menu focuses on classic dishes with an adventurous twist. The pappardelle with venison ragu was simple but yet so flavorful. Although tiramisu was ordered on every other table, and looked very yummy, at the end of our meal I was simply too full to try.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"i went there just because a friend of mine who's visiting from wyoming looked inside and found the bar and the idea of japanese grill interesting... i'm a big fan of cheap eat. but robataya did a decent job of defeating me. we sat at the bar where all the yelling and grilling was going on. the server took the order from you and then yelled it out to the chefs who did the grilling in front of you. the chefs will climb over the grill or use their little oar to get the raw ingredients, which were hanging out in front of you. you know fish, squid, steak, veggies, etc. the whole thing was fun to watch. and it's fun to see the way they prepare the food, which is very cool. we ordered a whole red snapper, scorpion fish, cod fillet, enoki, zucchini, japanese yam, and mochi! they were all good. but the cod was the best thing of the meal. oh and we also got the rice with salmon and salmon roe. the food was excellent. but the service was really slow though. we waited for 30 minutes, which wasn't bad for a friday night dinner. but the whole cooking thing took kinda forever. they grilled things very slowly. that made the food really good especially when you have to grill the whole fish. but the whole meal just took forever because we had to wait for 15 minutes for anything we ordered. we had a lot to catch up so the wait wasn't a problem. but it would suck if you came with someone you bring to entertain but you don't want to hang out with e.g. customers from work. but it should be good for dates though. and the chef was attentive. he knew that i was waiting anxiously for my enoki to come and told me that he would make that next. and he had a nice smile but that's beside the point. interesting dining experience. but i love my hole-in-the-wall food though.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Can't wait to go again. Incredible service, delicious food. I can't give it a 5 star because while the entree I got (sautéed seafood with couscous) was well seasoned and tasty, it wasn't anything special, and the sauce could have used some bold flavor to complete the dish because everything was just a tad dry without a sauce and the sauce was too mild and watery to make a good sauce to dip in. The Caesar salad was fantastic, the sorbet was so flavorful, chocolate mouse cake was addictive! Almost perfect experience. Really great place.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"ive walked by here so many times and never once managed to go sit and eat but tonight i did and was so throughly pleased that i wanted to curl up in the warm glow of the gently incandescent globe lamps and snooze on the booth.  we both had excellent entrees; i had the hanger steak with mashed potatoes, sounds basic but the flavor of the reduction on the steak was phenomenal. my fellow diner had the porkchop with apples, pearl onions and mashed potatoes. im not usually a pork kinda lady unless we are talking about bacon or the pulled variety, but man. i am still wowed an hour later. absolutely delightful intermingling of flavors.  and the portions were so generous, im having hanger steak at my desk for lunch tomorrow. the space is tiny and magnified by many mirrors, very cozy indeed, with a cream painted tin ceiling and a very kind and attentive staff. two entrees and two hearty glasses of a tasty pinot noir were 50 bucks (not inc. tip).  brilliant. now, i need to get off my ass and head to investigate their brunch one early weekend day.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"EPIC! Hands down, the best late night food. At 4am, there is a line around the block for this cart. Everyone - hungry, eager - anticipating the best late night drunk food NYC has to offer. My favorite is the lamb, but sometimes I get combo, just for the diversity. I always, always, recommend extra white sauce. You can never have enough white sauce. The hot sauce, is SUPER HOT, so be advised and use sparingly. The first time I had Halal from this cart, I doused my plate with hot sauce... it was still amazingly good, but I was sweating and crying the whole time while eating it. The pita slices are so, so good. I love soaking them with sauce. The lettuce is kind of laughable, I honestly don't even know why they throw that in, it's pretty much an afterthought. If you're ever drunk, just got out of a club, hungry late at night, then just remember 53rd and 6th. Find your way here... to the mecca of late night street food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Location: Conveniently close to shopping and cinema. Atmosphere: Attractive lighting, classy yet comfourtable decor.  The dining side feels open and lends to sociability while a short-wall with stools and tables acts as a point of differential from the bar. Food:  Mexicali stays true to its name by blending traditional characteristics of its Mexican side with big, hearty American fare.  Approachable, tasty and fresh.  The salsa bar is generous as are the interesting and varying entree sides. Bar:  A cantina style, horseshoe bar.  The area flows well and rarely feels overcrowded even when the place is packed.  The draft selections range from faithful staples like Switchback and Bud-light to rarer and more exciting local and regional craft selections.  I once had a 'Farmers Tan' imperial Pilsner from Southern Tier here!     I'm not really a margarita guy but you'll see no shortage of margarita glasses boasting a spectrum of colored contents making their way to tables and patrons who look eager and pleased to receive.     There are pretty regular beer and liquor promotions as well which equal free swag! I've also seen some really nice raffle prizes given away that was free to enter. Staff:  An overall vibe of welcoming warmth speaks to the personable and professional attitude of the servers.  The service at the bar is efficient and friendly.  On a super busy night the wait times can get a bit long but I've never attributed this to apathy on the part of the staff.     Very attractive servers! (Sorry, couldn't not mention that....seriously, these girls are hot!) Overall:   At the end of the day, before or after a movie, Mexicali is a local gem hidden amongst the corporate ""restaurant factories"" like Chillis and 99.   Cinco de Mayo at Mexicali should not be missed!!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Arrived just before 8pm without a reservation to a pretty busy restaurant on a Wednesday night. The hostess said it would be about 30 minutes for a table. We went to the bar. The bartenders were attentive, and the drinks were delicious. A little pricey, but they felt special. We were not seated for 50 minutes, at which point we were finished with cocktails at the bar and had started Googling other restaurants in the neighborhood. Just then, we got seated, and they sent over an appetizer on the house. So at least they had the sense to try and make up for their hostess' poor estimation. The food is well prepared, and seasonal, which was appreciated. But the portions are quite small, especially for the price. The menu is brief and not good for vegetarians, or even pescetarians for that matter. Most of the dishes feature meat, or have a meat component. We each had seafood, and were generally disappointed by the overall entree composition and presentation. The fish is served as-is on white dishes, with a more complex side of either vegetable or meat and veg pairings with sauce. Ham seemed to be a component of many dishes. The wait staff seemed junior, confused about whether drinks had been ordered, and reliant on servers and hosts to truly serve and describe the dishes. There is a main room where the atmosphere is enjoyable, but the back room where we sat felt loud and unpleasant. There are also some tables quite near the entrance to the toilets, which I am happy we were not seated at. All in, we spent over $100 per person for drinks, appetizers and entrees. There are restaurants within walking distance of this place where you can get a better meal for that price. I would only go back for drinks at the bar.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Café Luluc is in that gentrified area of Brooklyn of hipsters and parents pushing their Bugaboo strollers. It is a popular Brunch destination for the surrounding neighborhood. It is a quaint restaurant with a nice outdoor seating when the weather suitable for al fresco dining. I've only gone here for brunch so can only comment on that experience. Even with the crazy crowds all bunched up at the door vying for a table it is very civilized and the host does a good job of handling the amount of patrons. I prefer outside if I can just because inside can be loud tight while outside is very enjoyable and room to breathe while you eat. The service is also fairly good with the crowd, fast and friendly. So far everything I've had there has been good. The most popular are pancakes which are delicious. It is enough to share for two or one and not eat the rest of the day! The omelets are cooked superbly.  You say how can one mess up on the omelets...oh I've seen it done. The Western omelet is very good as is the Eggs Benedict.

"So a few people have said the staff were surly and I experienced that but I thought it was part of the charm, the two gents behind the counter ribbing each other - one calling the other an old man when he messed up an order - and ribbing the customers - complaining when people ordered well done coz it takes 10 minutes longer etc.  I wouldn't have expected anything else from a joint like this.  The decor is classic and old and the seats are small and cramped but I wasn't going to eat in so that didn't bother me. The place was busy when I was there, I ordered to go and they write everyone's order down on a piece of paper as they go.  They can only cook 8 burgers at a time on each grill (they had 2 of the 3 grills working so thats 16 burgers at a time) - there were about two and a half pages of orders in front of me so I ended up waiting about 40 minutes for my burger. Easy to order, you can have a burger or a cheese burger - with tomato and onion or without tomato and onion - I went with. The potato salad eas awesome - more of a cross between egg salad and potato salad - two things I usually dont like but these I certainly did. The burger itself is flame grilled and served between two slices of toasted bread - unique was to serve a burger but actually worked really well.  I enjoyed the burger, it was tasty and delicious and the tomato was fresh and crisp. Overall if it wasn't for the 40 minute wait for what should be a fast food order - I would have probably given it five stars.  I'd highly recommend anyone who is planning to visit Ted's calls in their order about 30 minutes before they arrive - then it'll be ready when you get there and it'll be a much better experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Pretty surprised to see the amount of great reviews for this place, but it's only because the owner is a friend of a friend of a friend and so on. It's great that alot of his friends are supporting him and the place, but lets be honest here. $3-$4 per ""Bao"" that can be finished in 1-2 bites isn't going to satisfy alot of HANGRY customers. Yes, all businesses need to make profit, but those Chinese buns are NOT expensive to buy and with the skimpy meat, I feel like the food is overpriced. Not only that, but the food quality doesn't even  live up to its prices. I also ordered the famous Baozilla fries, thinking that they would be similar to the Joju fries that I LOVE. Boy, was I wrong. I think what went wrong was that they they try to incorporate all these flavors  and they didn't just didn't go well together. I couldn't even enjoy my fries because my sinus was busy getting burnt by the wasabi that they ODed on.

At first I thought it was suppose to be there, (like those moving bonito flakes you find in okonomiyakis?) and I was about to eat THAT piece before I thought: wait a minute... It was quite large and stood on a piece of watermelon, literally waving at us. So we told the nearest guy we could find and turns out he was the manager, so he really took care of things. He asked me if I wanted to order something else and since it seems that the watermelon was the source of the maggot (everything else is cooked/heated), I had to choose something else instead of re-ordering the pork jowl. The nice part was that the entire meal was comped, that was totally unexpected. I also found relief that they told us they are double checking all the food to makes sure everything is okay (it is an open kitchen after all). It did leave a really uneasy feeling in us as we were really hesistant to eat anything, until the sisig came out (it's on this super hot sizzling platter, so that was safe..or at least dead). The sisig was alright, I think I like the one at Marhalika better. Super awkward, we left our waitress a tip and left. I think I will go back and hopefully have a much better experience!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The name says it all. Fish. All kinds, all preparations. This small, nautical fishing shack-decorated was slammed when I came here. Apparently there was some holiday party, which caused us to wait a while for a table for 3. People really seem to like this place, including yours truly! This place is legit. Seafood and an oyster shucking station as soon as you walk in. I was half expecting some old sea captain to come out with a peg leg and order a tray of oysters! Our table shared a feast! Including 2 types of tar-tare (tuna and salmon), a giant bowl of mussels steamed in a delightful garlic butter sauce, a wasabi crusted salmon. and I had some awesome beer. No oysters for me. I feel like a strange version of a red-headed step child for not trying oysters in NYC, but hey, I just don't like 'em. The mussels were phenomenal, the tar-tare fabulously fresh and delicious, the salmon had some sort of breading which we didn't really like. We wanted it to be grilled or just plain, probably wouldn't have ordered it if we knew. The only thing bad I gotta say is about the bread. We were starving by the time we sat down and asked for some bread to snack on while we wait. No sourdough here, no crusty goodness for me. We are served a basket of jalapeno cornbread-like breadsticks that were pretty dry. I thought I would get some bread to go with my mussels to soak up that awesome broth. The only bread they had was garlic bread, and it was 2 pieces of butter soaked bread with RAW garlic and parsley on top. It was too saturated in butter to soak up much of the broth at all. (the server even commented on how gross the bread is). Come here for some awesome seafood and attentive, friendly service. If you like oysters or any kind of shellfish, or hey, just FISH, you're in for a treat!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am completely enamored with this restaurant. Its trademark open faced sandwiches are a real culinary treat but what gets less attention is the awesome sides and out-of-this-world brunch. The chef(s) present innovative, healthy, and absolutely delicious versions of comfort foods. Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich Of Smoked Eggplant, Avocado, Aioli, and Tomato is but one example. I swear, everything I've eaten there (and I'm slowly making my way through the whole menu) has blown me away. Aside from the food, here's a top five list of things I like about the place: 1. gorgeous patio out back 2. really good musicians playing in the corner on weekend nights. (ok, sometimes they do get a bit loud for dinner conversation to continue) 3. wait staff that seem genuinely psyched to be working there and sharing this culinary adventure with you. 4. the fact that Maimonide is located in the hub--if not the heart--of Brooklyn. 5. Dessert. (sorry, i realize that also falls in the food category but i really can't leave it out.) My advice: go and go often. If you're not vegan and don't care about animal cruelty or the environment, go anyway. Your selfish mouth will be rewarded many times over.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Seems people either love this place or set their expectations extremely from all the hype (even in that case, I say I still believe it) Took a date here for her David Chang experience. There was no wait, though we were relatively early for dinner (6pm). By the time we put in our orders there was a queue going out the door (and for a particularly rainy July day in NYC, this still isn't a surprise). We tried a mix of things I've had before and hadn't. We started off with a nice little round of beers, she had the OB (korea) and I had a white beer from Portland. I forget the name. They gave us little chilled glasses for them which were great. Pork buns - Yeah, what else can I say. Still good. Crispy Pigs head - an extremely lovely dish, two cakes made of pulled pigs head, breaded in panko(?) with a lovely sauce with pickled limes. My favorite next to the pork buns. Sausage with rice cakes - a dish I suggested we try since I read about it here. I found the cakes to be a litlte dry, but overall the dish was tasty. Afterwards we hit up the Milk bar for desserts. I'm going to give that a review too but I thought I'd include it here since they're connected. We overloaded on desserts. Blueberry pie - Classic, not too sweet. Pretty much perfect. Compost cookie - A cookie that contains pretzels, potato chips, coffee, oats, butterscotch and chocolate chips. The winner of the night. Blueberry Cream cookie - dried blueberries and milk crumbs. It basically tasted like the best part of a blueberry muffin, the top. Cornflake Choco chip marshmellow cookie - Tasted like a hybrid rice crispie chocolate chip cookie. Good. We also got the cereal milk soft serve ice cream which tasted exactly like corn flakes. Blew our minds! GO GO GO","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This by far is one of the best places to get pizza in Brooklyn. Roberta's in Bushwick is the best, but this isn't too far behind. The food is great, and so is the atmosphere! It is right near many coffee shops, and a great candy shop two blocks away. The only problem was the wait. It doesn't seem like it's usually bad, but we had to wait an hour to be seated. It was worth it though because the food was great! And then the manager gave us free gelato because of how long we had to wait. Great place, just don't be surprised if there's a long wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Vanessa's is a great deal in a city that often seems to put a dent in your wallet. Fried dumplings come 4 to an order for $1, which other items including the pancake sandwiches, soups and appetizers run anywhere from $1-$4. Needless to say, everyone comes here for the dumplings and the stuffed pancakes. My only complaint is that the dumpling wrappers here are a bit thick for me. Of course, it is typical for Northern Chinese style dumplings. Sometimes the wrapper rips and falls apart as well, though I'm not sure if that's due to the quality of the dough or mishandling by the ladies who serve up the dumplings. Despite that, the pork and chive filling inside is quite juicy and flavorful. Besides the fried dumplings they are so known for, I really enjoy the fried buns (shen jian bao) that come 3 to an order. The skins are much softer and glutenous than the dumpling wrappers, giving way to a meaty pork filling that also consists of mushrooms and vermicelli. Delicious!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Some of the dishes here are fantastic (MuShu Pork, Fried Rice, Mango Smoothies, Mongolian Beef) others have gone down hill over the years and are almost to the point of horrible (WonTon soup, egg rolls).  Once you get to know what to order, the experience is great, good food, delivered FAST, accurate and hot and they have friendly customer service.  When there is a mistake, they rush the replacement right over.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Faaaaantastic place. Two thumbs up for excellent, caring service. Our waitress was so much fun and always checking in. I chose this place because reviewers said it was accommodating to vegans. They don't have too many choices but the avocado toast was enough to win me over. Without the egg $8 wasn't too bad since the flavor was delicious and the avocado was generous in amount. My husband ordered the bronte burger, not knowing how popular it was. He has had a burger at almost every joint we ate at, and he literally dropped his jaw after his first bite. It was phenomenal he said. The combination of sauce and juicy beef rocked his palette (it's some homemade citrus sauce) and the burger was unique because they used bread as opposed to buns.  He just kept saying ""Omg so good! Omg omg"" Next time I will definitely try the burger (after this one month trial of being a vegan and seeing what it feels like!). This place is a must!! BuT get there early :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I hosted a reception at Jadis on the night of my wedding day.  Working with Edit could not have been more pleasant.  We reserved the entire restaurant for about 60 guests, and the space was perfect - it could also have comfortably fit more people.  With zero fuss and stress, Edit helped me to plan a menu of wines and hors d'oeuvres.  The food was great and plentiful, the wine was fantastic, and the staff were as lovely as could be.  Edit in particular treated me like royalty.  My guests all had a wonderful time, and I received many comments on what a pleasant, comfortable and attractive space it was.  I would highly recommend hosting your event here. Mine could not have gone better.  And of course, I'd also recommend going just for a glass of wine or for a meal.  I plan to, many many times in future.  Thanks Edit, and the rest of your incredible staff!","[0.0, 1.0]"

The food tastes horrid, but it is basically my only option around here. I sincerely feel sorry for the people who live in this area who say this is the best restaurant around. Wow.

"Best restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. I know that sounds extremely exaggerated but it's true. The service here is impeccable. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly.  Our server's name was Jose and he was amazing!!! They treat you like beloved family here. I can't explain it, it's something you have to experience for yourself.   And to make it EVEN better!!!!- their food is phenomenal. We had guacamole, yucca, tostones, paella and short rib entree, and pastel de chocolate dessert. Guacamole came out a little oxidized, but it tasted perfect. Great guacamole! Yucca and tostones were your standard so nothing jumped out. The entrees though, oh boy. The seafood in the paella was fresh and perfectly cooked. Saffron rice were amazingly seasoned.  It doesn't come with the crispy rice on the bottom like traditionally paella but still a great dish. Short rib- omfg... It was like perfect pork belly. Crispy on the outside but so tender and soft on the inside. The short rib just fell apart- didn't even need a knife!!! Dessert- chocolate cake with mint ice cream and a tequila blueberry sauce. Nuff said! Also- had the poquito picante (little spicy in Spanish) and it was divine!! Perfect mixology in my opinion.  It's funny because originally last night we had planned to start out at Angel's Share but they were having a health inspection so weren't open. I was pretty bummed but in retrospect, I am SO happy that happened bc I wouldn't have tried this gem. There were a lot of regulars and I can see why. I am movin out of the neighborhood but any time I am back, I will definitely be coming here!! Best experience ever. Seriously.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"First time I tried Kochi in September 2013, soon after its opening, and visiting often after that. Kochi is the best Indian cuisine that I have ever tasted in North America. I feel like home when I am in Kochi. The food has authentic Kerala standards. The staff in Kochi are very welcoming, friendly and enthusiastic in doing their job. Owner Thomas, chef Mathew, and the serving staff, all have professional training in the field and you can identify their talent by tasting the food. I tasted a number of items including Kerala puttu-kadala curry, kappa-meen curry, Egg curry, different snacks including halwa, neyyappam and all of them were great!  Kochi offer lunch buffet every working days. They recently started offering dinner buffets on Mondays and is having amazing variety dishes. Among the side dishes, what I like the most is their appam--simply amazing!

"I've been here a few times now, mostly during instances in which a friend and I couldn't decide where to eat and compromised to dine at the unassuming, inoffensively American Temple Grill.   As far as I can tell, the food is pretty standard ""sit-down American"" style; most of the items on the menu relate to steak, burgers, fish or simple sandwiches in one form or another. Haven't had any bad experiences yet - portions are large and everything appears to come with a complimentary bucket of waffle fries. Sandwiches and burgers are nothing to complain about nor to write home about. Have not yet tried the ""do it yourself"" salads, the fish or the grilled cheese. My friend once ordered the New York Steak something or other (the most expensive item on the menu), which was huge and almost good enough to warrant the price tag.   Service is a bit slow and a couple of times it's been hard to find a waitress.

Scallops are like no scallops I have ever had. How do they make the sauce for these?  Sweet and savory. All fish dishes I have tried are out of this world.

"I gave Saint Austere a 2nd chance after my 1st 'meh' experience there, simply because Fabrizio was so sweet the first time we were there, when we stopped in after a performance. He gave us some extra dishes with substitutions for my veggie needs, including 1 killer one (polenta) and encouraged us to give it another try, since we live in the neighbourhood. Ooooooooffff - the man tricked me. Returning was a bad move ~ because this time, I didn't have the pleasure of his company to save the day. Instead, I was with his less than charming sister, who would do better as a paralegal than a bartender/server. Hospitality is clearly not a family trait. Deplorable & Disgusting!! There should be a star for that. As for the food :: the same bland bummer from the kitchen with a braised short ribs & risotto ($15) served in a bowl smaller than my cat's & of course in square cubes that reminded me of beef dishes in India with a little cold temperature for effect. Beet pasta was super boring & harder than gnocchi supposed to filled with what they called cheese. To down this sad cuisine - we needed wine which came from a list selected by someone behind the delivery counter in a diner. The wine list :: the same unfortunate selection with only 3 mediocre Italian reds by the glass. Oy! Clearly, the smart thing to do for any customer at this point is to end this misery. But the kicker came when I asked for the bill, and the paralegal asked ""what was wrong with the meal"". I started to answer, and she threw me out of the restaurant. Yes, you read that right. The woman asked me to tell her what I didn't like, then said: ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave now."" Unreal. Why ask if you don't want to know? I didn't say a word until asked for my feedback which of course would ooze out of me after this killer experience at the bar - Right? Fabrizio shows up just to hand the credit card that we left at the counter & says ""thank you"" - My postscript to the paralegal: don't fret, darling - I won't be back & ensure no one from my neighborhood does either. My recommendation ~ Grand Street has other options to offer & if you need a paralegal there is one right round the corner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Definitely a place to go if you're looking to experience ""chic New York brunching!"" as my out-of-town friend requested. Of course, on that front, Cafeteria delivers. However, in the comfort category not so much. We were waiting for one member of our party to join us, who we knew would be joining us well into our brunch. However, we were told we couldn't be seated (even though we assured them we would order drinks and food and all of our meals while we waited for our 4th friend, and even order her drinks and food as well). So we stood in the crowded back area for 45 minutes instead. Already off to a bad start. Then there was a stray hair in my coffee. Completely put me off to the rest of the meal. I will say though that the food is decent - the macaroni and cheese being their greatest hit, for good reason. You should get the 3 mac n' cheese sampler. The truffle oil is my favorite though the bacon version is a close second. I had the fish tacos as my meal and they were good (a bit small and thus would have left me hungry if we hadn't split the mac n' cheese sampler as an appetizer). My friend got the granola and greek yogurt and it looked really good. She highly recommends it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had a special deal on a $25 off restaurant.com coupon through work for only $4.  How could I pass up that deal?? Went on a Tuesday night with 3 friends.  We asked for seats in the lounge area because there was a sizeable live band setting up in the dining room.   It looked like the ratio of band members to actual diners was around 50/50.  As it turned out, the lounge wasn't far enough removed... they were LOUD.  No one likes having to shout to be heard by someone sitting at your own table. The restaurant and lounge decor was very reminiscent of a 1980's banquet facility.  Granted... Marco Polo's IS a banquet facility... so it doesn't break any molds there.  However with small windows set high in the wall in the lounge, and dark wood trim and coffered ceiling, the place could use some lightening up.  Also, it could use a bit of spring cleaning... water stained ceiling tiles and visible dust on the lamp shade over our table were somewhat offputting. Having been to Marco Polo's a handful of times over the past couple decades when a relative passed away for an after-funeral reception, or for a relative's 60th birthday party, I really had never paid all that much attention to the decor or food.   I used to live nearby and got chicken marsala take out every now and then, which I recalled really enjoying.   So that was what I ordered this time.  My friends ordered baked ziti, pasta calabrese and pasta alfredo with chicken.  We also ordered garlic bread with cheese as an appetizer.   Our salads came out really fast... large piles of iceberg with the standard toppings, carrot slivers, red onion circles, cukes, and grape tomatoes.  It was all fresh and crisp, my only complaint is it was dripping in water, having apparently just been freshly tossed and rinsed.  The excess water ruined the dressing. The appetizer was great, but really, anything covered in a glob of melted mozzarella is going to be good!  Next time I dine here, I'll remember that they give the table a large basket of fresh garlic bread and herb/oil dip... so ordering a garlic bread appetizer was a bit redundant.  The bread is good btw... soft and chewy and the top is brushed with garlic and oil and sprinkled with salt.  Reminds me of an overweight Olive Garden breadstick. Our meals came out with a reasonable window in which we enjoyed our appetizer.  My chicken marsala was great... just as good as I remembered.  It's a thick brown marsala sauce which is fairly heavy so I paired it with mashed potatoes instead of pasta (I enjoy pasta with my chicken marsala only if the sauce is light!).  Seasoned vegetables accompanied the dish.  One friend really enjoyed his baked ziti.  However, the pasta alfredo sauce was very thick and met with very low approval and upset her stomach later that night.  The pasta calabrese was terribly over-salted and inedible.  We had to send it back.  My friend opted to get an order of chicken marsala to take home with him instead which the restaurant provided free of charge and with apology for the pasta calabrese dish.  While they didn't make any excuses, I had to wonder if the sauce got salted twice by accident or if there might be a new line cook in the kitchen.   Individually our dishes rated a 5, 4, 2, 1... so 3 stars is a good average.  Throw in the good service (waitress was friendly and fast) combined with the poor ambiance (LOUD live music in an outdated lounge) and the trip was a very average experience. I'll try Marco Polo's again in the future... I'm just not in a rush to do so anytime soon.  And it may take a lot convincing to get my friends to join me!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The atmosphere at Le Grainne transports you to Paris... except with better service. The bistro style chairs, along with the dimmed lights and vintage French signage adds to this ambiance. I found myself there, again, on the eve of Bastille Day. The bread and butter came to the table immediately. The quality was fair enough, though nothing really worth noting. we ordered: the flattened chicken with arugula, La Danielle crepe (ham, cheese, egg), and the ratatouille. All of which were prepared nicely and dressed / seasoned just so. We ended the evening with the tarte tatin, the chocolate mousse, and a banana and Nutella crepe. While dinner was well prepared, dessert is where this place has always shined. The tarte tatin was moist, the crepe was delicious, and the texture of the mousse was velvety rich.   Date, big group, or families will do well to dine here for a multitude of occasions.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Across the street there was an empty Italian restaurant. Down the block another near-empty Greek restaurant. But early on a Sunday evening (around 5:30), not only was Taverna Kyclades busy, it was PACKED with a line running out the door. That really says it all about this restaurant. It's a bustling, energetic place with waiters, bus staff, hosts and the chef moving through the dining room with incredible speed and efficiency. It's a kind of controlled chaos, but a friendly chaos. I think this energy is one of the things that attracts so many people. The other thing that attracts people is surely the food, which, while not phenomenal, is good for the money. I shared stuffed grape leaves with my friend, who was in from out of town. They were a bit mushy but nice and lemony. My friend gave a high rating to the grilled calamari, and I was pleased to have so many vegetarian options at a seafood place. I really enjoyed my lima beans and carrots in a rich tomato gravy, as well as my sides of lemon potatoes and horta (swiss chard). This is one of those rare restaurants that helps define the culture and energy of the neighborhood in which it resides.  I wouldn't call it a five star experience, but if you're going to visit Astoria, Taverna Kyclades should be on your list.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend and I went to have lunch here on Mon and had to most awful experience with the manager!!! We have been here couple times before and was very satisfied with the quality of food for the price.  Today we ordered home made tofu, katsu toji, and kaisen don.  Upon our food's arrival we thought that the katsu toji was too fatty.  The pork loin had about 40% fat.  We did not like it and informed our waiter that it was way too fatty for our taste.  He asked what we wanted so we told him that we would like another order of that is preferably less fatty.  He said he will speak to the manager.  The manager did not come.  After about five minutes the waiter came back and said the kitchen is closed so they can not make another dish for us which was fine so we asked that the dish get taken off the bill.  We did not want to pay for something that we didn't even like. We thought that the message had gone through but a few minutes later the manager came to us.  He introduced himself and asked us what the problem was.  We told him that the pork loin had too much fat.  He then started a lecture that lasted more than ten minutes about how the pork fat was good fat and at Ootoya the menu is a balanced diet, we can't just eat all salad or just rice as carbohydrate and etc... He also mentioned that in our industry people think that fat is bad but the fat in the pork was good fat.  He was literally foaming in his mouth.  My friend and I were very astounded by his reaction.  Usually in a well ran restaurant when a customer complains about the dish and sends it back you get the option of either ordering something else or getting the dish taken off the bill.  My friend is a pastry chef and I also work in the hospitality industry as a manager and we dine out a lot at different restaurants.   All we wanted was the katsu toji taken off our bill since the kitchen was closed.  We didn't even have the opportunity to finish our kaisen don because after the manager's lecture we lost our appetite and dumbfounded by his reaction.  We were just very upset and wanted to get out of the restaurant.  We asked for the check and a different waiter gave us the check with katsu toji on the bill!!!!  We asked that waiter to take it off the bill then the manager came to us again.  This time he was more rude saying that he was trying to figure out what the problem was.  He asked why we didn't like the dish.  We told him again that it had too much fat.  He claimed that we had already consumed at least half of the dish.  I told him if we had liked the dish why would we send it back?  Again we told him we did not want to pay for it.  He clearly expressed his frustration and took the bill and came back saying that he took it off.  When he came back with the bill he stood there in front of us and stared at us waiting until we paid the bill.   We paid for two dishes that we did not even finish plus gratuity.  We did not want to punish the wait staff and deprive them of tip for the manager's rudeness and ignorance.  We vowed never to return to Ootoya ever again!!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place has the best crostini a girl could ask for. My friend and I got the tasting platter, so we chose 6 types and shared them. I tasted the goat cheese & fig jam, goat cheese & apricot butter, and chorizo & spicy mayo ones. Everything was amazing and I was especially blown away by their fig jam and apricot butter. It was a really nice pairing with the tart goat cheese. The 3 crostinis were the right size for a light brunch, and the 6 of them only cost $18. The ambiance could be improved, but it's still a really nice, charming local eatery that I will definitely visit again. It's quite small, so I probably wouldn't go there with a big group of friends.They also have outdoor seating which will be great in the spring and summer.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here at 9pm on a Friday night. There were open tables outside, so we were hopeful we could be seated immediately. No such luck (even though there were open tables the entire 30 minutes we sat in the Piazza waiting...maybe they didn't have enough servers?). The hostess told us 15-20 minutes max, but the text message confirmation I got said 20-30 minutes. After 30 minutes, we started to walk toward Standard Tap knowing that we could easily walk back if I got the text that our table was ready. Long story short, we FINALLY got our ""your table is ready"" OVER AN HOUR after we came. Absolutely ridiculous. We were already eating our burgers at Standard Tap when they texted.

"I was so impressed with this place that I broke down and signed up for Yelp. I don't head to Williamsburg often, but will be coming back here. This place was well-executed from the menu to the design. Open airy corner space w/tables on ground level and a spacious downstairs bar. Could be great for a large group or party. I spent a few hours downstairs on Thursday - all the cocktails that I tried were delicious and the bartender was very helpful attentive and friendly. He could tell what you liked and was able to improvise some off-the-menu cocktails. They also had a quality playlist going. Didn't really try the food except for the croutons (which were great), but will be back to get through the menu. I was surprised there weren't more people there on a Thursday night, but this place will become more popular through the summer as word gets out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We practically sprinted down the block to get there within 10minutes of their text and even after texting ""we're on our way"" as we walked, they still didn't hold a table for us.

"meh. i dont know the whole bed stuy do or die thing kind goes out the window when you have a disco ball, tea cup lights, a skull in your crown moulding, and quail the size of a quarter over a dollop of polenta for GREENPOINT PRICES! couldnt really settle on what the vibe of this place is. just had a couple apps and drinks on a weeknight and everything was ok i guess. for those prices i could have balled out somewhere worthwhile. the only thing that really irked me was i only had a dollop of polenta to start and before i got to scoop that up the server came over and lifted the plate up! and said let me get rid of that for you. i know this isnt fine dining but please ask your customers first before putting your hands on the plate. the tartar was ok but they only give you one itsy bitsy little piece of toast with it. sorry guys i know you have good reviews and your trying, again you obviously had some money to throw at the place but it just seems haphazard in some unsettling sort of way. sorry i couldnt speak more on the food or service but when i go out to eat the ambiance and aesthetic has a lot to do with where i spend my money. the only thing salvageable was my date being cute as hell but we could have had a good time anywhere and i think we did next door at the bar with a fireplace in the back? and if your gonna spread love the brooklyn way dont let biggie just trickle out of your speakers. you clearly spent some time to make some speakers in the ceiling wether they work or not i dont care but i shouldnt have to struggle to hear biggie or wu tang coming from somewhere. thats like blasting kenny g or something.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My husband and I hosted our daughter's rehearsal dinner at Anthony's. From the planning to the execution, Anthony and his staff aimed to please. Our guests traveled a long distance  and they were not disappointed. Our party took over the whole restaurant. The tables were nicely dressed, and Anthony set up an appetizer table and small bar. Our guests had a preselected menu to choose from, that was agreed upon by  Anthony and our daughter. Every item that was chosen, was  excellent. Our guests were more than pleased. Anthony was hands on and attentive the entire evening. He took great pride in  making sure all the food was  fresh, well prepared, delicious and eye pleasing. The meal was followed by a wide variety of Anthony's famous desserts and choices of hot beverages. Our guests were full, but managed to sample both and the raves continued.

These rank up there with some of my favorite NJ spots (Hot Bagels in Fair Lawn, KCs in Pompton Plains). I am very picky about my bagels and these are well worth the trek into Yardley.

"Dragonfly: We are begging you-- PLEASE fix your service! We love everything else but HATE the service. We've been here so many times and it's always the same. Everyone (hostesses, waiters and waitresses, and bartenders) seems bored and uninterested in doing anything besides socializing with each other. Busboys roam around looking lost. Groups of three or four waiters and waitresses will stand around having a conversation while their tables scan the restaurant wondering where everyone is. And I've never even seen a manager. That being said-- the sushi is fantastic. Always fresh, very creative, and delicious. Every menu item I've tried was great, and they change it up every once in awhile to give it some variety. Honestly, this place is pricey for an average night out but it's the only place in the area with decent sushi which is why we are still customers. We've started just ordering takeout from here instead of dining in because the service is sub-par, resulting in lots of missed alcohol revenue for them.   Please fix your service! You've got something that could be quite special-- don't ruin it with bad service.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ramen Nazis, Pretentious Staff. Look, the food is fine and only slightly overpriced, but here's our  experience: My 70 yr old father asked to use their bathroom at 4:45pm while we were waiting in line for them to open at 5pm. Despite the restaurant having active staff and doors open, they refused and made him WAIT to use the bathroom. When they opened, he rushed into the bathroom while we waited in line for a table. We were told all persons must be present before seating, even though he was in THEIR restroom! He wouldn't have needed to rush in if they'd been HUMAN BEINGS and let him in early!

He sat at my table as I explained what had happened. The manager was very polite and funny, making us feel comfortable and at home. He was good looking also =) He bought us a drink and apologized on the waitress behalf and helped us get our orders correct. Our night was fixed.

"I took my girlfriend here for our first date in late September. We had a reservation for 5:45 and were seated immediately. The atmosphere was nice, the hostess and waitress were both incredibly friendly. They had a whole team of different people devoted to making sure my water glass was never empty and everything was ok with our meal. I think we had a total of about 5 different people stop by our table. Their iPad wine lists were very cool. The only minor complaint I can think of is that the 2 person tables where they sat us were very close together, so one person had to scoot through a tight fit to get to their seat. Luckily I'm in shape so it wasn't a problem but it might be for others. I had the lombarda pizza which was good and surprisingly large and filling. Didn't believe the waitress when she said it would make a good meal on it's own but she was right. I couldn't eat much of my second course, the chicken liver rigatoni, which was also very good. My girlfriend had a peach salad that was on special and something else which I can't remember, but was very impressed with both courses. The variety of bread they gave us was delicious and served with olive oil. Two glasses of wine, and two courses for each of us ran me $105 with tip so be prepared to spend a little money. It's definitely worth it though, I got a little action afterward!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Really great spot. Loved the open space, loved the fact that they have wifi and are cool with people working there for extended periods of time. And the food is wonderful! My only disappointment? I had scoped the website and wanted to try the Saucisson - a ""Dry cured fennel and sage saucisson of sundried tomato, porcini mushroom and sunflower seed on whole grain sourdough toast with aioli, and pickled radishes."" But the item is no longer on the menu and they need to revamp the site. So I went with the oyster mushroom and chick pea ""nuggets"" with mustard instead, which were a good, hearty choice. So then I really REALLY wanted to do a half and half on the MOB, which wasn't possible. I was bummed since I don't live in the area, but powered through it ;) I ended up with the Bright Eyes, which was a good choice, but I found myself looking around at everyone else's meal longingly too. Yeah, I'm a fat kid. Don't judge. Here's the description of Bright Eyes from the menu: ""House made cashew yogurt, peperonata,a sweet and lightly acidic (from white wine vinegar) stew of sweet peppers and onions. Next the mob is topped with fresh seasonal fava beans and crimini mushrooms roasted in garlic. The final garnish on this mob is a touch of spicy and fresh tasting watercress.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
2 Adults had dinner on Thur. 10/28/10.  The food was very bad! I doubt that they have a chef. My duck was OLD and stringy. The cold lumpy risitto it was placed on top of was strongly flavored with something like blue cheese. It was garnished with Asian flavored thin strings of what must have been dried vegetables. All the flavors clashed and ran into each other. My guest had crab cakes.  They too were warmed up after frying. He had lumpy cold mashed potatos with the vegetables strings.  Both meals were skimpy and nasty.  This place specializes in microwave leftovers. The bread was stale and rewarmed. It was served with a bottle of oil...no butter. Never again! This place needs to close.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"One of my favorite dive bars in Brooklyn.  This place has pretty much everything you need in a bar. Cheap Booze: $4.50 get you a shot and a can of Carling Black Label and for a wopping $5.50 you get a bottle of Lone Star and shot of tequila The place also serves random bar bites, like chili dogs and nachos for pretty cheap (veggie varieties also available)  They don't taste that great but for a $1 it hits the spot when you're nourishing a proper bender. You've also got plenty of mini games here that make Sunday afternoon drinking a blast.  Buck Hunter, Darts, and a bevy of board games in the back bar.  The absolute best however is the giant Connect 4 board in the back patio, which is excellent in the summer. The only beef is that it can be near impossible to order on weekend nights, the bar wraps around to the back but the bartenders have trouble evenly spacing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"While the food is excellent, I feel that it's the staff that truly sets Fat Buddha apart.  There's nothing better than being in a bar where the staff is truly happy to be there.  It's funny, I've seen a lot of the staff members there on their nights off.  I think that's a true testament to how much they enjoy being there...well, that, on top of the fact that Carlos (bartender) periodically screams ""I love life!""  This place is such a draw that my soccer team chooses to go there after every game, even though we play on the West Side Highway in Chelsea. Anyway, getting back to the food, some of the things I enjoy the most are: - Beef sliders - Pork sliders - Salt & Pepper squid - Chicken Don - Flank skewers over rice (Flank Don) - Honey ginger garlic wings - Bacon wrapped shrimp I also had this great salad once (that one of my teammates ordered).  Unfortunately, I don't know the name. Also, for you vodka drinkers, I was introduced to a great vodka there the other night called Russian Standard.  One of the bartenders told me it's supposed to be good, so I tried it out.  It's really smooth, and is my new vodka of choice.

"Read about the famed Lure bar burger (shoutout to bestburgernyc) and heard that B&B had the same owners and offered the same burger so we made our way here for lunch. The place was virtually empty so there was no issue getting seated or the like.  The atmosphere is fine, just like any other newer place offering up to be rustic with exposed brick, etc.  Another had also read about their truffle burger.  We decided to split the white truffle burger at a jaw dropping $48.   The white truffle burger was underwhelming.  There was hardly any truffle on the burger and the taste of the burger overall was salvaged only by the LaFrieda patty.  I've had the black label burger at Minetta for $26 and this doesn't compare!   On to the reason we came here.  The Bash Burger!   This was a damn good burger.  The meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The bun held everything together and the element that ups this burger a notch is the bacon jam.  I mean God bless!  Why didn't anyone think of bacon jam before.  Why didn't I think of it if another has.  Amazing!  In my opinion, it blows the truffle burger away at a 1/3 of the price.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"There is so much positive to say about this independent cafe.  Service is very friendly, the menu is surprisingly expansive and creative (desserts especially), and the location and atmosphere couldn't be better.  It simply feels good to be in Trend.  But there is one thing that has disappointed me every time I've visited since they opened earlier this year, and it does keep me from returning more frequently.  It's the coffee.  Even though they have a few choices in insulated carafes brewed at all times, I simply find the QUALITY of the coffee sub-par, especially for a cafe.  Maybe the basic equipment used to brew the coffee is a factor, or having the incorrect bean to water ratio, but I suspect it's primarily the quality/source, roasting and handling of the beans.  I personally don't care for flavored coffees, and the extra caffeine variety isn't something I need, but I recognize that both are very popular with a lot of people.  That's not my issue.  I just want a good cup of full-bodied, robust coffee that has a complex, rich character and a very pleasant aftertaste.  The ""bold"" variety I've tried several times at Trend falls short on these characteristics.  It reminds me of the canned coffee you might stash in your summer house for emergencies.  Little nuance and a very unsatisfying finish.  I really don't like the aftertaste.  I'm not a coffee expert, but have been drinking it every day for decades, and think I've developed the ability to separate the poor from the average from the superior.  I'd describe Trend's coffee as just average.  I had such high hopes and expectations of Trend in this particular area.  It is a cafe after all, so one would naturally expect to get an above average coffee experience there.  The good thing is that this is something that can so easily be improved.  Because I love everything else about Trend so much, and really want them to succeed and be in business for a long time, I'm going to share my feedback about the coffee with the owner and hope that he takes it in the constructive spirit it's given and hopefully decides to make some changes.  Montclair needs Trend.  And I think Montclair deserves better coffee.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"About as good as pizza gets.  Pepe's is serious business and is right up there with my two favorite NYC places (John's and Nick's), as being the best pizza I have ever had.  Who would have thought New Haven, CT had such great food, (Louis Lunch as well as Wooster Street Little Italy).  My friend and I waited outside for about 15 minutes and then continued to wait in the small vestebule indoors for another 10 minutes.  As I looked through the glass window into the restaurant I could see a large sausage pie sitting on one of the tables.  My tongue basically rolled onto the floor similar to what you would see in a cartoon.  Keep in mind I had just had two Louis Lunch burgers but I was ready to dive into this pizza.  My friend and I ordered a half plain, half sausage large pie and it tasted just as good as it looked.  The underside of the pie had a perfect bake on it, airy crispy, with a nice flavor from the coal oven.  The sauce and cheese played nicely off of eachother and there was no dominating flavor.  I would urge anyone to take a trip over to Pepe's, I don't think its possible to not like this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have to admit, I always come here for their yakinabe udon. Their soba is okay but I prefer SobaKoh. Yakinabe udon is the best thing especially in a cold winter night. The broth, the egg, the tempura shrimp, the right kind of chicken, you will have to try really hard to slow down or you're going to burn your mouth while chowing down these yumminess. One thing to complain, why is there broccoli and carrot in the mixed tempura? That just feels so wrong!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stopped by for lunch. Cubano sandwich was pretty good. I wasn't blown away but it's a solid sandwich. I wish it came with a side, but for $9 it was a pretty decent sized, filling sandwich on its own. Yuca fries were real yummy! I loved the sauce! $4 for 9 fries A lil pricey. Service was just okay. Pretty standard. Didn't check on us during the meal or stop to refill our water. The decor is pretty cool. A bit loud in the back room though. Overall, food was decent and I would come back because I want to try brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here like 10 times now  and I think it's finally time for a review. Start off with the wait. My wait times here have varied from 10 minutes to 2+ hours. It really depends on the weather and what time of day you go. Even on a typical working weekday when you go at 3PM it might have a long wait time, but generally that would be the best time to go. Moving on. The space is small but no one really cares because you are here for the RAMEN. I usually get the Totto Extra Spicy Ramen or the Mega Ramen if I am really hungry. I usually add in Kikurage Mushrooms, Spicy bamboo shoots, extreme rayu (only for the mega ramen as the Extra Spicy ramen comes with the extreme rayu), and boiled egg. The extra spicy ramen is always good. Love the slightly more cooked than al dente noodles that they use. The Mega ramen uses a different kind of noodle (they use the same for the miso ramen as well). I personally like the texture of the extra spicy ramen noodles better. Char siu pork buns are okay. They were hit or miss for me. Sometimes if you get a newly seared piece it tastes great, but if you get one that has been sitting out for awhile (which is usually the case) then...not so great. It comes in tartar sauce and a couple pieces of lettuce. One of my favorite appetizers is the Char siu mayo don. This thing is unbelievably yummy! My favorite part about this dish is actually the rice. Theres something in the rice that is super flavorful. Highly recommend you get it. So I used to think that this place beats out Ippudo and Zutto Hands down. I'd say it still slightly edges out Zutto, but I am beginning to like the ramen at Ippudo more now. But I think this is solely due to the fact that I always end up stuffing my face at Totto more than Ippudo which leaves me feeling bloated lethargic and uncomfortable at the end of my meal... All in all...love this place and definitely coming back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Absolute favorite Japanese restaurant. Cozy little place with excellent service and excellent food. It can be a bit pricey but I always think it's worth it. They close in the middle of the day between lunch and dinner time which is odd but not a big deal so just plan accordingly. Their service is great, the staff is very knowledgeable of the specials and the dishes offered regularly. They are nice, patient and know how to do their job. I haven't been there during an extremely busy time yet so I can't say anything about how they are then, but the countless number of times that I've gone, I have been met with excellent service. Their food is just amazing. You have to HAVE TO HAVE TO try the Monkey Roll (shrimp tempura with three blend spicy sauce) and the lobster roll, both amazing. You also need to try the grilled rice balls (filled with pork and bonito flakes). I have yet to try any of the entrees other than the chicken teriyaki (which was okay) as I made it a mission to try all the specialty rolls first. But will update once I go again and try a few entrees.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is amazing.  From the outside, you would think you're walking into a store, or yoga studio.  However, when you step one foot into this quaint, cute place, you are pleasantly surprised.  And when you taste their food, it will transport you to a delicious, magical place.  For lunch time, this cafe is fast and delicious.  For dinner it is homemade and superb!  Everything was clean, portions were on the smaller side, and the atmosphere speaks for itself.  I had the Tomato Bisque soup (which is one of their staples), then the Fried Brie salad, as well as the garlic fries.  The food was unbelievable.  I went with my coworker, and we had to get dessert!  We ate the Banana Cheesecake, and absolutely loved it.  The waitstaff and hostess are also incredibly nice.  Love this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We have been going to Bridid's for years and I am crushed.  It must have new owners because this is one of the worst dining experiences that we have had in Philly.  The menu has changed to something sparce and uninteresting, they have raised the prices, the bathrooms were dirty and the food was almost inedible.  In fact, my daughters sliders were inedible because the bread was so hard and dried out.  Bridgid's was one of our favorite restaurants, may we have a moment of silence for it's demise?  Where is Gordon Ramsey?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Tasty tasty brunch spot. As we all know, any decent brunch place in the city is gonna have a wait. Factor in the fact that it's in the Murray hill area where good brunch spots are few and far between and you might as well pitch a tent and get cozy cuz ur in for an hour wait. Props to the fact that they offer free coffee to those in line. Not props to the less than welcoming staff. Jeez font act like you're doing us a favor were patrons of your establishment. Anyway let's get to the food!! Ok hands down as many yelpers have already stated the pumpkin waffles are the best best best. One of the best brunch items I've had in the city. So I was deeply saddened to go in today to discover they're no longer on the menu. Upon inquiry with the waitress, she explained that they are a seasonal item. The last time I ordered them was about two months ago which would have been in June. If you're gonna do a seasonal pumpkin dish, I'd expect it to be offered in the fall. So whatever I'm a little confused. Anyway this latest time, with the lack of pumpkin waffles, we settled on the the nutella French toasted and salmon wrapped poached eggs on brown bread. For a pre fixe of 14.50 our dishes came with coffee/tea and juice/mimosa. We were wired from taking advantage of the free coffee during the the wait, so knowing we had to pay for coffee as part of the inclusion made us feel a little less loved Anyway the two dishes were solid but not comparable to the pumpkin waffle If you don't get the gist of my review, its that the pumpkin waffle should come back ASAP!!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here last week with a party of 10. We were seated right away, although we made the reservation 20 mins prior. The decor is very lovely. White chair covers all have funky faces on them. Nice touch. DRINKS - came out faster than I've ever seen. Patron Margarita was small but good. APP - I ordered the Edamame Ravioli - AMAZING. 4 come on the plate surrounded by this savory sauce and sprinkled with edamame beans. I have to learn how to make this ASAP! So of course, my entire table basically ordered various appetizers, and being the must-try person that I am, I tried them all. The Caesar salad is okay, I didn't really like the cashews in it. My bf had the Dungeness Crab Sticky Rice which came inside an actual crab - LOVED. Tasted my friends Wok Stir-Fried Broc - GOOD. Also, some Rock Shirmp taco looking dish - GREAT. ENTREE - (this is where it gets interesting) So after tasting so many dishes, I was basically full :( my beautiful $48 lobster came out, and I had to snap a pic. The presentation was more than perfect. It had 4 small piles of noodles, some steamed spinach, and poached lobster resting in the tastiest lobster sauce I've ever had. It also had the hard shell of the lobster still on the plate. I took 2 bites from the lobster and even tho I wanted to scarf it down...I just couldn't. I was stuffed. So I told the busser to wrap it up for me. He came back very quickly and tapped me & put my leftovers on the floor next to my chair. Now we stay for about 30more mins and a few more drinks are ordered. A friend pays, and we get our coats from the coat check & part ways. As soon as we get into the house, I realize that I've left my LOBSTER GOODNESS at the restaurant! I call immediately and the girl who answers the phone tells me, ""The bus boy actually just threw it out...is that a problem?"" in the nicest, attitudey voice. I say ""Umm yes it is a problem because I took only 2 bites out of that food and I was looking forward to eating it tomorrow."" in my nicest, I-know-it-was-my-fault-for-leaving-my-food-but-­who-puts-food-on-the-floor-anyway voice. She transfers me to the manager, and she was AWESOME! She asked for my name & number and asked me what time would work for me tomorrow because she will have my dish ready.

First, the prices have gone up a lot in the last couple years, and second they have a decreasing supply of good vegetarian dishes.

After being there for more than 20 minutes, one of the female owners (I think) made it a point to say I had to buy something to stay. I found this very rude and discourteous as I was already planning on purchasing food. There is also a lack of outlets and a general ""chill"" effect if you have been there too long. This is made worse by the owners constantly wandering around, making it feel as if they are watching you all the time. With all the hipster shops in New York, I wish Montclair would open a more student-friendly coffee shop.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The first thing you'll notice about Grimaldi's is the line stretching around the block that always seems to be there. We arrived at the end of the line closer to the waterfront and the wait was about an hour. I thought the experience and food was well worth the wait. The whole place has a classic and old vibe to it. The tables are covered in that quintessential Italian restaurant red and white checkered plastic tablecloth. The walls are covered with old, yellowing pictures of NYC figures and buildings. We ordered a large 18"" plain pizza for $14, which were divided into 8 HUGE slices. Not too pricey when divvied up between three people. One thing I thought was great is that a ""plain"" pizza is really a margarita pizza, which is big slabs of fresh mozzarella scattered around the pie topped with fresh basil and thick tomato sauce ladled all over it. Never been a big fan of margarita pizza until I had it here. Yum. The pizza was a little bland, it needed some salt (which i quickly applied. The salt brought it from an ""okay"" to ""incredibly delicious"". The crust was crispy and flavorful, which I find very important.. One of very few pizzas where I could easily just eat the crust. The distribution of mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce was masterful, not at all lack or overdone. - C & M","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you were a fan of Madison Square Bites then you will absolutely LOVE Broadway Bites. Brought to you by none other than UrbanSpaceNYC, Broadway Bites is a pop up food food market where we all can indulge in delcious eats from a variety of different food vendors daily (11-9) from June until August. Located conviently outside Harold Square Station on 34th in Greeley Square, Broadway Bites is hard to miss and even harder to walk by without being tempted to explore. There are some vendors that you will notice that were present at Madison Square and many more that are completely new. With a larger space and more seating areas available at Greeley Square all the booths are spread out providing ample space to roam around. There is a general seating area complete with tables and chairs located on the south side of the park, and along side the booths there are some stand up tables and a few sit down stations as well. I was most excited about trying out Hong Kong Street Cart. For 6 dollars I got a very generous portion of their cold peanut spinach noodles. The green noodles had a very interesting texture and the peanut sauce had a nice spicey kick to it. I also tasted the buckwheat and lemongrass chicken salad bowl, I cant for the life of me remember what dressing was used but everything was incredibly flavorful and delicious. I also sampled the Papaya Salad from Bangkok Bar. It was freshly made to order, the papaya had a slight crunch to it and the lime fish sauce had an adequate spice to it for the spice sensitive, for those who prefer more of a kick they had additional seasonings to adjust. Other vendors that are a must are: Seoul Lee Korean BBQ (get the tacos), Macaron Parlour (macaron ice cream sandwich), Onigiri by Tampopo (octopus balls) and Two Tablespoons (gluten free tacos).

"I've been here a handful of times and loved each experience. I've recently been loving their duck ramen and haven't even looked at the menu for other ramen options, I love it.

Don't go on first dates here. Something about the beer and the delicious food, one or the other, or the combination of both...your farts and burps will sear off your nose hairs.

V said it reminded her a little of chicken pot pie! While still good, the sweet crepe didn't have as much flavor. The hazelnut ice cream melted way too quickly.

"RAMEN REVIEW Cost:  $7.81 (a convenient, even $8.50 after tax) Components: Pork, noodles, broth, scallions Size: About 1.5 pint Method: Takeout I don't know what I was expecting, but I did not really enjoy Kobeyashi's ramen.  The menu clearly states that this soup would contain ""roast pork, scallion, ginger, nori, togarashi (pepper)"".  The nori was mysteriously absent, I tasted (nor saw) any actual ginger, however I could pick out a delightful togarashi. I opened the to-go container and was met with a visual assault of a mesh of noodle cake.  I only waited about 5 or 10 minutes to eat after my remote buzzer buzzed and I picked up my to-go bag, so I was expecting noodles that held up a little better.  Nearby Kofoo rice bar serves their ramen with noodles on the side so that you can add them when you're ready to eat, a move which preserves the noodles quite nicely. Since we're on the noodles:  these obviously came straight out of a $0.29 package of instant Mariuchen or spicy Shin Ramyun, possibly purchased at a nearby bodega.  Nothing special.  Nothing good. The broth did have plenty of dimension.  It was like nearby Ajisen's broth but with more body.  Buttery, salty, fishy, spicy, porky.  Overall I was pleased but not impressed. The roast pork is a definite standout.  It fell apart when I attacked it with my chopsticks, which is a GREAT thing.  It was oh-so melt in my mouth tender and full of flavor. Skip this.  For the price, you should head over to Kofoo or Ajisen and get a much more satisfying, complex ramen.  Saying that Ajisen's soup is better isn't really saying much (because Ajisen is probably the worst of the worst), but Kofoo puts this to shame.  As a contradictory side note, I devoured it to the last drop.  Hey, I love my ramen!  I never leave a drop, even when I'm satisfying a craving at home with the instant stuff. I will not be going back for the ramen, but I think I'd like to try their beef udon.  I'm pretty sure the inclusion of a ramen on Kobeyaki's menu is really just obligatory, since the restaurant touts itself as ""Japanese food in a fast casual environment.""  It'd be hard to claim that without offering up a ramen, which is a fast food staple in Japan.","[1.0, 0.0]"

But as someone who's lived in New Haven for over five years and has been to every restaurant here, I can say that this is the best pasta in town.

I had lunch with my wife here and this is what my opinion is of it... The staff was uninterested in us. The chips and salsa came out but they were extremely greasy. The homemade salsa was great. The hot sauce that they have there (that they also use at the farm house) is out of this world. We received our food quickly but the pork was way overcooked and it literally poured out water from the tacos. They also had an insane amount of Cilantro in it which to me was overpowering. The margarita was good but when I ordered it she asked if I wanted salt and I said no. A minute later she came back with one with salt. So I mentioned to the server again that I didn't want salt and she grabbed it and told the bartender that it wasn't supposed to be salted. The server said just dump it in another glass without salt and the bartender said but it will still be salty the server didn't care. Thanks a lot if it were your drink you would have wanted it redone. For $11.50 for a half size glass I expected a little more or at least what I ordered done right. Have some respect for people. I had high hopes because these guys own the guild and the farmhouse and American Flatbread which are all great. I was not impressed.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

They do not accept reservations, but they will take your phone number down and text you when your table is ready so that you don't have to wait inside a cramped restaurant. Every restaurant should have this system, seriously awesome. We had pork buns as an appetizer, which were AMAZING. So so so good, I can't say enough good things about those pork buns. I had the roasted jurgielewicz duck for my meal, every component of this entree was fantastic. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and all of the flavors complemented each other very well. My boyfriend had the pork chops which were also excellent. Definitely going to come back here and try more items on the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"You'll have to wait for a table.  It's inevitable.  But standing on a nice little corner in the West Village or having a drink at the bar isn't so bar in my opinion, just make sure you're not too hungry.  The food is worth the wait, and in truth those deviled eggs are delicious.   I will say I've haven't had the most friendly service when I've been here but honestly it wasn't so bad that it ruined my experience.  I feel that due to the high volume of clientele the staff does get a bit rushed, but as long as they're bringing me yummy food I could care less.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What can I say that others have not already said?  If people could only go to one restaurant in Philadelphia, and they asked me which one it should be, I think Zahav would be a fierce competitor.  Why?  Because it's something different - there is nothing else like it in the city.  Because it introduces you to tastes and foods you didn't know you liked.  Because it's so flavorful that you can get full on the hummus and salatim alone. I can't say enough about how delicious this place is.  I always wish for a second stomach when I go.  Occasionally a third.   You are really, truly missing out if you skip Zahav.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I like you a lot, lot all we want is hot, hot Balls, Balls, Balls we like balls in cars Balls, Balls, Balls, buy us drinks at bars Balls, Balls, Balls with hairspray and denim And Balls, Balls, Balls, we love them, we love them! Man, do I love these balls. I've had balls in a drunken state late at night and naked balls during a classy not trashy date. When tips I like the hero balls because the bread does wonders to soak up the alchy in my tummy. Actually sitting down for dinner is a lot different than ordering your balls from the take out window. For one, you can give them your phone number and go somewhere else and they will text you when your table is ready. EVERY restaurant should go with this method! When you sit, their menus are cute dry erase menus where you can mark off what you want. We got the naked balls with original sauce and a spicy sauce. We also got sides of penne and broccoli. Honestly the balls were delish - just stuff them all in your mouth and it'll be a party.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to LaScala's many times for lunch, so my review is based strictly on lunch experience. The dipping oil that comes with the bread is awesome, and goes perfectly with any of the great salads. My favorite salad is the caesar with grilled salmon. The chef will happily add the salmon for an extra $7 but it's a huge great salmon fillet which is guaranteed to up your protein intake and hold you over until dinner! Beet salad good, but you'd better love beets, and chopped salad is a safe bet as well. The wait staff at lunchtime is hit or miss. Although they aim to please, service can be a little in attentive, especially if you are in the dining room to the right. If you are only a table of two, you may be seated very close to other tables, so I try to either request a window table to the left or  a ""quiet table""', and they always oblige. If it's super busy, you can sit in the bar area at one of their pub style tables. This works if it's crowded, you are on a short lunch break, or you don't feel like waiting for a table in dining room. Overall, I love this place, but couldn't go beyond 3 stars for now since service and stale croutons this time around held me back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"For the price point, I found Traif to be a fun easy restaurant. The service was casual, but nice and very attentive. Our server was easygoing and if they weren't immediately around, another server or back-waiter was always there to help. The crowd seemed young (20-40 years old) and very Hip (Williamsburg of course). The music was current top40 stuff that played very loud and with an open kitchen the ambiance was very noisy. However I feel that the noise did not at all take away from my dining experience. The tables were all very close together, but again, at this price point I find that it was fine. The menu was simple but well executed. Smaller plates that ranged from $7 to $20 dollars. I would estimate that two people, a couple of drinks could get away with a $60 tab (no tax or tip) and be quite satisfied. We ordered about 9 plates. They opened with a demitasse of lentil soup for an amuse, a nice touch considering I wasn't expecting it with that atmosphere. A decent tuna tar tare bruschetta. A wonderful comice pear salad. Sweetbreads (of which I will always order if its offered) that were outstanding. That lamb loin was decent, but compared to the previous courses seemed disappointing. The duck leg confit was over done (in the fact that the meat was quite dry for a confit) and under cured (not enough salt or time in the cure process) but the barley risotto that garnished it was amazing. The dessert menu wasn't calling anything out to me because I was quite full. But they served us a little mignardises of a marinated pineapple something. It was enough bite of sweet that sent us out the door quite happy. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Down the street is a new sister restaurant aptly named Shiksa.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The food quality and ambiance deserve four stars, the service was definitely two stars. Expected a much higher caliber in this department considering the price point and the chic decor inside. However the decor was very modern, big fan of the copper table tops. The menu is a little lengthy and it would have been nice to get some guidance from the waiter on it, but didn't. We order appetizers but weren't ready to order entrees at that time. But he never came back to take the orders for those, so after finishing our appetizers we had to flag him down to put in for our entrees. Also after finishing my cocktail he just took the glass and never asked if I wanted another, so I had to flag him down later for that as well. Also the bus boys seemed to stand and hover in the dining room. Almost all the dishes were spot on. Didn't care for the steak tartare as much, it had too much aioli that overpowered the other flavors. All of the portions were very generous and tasty. Only other gripe was $18 for cocktails, not top shelf liquor. Seemed a little steep in comparison with the prices of everything else.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of my best friends hand-picked this hidden gem as our NYE dinner spot and I gladly agreed so as to avoid spending a pretty penny on fixed menus and chaotic crowds everywhere else. We lucked out and scored a private VIP table thanks to the last minute reservation. This place had the perfect ambiance. Classy, yet cool. Fancy, but not overpriced. And I haven't even started raving over the food itself. It was my first time trying Peruvian food (and ceviche!) and I loved it to say the least. We ordered: the Saltado Cebiche, Matador Combo (rotisserie chicken, yellow rice, beans, tostones [plantains], salchipapa [frankfurters and fries], and avocado salad), and ended with Peruvian Chocolate Cake (courtesy of my BFF). The food was more than enough for a party of 4, but it was definitely worth being able to try a little of everything.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hu is a newer deli / restaurant / bar which is committed to creating good tasting food which is completely unprocessed and natural before the food revolution processed everything we eat. And they knock it out of the park. The location is a stone's throw away from my home, and so I frequent Hu. They make an assortment of vegetable options daily, with chicken (breast or thigh) to accompany them on a platter. Some times they will offer another meat option. Also there is a large pay by the pound option for food they make. One day I'm going to tear into the venison but its a bit pricy (kind of hard to put hormones into a deer or elk running wild in the forest, venison meat I've always put a premium on), so I stick to the cashew chicken salad which is more in my budget range. Fantastic. If you care for a dessert, I got a quinoa chocolate bar made with almond butter which, I can undoubtedly say, is the best tasting chocolate bar I've ever had. And I hate chocolate. They usually sell out of them pretty fast as people buy 10 bars a time on the regular. Oh, and the price of that bar? $8. You'll know where that money goes when you bite into it. While some items may be on the more expensive side for a restaurant without a waiter/waitress service, you cannot top the quality of the food that is being eaten, so you're really coming out on top by choosing Hu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
My boyfriend and I went here for our 4 year anniversary. I have to say it was one of the best meals I have eaten in the city of Philadelphia.

A lot of interesting choices on Bobby Flay's menu. Saw Jeffrey Zakarian walk by with his little kid (Food Network friend of BF). Food was very good, and service was very nice, if not trying to hard to up-sell items.   I noticed the server bought after dinner drinks for many of the tables (we did not stay for dessert). Setting is typical.  Big, corporate, very nicely done. Why wouldn't I go back? Not personal enough for us.  No way to get to know the bartender or manager (we like to frequent restaurants and know the staff), because it was just too big. Too many tourists.

Tempura bits of lobster fried but not too crispy and topped with a sauce that was amazing. Steak was perfect! Served on the signature 500 degree plate to keep it warm. The meat was so tender you could eat the fat! Just unreal. The onion soup was also great, with the melted cheese on top and loads of onions in a winey broth.

They only have two servers but they always served you with a genuine smile and care despite during busy hours. The ambiance is classy but not pretentious. My boyfriend and I have a pleasantly romantic date here because the beautiful decor and warm ambiance really charmed us. Try their creative and satisfying Laos Samplers appetizer and mouthwatering Thai Tea cheesecake with ice cream ! You wont regret it except maybe on your weight.

"Okay, okay, I know this place has a million reviews already, but I figured I'd put my two cents in.  I went to this place with a friend who was in from out of town.  I'll admit that I didn't have much of a desire to eat some late night Ramen and I wasn't too hungry when I first came here, but this place was a great surprise and I'm happy that my friend took me. The place itself is interesting.  It has the feel of an upscale, loud sushi bar.   The staff was friendly...or at least I think they were friendly.  They took us to our shared table after a short wait, and as we entered the main dining room, they shouted our entrance (which they do for everyone).  Yeah, it was a little strange, but I just went with it.  Most of the tables are large, shared tables with a giant centerpiece in the middle.  It can make for a bit of a distracting dinner, depending on who shares the table with you, but in general, i didn't mind the communal atmosphere.  The servers were very attentive and friendly. The food...oh, the food.  I know this place is supposed to be all about the Ramen, but to be honest, I thought the small plates and appetizers were just as good, if not better!  I started the meal with the tofu and nasu agedashi, which was delicious--flash fried tofu and eggplant--nom nom!  I also had the vegetarian Hirata Buns, which were open buns with eggplant & eringi mushrooms.  They were delicious.  I'll have dreams about these!  For the main course, I shared an order of the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen with my friend.  It was good, but because it was soy based, it was a little bit too salty for me.  It was enough to share though, and I've heard that you can ask for additional noodles for about $2--if you wanted more for the broth. This was a great place to go for Ramen, especially if you don't have any real expectations.  I was tempted to bypass the appetizers, but I'd definitely advise against it.  On my next visit here, I might get an entire meal of only small plates, and I can't wait to return!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The brisket sandwich was very tasty but for $11 we felt it was a bit pricey.  Everything adds up real fast as well.  Definitely great quality meat though.   Service and staff were great - very friendly and helpful in ordering.  We always really appreciate that in a restaurant and they did not disappoint.

You can also order as an  entree Grilled Asparagus: Comes with a fried egg and although it doesnt sound appetizing, trust me it is great. Entrees: Wagyu Flatiron: Very tender and Juicy. Great steak Roast Chicken: Beautifully done with the best mashed potatoes and herbs Cavatelli is also really good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A funky, modern space for dining, Buy your kid a fresh burger so they stop whining. Maybe even try the cool, creamy shakes, Or with unlimited soda refills you could fill up lakes. We've been wanting to try this place for a while and what better time for a burger than the afternoon after a crazy wedding? The restaurant is set up like a fast food joint- order at the counter and then wait for your name to be called. I got a Mooyah burger. There are multiple cheeses, toppings, and sauces to choose from that are included in the cost of the burger. I settled on cheddar, onion strings, jalapenos, hot sauce, lettuce, and tomato. Premium toppings such as bacon cost a bit extra. The meat patty was kind of thin, but the burger was hot and juicy. The size didn't completely satisfy me (Get your mind out of the gutter!) I also chose to order a large fry, which was a mistake for two people. I got enough fries to feed the entire 1996 Chicago Bulls roster. Stick with the regular-sized fries unless you have a big group. The fries were a bit overcooked. The vanilla shake was nice and thick. No complaints there, but I also like anything sweet. Most of the staff seemed like they didn't want to be there, which is pretty common for a fast food place. We were, however, bidded farewell by a female employee when leaving. Overall, OK in a pinch. Average burger place. Would probably be back for the 2-for-1 special on Tuesdays.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I don't care that the ambience isn't amazing. Yes, it's sparse, a little dingy, and occasionally too cold or warm. I don't care that the waiter doesn't act like it's a TGI Friday's and introduce himself as my server with a saccharine smile. I don't care that this isn't the finest cuisine in the world or that it's not the absolute best place for each dish it serves. Ivy Noodle, you are getting five stars because I could eat the curry tofu noodle soup with chow fun (wide rice noodle) every day of my life. It is hot, it comes out incredibly quickly, and the curry is rich without being heavy, spicy without burning my face off, and filling enough that I never order a second bowl even though there is not enough tofu curry soup with chow fun in the world to satisfy me. I don't even eat tofu most of the time, but the secret of tofu is that it turns into little flavor bombs of whatever soup you put it in, and this soup is a soup you want little bombs of. Ivy Noodle is fast, it's cheap, and I will probably never make it anywhere else on the menu, so I can't tell you how good the lo mien is. Get the soup. Oh god, get the soup.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"- ""Hey cuz, now that you moved to Astoria, go to Jackson Hole and get some breakfast there someday. Their pancakes are the best."" - ""Yeah, I'll go one of these days. Thanks for the tip."" That conversation between my cousin and myself happened in mid-2008. If I only had listened to him and gone before the end of the 2009, I wouldn't be too bummed about it, now that I live thousands of miles away. After almost a year and a half of living five blocks away from Jackson Hole, I decided to go on a lazy Sunday morning for some breakfast. I ordered pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage, and some fresh-squeezed orange juice. After my first taste, I almost stood up and punched myself in the groin for not listening to my cousin earlier. Their breakfast is damn good, their prices are decent, and their service is quite fast, especially considering that the rest of the times I went the place was totally packed. I took my mom, brother and sister-in-law when they went to visit me from Puerto Rico, and they also loved it. The 50's style decor is a nice touch. I never went there for anything other than breakfast, so I can't vouch for the rest of their food. But if you want some good breakfast either by yourself or with family and friends, this is definitely a good place to head to. If you're going on weekends, make sure to go early, or be prepared to wait for a few minutes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Our host and chef was so nice polite and welcoming, the atmosphere, the decor superb, you feel at home or in a different country with all the memorabilia of a past era and French flag on the ceiling. The best ever corn crab chowder moist, delicious with big chunky pieces of crab hummmm in a succulent creamy veloute as appetizer I truly recommend it. My boyfriend had the seafood chowder soup he loves it. Usually my boyfriend is difficult and hard to woo but he looooooves the place the food the meal. For entrees he had the dorado a whole grilled fish with a flesh so tender cooked to perfection and a tomato marmelade green beans carrots and mashed potatoes . Next time i will get his plate. I loved my dish as well I had the cioppino. We already planning to come back my boyfriend told me next time he will try the salmon burger with fries.

"Sorry to say this place is getting worse and worse. We found so much comfort in this place 5 years ago in their old location and the atmosphere, food, and experience is much different now. The crowd has gotten loud, really drunk, and not a reflection of the neighborhood. A girl fell out of her stool at the bar and almost hot us while we were eating dinner, so classless. I could not even stand the loud noise, food was overly Hot ( not spicy, seem to be for no reason) and we waited twice as long as we were told for our table.

I'm a little nervous to write this stellar review because I don't want it to get too popular and crowd our #1 spot... but I can't help but say great things for them. I love everything about this place. First of all, the food is absolutely delicious. The Beef Hash as well as the Biscuits and Gravy are both to die for. Also, when they say bottomless brunch, they mean it! I've been to too many brunch spots where ""bottomless"" really means two glasses if you're lucky. Not Jeatjet. They have your next mimosa on the table before you even think to ask for another. And they'll keep 'em coming for as long as you want. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is chill, and the decor is rusticly cute. JeatJet gets an A+ all around in my book.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We waited for at least a good 30 minutes outside in the cold to try this place, expecting it to be great for the normally long wait (in the cold, no less!). So, we ordered 3 entrees total with a side of bacon. The short story? None of it was that great. Maybe we just picked all the wrong things, but hey that's a lot of wrong things. We both love food, so the fact that we packed some to go and STILL didn't even bother finishing the leftovers means it wasn't worth it. I apologized again and again for suggesting to come here. What I thought was okay, and ""good"" only in comparison to the rest were the eggs and maybe sausage. I'm not sure how you're supposed to eat grits but it's very tasteless, less favorable than plain congee. I tried to eat it with the sausage which made it better. The monkey french toast I got was lacking in flavor, bananas are mild so it didn't add flavor but the french toast alone was just, bready. The peaches didn't add much either. I liked the french toast better at Cafe Lift much more. The pecan belgian waffle seemed delicious at first but as it wore on, wasn't as great. The biscuit top was great, the rest was just ok. I don't think I would come back here, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sandwich foods are better. Definitely not a brunch place to take a date.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Don't try to order by phone because you either get a busy signal or it just rings until you get the answering machine. You basically have to go in to order your food. Also, unless you enjoy eating around chaos, take your food home. The waiting/eating area is very small and every time I've been there, it was very noisy and crowded. p.s.

"Living close to Gramercy is a blessing because it allows me the luxury of walking by Maialino from time to time to see if there's a seat at the bar. When I do see a seat (or two), I walk in, grab it, order a glass of bubbly and wait for my companion (whom I've texted as I grab the seat) to arrive and join me in this completely spontaneous meal/treat. Anywho, my favorite go-to dishes at Maialino are the octopus, Maialino's very own mortadella, and almost any of the pasta dishes depending on my mood. The mortadella is basically a bologne - but a million times more delicious.  I often imagine myself making a mortadella sandwich with 2 pieces of white Wonder Bread and wondering what it would taste like.  I decide that with Maialino's mortadella, of course, that no condiment is necessary because it is THAT good.   The 'polpo', or the octopus, is succulent, charred and delicious and it's dressing of citrus and veggies make the dish perfect. My go to pasta dish is any one of their versions with sausage in it; or the carbonara, the cacio e pepe, or the bucatini all'amatriciana.  Along with my pasta, I often order their veggie sides because whomever is cooking up the veggie sides is doing a crazy good job at it.  You don't like your veggies?  GET the veggies here and you'll be in love with veggies - well seasoned, garlicky deliciousness. And then - of course - you have to get their chocolate bread pudding. Moist, warm and delicious.  The perfect ending to a fine yet simple meal.  I never get bread pudding anywhere else after having Maialino's.  Also, a close second is the olive oil cake.   In addition to the food, I think Maialino's layout, casual-vibe, it's spacious bar area and extensive 'by the glass' wine list make it a good spot for 2nd/3rd daters.  It allows you to a) get a little more adventurous (then you were on the first date) b) get to really 'see' what your date looks like since the lighting is bright than some candle lit spot.  If all is well, move the party to the uber sexy Rose Bar across the hallway then get FUNKY!  yeah!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My fiancé and I decided to come here for a treat after a very long and stressful week. Hands down, this was one of the best meals I've had in a really long time. We were greater as soon as we walked in and were promptly seated. I had this delicious Mojito made with white wine and my fiancé had a regular Mojitoto start. Both were outstanding. We decided on a mix of small plates. Our favorites included the sliders which were PERFECTLY cooked and they were served with the most delicious au jus on the side. We also had goat cheese on toast which were served drizzled with aromatic white truffle oil and topped with figs and walnuts. YUM. The ceviche was outstanding. We we seriously ready to finish off the juice with straws. I could have eaten that the rest of the night and have been totally content. One thing that we did not enjoy was the trio of cheeses. We love our cheese plates but were disappointed that we had no idea which were which. It didn't really matter because they all tasted the same. Dessert consisted of their version of pineapple bread pudding which was almost more like a dolce de leches dish with creme brûlée crust. Who cares, it was so dreamy. We also had these amazing tiny chocolate and almond croquettes which were cleverly served on spoons. Heaven. I remember at some point during the meal my fiancé and I saying how impeccable the service was. Our water was never less than 1/2 full all night. Plates were cleared very quickly and at the end we were allowed to sit and relax and finish our drinks. After we paid we were brought these little shot glasses of passion fruit mojitos on the house. It just made our night and we left so relaxed. Can't wait to bring everyone we know here!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Well, we've given Grazer's three legitimate tries and won't be back.  The first time we went, it had just opened.  It was a nice night and the place was full.  The service was slow and poor - we waited an hour for food and had to get our own drinks.  But we chalked that up to inexperience and have since been trying to find a reason to like the restaurant.  However, each time we've been back, it's been the same experience regardless of how busy the place is.  Last night it was empty (just my family and two others).  The staff is untrained (host/hostess and waitstaff alike), the service is as painfully slow and poor as any I have ever experienced, the food is marginal and they run out of menu items seemingly all the time (yet the wait-staff doesn't tell you until you order it).   Two out of the three times we've eaten there, they've given me no choice but to leave NO tip - now that's pretty bad.   It's a shame - the location is perfect and they've done a great job with the theme and interior decor.  But at this rate, Grazers likely won't be around long and is a waste of prime commercial real estate.  Bring on a worthy Maple Tree tenant!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is an absolute must for you when you stop by NYC.  It's within walking distance from the Soho district - perfect for my friend and I since we came here after a long day of shopping.  Although we did not make reservations when we came, I would definitely make one if you don't want to wait long.  We were lucky in that they were able to seat us right away since we came before the dinner rush...although most the dining room by then was full already.   After we ordered, we munched on the variety of yummy warm bread served with soften butter while waiting for our main entree.  I ordered the Balthazar Bar Steak with pommes frites and béarnaise sauce (but it can be served with maître d' butter instead).  My friend got the Moules FrItes - both dishes very absolutely fabulous!   I'm normally not a big fan of red meat, but the steak was done right here!  The medium-rare meat literally melted in my mouth, it was ridiculously tender and juicy.  Hands down, the best steak I have ever had!  Along with the béarnaise sauce (made with clarified butter & egg yolk flavored with tarragon) goes perfectly with the steak.  Now we can't forget about my friend's dish as well...the mussels were simmered in a seasoned broth & tons of herbs reduced with white wine.  The mussels were super fresh and everything was deliciously flavored.  We actually wanted more bread to soak up the broth... :)  Lastly, the frites - were amazing!!!  Perfectly seasoned & fried just right!  I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to try an authentic French bistro restaurant at a reasonable price.   My only compliant is that seating is tight (so we had difficulty with our numerous shopping bags...)and it's loud so definitely don't expect to have an intimate conversation here.  Otherwise, a MUST go when in the area!  :D  Bon appetite!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I recently had to plan a large group dinner and a couple of my friends suggested Rangoon. I had heard of the place but never had the chance to try it out. And I'm really glad I did! I originally had a group of 23, but due to scheduling errors, only 10 of us showed up. They were very accommodating and the servers were all very nice. Right from when we sat down, they starting serving us. Our first course was a spring ginger salad minus the shrimp. I absolutely love Burmese salads and this was no disappointment. The ginger was so strong but oh so good. And there were many other add-ins that gave it a nice crunch too. We were next served the thousand layer bread with potato curry. It reminded me a lot of Malaysian roti canai. The bread was nice and flaky and the curry had just the right spice level. Not too filling but a great tasting appetizer. Next came all the main dishes. I don't remember all the names, but we had chili shrimp, coconut curry chicken, vegetarian delight, and vegetarian Northern Burma fried noodle. The chili shrimp was fantastic. It was slightly overcooked, but the breading on the outside was just right and didn't drown out the meat. The seasoning and sauces was spot on. Loved every crunch. The coconut curry chicken was nothing special. I've had curry at multiple places and this one didn't really stand out. Vegetarian delight was same old, same old. Just your standard stir fried veggies with tofu in a mixture of sauces. Unfortunately, the Northern Burma fried noodles were awful. There was almost no flavor. I wasn't sure if they just didn't add enough seasoning, or if the chili sauce they used overpowered what little flavor it had. Either way, the noodles were a little painful to eat, with nothing but the ""spicy"" flavor greeting your mouth. And the add-ins weren't exciting either. The food wasn't that great, but the good dishes were pretty solid and there's a lot on the menu I'd love to go back and try. And the service was awesome and speedy. Pros: Service, variety of menu (so many options!) Cons: some bland flavors, a little pricey for portions Dishes to try: any of their salads, Chili Shrimp Dishes to skip: Northern Burma Fried Noodles, Vegetarian Delight","[1.0, 0.0]"

I kind of regretted it, though, because the falafel were not really hot; I think they'd been sitting around a little while, but the flavor was good.

"I need to know what is in their curry sauce that makes it SUPER addictive.  Curry rice is a comfort food, although I've never had any that was compelling enough for me to crave it on a regular basis just on flavor.  Go Go CURRY may have just proved me otherwise. It sucks that they don't give you fukujinzuke (the red seasoned pickles) for free, because those should just come gratis with curry rice... and I definitely wish they gave more cabbage.  But I still refuse to detract a star for that, 'cause I was pretty satisfied with the pork katsu + rice.  I don't like how you get a significantly smaller portion when you order the pork over the chicken, though... Go here on the 5th, 15th, or 25th of any month and get a free topping coupon.  Natto, cheese, extra rice, extra curry, fukujinzuke -- you name it.  If you're extra hungry and feeling a little rich, put down $12.50 for the Grand Slam Curry, a whopper of a curry platter weighing in at 5.5 pounds featuring all the toppings (pork, chicken, shrimp, sausages, and hard boiled eggs). May 5-May 11, the first 55 customers get Ishikawa rice.  Special.  Yummy.  Supposedly.  (I don't know, it tasted no different to me, but rice is always yum.) Am I wrong, however, for thinking that the L is... not so large?  I came here on the 5/5 birthday celebration, where all three sizes were $5, and thought I'd go crazy and opt for an L, and it just left me happily satiated, not in belly-aching pain.  Well, good news for me either way, right?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Godfather also owns the Seafood Bar & Grill right beside it (share the same entrance).  We opted to have some seafood since it had a nice full bar. The seafood restaurant was decent, but the main attraction is the full bar and TV. So, we sat down and ordered a round of drinks and appetizers (good raw oyster). So far, so good. So, we decided to stay and have dinner. HUGE MISTAKE! Second round of drinks came our way after we followed up on it (15 minute wait to pour beer, wine and soda, really?).  Worst - our order evidently never made it to the computer, according to our waitress. It was 'lost' in the cyber order world. Waitress comes back and says our order was lost and it would be a few more minutes. NOT! She came back and said - oops, probably 20 minutes. At this point, I couldn't deal with it anymore. I talked to the manager - another big mistake. He couldn't care less!. First of all, instead of walking to the table and apologizing - he did nothing of the sort. Second, he didn't know there was a problem. I told him - that's between you and our staff. Third, he asked me what he could do to rectify the situation. Now, I don't want freebies - I guess I should have said ""FIND A CURE FOR CANCER!!!'  Finally, he comes to our table to hand us a pen to sign our charge for our 'reduced' bill (we cancelled our order).

By far the best cheesesteak I have had since moving to Philly. This isn't your average tourist trap that puts a small amount of meat on the roll and processes you through a long line line.

"It's 12:33PM and the stagnant scent of burnt coffee is becoming too much to handle. I am in dire need of a cubicle escape. A ""cuscapé"", if you will. Impetus comes in the form of a craving. A SOUP CRAVING. Where to go where to gooo? I mean Au Bon Pain is just yards away, Cosi's not much farther. In fact, there's an entire food court brimming with stale, over processed, over-sodiumed varieties of soups a mere half block from my office. But I don't want any of that. I want something Fresh. Healthy. Delicious. Something in the realm of pureed kale, spinach, and cauliflower, seasoned with hints of cumin, cilantro and curry. YES, such delights exist in center city! It's called PureFare's green goodness soup and you would be insane not to worship its innate ability to satiate without overfeeding. I enjoyed this alongside a quinoa blueberry muffin (which, I am glad to report, contains WHOLE blueberries bursting with juicy goodness). Good things to know: +Seating is limited but it never seems to be overwhelmingly packed - there's one large shared center table, some stool seating along the windows and a couple of tables outside for the warmer months and/or those with polar bear skin. +Free wifi. +Service is a bit slow but I don't mind - I come here to get away from the 16-17-18 st. hustle bustle, anyway. +Prices are a little steep (specifically for the specialty drinks) but if you stick with a salad/soup/sandwich it's really quite reasonable. + The drip coffee looks legit, although I haven't tried it. +Interesting baked good options include olive oil/thyme muffins & avocado chocolate chip cookies. +They track your purchases through their website - after 12 visits you get a 20% off coupon & the site also doubles as a calorie tracker, if you're into that sort of thing. PureFare is definitely worth a visit, plus it's an excuse to eat a healthy meal! (although I have a feeling that homemade twix bar of theirs is rather decadent....).","[1.0, 0.0]"

Have to rsvp quite far in advance but you can do so on their website. Also, annoying that you can't get seated until everyone has arrived. The one other knock on the restaurant is that $200 is just ridiculous for bossam. It's a general gripe I have with all Korean food in New York but come on--the pork shoulder is $1 per pound at any meat market. To put this into further context, it's like paying a similar amount for an 8 pound turkey on Thanksgiving.

"We had dinner there last night (Thursday) with my son and daughter-in-law before heading across the street to Hartford Stage.  This was my 1st time at Dish.  There are a lot of reviews here stating that it is overpriced for the quality, great food but not a good value, etc.  Some of the salads/apps and sides are a bit heavy on the price but the entrees are not out of line for a restaurant of this quality.  This is formal dining, ie white table cloths, new silverware for each course, glassware extraordinarily clean, etc. We ordered cocktails and wine as we looked at the menu.  I had a V.O. Manhattan which was diluted when it arrived..  I suspect the bartender who made it had water in his ice scoop when he iced the glass before adding the liquor.  The wine list by the glass is extensive and fairly priced.  Very good selection. We began with 2 ""starters"" while sipping our cocktails & wine and reading the menu while chatting. My wife ordered a Ceasar salad, which we wanted to share.  It was brought to the table on 2 plates, which was a nice touch on the part of our waiter, Steve.  This was the best Ceasar I have ever  had. It was not drenched in dressing, making it soggy which I hate, but a drier style of dressing full of flavor and with a hint of anchovie taste.  No pieces of anchovie that would overpower the rest of the dressing.  Excellant. Next we ordered 2 sides(mac&cheese & brocholli rabe) which was plenty for the 4 of us to share. Very well prepared and freshly made. We all loved our entrees..chicken&dumplings, tuna ahi, hanger steak cooked to perfection &  the highly regarded tomato pie.  The tomato pie comes as a wedge which at first doen't look like much for the money, but it is plenty by the time you finish your meal. The ladies ordered dessert.  Very very good, especially the creme brulee.  The coffee was fresh and very well made.  I hate ordering coffee and it comes to you tasting weak and without flavor.  This was robust without being bitter. Our service was excellant and attentive without being over bearing.  The dining room was immaculate.  Overall a great experience and we will return.  Oh..almost forgot.  Show them your theater tickets and you get 20% off the bill.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Finally went to the Waiting room after reading the Star Ledgers munchmobile review.  I was very happy with my whole experience.  I liked the large open layout.  Don't have to worry about other tables being on top of yours.  Service was top notch. Decent draft beer selection.  Ordered the nachos as an appetizer, good amount of cheese and toppings.  Liked the salsa they served with it, not sure if it homemade or pre-made, it was still to my liking.  I had the lamp chops that I really, really, really enjoyed.  I would go back for them in a heart beat.  My husband had the ribs.  While good, he didn't care for the BBQ sauce.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stopped in to Ah'pizz for a quick early dinner the other night.  I was very excited being my family came to this country from Naples, to have what I thought was going to be a nostalgic experience.  Nope.  Fancy pizza oven, same ol pizza.  Nothing authentic about canned tomatoes and store bought cheese,  had the ""fococcia"" to start, it was a pizza with nothing on it, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't focaccia thick soft luscious bread with a crispy top of herbs and sea salt with good olive oil?  Next I tried the pizza Margherita, it was ok.  I was hoping for a nicer flavor from that wood oven, just didn't get it.  Had one other app and my wife had a pizza as well with mushrooms and goat cheese, very creative, total bill over $60.  Pricey for average pizza, I'll try one more time but I truly hope this was an off day.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I lived in Rahway for 11 years and this was by far my favorite pizza in the area; they consistently blow the doors off of the competition in polls of the best of the best local. The pie is a thin pizza, the crust get's a little crunchy but that just adds to the taste. The sauce to cheese ratio is almost always perfect and the pizza is always seasoned well! They have the usual toppings available, the amount of toppings they put on the pie is generous and some items available for topping that are not listed on the menu (i.e. prosciutto) if you ask. They have a full bar and usually a better beer on draught, beer specials throughout the week as well. It's definitely a step back in time as far as decor, but a clean and very welcoming place, VERY family friendly; there is also an upstairs room available for rent. Nancy's should be a stop on any pizza connoisseurs tour!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Visited Artichoke pizza during my NYC trip last month and I'm a fan!! place is small, cash only, we had to eat standing up, outside in the cold. The spinach and artichoke was just ok in my opinion, the crab was soso too, But oh man, the MARGARITA pizza!! the MATGARITA made it all worth it. the fastest time I've finished a pizza, hugggee slice, every bite was perfect, delicious, flavorful, down to the very last bite.

We started with the Rustico, which is a veggie, meats, and crostini platter. It was awesome. Great value on that appetizer, huge assortment of those items, well worth the $18. Then we each got a pasta dish. Tasted very fresh, homemade. I got the papardelle with wild boar ragu, it was delicious. My wife got the papardelle with fresh mushrooms which was also delicious.

"Lulu and Me has only been in operation since November, but they're already doing a fine job at being a great pub in a weird neighborhood! This area of Midtown is a weird mix of check cashing places, crappy t-shirt stores, and fancy 200-seat restaurants. Luckily, Lulu fills the gap for cute little bars with great food and a thorough drink menu. I came in on Friday night for a quiet dinner alone and enjoyed a Jefferson Bourbon cocktail and the eggplant rollatini. The food was delicious, but something to remember is that they do small and medium plates - order 2 or 3 things if you're really hungry, because 1 medium plate won't cut it. I shot the shit with the very friendly bartender and was overall pretty pleased with my service. The one thing I'll say is this - I think Lulu has a bit of an identity crisis that needs addressing. At first glance, it's a cheeky little candlelit gastropub with subway tiled walls and dark wood - a little French and moody, which I quite love.  But then you've got a huge TV playing some sporting event, and several people, including staff, screaming at said TV and bickering about some 'roid chomping athlete's current stats.  I'm not saying that you're not allowed to talk about sports in a cute little gastropub, I'm not! It just seemed like such a weird dichotomy. I am sure that once they've been on the block long enough, their personality and clientele will even out and we'll know exactly what kind of place this is.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was really looking forward to this, but I'm afraid I was quite disappointed on several counts. The evening started with one young woman at a nearby table screaming at the sight of a large bug, upon which their party promptly departed. The management was very apologetic about the matter and kindly seated us elsewhere after the incident, but the ambiance was rather sorely punctured by the thought that the bug was still out there. The appetizers we had were tasty (Kefi salad and cod), but the entrees were very disappointing. The roasted lemon chicken tasted more like fried chicken than roasted chicken. The outer edges of the chicken were so tough it was impossible to chew. The lemon sauce had an overpowering flavor and an unusual texture--not at all the subtle mixture of spices and herbs with lemon that I had been expecting. My spouse ordered macaroni and cheese and this, too, was sub-par. To be fair the attempt itself was creative, a mix of several cheeses with greens (spinach?), but the result just did not seem to work. I'm always frustrated when I see a restaurant with so many good reviews and it turns out to be a dud. Perhaps they were just having an off-night, but we will definitely not be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"What??  What??  Those are the words the three of us kept saying to each other while seated upstairs in the balcony.  We eat out regularly and decided this was by far the loudest restaurant we'd ever been to.  After a while, we actually gave up talking to eachother - that's how loud it was.  We couldn't hear a word any of us were saying.   One of the servers came upstairs holding 2 salads and walked around to each table only to find nobody ordered these salads.  He left and came back with 2 more and again walked table to table only to find they belonged to nobody.  Meanwhile, we were still waiting 1/2 hour for our salad.  It was pretty disorganized and the waiter even gave us a look of frustration. I LOVED my chicken parm and someone else mentioned on here that it was a good portion - not too much.  The hubby got orichiette with shrimp and asparagus which was really good.  The peach/goat cheese salad others have mentioned here was terrific.  Our daughter ordered the alfredo and it was pretty tasteless.

Aside from the fact that I got the 'leftover dumplings' that were already pan fried and left out for 1-3 hours?, the dumplings were not as good as I anticipated. --The skin was too thick (this depends on your preference but thinner skin tastes better and gives you the right portion of meat and dough). --Meat wasn't juicy and a bit tough I felt like I was eating dough with meat as a side order.

"I came here three times and I'm never coming back here again. I ordered the chicken bento box the first time. Salmon the second time, and Chinese food the third time. None of them reached my expectation. The chicken was over cooked, the salmion was black one side, and the chinese food had no taste. The teriyaki sauce in the bento box was so watery. The stir-fry chinese food was very bland and the meats were dry. None of the dishes had the wok-seared taste. Several of my friends went there and they said this place is not good. I don't know why I always see so many people seating there. Is it becuase thye posted the 100 top restaurant poster on their window? I guess the non-Asain people can't tell what real Chinese food taste like. Just like I can't tell if I'm eating good Italian pasta.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So my first time experience....went with a large group and 3 kids (all under 3, 1 of which is only 8 months old). We elected to do the ""family special"" where its $10 per ADULT (14 of us bare in mind). Pizza and salads were good and service was ok. The bill comes and they charged us for the kids! Now if they ate any pizza to start with or if they had told us that the kids are included in the headcount to be charged, I wouldn't complain. The kids had their own meals we ordered off the menu so I asked the waitress to correct the bill. She comes back and removed one of the charges but not the other two charges. With it getting late and the kids getting restless/tired...out group elected to just pay it and move on. Thought I'd share this experience since it wasn't fair to charge us as they did nor to offer a resolution. Poor customer service.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Not the best Asian buffet experience for me...  I relocated from the land of Asian Buffets (San Francisco Bay Area), and this one was just ridiculous.  The basics (rock hard sweet and sour pork, stale fried rice, fishy smelling sushi, or watered down flavored soups) were not appetizing at all, and the atmosphere is just plain weird.  The scariest part of our buffet was when the ""waitresses"" sat down to eat, and brought out bowls of stuff that smelled like ""doggy doo""...  (Seriously...)  Whatever they had in those bowls smelled like dead something, and our group almost started gagging, because of that stench.  They said it was something fermented (fish or some type of meat), and they were eating that stuff like it was the best thing around...   Never again will I attempt to eat there.  They need major renovations, cleaner seating areas, and fresher food, not to mention hoping they would eat their smelly dishes in the back or away from customers who may not be used to those scents...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been going to Brazi's for years and was very surprised to see all of the low ratings for this restaurant.  Brazi's is an Italian restaurant for real Italian people.  You won't find anything resembling a dinner at the Olive Garden here but if that's what you think Italian food is supposed to be, then you will be disappointed.   I went there for lunch yesterday and although the restaurant was not packed, the bar area was full.  They start by giving you a variety of breads in a basket from pepperoni rolls to chibata to foccacia squares.  The bread is cooked here fresh throughout the day so they come to your table warm.  I ordered the eggplant parm which came with a side salad and a side of pasta.  Everything was delicious.  Their sauce is light and homemade- you can see thick cuts of tomato in the sauce.  I'm not sure what everyone else is taking about or maybe they've changed but the eggplant was cut very thin but stacked pretty high on the plate.  The salad is nothing special but very fresh.  The other people I was with had the salmon and chicken parm and said both were great.   The decor in this place does leave something to be desired and all looks a bit ""fake""but I'll take that as long as the food is good.  The prices are reasonable- $15 for the eggplant and chicken parm.  Brazi's does get very crowded on the weekend nights so make reservations if you plan on coming then.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Maybe we are just used to Americanized Chinese food but everything tasted a little off. Egg drop soup had a puzzling flavor until we discovered the corn. Fried dumplings were larger than normal with a kind of fluffy meat filling but served with a tasteless oily sauce. Pork fried rice had too many peas and the pieces of pork tasted off - it was bland enough I was looking for the soy sauce that wasn't there. The hot tea was very nice. The service was good.

"Finally!  A place that actually gets it right with the decorations.  It's all in the editing, people. In regards to the food and cocktails, I'm also a big fan.  We started out by trying the crawfish boudain balls, and the watermelon punch.  The boudain balls were amazing and not too spicy, so I could actually enjoy them.  And much to my surprise, the watermelon punch was super tasty, instead of just super sweet, like I was expecting.  It tasted like lemonade mixed with fresh watermelon juice.  Sooo good. As for dinner, the boyfriend had the blackened catfish w/ mac & cheese, and I had broiled shrimp w/ lima beans.  While I am a bit biased, being from the south and all, I still think this place was pretty spot on with everything.  The blackened fish was cooked perfectly, and the mac and cheese was almost as good as mine ;)  the broiled shrimp did have a lot of garlic on them, but they were still really good, and the lima beans were my favorite of all.  I can't help it, beans cooked with ham just remind me of home.

At least it was medium-rare as I had wished.  The prices are appropriate for the location, but honestly, you can get a better steak in a less well known joint. We also had oyster for an Appetizer.

"Don't come here if you are looking for high quality authentic Italian cuisine. This restaurant is geared more towards tourists and the like. I would say the food is a couple steps up from an Olive Garden. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad but there are plenty of authentic Italian restaurants to visit before going to this one. What this place is good for is large groups because they have large tables and they also take reservations. The portions sizes of the dishes are huge and are meant to be shared. If you do come, I would recommend the penne ala vodka. As another reviewer mentioned, they put an abundance of garlic in their dishes.

The addition of hyper-savory anchovy mayonnaise (charged up even more with shiro miso) slathered onto the bun accomplishes what the space shuttle's booster rockets do: Ramps the power of an already serious system that even on its own is impressive.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The Pig and Prince is THE (and only) gastropub in montclair. The restaurant offers both a unique dining and environment and menu. Taking the place of the former Montclair train station, the decor of the restaurant is chic, but not over the top...well, maybe with the exception of the giant rooster painted on the back wall. The menu is extensive and eclectic. We started off with a cheese platter that showcased a variety of Pig and Prince's cheese. The cheeses ranged from a creamy goat cheese to cheddar that was as sharp as a razor blade. The cheese platter was accompanied by freshly baked raisin bread. The platter was wonderful, but could have used more raisin bread. We then moved on to a Bacon apple bor-gonzola fresno  and red onion pizza. It was amazing! The fire baked pizza exemplified the perfect marriage of salty, savory and sweet. We also had the duck confit risotto, which was dressed with fig and toasted pistachios. Unfortunately, the risotto was bland and a disappointment. I was expecting a delicious symphony of sweet and savory, but was left with flavorless duck and rice. Overall, the Pig and Prince is a unique restaurant for adventurous foodies. Though pricey, the food is freshly prepared and delicious (with the exception of the risotto) Their unique menu and setting definitely makes itself stand out from other restaurants in Montclair.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Food is good, but staff is unprofessional. We had guests over from Europe and started dinner at 9PM. Lots of food and wine and a big bill. When it came about 10PM, they asked for us to pay as they had to close the register. The bill was about $700 and I paid and left a big tip. As soon as they got our money, their attitude changed. When one of our European guests asked for them to call her a taxi, the head waiter said ""I can give you a card with their number on it. Do you have a cell phone? If not you can borrow your friends cell phone to call the taxi."" So, they can't even make a call and the guy just got a $100 tip?? They started to turn the lights off and came over at 5 minutes past 10 and said ""can you wait outside for your taxi"". It was freaking 40 degrees out and some of the guests had not brought their winter jackets! Could they not let us wait inside while they were clearing up for another 10 minutes while the cab arrived?

"Bumping and grinding was not my intention, but I had no choice but to receive and give when I walked into Barrio Chino on a Friday night around 7:30pm for dinner. Luckily we had a table reserved for our group because it was more than eight and apparently if you have less, you'll have to stand and wait since they don't take reservations for anything below. The restaurant was extremely packed. Patrons were sardine side by side with hardly any room to move. The restaurant was dimly lilted with Chinese lanterns as well as other Asian décor and buzzing with its distinctive LES vibe. I was enjoying myself until the menu arrived. Initially, the price of their dishes seemed reasonable (ranging from $10-$16) but when our meal came, their portion was nothing more than tapas size or as my friend referred to them, model size portions. My fish tacos were good, but each taco were no more than 3 inches in diameter and it certainly did not fill me up. As for their drinks, I ordered their tamarind mojitos ($12). It was overloaded with kosher salt on the rim and compacted with ice --definitely not worth its price!! Furthermore, it was sloppily made which made my glass slippery and sticky when sipping. All in all, I had a good time and an interesting experience. Would I come back here again, probably NOT! But would I recommend it to someone else, the answer is YES!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The wait staff need to learn how to make eye contact - why would you consistently go from one table straight back to the kitchen without having a glance around? I've been there many times when there's only 2 or 3 people (not parties) in the place and had to go find the server.  People have limited time for lunch and they should realize this.  There is one server who seems to get it and I feel bad lumping them all together - and perhaps the big issue is that they probably just aren't willing to hire enough servers because when there's 4 or more parties dining its pretty clear that the one server is overwhelmed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We're going back this weekend!  I'm not sure if we will make it for dinner or brunch this time but we are absolutely going back. We finally tried out Brooklyn Star and everything you read is true.  The food is insanely good and you will be full all day if you have brunch.  They have communal seating so you may end up sitting with strangers but your mouth will be full of food so you don't have to talk to them unless you want to. lol I had the Apple Johnny Cakes (aka pancakes) with scrambled eggs, super thick bacon (almost like short ribs) and a hash brown that I was too full to eat.  We also had buttermilk biscuits to start (with butter and honey) and cocktails.  Hubby had the ham steak with fried eggs and mashed potatoes.  I tasted his meal and it was delicious too.   We got out leftovers to go but I'm not really sure how to heat up pancakes.  I did eat the leftover biscuit (15 seconds in the microwave) and I ended up tossing the hash brown since it had too much of an onion smell for me.  Although, I'm sure it was really tasty.  Brunch, with 3 cocktails was $61 + tip.   I wish I knew the name of our server (tall, dark hair, tats).  He was super attentive without being annoying and we rewarded him with a 20% tip.  For brunch you cannot make any changes or substitutions so be aware.  This includes the bar.  No Mai Tai's and no Long Island Ice Tea.  Hubby is not a fan of fried eggs so he just threw them out.  He was already full from the super thick ham steak and mash potatoes plus the buttermilk biscuit.   I plan to try the mac & cheese with bacon, the shrimp & grits and the chicken & waffles over the next few visits.  We have found our new brunch spot. Edited 4/21/13 So we have been back a couple of times and I tried the mac & cheese with bacon (late night around 11 pm), they spicy chicken wings (late night around 11 pm) and the chicken & waffles (brunch) in addition to a Pimm's Cup and Dr. Pepper cocktail (late night).  The food is really good!!  The service has been good too, each and every time.  I can't recommend the Dr. Pepper cocktail (Dr. Pepper syrup, gin and grapefruit juice) and I can't recommend the Pimm's cup (sort of like a Long Island, but not); however, the food alone is worth the trip.  The John Daly (vodka mixed with iced tea and lemonade) is very good.  A pitcher is $32 which is about 4 servings.  I still need to try the shrimp & grits. Get there early for brunch, and by early I mean by 11:45 am for the 12 pm opening.  If not, it's better to just wait until around 3 pm.  There was a line by 11:55 am of maybe 30 people.  I don't recall ever seeing a line down the block waiting on brunch and a few other people in line made the same comment. Plan to spend about $60 for brunch for two with two cocktails, more if you go for dinner. Edited 4/28/13 I finally tried the shrimp & grits!  Excellent. The biscuits were a bit over cooked (visibly burned on the outside)  but still good.

He wandered around with our food looking for the right table. When he finally got to us we told him that it took to long for the food to come out. He looked at us, turned around and walked away. After explaining to the waitress how unhappy we were she sent the manager back over to our table.

"Let me preface this with the fact that my review is based on the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  I didn't eat anything and definitely wasn't dancing during this visit! Lengthy story: A few months ago, I was riding my bike home from work and I was hit by a car and thrown from my bike.  Of course, the driver took off.  I had a helmet on, but my head hit the pavement so hard it cracked the helmet and I ended up with a severe concussion.  I didn't know this yet, but I did know that my bike was messed up and I couldn't ride it anymore, so I pulled it (and myself) out of the street and started dragging it.  I had the sense to call my boyfriend and he left work and rode over to find me.  It was clear that I wouldn't be able to walk all the way home, so he asked a friend who was (conveniently!) riding by to walk me to Silk CIty, where I could hopefully wait while my boyfriend went to get our truck to drive me either to the hospital or home. Good Samaritan friend and I walked (well, I almost crawled in at this point) into Silk City, he explained what had happened to me, and they immediately set up a place for me to hang out while I was waiting for my boyfriend to return with the truck.  They gave me a beverage and repeatedly checked on me while I sat there.  In fact, two of the ladies talked to me and asked me lots of questions, which was incredibly helpful considering the massive concussion I just experienced.  They refilled my water many times and were incredibly caring and concerned.  If it weren't for their hospitality, I would have been stuck out on Spring Garden, bleeding all over the place and hugging a cement planter while I waited to be rescued. It took me a really long time to recover from that bike accident (I'm fine now!).  I'm fully convinced it would have been worse if the kind people of Silk CIty hadn't gone out of their way to make sure that I was safe and alert in those critical moments right after the accident.  Thank you, Silk City!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Was on the phone with a friend the other day and the Balut came up into the conversation (had a bad experience before, I knew then on that I'll never do it again). The next day he brought me here after going on a scavenger hunt around the city. We drop by in the evening and this place was packed ... the host said it'd be a two hour wait. However, my friend saw that there were a few seats by the bar so we went for it instead. After enough beer, he then decided that we should go for the Balut. I figured might as well since I'm already here. As I gathered up my courage, my friend somehow managed to convince other patrons ... we all ended up ordering it. Crack the top open, season the Balut  to your liking and go for it. For some reason, it wasn't bad at all... to be honest I don't mind eating again now. After the adventurous experience he got me Pancit Malabon and he went with Dinuguan with Puto. The  Dinuguan with Puto was really good even better with a side of garlic rice. Great for groups or causal date. Would definitely come back and to also try the Kamayan Night!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Get: ~pig's trotters (4.5 stars): juicy and savory shredded meat, surrounded by meltingly delicious fat from the skin, wrapped up neatly in a delightfully crispy outer layer.  Need I say more?  Served with acidic lentils to cut the fat.  Some of the best trotters I've had, although it's hard to go wrong here.  $24 ~black label burger (4 stars): my first bite was perhaps the best burger bite I've ever had, juicy, fatty, slightly sweet from the caramelized onions, with a bit of char and tender savory meat.  However, from there on out, the best overall burger I've had still goes to Spotted Pig.  Why?  The bun was totally soaked by the time we finished, so all the juice of the burger leaked out and we were left with a still tasty but not so tender melt-in-your-mouth meat.  Still, it's totally worth getting this, at least once.  The fries are also fried just right: crispy outside with not-starchy inside.  $26 Skip: ~bread (3 stars): not served warm, but a small loaf came in a cute rustic bread basket, accompanied by a round pat of butter and a small dish of sea salt.  Crust wasn't crispy anymore, but it was decent.  Don't waste your appetite on it though.

"I went there for lunch with a friend having read very mixed reviews of the place. Many recommended the beer but not the food. Well I thought I would give it a fair try in any case. Don't waste your time or money on this place!! Upon entering we waited near the hostess podium for about 5 minutes before anyone paid us any attention. There were 2 people sitting at the bar, a table of 4 and a table with 1 - so no reason to have slow service. We noticed one server and one bartender - it was only 12.30 pm on a Sunday. Being someone who loves different foods, I was really looking forward to a good German meal. We ordered a Gulaschsuppe (beef stew with potatoes in a red wine sauce) and a Kasseler Ripchen (smoked pork chop with sweet and sour red cabbage and a potato pancake). A female server took our order, but the food was brought to us (in a timely manner) by a male server. He had his thumb half way into the gravy of the Gulasch and spilled about two spoons of it on the floor and table just before placing it in front of me. He didn't seem to care as he said Oops and wiped it off with a paper towel. Actually I was a little shocked that he didn't think that his thumb in my food was unacceptable and didn't know what to do at the moment. My friend's KR was mediocre and overpriced at $19. My Gulasch was tepid to warm at best and after I tasted it from as far away as possible from where the server had his thumb inserted into it, called the server and told her that it was too cold to eat. She said ""no problem - we can heat that up for you"". Really!! I think that is the least they could do. I did get another bowl 5 minutes later, which was just as cold as the first. I was having horror thoughts as to what was being done to my food when it went back to the kitchen. Who knows. We left most of the food on the plate and decided to cut short our lunch. We paid our check in cash and the server came back with plenty of notes in change, but decided to round up the bill and didn't bring back 40 cents. Of course I know it is only 40 cents, but from when is it the right of any business to round up a customers check. I highly recommend not going to this place, What a waste to time, money and a nice afternoon when there are so many other nice places to go eat in Philly!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Almost $20.00 for six tiny pieces of THAT?...   No way!!!! I don't mind paying that much....

"Incredibly fresh and flavorful bahn mi served by the nicest staff and at unbelievable prices.  Usually I am all about the classic bahn mi, but I have to say there shredded white meat chicken  bahn mi is out of this world.  As someone else noted it is like crack.  We have probably order 50 of these in the last 3 months and every time the chicken is absolutely perfect with no mystery meat or fat....just perfectly cooked chicken.  Get it spicy for an extra kick.  Summer rolls are also done perfectly.  While we still think the best pho is in chinatown, Hanco's is pretty good but not something we get regularly unless we can't make it to chinatown.  Love that they are on seamless and give you no attitude like some places for using.  Make sure you get their sandwich / soup cards as every 10th (i think) item is free.  Another tip is that bahn mi is 50cents cheaper here than their park slope location.  Just wish they stayed open later.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went here 2 nights ago and I STILL go to bed dreaming about this place. Maybe that's why I wake up drooling on my pillow.... But really, I could spend DAYS here eating and browsing and I will never get sick of the place! I am IN LOVE with Eataly and I can't wait to be back again!! Eataly is pretty much Costco/food heaven for the ultimate italian food junkies. Set up like a massive whole foods, the entire place is a market, each section (dairy, meat, produce, dessert, etc) containing an area to eat and shop. My friend and I wandered around gawking at everything and honestly, the place is kind of overwhelming. People say it's a tourist trap, it's crowded, and it's pricy....and that's all true BUT it's only a shitty experience if you make it a shitty experience. It's not a cheap, sit-in, intimate restaurant but don't let that discourage you at all!! My friend and I went in knowing wholeheartedly that we love to eat italian food, we love dining experiences, and if we're going to spend money on food, it needs to be on GOOD FOOD. And Eataly definitely met our standards. With that being said, it can get pretttyyyy packed at night (we went on a Thursday night) so here's what I recommend: 1. put your name down at a sit down place that you want to eat 2. go to the center of the market for cheese, wine, bread, and assorted salumi as appetizers. By the time you're done with the appetizers, your table will be ready. We started off by putting our name down for the pasta/pizza place (in the back corner)  and then ventured off to the center of the market for some cheese and proscuitto. We were told that the wait for the pizza/pasta place was about 40 minutes, so why the hell not EAT while we wait? #foodjunkieproblems We got the $16 ""Platto di emilia-romagna""- a plate of cheese, melon, and prosciutto, which also came with 6 delicious slices of bread. SERIOUSLY, IT'S SEX IN YOUR MOUTH. At the pasta place, we split a $25 bottle of Rose (yea, two petit girls killed a bottle of wine. classy bitches) and the postacci, a ravioli tossed in lemon butter and pistacchio. it was delectable but sort of dry. I recommend getting something more tomato based! THEN, we went to the dessert area of the market and got gelato to end the night! I recommend the sea salt chocolate, melon, or milk gelato (melon and milk taste awesome together, btw). Mario Batali & Joe Bastianich. oh you fancy huh?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The waitress with the Stevie Wonder ""Visions"" tattoo is rude and offensive, going so far as to argue with customers (especially black customers). I watched as she argued with a black customer who was having beers with his buddy. The customer was talking, and it was apparent he was expressive when talking as he used his hands to express himself, as some people often do. The waitress kept walking back and forth and eventually told him to watch his hands, he gently placed his hand on her shoulder, told her he did not see her as his back was turned and that he was expressive and used his hands when he talked. He apologized  whereupon she again told him to watch his hands and not touch her....eventually he told her to go to hell as he felt offended.....MY QUESTION IS: SINCE WHEN IS A WAITRESS ALLOWED TO ARGUE WITH LET ALONE TELL A CUSTOMER TO WATCH HIS HANDS WHILE EXPRESING HIMSELF IN A CONVO (ESPECIALLY SINCE HE WAS NOT PLACING THEM ON HER)----NEEDLESS TO SAY THEY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER AND I  FAIRLY CERTAIN HE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN------","[0.0, 1.0]"

They were rare (which I don't mind, but I prefer a little more texture contrast), simply seasoned, and enormous. Another minute in the pan and they'd be perfect. I'm pretty critical when it comes to seafood, but they do it justice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Where to start? -Its expensive as hell . -An incredibly long wait. -Hot, cramped eating area. Yet i still gave it a 5 star.  We ordered the regular pie with mushroom and it was delicious.   I love thin crust pizza and this just makes my stomach smile.  The sauce..oh the sauce and the basil...sigh.  Was it the best tasting pizza ive ever eaten, maybe..maybe not but what makes it special is Dom himself. Theres something about the master himself making pizzas for 8 hours a day for the past 40 years that adds a quality to the experience that is hard to quantify. I probably wouldn't make the trek tout to brooklyn all that often, but if you've never had the chance to go, it is definately something worth goin for.  hey coney island is a few stops away, give it a shot~~ fyi: if you want to grab a seat, id advise you to get there right when it opens, oh and for some reason plain pies come out faster than if u were to get a topping.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Considering myself to be somewhat of a pizza connoisseur, I had to try Santucci's when I heard that they had opened a location in my neighborhood. I went in to find the place pretty full, which is always a good sign. My friend and I couldn't decide between getting a pizza or a panini, so we decided to get both and share. The square pizza we ordered was topped with a delicious tomato sauce and plenty of yummy cheese. The garlic bread cheesesteak panini was delicious! The rib-eye steak was sliced perfectly and not fatty or chewy. I would vote for Santucci's as the best pizza in the city, hands down!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"BEA and it's very kind owner + staff care for their guests like family. It is so refreshing to find a place here in nyc that has the perfect balance of service, menu and atmosphere.  The cocktail and wine selection is well curated. The menu offers a scrumptious selection of both comfort and sophistication foods. The Atrium area is perfect for small parties as well.  I have been here a few times now and the most important thing I can share is that everyone that works there cares about you and if you're having a pleasant experience. BEA is a true gem! Please check this place out for yourself. Cheers!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It was a cold and blustery Saturday night in Chelsea when my companion and I hobbled into The Red Cat for our dinner reservations.  We decided to try it out for restaurant week, or so we thought.  After being seated at our intimate little table, we noticed the waiter didn't leave the menus specifically for restaurant week.  I ask him what the deal is.  He (very politely) tells me that restaurant week is every day but Saturday.  Stupid me...shoulda read the fine print.  No matter.  The prices at The Red Cat are reasonable enough to get an appetizer and full-sized entrée for the same price as a restaurant week prix fixe menu would have provided.   In fact, THANK GOD restaurant week didn't apply that night because then I would have never been able to experience the BACON TEMPURA with black-eyed peas and baby 'bello mushrooms.  Holy hell, I could eat that dish every day.  They say bacon makes everything better, but imagine thick-cut bacon (3 huge slices) deep-fried in the lightest, fluffiest, crispiest tempura batter you've ever had and piled on top of black-eyed peas with mushrooms lightly swimming in a salty broth of heaven!  I ordered this dish because of my love of bacon and because it sounded interesting.  Ted Allen said this dish was one of the best things he's ever eaten and I'm gonna go ahead and second that.  This dish was positively divine.  Bacon lovers, rejoice! For my entrée, I ordered the grilled pork tenderloin with blue cheese-tomato gratin served with wilted spinach and caramelized onions.  It was innovative and had all the things I like in one dish, but, unfortunately, was under seasoned for my taste.  I was just grateful to find a pork dish that didn't involve apples as an accompaniment.  The pork itself was perfectly cooked and very tender, but I had to add a fair amount of salt to bring out the flavors. We were so stuffed from the gracious appetizer and entrée portions that we declined desert.   The wine list offers a nice array of wines both by the glass and bottle and the full bar seems like a fun place to hang out at if you don't have a table or if you're waiting for one to open up.   I got a great feeling from dining at The Red Cat.  The other diners were clearly people from the neighborhood and NYC locals.  The staff was completely helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.  All in all, this was a very good dining experience and, truth be told, my companion and I wound up spending about 50 cents more ordering regular priced appetizers and entrées than if we'd had the restaurant week menu option.  Very satisfying, indeed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I FINALLY had a chance to go to Ippudo and lunch is definitely the way to go.  There's still a wait but it won't be for long.  The Tonkotsu ramen was delicious esp with the extra pork belly but I do think Totto's broth is a lil better if we're making this a competition.  I'll need to come back and try the pork buns next time.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"After putting Sakagura on my long list of places in New York I want to check out, I finally decided to venture into midtown with my mom and Chris to see what all the buzz was about.  I had a long list of things I wanted to try (especially because the portions are small) and we decided that everyone at the table would order two dishes (to start) and we'd add on as needed.   We ordered the soft shelled crab (one of the specials of the night), eggplant, chicken, fried potato balls,  shrimp balls, and one fish dish.  Everything was delicious (especially the crab) and we all left incredibly satisfied.   Sakagura also has a LOT of sake's to choose from (they also help you pair the sake with dishes you're ordering) and the waitstaff is really helpful.  I'm trying to make reservations to go again, but they're always booked now!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Food -  Excellent balance with quality engraved in each aspect of the food.  The food tastes brilliant, and little touches and attention to detail on presentation just makes the food even better. 2. Drinks -  Perfect drinks with a touch of class.  Love the metal/steel straws that come with every drink 3. Service - Even though it was a large party, services were just on the mark.  From the host of the establishment taking out coats, to the servers who were patient, and ensuring that everyone was attended to, and following up to ensure that they had everything they needed. 4. Decor -  I have been to many many indian places but this one just exudes class and you can see how well thought out the everything was.  This is a place I can hang out with friends and family and just relax to good drinks and foof...or have a formal client meeting as well. 5. Attention to detail - Just what it says....embedded into everything that they do. In short, hands down one of the best indian restaurants I have been to!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Five of us ate at Basso56 last night expecting a more than decent meal as a result of reviews on yelp, chowhound and even Zagat.  Our experience was profoundly disappointing and confusing.  In fact disillusioned.  Some did warn us that is was a tourist place not worthy of true foodies.  I should have listened.  My first clue that this was not going to be what I expected was when the waiter, a perfectly gracious guy, asked where we were from and was taken aback a bit when we said UWS and the Village.  So here goes.  The drinks were quite good. the barata tasty.  Except for one main dish, a special wild mushroom ravioli, the food was disappointing at any price.  Some inedible. If you want good pasta go to   Lupa, Cacio e pepe, Apiary, Gotham just to name a few.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I gave it five stars because of the following three things they do exceptionally well: Handmade Pasta Nino is a master. He makes it by hand in the front of the shop and often shows you the creations before sending it back to the kitchen. The flavors and textures are amazing and the quantities are just right. Friendly Service The brothers and Nino are very friendly and they greet me any my family whenever we walk in. You might occasionally come across a young server that just learning the trade, but I've never had an issue. Soups Try the homemade chicken noodle! It's a must for anyone suffering from a cold. The sausage and lentil is a favorite of mine as well. I've never been disappointed by anything I've gotten from Antimos.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So I've been living in Jackson Heights for a few years now, and this is my first time coming here.  I was very impressed by all the reviews and I know I must try it out.  That being said, I wasn't blown away by the food here.  We ordered the curry puff, fried calamari, shrimp pad thai and green curry duck.  The food was just ok and average, it wasn't like WOW its so delicious!  The dry bean curd in the pad thai has gone stale, either from leaving out too long or its way past expiration date.  The batter on the fried calamari was done right and it was very crispy and it didn't flake off, but they can season it a little more.   I do have to say the service here was great and they never let me go empty on my water glass.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place  is a true ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" rating... With tons of ramen place to choose from, this is definitely one of my favorite and I truely believe it is one of the best this great city has to offer.. The noodles is cooked perfectly well, the both is rich with spices and bold flavors.. The Chashu just melts in your mouth.. A bowl of ramen is not a bowl of ramen without the extra order (and you need to order the extra order!!!) of chashu and pouch egg of course... The other best dish of this place is the baby portobella bun..   I know what you are thinking.. how can a non pork bun be good... but god had cast the secret recipe of this bun to thee chief and each bite is just heavenly.... The best thing about this place, beside the amazing food, it the great service.. The staff is friendly and this place unlike Totto and Ippudo, the vibe is so relaxing... You can just  sit there have a nice ice cold glass of Kirin, and savor over a great bowl of ramen for hours.... Oh.. unlike Ippudo or Totto..

"The best brunch in the area, hands down. Their specials are always imaginative and delicious. Their different French toast creations are legendary. They are so nice and the prices are so reasonable it almost seems impossible. The only downside is that you have to get there very early to be one of the first in, or be prepared to wait a long time. Not uncommon to wait an hour BUT I do it all the time because it's beyond worth it. Plus they take your number so you can walk around the surrounding area, and they'll call you when you're up. They have an amazing selection of house made sausages. My favorite is the chicken/apple. I often just order a bunch off the menu and take most of it home, just so I can try things before they leave the menu!! Seriously, this place is amazing.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been eating my way around NYC for over 5 years, and I have a lot to say about food in general, so I finally decided to start a Yelp account.  I want my first review to be Ippudo because it is one of my few 5 star places in the city. Food- The most amazing aspect of Ippudo is their pork broth, it is so much better than Totto Romen (which is a light chicken broth). It is rich, savory and really hits that umami taste bud. The noodles are made fresh in-house, one of the very few places in the city that does so, and it is always perfectly done. My favorite is the Akamaru Modern with the soft boiled seasoned egg. It has a special miso-paste and fragrant garlic oil, and the egg is perfectly yolky and never over cooked.  The appeititzer are good, but I go for the ramen. Pork buns are yummy, but Momofuku's are better. The cucumber and shishito peppers are also nice, but small for the price. Ambiance- People who are critical of Ippudo say that it's too much of a scene, and it's not authenic Japanese. All I can say is that the ramen kicks ass, and I don't the enviroment. The Line- I always go for lunch, right before they open ~10:55am. This way, I never have to wait. I also go either by myself (it's that good) or with one other person so I don't have to wait for a table (they have communal tables to seat indivuals and couples). If you go at 11:15am or during dinner time, you can wait 1-2 hrs, and food does not taste as good when you are grumpy because you waited so long.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Too bad, so sad. What was once my favorite place is now a place to never return. Beer list is awesome, but Philly is a city full of restaurants with great food and craft beer lists, so on to the next. Manager took my empty beer glass from table. Didn't ask if id like another. Nice to have sat in a booth next to the bar; I didn't have to get up and walk too far from my table to ask for another beer after waiting for our waiter, to no avail. We had a friend show up later and ordered a beer and sandwich. Beer came and after about 45 minutes of waiting, no sandwich. Surprising seeing as how the manager took tht order... They offered to comp our forgotten sandwich  if we waited while they prepared it at tht time, but after waiting so long we opted to go elsewhere. I was surprised and a little taken aback by the fact that even after speaking with a manager who was very apologetic about the errors of the evening, he was happy to charge us full price. No worries, we won't be back. Judging by the lack of traffic compared to the past, I suppose many other locals have opted to go elsewhere as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This restaurant is CRAZY expensive! Not only is it expensive, but the portions are so small. They charge you almost $8 for a regular/small pho yet, gives you so little food in it! This is not a good practice! I decided to buy the 2nd big size pho ($7.95) and it was the size of a regular/small pho that I could have gotten at ANY other Vietnamese restaurants in NJ and NY at a cheaper price. In it, there was a very small batch of rice noodle and probably 4 slices of beef, 1 ""hair string"" of beef trip, diced up beef tendon! This is truly a ripped off. At any other Vietnamese restaurants, for the same order at a CHEAPER price, we would have gotten double or triple the amount of food. We had to ask for soup spoons since we were only given chopsticks. We ordered a large spring roll and they only gave 2 tiny cups of dipping sauce (the fish sauce) for 7 people to share! Unbelievable! At all the Vietnamese restaurants I have been to, they will give each person their individual bowl of sauce to dip into. The dipping/fish sauce is NOT expensive so don't try to cheat the customers on that considering the crazy high price they charge. My friend ordered the pork chop with white rice and egg. It came in a small appetizer plate! They gave 1 small pork chop (other standard places give 1.5 pork chop or more) and a small scoop of white rice. Again, white rice is NOT costly. We had to ask them for fork and knife; I don't know how they expect us to eat the rice on the small/appetizer plate with chopsticks. So, for the high price we paid, we got very small portion food with OK services. We went on a Sunday night (8:30pm) and there were only 3 tables (including ours) filled, but we had to remind them of the cup of ice we had asked for 15 mins ago. The food overall was good. Yes, the decor was nice. No complaints there. However, it surely doesn't justify for the price. I also don't have a problem with the high price, but if you are going to charge double the price and be CHEAP about the portion, then that's a real problem. Pho 99, don't try to cheat your customers! It's not nice to rip your customers off. We will NEVER go back to this place and definitely not recommend it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was going to start out my review by naming all of the things here I tried and what I liked about them, because ya know that's never been done before, BUT then I may as well just take a screen shot of the menu. I've been here for both happy hour and dinner. On one occasion, came here with about a group of 6 for a birthday dinner and after a few rounds of apps/meals/drinks, the chef sent out a few more dishes to our table on the house. Cool atmosphere. Lovely service.  I was impressed. I will be back for sure. One caveat: I should add that I originally heard of Alla Spina because they were voted best Philly pretzel in Philly Mag 2012 (yup that's all it took) now while GOOD I personally couldn't say BEST (anyone tried the pretzel at Bru?!)... and nope not going to stop me from ordering them every time I come.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I no longer live in Philadelphia, but I visit my parents several times a year, and it's the one restaurant that's always on my must list.  We tend to go early, which avoids the occasional back-ups (and waiting outside) that can happen for later reservations.  The small dining room is comfortable and nicely appointed without being stuffy, and, strange as it may seem, I always make a point of visiting the restroom, if only to wash up, as it's one of the nicest around. The staff is superb--always friendly, always correct and knowledgeable (and it's always nice that Pierre comes out to check on diners--not just the regulars like my parents, but everyone).  But of course, the reason we all come is the food.  We were given a small serving of cold avocado soup with a morsel of tempura-fried avocado.  The soup was delicate, with just a hint of tomato oil, and the tempura was, to be honest, better than the tempura I've had in LA's Little Tokyo.  So light, not oily at all.  Continuing to our appetizers, I had a crab salad, which was a lovely combination of crab salad, watermelon and avocado mousse.  Yum. For my main course, I had grouper with a panko-dried apricot crust (not at all heavy), deliciously sauced and accompanied by somewhere between a tomato puree and a tomato chutney.  It was accompanied by a trio of clams, all deliciously sauced (the sauces here are better than virtually anywhere). I finished with a light and perfect floating island.  It's so good that you find yourself downing every last drop of the accompanying sauce and wishing you had another island or two floating into your mouth.  Cap that off with their homemade macaroons and meringues, and another fabulous dining experience has come and gone.  I'll just have to be satisfied with the sense memory and dreams of the next time. This is truly one of the best restaurants anywhere, and to their great credit, they've delivered each and every time I've eaten there.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I almost want to give these guys 4 stars for what they do well, but the majority of their menu forbids it!  I haven't had everything, but they tend to overcook their meats to the point of being dry and hard; I haven't had lamb from there that I can really tolerate.  Also, the falafel is tasty, but dry.  To note, I've only had the meals as delivery, so it might be better in the restaurant. On a good note, their pizza is great, and their grape leaves are great - both important things!!  Having spent a lot of time in New Haven, I've had trouble finding good pizza in the Hartford area, but here is a place that delivers at all hours and has a fine selection of very tasty pizzas. Bottom line positives; great pizza, grape leaves, availability negatives: mediocre meals and overcooked/dry meats (delivery) If you're coming by late nite, it's a great place to grab a snack and a slice or two, and if you're ordering delivery in the area, I highly recomend their pizza and a side of grape leaves.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I think this is my favorite Asian place in Jersey.  Came here with the family the other day and this review is based solely on my order. Fish ball and beef ball soup-tasty, but I wasn't used to the beef ball inside the fishball concept. Pan fried pork dumplings-great, you must order this.  The skin is perfect thickness, filling is nice and chunky grind of pork and it was pan fried with the just right amount of crunchiness.  Dip it in hot oil and vinegar. The marinated cucumber in hot sauce is a must.  So tingly hot and the right amount of sweet and sour. Pork chop over rice was delicious.  It wasn't greasy and was juicy.  The rice had a nice topping of meat sauce.  I liked the half of soy sauce egg and pickled vegetable on the side. My daughter's Shanghai wontons were just OK, although she enjoyed it.  We asked for wide hand pulled noodles added to the soup and she loved it. The last time we went, I had the shredded pork with pickled radish with wide noodle soup.  I loved it.  However, the husband wasn't too thrilled with his spicy beef soup.  He said the broth wasn't rich enough, he only had one piece of bok choy and very little meat.  But as I said, my review of 5 stars was based on what I ate. Our daughter had the mango smoothie.  We had a taste and enjoyed it very much.  The right amount of sweetness and a hint of tang from the yogurt drink they add.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It is so woodsy and warm, I never want to leave. And, I have never had bad service and find the employees to always be very nice when we eat there.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Food and service great, not good but great!  Atmosphere is the question.  More like a party, a LOUD party.  Noise level so loud I could not take a cell phone call, had trouble hearing people at our table of four.  Do not plan to return.  However, it appeared that locals like it.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"In brief, was my first time there and brought a friend who just arrived from London. Went on Thursday night, October 2, 2014. We were rushed through our dinner from the recitation of the specials to the check being dropped off along with our desert and coffees. The restaurant was crowded and it is obvious that the owner wants as quick a turn-around as possible to maximize income for the evening. Periodically, throughout the evening, he approached other tables to ask how their dining experience was, but never approached our table. These patrons may be regulars or local people that frequent a lot. That is no excuse for poor customer service. Upon leaving at 8:45 PM, there were two empty tables for four and one couple waiting to be seated. I approached the owner and told him that although the food was very good, we felt as though we were being rushed through at lightning speed so that our table could become available. His reply was, ""Well, we need our tables."" Really, Giorgio? You may need your tables, but you need some lessons in proper customer service and how to conduct a dining experience that doesn't make your patrons feel like you stopped on the road for a Big Mac and fries. I have eaten at his two former defunct restaurants and won't be frequenting this one again. There are two key ingredients to a successful restaurant: 1) good food; and 2) excellent service. This establishment is sincerely lacking in the later. There are many fine Italian BYOBs in Philadelphia of a much more excellent ilk, namely, Mercato, Branzino, and La Viola. Giorgio, I suggest you take a page from their respective books!","[0.0, 1.0]"

My suggestion is to go sit at the bar and drink beer...if you decide to order food, try sticking with bar-app type of stuff. (you'll be less disappointed than if you order anything on the menu that sounds like it could be creative) The Office can be a fun place to hang with a group of friends, but it's never somewhere that I'm like ""hey, I'm really craving the office for dinner...they have a really good stomach ache there"".","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had a nice dining experience here.  I made dinner reservations for five people a few days in advance on OpenTable.  When we arrived on time they had the table ready for us right away.  The dinning room is pretty large and had a rustic feel with the some Roman art on the walls. Service was top notch and our server checked in on us the perfect amount of times.  Water glasses were refilled as necessary and plates were removed when finished.  If you are celebrating a birthday their staff will surround the table and sing happy birthday. What we tried: -Focaccia Starter bread (6/10) - pretty tasty but overall average bread, they do refill the bread basket as needed -Burrata & Prosciutto Di Parma with olives (9/10) - it is hard to go wrong with burratta and prosciutto but everything here was fresh and tasty -Lobster Seafood Risotto (7/10) - The risotto was a bit on the salty side but overall had nice flavor and texture wise cooked perfectly. There was also a generous amount of seafood. -Lobster Spaghetti Carbonara (8/10) - They make their own pasta in house and you could tell.  The pasta was cooked perfectly to complement the seafood carbonara sauce.  The sunny side egg on top could have been cooked a bit more runny but that might be my personal preference. -Tiramisu (9/10) - Probably one of the best tiramisu's I have tried.  The rum they added enhanced the flavor profile of the cake tremendously.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First of all, I love fast casual joints. And I love burgers. This place is about as good as it gets. The burgers are a little pricey, around $7.50 for most of them. you can also get the burger salad, which is literally any burger form the menu, minus the bun, plopped on a bowl of fresh greens (real greens, not iceburg lettuce). However, the burgers are delicious and creative, and the onion rings are out of this world. We had a Bobby Blue Burger salad and a Dallas burger. Both were delicious, solid choices. We also had the vanilla bourbon milkshake and an order of onion rings. Both of those were also delicious. Total for two people? Just $30. and that's including an alcoholic milkshake (that we split).

In fact, I wish this place was near my apartment and my job. I love both types of noodles they offer (flat or egg noodles), wonton soup, seafood soup, Cambodian noodle soup & the house special shrimp roll.  I have yet to try a rice dish.

"I was here last weekend with a friend, after taking her on a quick tour around Philly. First impression is that it's a nice large place, but a little too noisy. There's no long line of people waiting to be seated since it's very spacious (which is really appreciated). Despite the number of diners, food and drinks came really quickly. We started off with a dish of grilled calamari, which was very well seasoned. I found it nicely cooked, but my friend thought it was slightly overcooked. Over to the main course, I had a special dish of grilled, vegetable-stuffed pork chop, while my friend had a dish of veals and clams. Both were very nice, from seasoning, cooking to plating. I really love my dish, where the pork chop went deliciously with the sides of mashed potato and vegetables. The portions were also really large and we were both stuffed to neck after the main course. Still, we magically managed to finish the desserts, mainly because it's the best tiramisu I've ever had in Philly - better than many other excellent places, including Modo Mio and Giorgio On Pine. Overall I think it's a 4.5, with the noise being the biggest setback. We were very well served, even without a dedicated waiter/waitress. The food was awesome, especially the tiramisu, which I believe is a must-try. The place totally deserves the 20% tip I wrote at the end of the meal and this 5 star (although a round-up it is). I enjoyed the experience overall and will definitely come back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Chef Francesco Palmieri - after dining at your restaurant for the first time during Bloomfield NJ Restaurant Week 2013 my first and lasting impression is that you must not have a great deal of concern for your customers.  We, like so many other customers left the Orange Squirrel feeling angry and offended - how can you look at the plates that were being served and think that anyone would be happy?  Portion sizes were an embarrassment, flavor was forgettable and prices were very high. Dinner 1 Appetizer:  Duck Confit, size was 1.5-inch square, flavor was just OK Entree:  Skate with Meuniere sauce, filet was about 2.5 x 3 inches, sauce tasted like vinegar, there were 9 baby green beans on the plate - nothing else, served on a dinner plate with lots of plate showing Dessert: Bread Pudding, served in 2-inch ramekin, nothing else on the plate, flavor was good Dinner 2 Appetizer: Shrimp Kataifi, 1 prawn wrapped in some kind of a pastry mess - not kataifi, shrimp had no flavor, three sauces on the side were dime sized, not sure of their flavors they were too small to really taste Entree: Petite Filet, size was 1-inch by 4-inches by 1-inch high, mashed potatoes that were not seasoned, served on a salad plate, no flavor to the meat Dessert: Tart, 2.5-inches across, filled with what looked like blueberry yogurt and a few blueberries thrown on top, just awful Cost: $30 pp + 3 beers at $9 each (NYC prices?) + 20% tip included = $110 You should be embarrassed","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Had the fake vegetarian BBLT (double bacon). The 'bacon' itself was actually tempeh, not greasy or sizzling enough to deserve the bacon title. But the balsamic mayo had nice peppery seasoning, and the sourdough was crunchy and great.  Thumbs up. On the down side, the dark pulpy mimosas weren't as strong as I like. My friend found her sausage too blackened and her french toast ""really tough."" The music is old-school: Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Jackson 5. I liked the church pews.

"The first time someone brought me here, we were on a third date. I was suspicious. Suspicious that he had been too lazy to make reservations at a restaurant that takes reservations, mostly, but also suspicious that this wonderful thing he was referring to as a soup dumpling, something I had never heard of before, was really just wonton soup. 8 Pork Steamed Buns later, I was a wholly changed individual. JS soup dumplings have since become one of my favorite things to eat, right up there with everything else that poses a potential mess-problem and is sort of unhealthy. I have even expanded my preferred terms of endearment (Sweetie, Honey, Babe) to include ""Joe's Shanghai Soup Dumpling"". It doesn't get much more loving than that.   The menu is rather extensive, perhaps too extensive for thorough familiarity. Everything I have had here has been good (scallion pancake) or great (try the noodle soups), but you will see from looking around at other tables that the soup dumplings (pork or crabmeat/pork - I prefer the pork) are definitely the go-to items. The two issues that I have with Joe's Shanghai: They do not deliver and they do not take reservations. Almost always at capacity, you will be forced to wait between twenty and forty minutes to be seated. Where do you wait? Outside. This is all fine and dandy during the summer but during the colder months? Not so fine, not so dandy. Side note: Once inside, you may or may not be seated at a table full of strangers.

"An update to my last review.  I came here again this week.  First off, the food is wonderful and has become my favorite place to eat sushi in my area.  For $14, I can get a platter of 18 pieces of sushi, a salad, and soup.  It's delicious. But the reason for the update is this: Get your act together, Ninja Sushi!!  You deserve 5-stars but the ordering situation is sort of a mess.  They say you can order online (either from their website or from GrubHub).  The first time I tried this, I received a confirmation e-mail and when I showed up, they had no record of my order.  I chalked it up to a fluke but decided I should probably call next time.  So I did.  When I showed up, there was another poor sap waiting for his online order... which he explained was ordered online 90 minutes ago and received an additional confirmation over 60 minutes ago that his order ""was ready for pickup""... and yet there he sat.  Felt real bad for him because he had been there for at least 30 minutes (as I waited for quite some time for my phone order) with his toddler that he was trying to keep entertained.  Bravo, kind stranger for keeping your cool. Come on Ninja Sushi.  The food here is terrific.  It really is.  You're very kind.  But you're going to lose business if people can't rely on your ordering system.  Please fix it and I will remove this review.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"BRUNCH REVIEW. We made reservations at A.kitchen for Mother's Day brunch, it was a perfect day and they had the doors open and everything was pretty much open air.  We were sat immediately and the service was great and not too overly attentive.  We started off with the 4 pastries, all of them were very good, not as good as the doughnut misto at Alla Spina but definitely up there.  I ordered a cocktail, the Standard Breakfast which was very good, I had 2 and coffee which was nice and strong.  For the mains we went with the rhubarb french toast and the wagyu steak and eggs with a frenched onion and potatoes.  Everything was awesome, the steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the potatoes were hot and crunchy.  The onion and eggs (over-easy) were also well prepared.  There are 2 reasons why I didn't rate this place 5 stars, one is because everything on the menu was pretty safe and after our dinner at Fork I expected something a little more adventurous.  Second, the timing for the arrival of the entrees was a bit off, 1 arrived and we sat awkwardly for 3-4 minutes until the other arrived, it is somewhat nitpicky I realize and it wouldn't prevent me from dining there again but at an upscale restaurant like this I would expect the timing to be on point.  Overall a quite enjoyable morning right off the square and I would absolutely recommend A.ktichen for brunch and I look forward to returning some time in the future for dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It's such a comforting space that I found myself wanting comforting food to match it. I also was all about their alcohol selection. The savory horseradish martini is surprisingly delicious, though I might suggest splitting one with everyone at the table because downing a whole one is quite a feat. The Bard alum cocktail was INSANELY strong...My dinner companion literally thinks the drink gave him a fever.

Pretty basic brunch menu, but it included some twists (wish I had tried the breakfast sandwich with pesto- it looked awesome). Cappuccino was great, omelette was awesome and the fries it was served with were okay. They don't accept AmEx, but it doesn't make that big of a difference.  I'll come back when it's nice outside and the wait doesn't matter.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I used to go every thursday night! last couple of times it was not good! and the portion is getting smaller and smaller and its not cheap!

"I've been here 3 times, because I wanted to be fair when writing a review and not judge things by one or two potentially sub-par experiences. I suppose I went with high hopes since Bobby Flay has his name all over this joint, but I'm sure that if Bobby made burgers like these, he wouldn't be as famous as he is. Don't get me wrong, they aren't bad. They just aren't anything special, and definitely not worth the price you pay for them. The sweet potato fries are good, but again, probably not worth the price. I like the various sauces and the cool, retro-style decor. It's a good place to go eat lunch by yourself and not feel like that weird lonely person. It's not a good person for a large group because you probably won't all find seats together in the cafeteria style seating.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"OK. So, I guess people in BV don't get up early to go out to breakfast because most places here open at 8:00 a.m. However, I am a working girl and have to be at my desk by 8:00. So, where does a girl go for a Friday morning meal before work? Morning Glory! Or so I thought... Morning Glory opens at 7:00 a.m. At least that's what is says here on Yelp and on Morning Glory's website. We get there a little after 7:00 today. The place is locked up, but we can see activity inside. A few minutes later we are joined by another guy who thinks the place should be open. We pace around on the sidewalk. He stands in the doorway to get out of the fog rain. 7:10 - nobody lets us in. 7:15 - nobody lets us in. The tables are set with condiments by a woman, a guy is sitting at the counter. Three customers stand outside...adios MG. We took off for Fitzwater Cafe -- a bit further away, but the door was unlocked, we were seated and fed in no time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This was our choice for our first anniversary. We couldn't get a reservation any earlier than 9pm. This was just done with us as we had plenty of time to enjoy our suite at the Vermont Hotel before dinner. The place felt comfortable and cozy, and not overly dressy. The staff was very friendly. The one cocktail I had was different, well executed and potent. We had to try the Parker house rolls and I'm so glad we did! These came out at the se time as out tartare which was quite nice. We then split a bit of hake in a brown butter over a carrot purée with a mild pepper I can't remember how to spell... Moving on, we then had a cheese plate with a local triple cream and a local blue. Superb. The potions were generous enough to allow us to enjoy everything we had, but small enough that we ate all we ordered.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went here for a birthday dinner with a really large group of people. I really wanted to like this place. It was very cute and I've been looking for a cute Haitian Restaurant that allowed me to sit down rather than Take Out. We were never given a menu or an explanation of whether it was a prix-fixed meal, but I didn't personally care because it was a birthday dinner so cost was not a factor for me. The food was alright, but it too a long time to come out. We also had to ask for things once or twice before getting them (We were the only table in the restaurant so it wasn't crowded or busy). One of my friends asked for a wine glass and after the second time of asking, the waitress said ""Ok already, you've been asking for that glass for like 2 days now!"" My friend was completely caught off guard by the rudeness of the staff and just to decided to continue to drink her water. There were also other instances of rudeness which were completely unnecessary. Including the owner calling one of the members of the group cheap out loud in front of everyone (Keep in mind a menu was never presented and we never received a physical bill. The waitress just went around collecting $43 from everyone). My red snapper fish was delicious but was overshadowed by the cons of the establishment. Service plays a big role in the dining experience for me. I rather save my money and eat elsewhere that won't ridicule me for requesting for a wine glass or call me cheap because the owner refused to give us a menu or an actual bill. Saveur Creole needs to work on their customer service skills and their process for large parties. If they are doing a large party they should have a prix-fixed menu with a detailed description of what will be served; that way there isn't any room for arguments between the staff or customers.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Eva H. wrote a one-star review below, and I simply have to jump to Marigold's defense.  I had many of the same dishes she did,  and the best way to describe it is as a ""culinary oddyssey"".  My only conclusion is that Eva either entered into the experience with the wrong expectations, and/or has no taste in food. First of all, to address the price: we did not buy into any special ""tasting menu"", and were treated to 11 amuse bouche, on top of our appetizer, entree, and dessert, and the entire experience cost us 60-65 a head including tax and tip.  For 14 courses, I consider that an extremely competitive price, even in Philly.  Compare it, for example, to Bibou, and you will see that they have nearly identical pricing structure. With regard to quality: Eva goes out of her way in attempting to describe excellent food in a negative way. The ""molten rotten cheese"" was a 2-year-old aged cheddar, and it wasn't rotten.  Either she has no idea what cheese is supposed to taste like, or has a strong need to apply her narrative of ""terrible meal"" to even the most straightfoward experiences.  I'm reminded of the scene in ""Can't Hardly Wait"", where William (who has never had beer) exclaims, ""Nobody drink the beer, the beer has gone bad!"" On a similar note, the chilled chestnut ravioli was a big favorite at our table of 6. Let me set the record straight: the food quality is extremely high.  I know it's my word (and the words of nearly every other reviewer) against hers, but the technical and artistic skills on display are world-class, and I base that on my own experience dining at Chez Panisse and other top restaurants throughout the U.S.A., Europe, and Asia. Lastly, let's talk about pacing: Marigold is a place you go for a slow, intimate dinner.  Our meal lasted 4 hours, and for us this was a *feature*.  We brought two bottles of our favorite wines and found the rate of 10-15 minutes per course gave us time to talk, drink, savor, anticipate, and celebrate.  Expert timing. All I can imagine is that Eva H. was extremely upset (and rightly so) that she was being charged double for a ""tasting menu"" that offered far less than twice the value.  Given my 3 experiences dining at Marigold, I cannot imagine it being a worthwhile investment, and I would have found it disappointing in the extreme.  The reason for this, however, is only because I so greatly enjoyed their normal dining experience.  Let me recap that last point loud and clear for those skimming this review: IF YOU ARE CONCERNED THAT YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE TASTING MENU, PLEASE STICK TO THE REGULAR MENU!  IT HAS 10-15 COURSES, AND INVOLVES PLENTY OF TASTING! In conclusion, PLEASE DO NOT use Eva H.'s review as the basis for your decision on whether to eat at Marigold.  Her tirade has all the signs of sour-grapes whining from a woman who accidentally bought a ""tasting menu"" no knowing what that meant.  I am certain that she had a negative experience, and I am truly sorry she couldn't enjoy what they offer as much as I did.  However, her single-minded need to cast even the best parts of her meal in a negative light does little to support her review's credibility.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As at least one other has mentioned, this place is not for everyone. The place is disorganized and staffed by misanthropic hipsters.  This really wasn't an issue until the last couple of weeks.   We used to order for the office from here.  After today, we won't.  While we enjoyed the food, the experience is tedious.  Our orders were generally large and were almost always incorrect or incomplete.  Today the order was wrong and incomplete.  I talked to the manager about how to improve this and he didn't seem too concerned.  He recognized that they made a mistake but sounded like it would likely happen again.  I told him that would make us go elsewhere and he said ""well that's ok. We've been here 16 years and for every customer we lose we'll get 15 more. We're ok losing you.""  Well, I guess that's one way to rotate your customer base.  Too bad though, the food was decent but we just can't keep going to a place that screws up our orders.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"3.5 stars A lot has already been said about what is essentially on top of the brunch list for Murray Hill. Even though Penelope does stand out within the walking radius of Grand Central, I can definitely think of many places that will serve food of equal quality without the excruciatingly long wait you may experience here. To put things in perspective, I planned to join some friends in Penelope a while back and was unfortunately over an hour late to the meet. I walked in to find that they had JUST been seated a moment ago. By that time, the brunch menu was no longer available and it took another ~40 mins for simple lunch sandwiches to arrive at the table. During this time, we entertained ourselves with the famous tidbits in the drawers (see pic attached!), and observed the mix of tourists and young Manhattanites that contributed to the fun and noisy atmosphere of Penelope! From the menu, the chicken meatball sandwich deserves a special mention, and I knew right away that what I was eating was 'mos def better than what everybody else at my table had ordered! That being said, the chicken artichoke, club sandwich, burger, and mac & cheese are all decent in their own right, but I can't justify how long Penelope will make you wait for them! The drinks and service are also a cut above, and I guess help ease the pain of the wait! In short, Penelope is a classic noisy NYC spot; leave it to the tourists to observe the local lazies who don't want to brunch in other 'hoods, or if you're desperate for meatballs, try going there in the 'off' hours.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Although we are perennial early brunch fixtures at Sweet Afton, we did not realize the cold comfort food that is  their Mac & Cheese (Irish Cheddar, Muenster and Gruyere with Brooklyn Bacon) until a recent birthday dinner.  As I listened to my friends wax ecstatic at the prospect of eating the Mac & Cheese here, I was wondering if I was surrounded by people far too easy to impress.  And yet, when I lifted my fork and brought it to my lips, visions of angels and trumpets came to mind.  The topping was crisp and crunchy and the rest was creamy and velvety, it was too wonderful and comforting on a cold evening that I wanted to elbow my dining companions so I can have the dish to myself. :) The Salt and Pepper baby back ribs dry rub with shaved cabbage fail in comparison to the Mac & Cheese while the Sweet Afton Burger remained a runner-up.  That the Mac & Cheese is great is but icing on the cake at this neighborhood place that boasts of incredible drinks  like Apple jack Manhattan and Afton Fizz which had bourbon, burnt honey, lemon and egg whites, that warms even a cold heart on a chilly night. And, don't forget the fried pickles.   It was a great night of food and drinks rivaled only by the excellent company that can sing the chorus of  ""Flow gently, sweet Afton"" with me.  ~_-","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went to Drunken Monkey last night, after hearing a lot about this place from friends of ours.  Took a colleague of mine who I've been planning to celebrate his residency at Mt Sinai hospital after planning to meet for so long.  He said he hadn't had a good Indian meal in quite some time, and I, myself, LOVE Indian Food, so we decided to head over to The Munkey. Upon entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised by the charm of the decor.  Being in the nightlife industry, myself, for some 17 years, I tend to take notice of construction, details, and attention to detail as I've seen places with their lights off and places with their lights on and how cheap or not so cheap a construction can be.  These guys did a great job with their build out.  You can see they used quality everything in bringing the place to life, and I sat down in hopes that the food would reflect the quality of the decor. We started with Tandoori Quail which we could see being hung from the tandoor seekhs that were being hung through the opening of the kitchen window.  It made us have to order this.  Completely done to perfection, cooked perfectly, and great blend of spice and flavor.  You can tell that this is the freshest quail that one can get.  We also order a Chili Cheese Toast, which was heavenly.....reminds me of a concoction that my mom used to put together in her kitchen with cheese and green chilis.....amazing!! For our main dishes we ordered the Lamb Chops, which were as tender and juicy as anybody could ask for as well as the staple Chicken Tikka Masala.  All came with a nice array of accompaniments.  Anytime I hit a new Indian Restaurant, I always go for the fail safe dishes - Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Chops; if you can't do those right, then it doesn't even make sense to get adventurous into the good stuff, let alone come back.  Drunken Munkey not only gets it right, they get it right to the point that you remember it the next day in such a good way.  We also got the Crispy Bhindi, and all our plates were literally licked clean. Their cocktail list is also off the hook.  I had some gin based cocktail, named along the lines of The Army Navy, which happened to be made with my favorite Gin, Bulldog.  Any place that carries Bulldog knows quality.....it is my favorite Gin. What really earned a page in my book, is that not only was the food really really good, but you can see how much the owner really cares about his place, as when it got really busy, he rolled up his sleeves and started helping the staff.  As a small business owner, myself, I respect people who are owners that are willing to put their hands to work when needed.  It's no surprise why this place was so busy, last night, the freezing cold. Score for Drunken Munkey!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I heard a lot about Amy Ruth's before going so I had really high expectations. Let me start off by saying this place is so convenient to get to, so don't let the fact that it's in Harlem deter you from trying it out. It took just about 10 minutes to get from Times Square to the 116 stop on the express train.   It's a very unpretentious place and it almost feels like you're stepping back in time as you walk through the door. There's plenty of seating so we didn't have to wait. Note that there's a back room if the front gets full. Despite all the rave chicken and waffle reviews, I decided to get the ludacris (luuuuuda) which was 4 chicken wings. They were really tender, juicy and fried to perfection. The hot sauce, which I doused across the chicken, was key. To be honest, the sides were not great. The Mac and cheese was particularly dry and felt like it had been sitting out for a while after it was made. The candied yams were so sweet that I winced when trying them. The mashed potatoes and string beans were nothing special. The only thing I really liked were the collard greens, which also seemed like the healthiest option. I didn't try the cheesy grits but apparently they were only okay. J really enjoyed his smothered chicken and devoured the entire quarter chicken before I finished a single wing. My sister got the same thing as me and liked it. A got the chicken and waffles, which he enjoyed, despite multiple cries of ""Diabetes"" while he was eating. Overall, we agreed a solid 3.5 to 4 stars. Artery clogging, but worth trying!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Unbelievable - such a disrespect - April 6 2013- I went there by 3pm and a guy, the hostess says that We have to wait ONE hour, We are party of tree. It was very weird because We could see one free table for 4, another for 3 and the last one for 2 on the first floor, at least 9 seats available. Then, I go to the restroom on the second floor and I see others 8 seats available, 3 & 3 + 2. WE WASTED 40 minutes looking one table for 4 available on the first floor and decided to kindly ask again what's is going on? They told us that's because They were calling a few clients numbers and waiting them to come from their houses??? because They've a reservation.

"Haven't been back here since it was with the old owners. I stopped going here because the service sucked big time and food got horrid. So since Honeys had about 30 people waiting for brunch yesterday morning we decided to go around the corner and give the old Silk City Diner a try. Well the place looked great, but sadly, the service was still the same. We sat at the bar; the waiter never cleared or set up our placements. I had to push the empties of coffee and juice glass in front of me so when my meal came there was room to eat. The waiter did manage to finally take his last check off the table midway through the meal though. I doubt there was a tip. The runner came out to setup our silverware because the waiter never bothered to replace the setting. Its a diner right? ....so I was kinda shocked when I didn't even get a water shortly after sitting down. The waiter never refilled our coffees or even asked how we were doing the entire time...standard waiter stuff and it wasn't like he was busy. It was a regular crowd, no rushes. He was just lazy.. or a bad waiter. Its ashame because the decor was great the food was good just the service lacked.

"So I was really looking forward to heading back to Jane because I had such a great experience there for dinner.  I made brunch reservations for 4 at 1:45.  We arrived early, checked in with the hostess, and waited outside because the weather was unseasonably beautiful.  We checked in with the hostess again at 2 and she said they were running behind. Well, we kept waiting and the next time I looked at my watch, it was 2:15.  Now when putting forth the effort to make reservations, one expects to be seated in a timely manner - maybe wait 5, 10 minutes, tops. Well, when these hostesses were asked the 3rd time when we'd be seated, they replied rudely, never apologized once, and kept saying ""10 more minutes"".  Also, when they came outside to call names you could barely hear them and they gave no real effort in finding the people they were calling.  Utterly disappointed and won't likely return - not for brunch anyway. We ended up leaving and going to Dos Caminos for brunch, which is kitty corner. Highly recommend this place, especially if you're waiting forever at Jane!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Let me start by saying that prior to my most recent experience, I absolutely loved North 3rd. This is the place that I would take friends who were visiting from out of town. Their atmosphere, blood orange margaritas and bloody marys are amazing and I think Jack is one of the kindest and most pleasant bartenders I've met in Nolibs (he gives patrons candy!) As you can see, I've been here enough times to know that my experience on 11/15 was an isolated event, yet I found it so unacceptable that I never want to go back. Around 1pm, I sat at the bar with my friend and we both ordered bloody marys from an attractive brunette female bartender wearing a blue shirt. Everything was totally fine until I asked for water. She pretty busy and was moving around a lot, so I waited until she got closer to my end of the bar and I said ever so politely, ""Would you mind bringing us two waters whenever you get a chance?"" She appeared not to have heard me, so we just waited a few more minutes until she settled down a bit. My friend then asked her a second time and she flippantly responded and said something along the lines of, ""yup - whenever I get a minute."" It was now apparent to us that she had in fact heard us the first time, but I guess chose not to respond. This rubbed us the wrong way, but she got another server to get us waters quickly after that, and hey - it was busy. I get it. But then I started noticing her being rude in so many ways that it flat out annoyed the hell out of me. Customers were walking to their tables and she was walking behind them trying to get back behind the bar, but they weren't walking as fast as she wanted so she started doing this swiping hand movement, shooing them to go faster. This happened several times and was even saying loudly and rudely, ""EXCUSE ME"" and ""MOVE!"" I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND BEING STRESSED OUT WHEN BUSY - but when people are spending their hard earned money at your restaurant, PLEASE do not treat them like they're an inconvenience. In the midst of all of this, 2 other of our friends entered the restaurant and came to stand by the bar with us to discuss if we should get a table or not. She did the same thing to them, telling them to move rudely, so I said to my friends, ""hey - get out of this girl's way because she's being a total bitch."" I'm sure she heard me, and I'm not proud of this moment nor do I think it was appropriate of me but...the truth is the truth. She then asked us what our plan was, and we said we would take a table. There was 1 table available in the corner, and she said, ""Ok I think that table over there is open,"" so we started walking there and she said, ""Wait - the hostess needs to set the table. Actually, it's fine, go ahead."" So we all sit down, relieved to be in the corner and out of the war zone, and the hostess comes over a few minutes later. She proceeds to scold us like children and condescendingly says, ""Next time - you need to see me. You really lucked out today but we usually have a wait and you sitting down would have messed that up."" We told her that the bartender said to just do it, but she still continued to speak to us like children. We sat there in shock as she went back to the bar and we saw that she and the bartender were staring and pointing at us. This further proved how unprofessional they were acting and made us feel like we should leave - so we did. We all walked out, and as the 4th person in our party walked out, the hostess approached him and said, ""What are you even DOING?"" Welp - we left and went straight to Standard Tap, where the bartender was amazing and WELCOMING. I've never been treated this poorly at any establishment, nor have I witnessed service industry professionals treating others this rudely. Like I said, I was a huge fan of this place, but I will not be returning. I understand that being short staffed is stressful for employees, but it never gives you the right to treat customers as inconveniences. If you're frustrated at work, try your best not to take it out on people who are paying you. If I was rude to my clients, they'd take their money elsewhere. This is no different. Being rude = losing business. Last thing - I raved about this place to my friend who was visiting from New York. I took him here and I was SO embarrassed that this happened.

"I must be in butter heaven!! It all started with the Escargots in garlic butter.  Really the Escargots were good, but the sauce was excellent.  We literally wanted to lick the entire plate of garlic butter off.  (I know it sounds gross, but it was so good).  We were taking the bread they served and literally swiping the garlic butter clean.  This lady next to the bar was looking at us and cracked up cause we were sooo happy eating bread + garlic butter. OMG, but it was so worth it.  By the time we almost licked the last drop of garlic butter off the plate, we were almost full already, but then, our entres came. Homemade Linguine with clams - woah, super good, (on the dry side, but it was totally fine with me), so buttery tasty, mm mmm good. Pork Belly - I'm not a Pork belly person, but I thought it was good, and the person who ordered it finished the whole plate and said it was amazing. Duck Confit - Woah, the chips that is drench in duck fat was so amazingly good. Banana Ricotta Tart - Banana heaven, right there.  So freak'in amazing! Around $50 per person if you don't order a drink.  Definitely worth the price, not some place I become a regular in on a weekly basis, but I would definitely splurgh here like once in a while.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review about any restaurant.  The food was ok.  The first time I ordered delivery the delivery man overcharged me and included his tip in without asking and was very short with me.  The second time I ordered the lady who answered the phone was extreamly rude and so unprofessional.  Everytime I asked a question, she cut me off midsentance.

"You could almost drive past this small, intimate and friendly restaurant on the corner. Once inside, you will me seated at some type of tiny table, with either cushions to enjoy to sit on or right int he middle of the room like i did with my guests. All around the place are framed photos, artwork, sculptures, and other various traditional Thai artworks. Its truly very warm, inviting and romantic. NOW FOR THE FOOD. Two items to get: Curry puffs: they are 3 large triangular shaped curry puffs for about $8, which consists of a soft but flaky dough outside and the inside..is just mushiness but GOOD mushiness and a great flavour profile. you will be hit in the back of the throat with some flavour--it was a similar feeling and taste to an Indian Samosas Tom Yum Soup: Vegetarian option is what i had--and for $4.50 for a cup you will fall in love. For such a small cup there was a broth that tasted like it had been simmering for a whole day, it was overdosed with veggies and the spice was the perfect amount. I wasn't crying but i deff felt my nose get a lil sweaty. Good things right here people Others: Fried Calamari- not a fan and way too overcooked reminded me of shitty onion rings. Mango salad- i was not a fan of this--my friend got it and she liked it but wasn't in love. yes it was a large salad, but honestly --not enough mango. more apples if anything Red curry-  Lawd jesus this was amazing. it was creamy, yet liquidy. not thick at all but when poured over some rice--it coated it well. i got it with tofu instead of meat and was in love. i would have liked to see more veggies but everything about this sauce was on point. i wanted to take a bath in it. service wasn't that great. we were waiting awhile just to give our orders. food took some time to come out. we were one of the first ones there (only a group of 5) and we were the last ones to leave. basically we got served last which was...weird. i don't know if this has to do with reason which previous people have stated but i don't wanna touch that issue. but it was a bit slow and they didn't come by to see how we were. parking sucks! and its fucking freezing in here! but i will be back oh lord i will. *also we were a group of 5 but they added a gratuity to our bill. wtf?! * usually its 6 or 8..our bill was only $100","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Only Australian food I've ever had prior to coming here was trying out the meat pies at the Tuck Shop on E. Houston and steak at Outback, which I know doesn't count. Wasn't too impressed with either. My friend suggested we try The Thirsty Koala in the ethnic food Mecca of Queens: Astoria. Looking at menu, I noticed they didn't serve koala. Good, leave the cute critters alone. Nothing really stood out as something exclusive to Australia, actually. We started off with the lamb lollies (best part of meal). Savory, juicy, and just the right amount of fat left on to optimize the flavor. The lollies came with caramelized pumpkin, leafy greens (can't recall what kind) and pomegranate seeds which all complimented each other quite nicely. This app could actually be enough for an entree order. For the main dish, I decided upon the steak tacos. You get 2. I could only finish 1. Tortilla stuffed with steak, caramelized onion, pico de gallo, shredded cabbage, cilantro, and chipotle sauce. Very Australian right? Half of the fillings will definitely fall off the taco before you take your first bite. It was ok, nothing special. Looking back, friendly service and our meal in addition to most items on the menu were more American than anything, but it didn't matter as long as the food didn't suck and no koalas were harmed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The bartender barely looked up and mumbled ""Any small table"". Wow. What a welcome. So we sat down. We were seating right opposite the bar in the main throughway. Not hiding in a corner. One waiter walked past by us completely ignoring us. Three times. Then another. Who animatedly chatted with the bartender who I had asked where to sit. Another waiter strolled by her eyes firmly fixated on some point far away on the horizon. After a while we got up. And left.

This place threw me a total curve-ball. I've lived in this neighborhood my whole life and never had a quality slice like this growing up! Really quirky place. The space looks beautiful. But the pizza is the main event. The pepperoni pie (the forbes i think it's called) is perhaps the best pepperoni slice I've ever had in my life. No kidding. Some drinking buddies of mine use the term 'hipster' a lot whenever something new shows up in the neighborhood. That's unfair to lump this establishment into that category.  Everyone here was incredibly welcoming to me -  the owner even reached out and personally shook my hand when he heard it was my first time. I hear they've only been open for about 4 months? That's really surprising. The place feels like it's been around forever. I wish this place a lot of luck and will definitely bring back my buddies.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"WOW. Seated by the nice hostess right away. The decor and ambiance is simple and understated. It sometimes can get a bit noisy because the space is not particularly large. The waiter was attentive, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Bread had some tahini dip, which was good, but nothing to rave about. There was a special eel appetizer (GET IT). Eel was supple with an amazing smokey flavor. The carrot slaw or whatever it was...delicious. Sauce was unique! The octopus appetizer was delicious. Two octopus tentacles cooked to perfection with a neat side salad. Rabbit leg entree was juicy and fall off the bone. The asparagus, lentil, carrot, onion, whatever it was...delicious. The lamb kotka looked a lil dry, but was absolutely tender and moist! Solid dish with pita, okra, and etc. The pig cheeks was the best! Amazing moist and flavorful. I could not get enough. You must order this! The food was top notch as were the size of the entrees. The chef actually came out a few times and talked to us which made us feel so welcomed. Assorted ice creams...there was a dill sorbet/ice cream and it blew my mind! This is a must try if they have it. Pistachio creme brulee had great flavor! Service is great. Food is amazing. Prices are incredible reasonable for the quantity, and most importantly, the quality. Plus it's BYO! One of the best meals I have had in Philadelphia so far.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place has been on my list for so long, and I finally went last weekend. I decided that I wanted to try The Spotted Pig for brunch for my first time. Upon arrival, of course there was a wait. Luckily we nabbed a spot by the window. It was a little tight but perfect for the two of us. Unfortunately, we had to watch trash being taken out and cooks bringing food in and out, but given that there was no wait time involved, we counted our blessings and were grateful to eat soon. We started with bloody marys, which come with some nice pickled veggies, and some deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were a little oily albeit delicious. We ordered the infamous roquefort burger with shoestring fries and knew we wanted to share, but we wanted a little something else. Our waitress recommended the burrata with roasted wild mushrooms to start. Best. Decision Ever. The burrata was soft and delicious, and the wild mushrooms were so aromatic with the perfect hint of acid to bring a bright flavor. We had ordered the burger medium rare, and unfortunately The Spotted Pig loses a star for serving us a medium well burger. Huge pet peeve of mine, especially when you're paying over $20 for a burger. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious, and we're not the type to complain to our server (considering how long things can take in NYC). While the first couple of bites of shoestring fries are crisp and delicious, when you get a huge pile, the bottom is always lackluster by the time you get to it. All in all, the burrata saved the meal and had us wanting to come back to The Spotted Pig to try the lesser known items on the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I give this place three stars due only to the very well-made drinks, hip atmosphere, and phenomenal food. The service, however, boiled my blood and left much to be desired. The bottom line is, don't eat here on a budget. Three girlfriends and I came here for a fancy night out during a girls' trip to Philly. There was not a table ready when we got there, so we got drinks from the bar and our table was ready as soon as we ordered them. Again, on a budget, we only ordered entrees (which, mind you, came to $115 alone) and our waitress, Leslie, could not have been more rude about trying to push appetizers and more drinks on us, clearly concerned about her tip value. My friend actually heard her complaining about ""the table of four girls who only ordered dinner"" on her way to the bathroom. I understand this is an upscale restaurant, but what was supposed to be a fun night on the town was essentially turned into a downer night by our rude, money-grubbing waitress.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'd rather go to a different place that serves fantastic food with the same price range as Geronimo's. The wait time for our orders was pretty long...around 45 minutes. Do not come here if you are pressed for time. We also had difficulty hearing our waiter over the loud noise/music in the background.

"This establishment is the epitome of mediocre, and the incompetence of the owner clearly shows. Let's start with the running of the establishment itself. Staff are not trained, do not know their own job descriptions, pass everything off onto someone else, and are completely incapable of helping customers. When I walked into the establishment, it was the manager who greeted me, rather than a hostess or server (who were nowhere to be found.) The lack of uniform lets servers wear less than presentable attire; it is important in the food service industry for a customer to be able to distinguish between someone who can help them with their order and someone who is just there for a drink themselves. Box has either been too cheap (or have not thought of the idea) of getting shirts for their employees. While dining here I have also seen the owner insult employees in front of customers as well as insult the customers, myself included. The business also caters heavily to college kids, which is less than appealing for anyone over the age of 24. There is nothing wrong with deciding that you are running a ""college bar"", but at least do it well. The patrons get into physical altercations with each other and the employees, and yet this place fails to change its policies or protect themselves. This is far from a family establishment. For all these shortcomings, the food and drink do not make up for it. The menu is nothing special, and changes so frequently that it's pointless to pick a favorite item. They claim to have amazing burgers, but I have been underwhelmed every time. The fries used to be good until the recipe was changed. Now the amount of salt that's put on them verges on disgusting. I realize salty fries is a fantastic way to get customers to order more beverages, but this place went too far. The drink menu is very small for a place claiming to be a bar. If you're a 22 year old college student who likes to chug cans of PBR,  then Box is your cup of tea. If you have an even moderately distinguished palate, the beer selection is a let down. The liquor might be this place's only saving grace. They offer vodka from Dubra to Titos and everything in between, as well as a very nice selection of whiskeys.  Sitting at the outside bar during the summer with a mixed drink is nice, but can also be attained at almost every other bar in the area. I hope everyone who chooses to go here also knows a few other details. 1. The place has been shut down for serving to the underage. If you can't card someone properly, you do not deserve to run a bar. 2. The place has failed health inspections multiple times. I believe the owner was a chef and claims to take care of the kitchen here. His experience does not show. A handful of the employees have shown that they know what they are doing, but unfortunately most of those people have since left and without their presence Box 63 is a let down every time I decide to stop by. Maybe they were once good, but Box 63 should now be considered a dive bar. The owner should take pride in his establishment and perhaps it will shine again. If Box continues to cut corners, let go of quality employees, and insult it's clients, it will sink.  Clearly running a business is not for everyone.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Jahm Ske's and Dunn's River are neck and neck in competition. Sometimes Jahm Ske's seasons their food better, other times it's cold or older. Dunn's River, to be honest, might slip up every so often, but they follow through with generally consistent quality food. I just hate when they sometimes leave those little black pepper balls in there. The taste is hard and overwhelming of black pepper. 1.) Service: Dunn's River moves pretty quickly. Normally I will find myself waiting in the midst of several people in front of me. If I were to time it, I would believe my order is ready in the matter of 5 to 10 minutes. The staff is nothing but sweet. No lip, no mean face, no attitude. Just sweet, helpful and accommodating. Kinda like the way the culture is in the homeland, Jamaica. Dine in or take out. You choose. 2.) Client base: The place I would say it pretty big for customers to dine in. It's amazing how many kinds of clientele come here. Business men, doctors/nurses, families, teens, etc. Apparently people love Dunn's River. 3.) Food: I have a dish or two that i'm comfortable with. I normally choose the Curried Goat with Rice, Peas and Veggies. It's normally served temperature hot, a little spicy, and the seasons are great with the goat tasting nice and juicy. Just watch out for the bones that are left in them, you're going to have to spit them out. They have a fridge filled with Cream soda, Birch and Root Bear, Coconut Water, and other soft drinks. 4.) Prices: Definitely an inexpensive place. A large entree. is anywhere from $9 to $12, depending on sides and add ons. 5.) Impressions: I come here for take-out. Fast, low price, High quality Jamaican food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Overcrowded. Overpriced, Overhyped. We had a truly annoying experience at OM. Crammed into a communal table without even an inch to spare between us and other diners, we were forced to literally shout at one another all night. The noise level was unbelievable, and not helped by the soundtrack of 80's pop. While the food was most often delicious (polpettine, tagliatelle with ragu and branzino were the standouts), it wasn't enough to make us want to come back.

"Been here multiple times for dinner, mostly with big groups. The food has been consistently amazing. There aren't many options on the menu, which consists of pizza (with choice of toppings, of course) and salad, but that's all you really need here. Plus some great beer. Personally, I'm a fan of the amber ale, although the blond is great, too. The dining experience is really chill - paper plates, a cup filled with silverware, a communal salad bowl, and a huge rectangular pan of pizza. I've never had anything but good service, both for dinner and at the bar. No complaints. Although I did bring a visiting friend here for dinner, and she was somewhat underwhelmed.

"My boyfriend always raves about NY pizza so he finally took me to Lombardi's to show me what real pizza was all about. Apparently, well I saw it written on the wall, Lombardi's is America's first pizzeria. Maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of pizza but I was thoroughly disappointed by what we ordered, especially with the prices on the menu. There are three pizzas you can order. We went with Margherita because it seemed simple and it was also the cheapest option before optional toppings. For a small, it was already $19.50. A small is 14 inches and consists of 6 slices. Margherita included the tomato sauce, cheese, and strips of basil. I wanted some meat on it so we ordered the Italian sausage topping. All meat toppings are also $4 each and vegetable toppings are $3 each. So imagine if you wanted some vegetables and meat on the pizza... It would be well over $30 for six slices - NOT WORTH IT! The pizza was a bit burnt, making the crust part a bit bitter. I stopped eating the crust after my first slice. It was nice to have pizza that wasn't loaded with cheese or sauce for once, I did enjoy the actual taste of tomatoes and seasoning. However, I didn't like how thin it was and how bland everything else was. The Italian sausage tasted weird to me and there was about two or three small pieces of sausage per slice. If given the choice again, I would probably opt out of that and order pepperoni. All in all, I did not enjoy that pizza and would much rather order one from Papa John's or any pizza place that offers delivery at that.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Maybe it was because the L train didn't run past Lorimer the weekend I went, but I don't know how Roberta's manages to draw the crowds it does. Yes, it is fantastic pizza, but I feel like I walked past a mile of graffitied abandoned warehouses with big looming trucks, 3 trendy angst-filled musician photo shoots in front of said graffiti, and a strange (yet tempting) yard sale type thing before even suspecting that there was a restaurant nearby. And I KNEW that it was there! Once I got to Roberta's (after almost spending all my pizza money on plants, 3 ring binders, and a used hair dryer at the yard sale), I walked in the wrong entrance. Note to visitors: if you enter through the garden, plenty of employees will stare at you but nobody will say anything. It's kind of weird. I finally found the correct entrance and got seated right away. Service is fine, but the pizza is awesome. Chewy, wood-fired crust with a constantly changing menu of topping styles (and funny names). I was a big fan. Our server explained the pizza descriptions to me, saying that any sauces are listed first, followed by cheese, then meat, then other. It also helps to have google out for bizarre ingredients, of which there are plenty. I'd elaborate on what I got, but it isn't on the menu anymore! It was delish, though, and I would recommend getting something with a spicy element. It really enhances the dish. I have complained plenty about Roberta's location, but at the end of the day this review is about the restaurant for those who are willing to go there. So if you are willing to travel and brave a spooky walk that feels like a weird after-hours film set, the pizza that awaits is definitely four stars. I can't honestly say, though, that it is better than its more subway-friendly competitor Barboncino in Crown Heights. The only spooky walking you will have to do on Franklin Avenue is past all the hipsters that have taken over the street (did I say that out loud?)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Had a wonderful family reunion dinner here last night. We opted for the $40 tasting menu, but unlike most other chef's tasting menus you get to make all the choices. The waitress and kitchen accommodated our request to split the selections by the two halves of the table-good thing as coming to any agreement for a group of 11 would have been nearly impossible, and as it turned out we only had 1/9 selections that were the same. All of the choices were very tasty, but the Philly Cheese Steak (served as a crostini and not the bao bun as menued) the Thai Chicken, and Crispy Brussel Sprout were outstanding. Service was very good, but as the dishes leave the kitchen as they are ready, it was a bit uneven at times as 2-3 arrived before we were done with the ones in front of us. Still it was a very enjoyable evening overall and a great way to share a fun meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Seriously some of the best ramen I have had in the US. My husband and I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with mustard greens and spicy paste added.  OMG so yummy.  The only thing I would have done differently is add an additional egg. Also had the pork buns.  Good grief they are crack. Mochi desert with red bean paste and almond coconut milk.  Yeah...I could have eaten three. The wait can be daunting.  We were there on a Wednesday night at 9pm and it was around 30 minutes.  Went back the next night at the same time and it was nearly 2 hours. Service was spectacular.  Our server Natalie was amazing (enough so that we got her name and became FB friends so we could keep in touch) which made the whole experience even better.

"Visited this pizza place as we wanted to try some NY-style pizza and what better place to try it than at the first pizza place in America! We came in late (around 10 PM) for some dinner and there was still a lot of people there.  They make their pizzas using a coal-style oven, so, that definitely interested us! We got a medium pizza and added pepperoni, sausages, onions and mushrooms to it.  It came out pretty efficiently (10 mins) and the pizza was very tasty, the thin slices were great, and the price was reasonable!  The service was decent and I'd definitely see myself going to a pizza place like this!  The neighborhood pizza place, the history of the place, the good pizza... all good positives! Definitely like!  New York Pizza is definitely Great!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place used to be great under the old ownership, but since changing owners it's gone downhill.

"UGH, I hate to downgrade b/c I do love this place, but a couple of recent issues (I have now eaten there for dinner, brunch, and lunch (twice).   1) They leave all of the doors and windows open and there is an ABSURD fly problem.  I mean, they are everywhere.  My wife got her legs bittne up.  I have no clue why they don't close the doors and turn on the AC and get the flies OUT.  It is really gross.  All over your food, in your face, etc. the whole meal.  I will not go back this summer unless they fix this.   2) They charge $12 for a vodka lemonade.  Obnoxious. This is the Upper West Side, not the West Village.  Stop.   3) The catfish tacos are revolting.  Sloppy, mushy bites of fish on soft tortillas that get soggy and gross so you can't pickup the taco and you have to consume it like catfood with forfulls of mush. Umm, guys, you do SO many things well, get this stuff in line!!!  It is a great addition to the area, but gotta get your act together on a few fronts.  The Fried Chicken Caesar remains delicious, as are the pickled stuff.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I would pass by this place all the time but never bothered to try the fries, even though I heard good things about Pommes Frites.  About 2 years ago, I decided to stop and have some fries for one reason:  poutine. If you don't know what poutine is, it's basically fries with gravy and cheese curds. Not healthy at all but sooo good! It's really popular in Montreal, which is where I had it for the first time in 2007. After my trip to Montreal I reeeeaaally wanted some poutine but didn't trust myself to make it and couldn't find any place in Boston (where I go to school) that served it. That's when I remember Pommes Frites. It was a cold day and I was showing my old friend from New Orleans around the East Village when we got a little hungry. I peeked into Pommes Frites and BEHOLD...they had poutine! I'll admit, it wasn't as good as the poutine I had in Montreal but it was still satisfying. My friend order fries with some other sauce and it was equally delicious, if not more. Random thought: Pomme Frites = French, French fries = Belgian (supposedly), poutine = French Canadian, Pomme Frites workers = Filipino? Yeah, I don't get it either...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"RIPPED OFF...  NEVER AGAIN!   OK, so I've been here for dinner before, and had a nice time.  It's not cheap, and they squeeze 3 or 4 of you into a 2 person table to get the biggest bang for their buck...  fine.  That's cool.   I take 2 friends here on Tuesday and am told it's a 15 minute wait.  No worries. I step out to take a call, and step back in and am told I'm at the bottom of the list again...  I missed my spot.  Hmm... OK.   Another 15 minutes.   We finally get seated on our tiny table and order some drinks.  My friend and I order the pinot , but they're out of it.  The waiter suggests the sav blanc.  Fine, that sounds reasonable...  so we get it, and end up having 4 glasses.   All going well until we get our bill... whoops, the sav blanc was $18.50 a glass??  Almost DOUBLE the pinot grigio.   I mean WTF?  It was a completely ordinary 'house white' quality and they're charging $18.50 a glass???!  90% of their meals are under that price.   I can get some nice French champagne around the corner at Fedora for $14, but there I get the ambiance and other bs that comes with the price.  And I'm happy to pay.     So in summary, love the food and the service is OK, given how busy they are, but I HATE feeling ripped off.    If you're going to suggest an alternative to something because YOU ran out of the first choice, TELL YOUR CUSTOMER IT'S ABOUT DOUBLE THE PRICE YOU F***ER.   So despite living on Bleecker, on principal. I'm NEVER coming back here.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Some reviewers mention lack of consistency with the deliciousness of the food at Zen Veg. My friends and I had a similar experience. Full disclosure: ZV was the second of two stops on a mini vegan tasting tour we conjured up. So our stomachs were already half full and maybe mentally we weren't quite as enthused. The pressed duck appetizer was thin sheets of tofu and not much else, and left much to be desired. The banana ""chicken"" rolls had great texture, but little flavor. The scallion pancake, much the same. On the plus side for all three: they were cooked perfectly and were large portions. What makes the lack of flavor aspect more frustrating is the condiment selection was also limited. They had the standard soy, and hot chili oil, and then... ketchup? Odd. Pretty sure I saw hot mustard on another table, but we didn't get any. Where ZV stands out is the soup department. Both the wonton and hot and sour were good. The broth particularly in the wonton was so flavorful and the dumplings cooked just right. Hot and sour had a nice tang. Only downside there was the canned mushrooms. Also, the fresh juices were top notch. Like others have said, the place itself is very clean and staff extremely friendly. I'd be willing to give it another try based on that alone, in hopes of other selections being much better.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Been here a couple of times for brunch so I feel comfortable writing a review. The food is amazing. Everything from the coffee to the service is dope. There are some drawbacks, however don't bother trying to get a table after 2, they won't even take your name. They also are one of the only restaurants in NYC that observe the no liquor before noon law on Sundays so that nixes that mimosas and Bloody Mary you were craving. The pancakes are as good as advertised, scrambles are perfectly cooked and the pork chop with the cheddar waffle is a signature unique dish I recommend you try. Bring your patience and a healthy appetite.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Let me just say that this place is a hidden gem...definitely one of my fav spots in the city! Since discovering Cocotero a couple of months ago I have been back 6 or so times, introducing different friends every time. Everyone I bring here falls just as hard as I do. First of all, the atmosphere is extremely authentic/intimate. Every time I finish dining at Cocotero, I think I am going to walk out of the restaurant onto the streets of Caracas instead of 18th Street. (Granted I have never been to Venezuela...but this is definitely how I would imagine it!) The restaurant plays upbeat Latin/Venezuelan music (even though it is brought to you by to Pandora...). Not sure how authentic it is, but it definitely creates an exciting environment. One of the best things about Cocotero is that you can spend under $20 and still get an amazing meal. My favorite items on the menu are: - Tostadas with guacamole - Pabellón arepa - Rice and beans If you want to spend a little more $$, you can opt for the Pabellón Criollo, which is the steak plate. To be honest, I have not tried most things on the menu. Even though I love to experiment with food, what I have tried has not tempted me to deviate! My roommate and I had an interesting experience visiting Cocotero this past weekend. Because the place was packed at 10 pm, we ventured next door to discover their new addition, Cocotero Too, a wine bar/lounge area where you can wait for your table or have a sit down meal with the same menu. The atmosphere is a step up from the original! We started chatting it up with the owner and some of his friends/new staff who were sitting around at the bar. Everyone was so nice and friendly!! We totally hit it off and ended up eating in Cocotero Too instead of waiting for a table in the original. Even though the service was a little disorganized because it was their first night combining the 2 restaurants, the experience was very unique and personal! Since the food took a very long time to come, the owner brought us over complimentary glasses of malbec and everyone was very apologetic when we were waiting. They definitely redeemed themselves. Now that we are tight with the fabulous owner, I look forward to stopping by even more often! I just can't get enough!","[1.0, 0.0]"

They are only at the table and never for longer than necessary but when you leave you feel you need to say bye cause they still make you feel like a personally unique customer that they value.

I haven't had their teriyaki anything yet, so I can't comment on that, but the sushi was pretty good for a random spot on Snyder between corner stores, a hair salon and pizza places.

"I went to the location in Harlem many, many years ago and it was good. Unfortunately, I almost never go to Harlem so I was excited they were finally going to open up a location within walking distance of me, in Brooklyn. Let me say, I've eaten here three times, just to be sure...Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is overrated. The first time I tried them was for lunch. I ordered the ""Breakfast all day"" plate that comes with a sunny side up egg. I hate sunny side up eggs but forgot to ask the waitress to make it an over easy egg instead. When she brought my plate, I asked if they could just put the egg back on the griddle to make it over easy. Long story short, I was told NO, because the chef had given everyone very strict instructions on how that particular dish should be served and, in his opinion, it should be served with the egg sunny side up. Um, are you serious???? I was flabbergasted. Instead of ""arguing"" I just ate the dish as is. It was gross because the egg had the consistency of SNOT in my mouth. I just ate what I could and paid my check. In addition to the gross mouth feel of the egg, the cornbread was GOD AWFUL. The only flavor I could discern was what tasted like they use mop water in the batter. To be fair, Dino did make up for this gaffe with excellent customer service and a coupon. The next week my best friend wanted to treat me to dinner. She suggested Dino. I said okay since she really wanted to eat there. I orderd a drink and the appetizer sampler plate. Meh. It was just OKAY. Their deviled eggs were fine (but I've had better), their fried green tomatoes were fine, as well. Personally, I hate how messy the peel and eat shrimp were but they were fine, too. What wasn't fine was the chicken wings. TOUGH AS LEATHER! Are you kidding me? No way. She paid the bill, so I didn't complain. Last week, I was treated once again to Dino by my dad who was in town for the weekend. I ordered ribs this time. I was FIGHTING with these ribs. They were not succulent and tender, the way I am used to when my mother makes ribs. Personally, I like my ribs to fall off the bone. That was not the case with these ribs. I was actually fighting with them. One bone flew across the table because I had to put so much elbow grease into just trying to pull the ribs apart. Ridiculous. The flavor was good but all that effort/cardio involved was a major turn off. The mac and cheese is meh but the potato salad is pretty good. My brother did not enjoy his wings at all. My father said his food was fine but he wasn't raving over anything. We all agreed that the cornbread was trash and put them in the bucket as soon as the plates came to the table. I can't believe I'm about to say this but Dallas BBQ's is way better. I went last night and my chicken was SUCCULENT, tender, juicy and it FELL OFF THE BONE! I'm going back tonight! That's just how good it was. I really wanted to like Dino, but it won't be seeing me again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I think this is because the food is spooned into a crafty paper package vs. plated traditionally.  But this never really bothers me because 1.) it's very occasional, 2.) we're talking a very insignificant difference in the amount you may get one day vs. the next and  3.) the quality is always more important to me than the quantity. Hot chocolate is so sinful it will send you back to church. Best tomato soup I HAVE EVER EATEN. Every bread is fantastic... and the scones are deelish (okay, could be bigger).

"As other reviewers have said, this could easily be a 5 star place. The ambiance is nice - it's that trendy rustic-chic look you find in a lot of restaurants these days. The food is absolutely delicious. The portions are fairly small, and unfortunately the menu doesn't have that many items on it. I don't know anything about Australian cuisine, but the food didn't strike me as particularly Australian. It seemed like fusion cuisine with a strong Asian influence actually. I tried the Avocado & Seaweed Salad, Hamachi appetizer, and the Steamed Snapper entrée. All three were great, but I was still hungry afterwards (I did share the 1st two items, though). The negatives: THE SERVICE. The wait staff is disorganized. It took them forever to seat us even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Then they only gave us a drink menu. After we declined drinks, we still didn't get food menus until we flagged down someone for them. The menu itself is confusing. There's just one list, so it's hard to distinguish between what's appetizer and what's an entrée. Our server explained the layout of menu as we were about the place the order, rather than when she gave us the menu. I know these are minor things, but the quality of the service compared to the quality of the food was a bit jarring. It definitely detracted from the overall experience. I know this place is fairly new, so maybe if it's still around in a year, I'll give it another shot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

We spoke to the waitress and she informed us that she spoke with the manager, but even though we were told that there were multiple managers working and the owners where there, no one (other than the waitress) spoke with us.  She offered us a free dessert, but what we desired was a good piece of steak.   The owners of KC should be ashamed to call their restaurant a steakhouse.  I will say that when we first moved to the area, we visited KC Prime and really enjoyed it.  Not sure what changed, but we will not recommend to others and will not go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Solid choice for a casual dinner. Service was friendly. Great beer selection focusing on local breweries and their seasonal offerings (i.e. Magic Hat Howler, Trout River Chocolate Oatmeal Stout when we visited in December). Tried the calamari appetizer--it was perfectly cooked (unlike the rubbery stuff you would usually find at a restaurant) with a delighful aioli dipping sauce. Two of us had the chicken pot pie--it was fine, but the pastry-to-filling ratio was skewed to a little too much pastry. Other folks we dined with got the lamb shank, which fell off the bone, and the pot roast, which was also tender enough to cut with your fork. I'd definitely go again! The prices were a little high in my opinion, and we were sat in the room adjacent to the bar near the door. That would've been ok, but it was cold out, so anytime someone left we were chilled! You can buy $25 gift certificates for $10 (or less with a coupon code) for this restaurant on restaurant.com too which is always a plus!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's one of those places where you don't ever expect much yet every time you go, you have a great night.   Ambiance: the simplicity of the bar, which is a square that takes up the entire center of the place.  There is window seating upfront, a cozy nook in the front right but a uncozy bench in the front left. LOL.  Bathrooms dark and nothing to write home about.  It is a dive bar with simply great service, good food and an laid back atmosphere. Head to the back where they have tables and a DJ booth.  We tend to come here around 8 pm after work.  We always order the shrimp dumplings (Love Them!), the french fries, black cod miso, rib eye, wings, bacon wrapped shrimp (YUMMY), edamame, and flank steak.  Order it like tapas and share.  Then drink up.   We also always start with a round of sake bombs. Then I move to lychee martinis. Now, I have to digress for a second... To do sake bombs right, you need to set up the chop sticks on top of the beer glass, then place the sake shots on top, and then bang the table and everyone grabs their glass as quick as they can.  It is one of my favorite team drinks. BUT we broke too many glasses at Fat Buddha because the shot glasses get stuck in the big beer glass.  So we are not allowed to do the chop stick and bang, anymore. :(  But we still keep coming and still order them. I just wish they had better glasses. OK, having said that, my team are known as regulars here's because we end up taking over half the dining area with about 20 of us.  It is really fun when you are in a big group.  The DJ hooks up old school R&B and hip hop.  It is always very chill.  It is a great place to get some cheap eats, great drinks, and good beats.   There is an latino, black and asian mix crowd here usually. No attitude at the door. Nothing pretentious. Just an easy night in alphabet city. If you go as often as us or me, the best part is the manager gets me even that much more inebriated by throwing down a few shots with you.  It is a great place when you are with friends and want to unwind.","[1.0, 0.0]"
This place is great! Lots of different restaurants claim them make hand pulled noodles. In Lao Bei Fang they show you they make their own noodles. Just watching the chef make them transports me back to China. Noodles here are tasty and cheap. Dumplins in my opinion are just an after thought. It's good - 4 for 1.25 but not great. But still a welcom addition to a tasty bowl of noodle with beef stew.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Love this place! Ignore the Princeton pretentiousness and come here for the very fresh and very tasty seafood. I cannot stress enough how fresh the seafood is. The raw bar selections are varied and taste great. Seafood dishes range from the classics (Fish & Chips, Bouillabaisse) to the interesting (Skate sauteed in lemon, oil & capers). It's not crazy or too strange. Food is simply cooked and refreshing. The dessert menu is amazing! Wait staff is pleasant & friendly. Nonetheless, during the warm temp months, be prepared for a very long wait. Make reservations! You will not be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Don't be alarmed by the line forming outside-- it goes quickly. It's not looped inside (at least in the summertime) and by the time you've thought over all the tasty options, you're already next in line to order. The meat and vegetables are a step-up from local fast-food style Mexican like a Chipotle and the decor is that industrial meets hipster feel. There are not too many places to sit-- so if you're popping in for lunch I wouldn't plan on planting yourself down to devour the delicious bowl or burrito in hand. Try the squash too-- it was fresh and yummy. It's a vegetarian friendly place too with some of the greens/ rice/ beans/ veggie options too should you pop in on a meatless Monday or are totally vegetarian. Worth a shot! Best $10 mex lunch in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is definitely my go to sushi restaurant in the area, partly because it the closest one to my apartment and also because it has a great variety. The owner is extremely friendly, offers a warm welcome and remembers you every time you come back. Plus, every night and all day on Sunday  they offer half price sushi and rolls, so you don't break the bank when you need your sushi fix AND you have a little extra to spend on sake! :) The hibachi tables are an added bonus, for those who are not huge fans of raw fish.   This is always fun for larger groups to suit everyone's tastes.  I'm a creature of habit when it comes to my selections at different restaurants. I personally recommend the lobster Chala Ca appetizer (appetizer roll with no rice, perfect for those cutting back on the carbs!) and the spicy dragon roll.  Everything is always fresh and delicious. I'm sure you will not be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Our #1 go-to restaurant-- we've been here COUNTLESS times, and have never been disappointed. My mother has ordered the meatloaf entree so often you'd think she'd be sick of it, but even 2+ years later she'll even (secretly) order it for take-out when hosting a dinner party. My father orders from all over the menu, and particularly favors whatever seafood special is listed that week on the chalkboard. He's always very pleased. I order from the specials menu as well, and it takes a lot of restraint to not finish the entire dish, even when my pants are about to bust. Recommended: The Endive Apple Gorgonzola salad (as another reviewer mentioned, the quality of the gorgonzola is outstanding), The Arugula, Pecans, Cranberries, Gorgonzola..... (the list of ingredients is too long to list, you get the point) The Meatloaf with Chipotle Sauce (comes with awesome mashed potatoes) Anything on the Specials Menu.. I especially enjoy whatever risotto dish they have going... they know their risotto. and their chocolate cake w/ peanut butter ice cream (or substitute the flavor if you like) is awwwweeeesssooommmmeeeee.

"I went to Pylos last night for the first time because I have been on a Greek fix and want to try all of the Greek restaurants in town.  Because of the great Yelp reviews, I was really excited, but alas, it was not to be.  I sat at the communal table because we didn't make reservations.  I ordered the octopus appetizer and the branzino.  The octopus was good, a little on the salty side, but it tasted super fresh.  My second course was when things started to fall apart.  My branzino looked perfectly prepared, so I was excited to dig in.  On my first bite, I got a small fish bone stuck in my throat, and I couldn't swallow it or spit it out, so I had to run to the restroom and dig it out of the back of my throat.  I went back to the table and decided I would tackle it again, but even though I thought I was careful, my second bite contained another fishbone.  I then started picking through it and found several bones.  I told the waitress that I didn't think the fish had been de-boned properly, and she replied, ""You know, fish have a lot of bones.""  My friend told her I order fish all the time (and in fact, had the same octopus/branzino combination just a week earlier at Kefi, which was AMAZING).  She seemed unconvinced and took my plate away and then came back and asked if I wanted something else.  I said I would just order the three spreads (appetizer).  Meanwhile, the manager came over to make sure everything was okay.  After I got the spreads, I asked our server if I could get some more warm bread because the bread we had gotten at the beginning of the meal had already hardened.  She said of course and then never came back with bread even though she plopped bread down in front of the couple next to us who had just come in.  I wanted to see if they would notice, but I never heard from her again, and when they took away my plate of spreads (which I had eaten only a few bites of), they did not ask me whether the meal was okay or if something was wrong with what I had eaten.  The main gripe I have with the restaurant is how they acted like I was inconveniencing them by being picky.  So I ended the night starving and went home and ordered take-out.  Since everyone raves about this place, maybe I just had a bad experience, but I wouldn't go back again.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I remembered having hand drawn/shaved noodles several years ago when I visited china, the tastes was phenomenal and unforgettable. Philly chinatown opened up a few spots, I've  tried all of them, i was disappointed. The. Yummy opened up, thought I'd give hand drawn noodles another shot. Restaurant was really clean and organized, service was really good (best I've had in Chinatown) best part is, they speak English!!!! I love it.   Anyways, this place was unbelievable!

"This is another good example of finding a decent place, that's cheap and quick. It's near the Bedford stop, too. I went in and ordered a chicken pita, because I was not in the mood for falafel, and they served maybe 6-7 falafel pitas in the time it took to get my chicken one because they cook the chicken to order, so in other words, you'd do better just to get a falafel pita if it's all the same to you. You'll have it in your hands in less than a minute after you order. They put pickles in them which is a nice touch, and some other things you may not be used to in the average pita. They'll ask if you want hot sauce, so unless you're really sensitive to spiciness just say yes, because it's not very hot, and it adds a good flavor. Another thing: the sign on the bathroom door says it's out of order, but it's really just to deter people from going in there, so ask them if it's really out of order and they'll probably roll their eyes at you and push the buzzer to let you in, so then maybe you should tip them a dollar in the jar, but wait until they're looking, or else you won't get credit for it. The sandwiches are served in minimally wrapped paper so it is environmentally a good choice, too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

In response to other reviews- On ""expense""- they source their ingredients at a higher quality than most restaurants. Yes, you're paying more than five dollars for a sandwich. If you want to stuff yourself to bursting with anything resembling food for under six bucks, there's a McDonald's right around the corner. On ""hipster-ism""- no one can define that term. Sure, most people eating/working here are under 35, but there's a wide range of backgrounds of the young people going here.

"First and foremost, you would be wasting a trip if you came to Penang and passed up the chance to get the Roti Canai.  Just do it, trust me.  It's amazing. That said, the rest of our meal was fantastic as well... You know that Thai food can sometimes get a bit boring, but the cooks here seem to do a really great job of putting a unique angle on almost every dish, right down to the Pad Thai.  The portions were plenty for us, and I tend to be a pretty hungry guy.  Decor was interesting (in a good way), and I noticed in the back of the restaurant that they have huuuge round tables that can sit about 15 people if I counted right. In all, I'd recommend for lunch rather than dinner; this way, you can easily split your food into two meals and get your money's worth no problem.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went to Elaine's for dinner on my wife's birthday and there was only 2 tables with people in the entire restaurant.  We found out why when our food started to come out.  Stuffed mushrooms were barely ok and cold, so was the fried mozz and the blue cheese dressing that you have to pay extra for was like water and tasted like water too. My wife andmom got the scallops, which they say are bay, but by the size and taste of them they were sea and for the price we feel like we were ripped off and my daughter got the chicken parm which was old and seemed to be frozen by the dark microwave edges on the sauce.  I got the special which was steak but when you ask for medium and it comes out well done i guess it just goes with the way the rest of our dinner was.

"We had a reservation for an early Sunday dinner. We arrived on time, and were promptly sent to the bar. The overpriced cocktail was just OK. The bartender seemed like she could care less and directed her attention elsewhere. There were two obnoxiously loud groups in the dining room; one of which was right smack in the center of the room. Romantic dinner plans foiled. We thought the flavors were good, though the apps and entrees we had were tiny and overpriced. There's a good reason they have unlimited bread and butter (the salted butter was good). The beet salad was good. The potato truffle ravioli filling was thin and runny, but it had a burst of cream and truffle flavor so I went with it. My companion loved the scallop entree but was also still hungry afterwards. The generous, homey and playful desserts seemed gargantuan in comparison, and seemed to fit the decor better but didn't match the dinner. Not a seamless meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Checked it out for lunch with LW on a sunny Thursday afternoon. As documented in my Roly Poly review, I have an affinity for Thanksgiving sandwiches.  Thus, Zoi's Thursday Thanksgiving on a roll special is a no brainer lunch choice. As with any Thanksgiving sandwich, ingredients are turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  Zoi's gets it pretty close to completely right.  The turkey is fresh and natural-tasting and the cranberry sauce is excellent.  The sage stuffing is very tasty but a bit  too buttery.  Also, it should probably be served on a wrap rather than a roll, as the roll is redundant with the stuffing.   Not to be missed, the sandwich also comes with a fantastic, fresh pasta salad.  Bonus points for also carrying A & W sodas. This place is very small, and I can't lie, a more pleasant seating area would be nice.  But the staff is one of the friendliest in New Haven. Ambiance: 10/25 stars Food: 18/25 stars Service: 24/25 stars Bathroom: didn't use it Probability of going back: 100% UPDATE 5/30/2008 Upon careful consideration, and after consuming several Thanksgiving on a Wraps, and other options at Zoi's, I've decided to up it to 5 stars, despite the smallness, on account of probably being the consistently tastiest and best lunch spot in New Haven.  Not to be missed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My Ranty Favorite Meal by Ally G. 1) El Camino Real specializes in Northern Mexican food and Texas BBQ. Most of the menu items consist of meat. Even though their seitan dishes are quite satisfying, according to my carnivorous and vegetarian friends... The focus is mostly on the meat. It's all about da meat! But if something isn't perfectly catered to a vegetarian need, just chill... they try hard to meet your needs :D Try the interestingly cheesey side of corn! 2) For all you real foodies out there, you know and can appreciate ECR's fine choice in ingredients. Everything is either fresh or homemade! You won't find any of that nasty canned crap in the kitchen. So um... for those who say otherwise,shhhh, just chill... have another bite and savor it. Try the beautifuly smoked wagyu brisket. 3) The service might not be ECR's strong point. But cut them some slack... How many packed tables do you see? A LOT. All the folks there are way cool; trying their best to make everyones experience enjoyable! So call over your server, be patient, relax, just chill... enjoy good company! Try the Texas peach tea while your at it! 4) For all you Top Chef fans... Guess who's going to be in season 6! None other than ECR's lovely executive chef, Jen Zavala! (definitely the hottest contestant in Sin City). 5) Lastly... seasonal fruit cobbler... enough said.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I use to go to Koreana all the time when I was an undergrad; in fact one summer I went there everyday for lunch. However I have stopped going there for quite a number of years because they got too cheap with the portions, esp the Gal Bi. I remember when i use to first get it, there was so much beef i couldn't even finish it.  Then they started given fever pieces of meat, and a more bone and fat to meat ratio. I would be hungry an hour after eating. I also did not like that when i ordered the dish  delivery , every time 80% of the meat would be all fat; literally bbq fat. I simply stopped going because  I was paying $10.25 for BBQ fat, bone and a little meat. That being said, their gal bi recipe is one of the best I have tasted, but until they stop being cheap and put more meat on the plate, I will take my money elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This was a very fun experience.  This is Korean/American fusion done correctly.  The meal came out Omakase style, one course at a time.  Each of the dishes are appetizer sized at around $10/plate.  Come in groups of 3 as the dishes come out that way.   The meal started with some complementary bacon oil popcorn.  OMG, I would've paid for this!  It was followed up with these... 1)  Tuna Tartare-  Not a very good start to the meal.  This was just OK.  You had to mix in spicy mayo, jalapenos, yuzu sauce with the tuna then eat with pork rings.  After you mixed it altogether it looked really small and delicate.. and like puke.  lol  Everyone kind of tip toed around it. 2)  Korean BBQ wraps-  This was refreshing.  It was good but I could've used some more meat!   3)  Pork Belly Tacos-  Holy moley this was amazing!  The taco was light and crispy.  The cheese, the pork belly, the pickled jalapenos.. everything came together so perfectly and it was so damn juicy!  Watch out for the proverbial greasy hand after you eat the tacos.   4) Pulled pork sliders-  these were cute but not as tasty as the tacos.  They charred some happy faces on the top of the buns but the bun was a little too thick for my liking. 5) Scallops-  OMG, get it!  It's a small dish but made right.  The carrot/maple syrup puree was so good.. I LICKED MY PLATE.  hahaha 6) Oxtail Terrine-  This was very very good.  Too small to share.. maybe between two people at most.  The mushrooms packed so much flavor.  Probably my 2nd fave dish after the pork belly tacos. 7) Crack and Cheese- Not all that.  You see a lot of pictures of this dish but I wasn't very impressed.  The bacon was rubbery, the gnocchi a little dry and the cheese was a little heavy... it didn't really go together as I hoped. The meal ends with some complementary tiny yogurt drinks.  I would compare this restaurant to the ever popular Danji.  Salt & Fat is michelin recommended if that means anything to you... give it a shot if you're in the area!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First of all, I am a great big fan of thai & chinese food...veg varieties only Second, I don't write reviews that often. My reason to write a ""long"" review is explained below. We wanted to take our friend for dinner as it was his birthday. He wished to eat thai  food and hence, we showed up around 7:30 on a Sunday night. We're 3 adults & 1 kid.   The very front of the restaurant made me think twice before I entered, esp with a kid. The garbage bin in front of the restaurant was soooooo full. I even took a pic of it to show it to their manager and ask him to do something about it. Well, I didn't do that, coz the manager was nowhere to be seen. The quality of service and knowledge of food the waiters had was very very poor. The male waiter who took our orders failed to explain about the food. Go to pf chang or somewhere, they will explain to their customers about the food and its major ingredients (veg or non-veg). This waiter did not bother to do so. He took the order and left. There was a lot of noise in the restaurant. I guess, it came from the kitchen or the restaurant was really that big so as to accommodate a huge party. Anyway, it was annoying. The food finally came. We ordered pineapple fried rice (spice level-mild) among others. Honestly, appetizer & green tea were good. The fried rice had non-veg in it. This dish, we ordered for the kid. There was shrimp and other non-veg. We wanted them to take it away and re-prepare the same dish but without the non-veg. Well, that was denied right away by the waiter. Added to our misery, the fried rice was very spicy. Too spicy for the kid and he refused to eat it. They failed to provide additional napkins & plates. We had to take it from the table nearest to us. No one bothered to ask us how the food was!!! Finally, we decided to leave and we did. We called the waiter and asked for the check. He did not bother to ask why we're leaving without ordering any entrees. They even charged us gratuity. We left paying them for their ill-service and not-to-the-expectation food, leaving the kid hungry. We went to another restaurant to feed the kid some good food. I will never go to Rhong Tiam again, nor take any of our friends to this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Everything was absolutely perfect - from our server to our food to the cocktails. The dishes came out in excellent timing and with all of the items we tried, not one fell short of amazing. What we ordered: Cazuela de Chorizo y Papas - chorizo and potatoes with kale in casserole form. So hearty and delicious! Tostadas de Tinga - shredded chicken served cold atop a crispy tortilla. These were heavenly. Ensalada - something light and fresh to cleanse the palate. I loved the jicama! Atun ceviche - buttery chunks of yellowfin tuna ceviche. Yum. Platija - maybe the favorite. Fluke ceviche served over those same crispy tortillas. The mild fish was so simply prepared but oh so good. Carnitas de Pollo - we were really full by this point, but I loved that they embraced the crema for these baby tacos. Carrillada de Cerdo - pork cheeks All in all, you should absolutely go to Xochtil.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Cozy, authentic, kitschy, and fun with speedy service and a diverse menu, Sake Bar Hagi is bound to have something for everyone. The service was good, especially the one guy who kept coming back to refill my tea. He get's 5 stars. My group of four also arrived a bit in waves. They were nice enough to seat two of us first since we waited the 20 minutes for the table and immediately placed orders to get things rolling while the 3 other slowpokes made their way in. Takowasa octopus marinated in wasabi - so delish Kushi mori set A (chicken, pork belly, duck, pepper) tasty! Tofu steak with mozzarella - odd, but not bad Edamame - par Hamaguri (clams) very salty, would skip Okonomiyaki - can't beat it if its hot! Salmon and plain rice ball (onigiri)- this thing is the size of a softball Kimchi fried rice - good. I really would like to come back and try more things!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We heard allll about the pizza scene in New Haven before our trip. We didn't have enough time to try them all out and decided since we could only try one on this trip we'd go to Frank Pepe's. But honestly, I'm hoping this isn't the best pizza New Haven's got because it was simply meh. We came in late at night and didn't have to wait too long (less than 30 minutes). We were the second to last people to be seated before they were closing fro the night. Their pizza is honestly nothing to write home about (I had the margherita and he had the white clam pizza). As others have noted, they're not known for their service here so don't expect it. One pro is that they have their own parking lot so you don't have to worry about circling around the block. Bottom line, it felt like wasted calories. There must be better pizza in New Haven!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Its a bar. You drink there, watch a game there, and as long as you dont expect anything other than medicore pub food, you can eat there. I as there this past Sunday to watch some games, the only thing keeping me there was the group of friends that i went with to watch the games. I was on the upper level in the back and the two female bartenders back there were TERRIBLE. we had multiple people trying to get drinks with no luck. I mean we probably stood there staring them down for about 15 minutes total.  And it wasnt that busy... busy enough, but its a bar, and your job is to get drinks. My problem is that in between their drink getting they were chatting, hanging out with people at the end of the bar, and just generally ignoring people that had been waiting. I understand the wait if you are flat out struggling and its packed, but they werent... they were actually just standing around talking to each other and showing each other their jewelry. I finally gave up, went down to the other bar (that was just as crowded) where the male bartenders were and got a 4 drinks immediately. I know what youre thinking ""of course a girl is going to have a harder time getting a drink from a female bartender and an easy time getting one from a male bartender""... completely untrue. I went down there with two male friends and they were helped just as quickly...they had no luck with the girls either. Drinks are decently priced and they have a good selection on tap.... but be careful, they run out when its busy especially of the seasonals. My first two ber choices were ""out."" Their bathroom is cramped and usually a mess, the floor is sticky. I know its a downtown sports bar, but they really could do a better jog of keeping it clean. On past weekend nights Ive actually seen vomit in the bathrooms sit there for quite some time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"oh my holy land, this place is freaking delicious. we've been ordering in mass quantities for our late nights at the office (yes, there are offices in chelsea), and now, we can all qualitatively agree that this may be the best (and only?) reason to stay at work until 9 p.m. on a wednesday night.  please don't tell my boss that, but it's true. seriously. probably some of the best quality/bang for the buck as far as middle eastern food goes in manhattan. tonight i had the red pepper hummus platter w/falafel, baba ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves, and tons of fresh vegetables (which are free!  and so is the feta cheese!  it's amazing!).  we got lots of fresh, fabulous and fluffy pita with our meal (see what i did there?  everybody loves alliteration), and some exceptionally good rugelach and baklava for dessert. the baba is all smoky and like ""hey girl, give me a try"", the hummus super smooth and inviting, and the falafels were tender and delicious.  a great aside to the golf-ball like nightmares they sell at Wrapido.  forrealsies.  i may have cracked a tooth on those once. some peoples seem to have gotten upset about the ordering process.  waddup with that?  just take a deep breath.  then order.  or do it on seamless.  or pop a xanax if ordering an $8 lunch is seriously giving you that much performance anxiety.  trust. oh, and the delivery guy was super nice and extremely helpful.  give him a raise, dear owner, if you are reading this. ok, i've never yelped, but this place was so good, we all felt compelled.  myself especially, in case you didn't get that by now.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I'm not the biggest fan of French cuisine per se, but the dishes here are light-on-their feet and definitely original. Favorite plates so far: Moules Poutine (they'd probably consider this a specialty), pate, and the Bourguignon entree (here they use pork instead of traditional beef). All in all, Three Letters is a great addition to the Fulton St neighborhood. Locals seem to love it and the bar scene has taken off already, so it'll probably be my go-to for late night grub.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had a group here on a business trip earlier this week and it was really really good! First off - if you visit the area realize that there are lots of BYO restaurants due to some weird local liquor laws.  This place thankfully had a full bar and we enjoyed some Soporo beer and a very tasty warm Saki Shared several sushi rolls for appetizers and the best of the lot was the Tempura Shrimp.  Crunchy. fresh. and the eel sauce was tasty good. Meals for the table were hibachi chicken, hibachi veggie, and a Sukayari Steak (likely misspelled).  Meals came with onion soup, ginger dressing salad (awesome!), soba noodles, fried rice (optional), and a shrimp appetizer.   Everything was uber tasty and the portions were very large.  Wrapped up dessert with a nice green tea ice cream - and they also had red bean. Would definitely visit there the next time I am in town - a great departure from the diners, Italian joints, and byos in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Barrio Chino is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but the unpredictable waiting times prevent me from going more often. The restaurant is very small, but the atmosphere is enchanting, the food is delicious and reasonably priced, and the drinks are quite tasty (albeit pricey). I feel as though you can't really go wrong with any of the entrees...I think I've tried at least a bite of almost everything. The tacos are small, but they also give you the opportunity to try a variety of options. As far as the drinks go, I am highly in favor of the margaritas. They make them fresh (no sour mix here) with fruits like strawberry and grapefruit (yum!). I also like the jalapeno margaritas, but you have to really like hot spices. I love me some spicy foods, but I can only handle one or two of these suckers. If you're in the neighborhood, particularly on a weekday before 8pm, definitely give this place a shot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bought a groupon recently for Saffron Place, and since I like trying new restaurants we gave it a whirl. We were there on a friday night and the place seemed surprisingly quiet. The nice thing about that was we were able to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather. The waitress was new, and seemed to know nothing about Indian food- so she had to call over different staff members various times to answer our questions. She seemed a little bit unprofessional, but not as bad as the waitress who was training her. This girl had a toothpick in her mouth the entire time she helped us, from taking our order to bringing us our food and then later our bill. It was pretty gross and I can't imagine any restaurant manager who would allow their staff to chew on a toothpick the whole time. The food- on the other hand, was pretty delicious. We ordered a Saffron Place assorted appetizer plate, which was mostly various fried foods. I can't eat deep fried food, but my brother said everything was great. We also had some garlic naan which was very tasty. For our entrees we both had curried chicken and another chicken dish which was very tasty. We also enjoyed a banana lassi and a mango lassi with everything. The only thing we didn't like was the weird dessert. They didn't have the original dessert that we ordered so we went with something else. It tasted like a strange version of an ice-cream/ pistachio pudding/ sorbet. Not the best, but that's okay. Overall, the atmosphere could definitely have improvements (the neighborhood itself doesn't seem top notch) but there is nothing they can do about that. The restaurant itself seems in need of some renovations as well. Also, they need to train their wait staff on better manners. The food, thankfully, salvaged the evening and we ended up leaving happy with that.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It's a good thing this place has killer French Fries, because the atmosphere is quite possibly the worst. It's so painstakingly small and cramped. It's like eating in a closet with every college kid in NYC. Other than that, these fries are awesome! $4.50 gets you their smallest size which is plenty for one person. You then add $1.50 for one sauce, or $3.75 for your choice of three. They also offer a couple of different free sauces like their Frite Sauce, and Especial Sauce. I went with the War Sauce, which is Peanut Satay, European Mayo, and Raw Diced Onions. I was disappointed in this one. It really surprisingly lacked flavor. I actually preferred the free plain European Mayo I got on the side. The fries come out hot and crispy every time, so you never get stuck with cold fries. There's a couple places to sit if you really want to eat in a cramped environment, but I'd suggest taking them to go and eating them at nearby park. Staff is really efficient and quick. Don't be intimidated by the line that is often outside, they get you in and out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Vesta is the perfect example of how behind we are in Astoria on good restaurants. A restaurant that would have not even been considered better than ok in other boroughs, here, in our poor Astoria, has received the most amazing reviews and highest rates.   I went there the other night so eager after all the reviews. It was a disappointment. Very small wine selection although they avoid the predictability of wine lists of red sauce italian restaurants. The pastas were decent, but nothing I could not do at home. The pizza had its moments when you did not chew on the burned black dough. Which was the case 80% of the time. The fish was poorly seasoned the side course did not add on the overall flavor of the meal. The service was warm though and there is a conscious  effort to move away from cliches and stereotypes of ethnic restaurants in Astoria.

"Nice neighborhood spot, though not a place I would make a special trip to. I tried the bibb salad, spicy fisherman's stew, and fried fish special (can't remember what kind of fish!). Bibb salad was yummy, although a bit heavy handed with the dressing. I also wish the bacon was more on the cirspy side to add more texture, but maybe I felt that way because there was a bit too much dressing. My dining buddy had it a different night and said the dressing then was just right. Fisherman's stew - Delicoius bowl to satiate my appetite especially on a chilly night! I love that there were chunks of tomatoes stewed right in and I also love the spicy kick. I also enjoyed that it is served in a large bowl with a hunk of toasty bread on top - the perfect companion to dip and scoop! MMM I will be craving this in the winter time. Fried fish special - I only had two bites of this, but I recall the fish was done just right and the flavor / texture a nice complement.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We found De Legna on one of its first days.  The pizza was exceptional.  We ate three pizzas (Scarole e fagioli, Salmon affumicato, and the Rustica) and really enjoyed all three.  My daughter loved the Scarole.   I loved the Salmon and both my wife and son-in-law enjoyed the Rustica.   The choice of small plates was interesting, extensive, and reasonably priced.   All of the staff was friendly, professional and attentive.  They actually stocked some good port wine as well.  I enjoyed seeing their wood fired oven.  It takes guts to open another pizza restaurant in New Haven.   These young people have carried it off with some interesting food that goes beyond the traditional, heavy offerings of the past.  We will go there at every opportunity and suggest that you do so as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"i love the ambiance of this place, and though i've never had austrian food before i really appreciated the vibe and the experience that i had here. i ordered the sausage platter here, which includes 2 or 3 different types of sausage, pork belly, quark dumplings, and sauerkraut. the quark dumplings were definitely my favorite part of the meal. you can definitely tell they were freshly made, had a nice light flavor to it, and a wonderful soft but not mushy texture. the sausages and pork belly were also really good, but just way too heavy and salty for my preferences. the sauerkraut did not help that case either. i wish that the platter had a little more balance. i'm glad to say i've tried really great quality Austrian food but it's really just not my thing","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Location is cool, food is just alright, but i beg everyone not to support a restaurant like this. We had a small casual bday dinner planned last night. 4 people. I brought cupcakes from the birthday dudes favorite bakery as a surprise. When i asked the manager if he'd serve us the cupcakes at the end of our meal (and we had just ordered a ton of food and drinks) he said there would be a $10 plate fee per PERSON. I asked him to please reconsider and said that was akin to extorting customers but he wouldn't budge. With so many great places in NYC and managers/owners striving to offer the ultimate customer experience why would anyone support a place that doesn't do that.  It made the whole table feel uncomfortable and that we were in a place we didn't want to be in.  It wasnt like the food blew our minds It was just food. So for anyone reading this, please consider another place, that finds ways to be more accommodating to customers' requests.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"OK, I don't write reviews but after this last horrible experience I felt I needed to tell as many people as possible to avoid the is place! First off we have been to this Outback a total of 4 times since it opened and 2 of those 4 times have been bad experiences so lets just say we will NOT be returning. This time was last night at 6PM New Years Eve and it was not crowded at all so service should not have been bad but it was HORRIBLE! There were 8 of us that started out ordering drinks and apps from the waitress that you could tell did not want to be working that night and had the personality of a wet sock. After we got our drinks and apps she dropped one of the apps on the floor and said she would be right back with the replacement app, it was 15 minutes before we say her again WITHOUT the app! After taking our dinner order and drink order she disappeared again for 10 more minutes, when returning we asked about the app that we still didn't have and all the plates and glasses on the table that hadn't been bused yet. Now the dinners come out 40 minutes later AND THEY WERE ALL WRONG AND MINE WAS ""LOST"" IN THE KITCHEN AND WOULD HAVE TO BE RE-DONE!! Now we have 3 drink glasses each (8 people X 3 drinks 24 glasses!!!!) plus app dishes and dinner dishes stacked all over the table with no room to put a thing down!!!! I called over the manager and told him this was absolutely ridiculous and he should be ashamed of his restaurant. Needless to say our entire meal was comped and we left in a hurry NEVER TO RETURN!

"YES YES YES I'll start with dessert even though i love savory items usually. However, this dessert was spectacular. It was the fig and black pepper panna cotta. You stumble upon some good things in life, and I believe this is one of them, or at least is one of those things that make you remember other good things. In my case, I was with friends and shared this dessert along with a hazelnut mousse and an ending cheese course. I, however, pretty much stole the panna cotta (the others liked it but didn't see what the huge deal was). It's not hit or miss. You'll like it. But for a select few, that panna cotta will do wonders for you. I had shivers while eating it--the panna cotta of such a texture to be soft without airy and insubstantial; figs sweet without being saccharine (i found them to be woody and green, even); and the black pepper to be super fresh and just the right amount. I'll say that the pasta dish was well done, perfectly al dente. the fish was interesting, with blood orange, and not oily. and the salad was, well, salad. But I'll go there and eat dinner (perfectly happily, btw) just to get to the panna cotta!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If YELP had Zero stars I would give Lombardi's Pizza a Big Zero. For being a fake, has-been, tourist trap with lousy service and worse than lousy pizza. We had the very Chewy Clam Pie. covered with well done dried out and flavorless canned clams that had the detergent smell. The crust was dry thin and crispy, maybe that was the best thing about it, but it lacked any taste and character. I think the pie was precooked and that's a sin in pizza world. Tried to salvage the meal and ordered the Margarita but were only slightly less displeased by the offering.  The bland sauce and mediocrity of the cheese was matched in this case by a wetter crust. The staff was made up of I don't give a ship, Latino girls that were bothered by us and you know when the hostess is wearing the headset, leave. This is strictly a tourist trap. It's too bad, because we were walking towards Eldgidge St for dumpling and I was responsible for changing the course and trying Lombardi's for the first time. You can have my $90 for 3 salads and two small pizzas this time but never again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"SATURDAY NIGHT REVIEW.   OK food (not at all great) BUT so poorly organized: No reservations No call in for waiting list: Resulting in predictably HORRIBLE WAITING TIMES ON THE STREET - OVER 2 HOURS We had been there twice during the week, and it was wonderful. So it was a Saturday night and we decided to go. Its over an hour drive, and we called to see if they took reservations. They said they didn't. They said when you arrived they'd put our name on a list. We asked if they could out our name on the list now (with a phone call) and they said no. Its against their policy. We asked about the wait, and they said at that time it was 30 minutes, but they couldn't predict the wait when we arrived. When we arrived the street side  in front of the restaurant was swamped with people. They said the wait was 2 hours - but we had come a long way - and neither us (nor others) really believed it. Its true. Its apparently their norm on Friday and Saturday night - 2+ hours wait !!! The impression is they feel they get more business by this form of disorganization. But its terrible and ruined the night. They should take reservations. Failing that - if they want a waiting list on the night of the dinner - you should at least be able to call in your name. They refuse both. Instead, if you want to eat there on Friday or Saturday night you are stuck on the street waiting for hours. They can't manage the volume wither. The food, which was truly excellent on a weeknight - was at least 3 notches worse. Food is a delicate balance of flavor and cooking, and the balance was lost. For instance - way too much raw garlic. Overcooked chicken. The experience was so off-putting we simply won't go back - not even on a weeknight, when we had a so much better experience. I recommend you stay away from this place on the weekend.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here on a Sunday night around 7, and the place was moderately full -- but no problem getting a table. A previous review mentioned the strong margaritas.  They deserve a remention.  Indeed, strong and just the remedy for a Sunday night. The food was really, really good.  I got rack of lamb tacos; my better half got vegetarian fajitas, and both were tasty.  The tacos came with a roasted jalapeno, which I didn't really believe could simply be a roasted jalapeno -- who would just cut that up and eat it.  So I did.  I recommend not doing that. Service was great, price was reasonable, and we plan to return soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm not going to lie. I was BLOWN AWAY by the food. I don't even need to describe it, it's just insanely tasty. The BIG PROBLEM with this place is their ridiculous seating method in which they leave many empty tables in the back and have people wait often HOURS for a table. I asked why on earth after having waited 70 minutes for a table, that when I got into the back there were at least 15 seats open, the waitress said ""the wait staff decide when they are ready to handle more customers and will signal for more to come back"" really??? REALLY!?!?! This restaurant doesn't want maximum turn over? I mean our food came in literally 2 seconds and clearly it doesn't take hours to cook some ramen, so why the insane wait when there are empty tables? I think it's more than what the waitress said, that's all I can ascertain but in the end it's ridiculous. Even at 5:30 we waited over an hour.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Didn't realize they had a C rating until my friend and I walked out of the restaurant.. Oops. Aside from that (I can't worry too much about it, what's done is done and I didn't get sick): Pro: affordable, good vegetarian options, cool decor, seated fast on a Saturday night. Con: were rushed by (occasionally rude) wait staff, only 2 bathrooms for a huge restaurant, pretty sure they use MSG. I had the Tom Kha soup with vegetables and Basil Fried Rice with mock duck. The soup was very good, a lot of fresh vegetables in non greasy broth. The main dish was good, but very intensely flavored/salty in an unnatural way. Not only that, I also had a massive headache for the rest of the night. So I'm pretty sure they use artificial flavor enhancers and I'm really not a fan of those. I would probably not come back here. Because of the C rating, because they were really rushing us and when we asked for a dessert menu instead they brought us the check (needless to say, they missed out on us buying a dessert) and because if you know how to cook food properly there is really no need for MSG.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Unnecessarily expensive is the first thought that comes to mind. That being said, the spot is definitely pretty cool. The crowd is young, professional, you may even say ""attractive,"" by New York terms. There's a tarot card reader in the front, so I guess it's technically going for a hidden speakeasy vibe? Valiant effort. Small, though, or as my friend described it, ""they really fit a restaurant in one-fifth the space."" To add to this, the bar is always packed. Not crazy about the bouncer at the door, either. I split the bone marrow poppers (small, few, only three); bacon wrapped lamb chops (very interesting combo, but again, two pieces for $16..); hand cut tartar (prepared/mixed in person; delish). Personally, I ordered a salad, which was a solid size. My friend had the bass, which was great. Impressive cocktails. I had this gin/ouzo-based drink that I had to try (an ouzo cocktail?!), and am glad I did. Something about it just doesn't quite put this one over the edge for me.

It's very cozy, and the staff is very friendly, quick with a recommendation for those of us not all that familiar with Brazilian cuisine that doesn't involve massive amounts of charred steak - not that I'm complaining. I thoroughly enjoyed the ""feijoada,"" a black bean and meat stew complemented with rice, farofa (yucca flour), and couve (sauteed collard greens, which I loved), along with a pair of baked empanadas, and a plate of cheese bread, compliments of the house.

There are hardly any options for vegetarians or vegans....which I can understand...I did go there out of my own free will.  However, what I could eat just tasted terrible.  The falafal wrap (w/no cheese or sauce) was borderline disgusting. Just the falafal balls themselves suck. Wasn't impressed with anything, and they didn't even ask why I barely ate my food.   The huge 10 gallon size wine bottles all over the place are also rather tacky looking. Nice decor, good music, indifferent staff, not-so-good food. Will never return. Don't get what the hype is. Maybe Astorians just think its suppose to be good because the place is pretty inside, who knows.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is becoming a go-to when we're in this part of Astoria. I like the approach in that MP Taverna offers a number of familiar flavors, but sometimes with little twists. But the twists never come off as pretentious. The overall vibe of the place is nice, straddling that line between casual and a little  more upscale well. On two visits, our servers were friendly and helpful. One word, though. If you can, get a table upstairs. The sound  there is more conducive to conversation with the folks at your table. If your taste in beverages runs to more potent potables, they have plenty of options. I've had a cocktail, the exact name escapes me, that was basically their take on the mojito that was effectively refreshing. Now, as to the food. This will focus more on our visit last night and touch back to one at the end of May. In the two visits, there was only one disappointing dish -- the calamari appetizer. The calamari itself avoided the texture woes, but was curiously lacking in flavor. While this place generally excels at not getting too fussy, this was one instance of erring too far on the side of simplicity. With that out of the way, on to last night. We had three items as apps -- the Octopus with Mediterranean chickpea salad, Grandma's meatballs and the bulgur salad. The Octopus -- Oh. My. Goodness. It is the best octopus dish I've ever had. The texture was perfect, not the slightest bit of rubberiness, with a nice char on the outside. It went very well with the salad, with the pairing of the chickpeas and the octopus proving a great choice. The bulgur salad was a refreshing balance of sweet and salty, soft and crunch. Pomegranates and dates, almonds and olives, red onions and pine nuts. The meatballs came with wedges of soft pita bread, tzatziki sauce and lemon. The texture was more creamy than dense and meaty, but it was solid, if unspectacular. These three were all well portioned apps, as opposed to the sausage one from the first visit, which was tasty, but seemed skimpy by comparison. The mains -- Roasted lemon chicken, grilled dourade, dumplings. I can speak most about the dumplings. Made with ricotta, they managed the nice trick of being pillowy without becoming gluey or overly glutenized. The sauce was a perfect vehicle -- acidity from the tomato (regular and sun-dried), a little funky edge from the feta, spicy kick from garlic and pieces of lamb sausage. My dining companions enjoyed their entrees. The one who had the chicken isn't as big a garlic fan as us, but still enjoyed it, in particular showing appreciation for the crunchy, flavorful skin. The one who had the dourade it was very clean, a fresh grilled fish that met her expectations to the letter. I can't pass without noting an entree from the first visit -- the Greek paella. It is another good option, as they didn't skimp on the seafood. Orzo pasta subs for the rice and the sauce was quite flavorful, resembling nothing so much as a diavolo sauce. Desserts: Baklava apple napoleon and galakataboureko creme brulee The napoleon is a good example of offering familiar flavors in a well-executed, different fashion. Layers of baklava with apple compote inside and a spiked ice cream on the side. It is sort of an apple pie flavor profile, but with the crunchy phyllo and honey, it adds a different dimension. Or, if you prefer, the apple adds a little bit of flavor to cut into what can sometimes be cloying sweetness in a baklava. Oh, and the ice cream was pretty darn good, too. The creme brulee is something we've enjoyed on both visits. The fresh berries cut into it. The crunch from the shredded phyllo set it off. It's not an ""OMG, amazing dessert!"", but it's pretty darn good. One final note, this place is not a ""cheap eats dive"", BUT the prices are a good value. Similar dishes would be higher-priced in Manhattan. For example, I highly doubt the dumpling dish would only be $15. All in all, it's a worthy addition to Astoria and well worth the trip for others outside of Queens  (it's a short walk off the last stop on the N and Q lines).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went last Sunday for the New Year celebration with friends and family, party of 18.  Service was non-existent...had to get our own utensils, napkins, and ask repeatedly for beverages including refill of tea and water pitcher, which we never received.  When finally got a server's attention and made request, he never returned.   Food was greasy and bland.  Dim sum carts did not stop by table.  Had to chase down and ask to see.  Used to be such a good restaurant, I don't know what has happened.  Apathy perhaps?  New ownership?   Will not be returning.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is awesome.  Read the reviews and save yourself a whole lot of frustration, if you're trying to sit down immediately at 8pm on a Saturday it ain't gonna happen.  Do what we did and go, put your name in, and head to one of the nearby bars, hangout, relax and wait for the call.  On a Saturday night this summer we showed up at 6:30, wanting to get our name in before they stopped for the night.  We were fully expecting an obnoxious wait.  We were told 1.5 hours and my phone started buzzing only 45min later- we headed over and were seated immediately.  From the other reviews I was also expecting a 'tude from the hostesses/waitresses.  There was none of that!   The pizza, calzone, and nutella pie were all ridiculously good, we had plenty of food to take home.  Everything was so fresh the toppings are mandolined right over the pizza, nothing is pre-cut/pre-chopped.  You can watch the pizzas being crafted (yes, I said crafted) right in the open, candlelit space.  We brought wine and were not rushed at any point in the night. This is not just a pizza place, it's totally date night worthy.  With a pizza + toppings, calzone, and nutella pie costing under $50 + leftovers to take home it's a steal.  The night after we ate at Lucali we went to Babbo, and I sat there through the entire meal wishing we had gone back to Lucali instead.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Perilla for dinner with my wife to celebrate  - i will say it was a wonderful evening. My wife being a vegetarian - i was apprehensive at first given she was vegetarian - but after the meal i will say it was a wonderful experience with very very good food and great service. We had an assortment of dishes with a good bottle of Lacrima D'Alba with a series of dishes. We started of with the Lacinato Kale Salad - a gorgeous mix of flavors with the orange and baby fennel adding a tremendous flavors with forbidden rice adding the starches. In addition to this we had a wonderful risotto - i will say this was wonderful and one of the best risotto's we have had in a while. Then we had the main course - which was an artful take of arctic char which had mushrooms substituted for fish - the combination of flavors work wonderfully well - with the slight bitterness and tanginess of the red lentil and mustard, the starch provided by the potatoes and the wonderful cabbage dumplings and the flavorful mushrooms on top - the combination of flavors work wonderfully well together and i would strongly recommend this to any one eating there. In addition we had the Brussel sprout leaves baked with toasted nuts (i expected pumpkin seeds etc. but was very impressed to find almonds in there instead) and a really nice and surprising sweetness coming from the chopped grapes. This works wonderfully well with the flavors in the arctic char as a great side. In all i believe this place was well worth the time and effort to get there - this is a wonderful place and i would say the chef is wonderfully inventive with an ability to bring congruent flavors together in unique and innovative ways - and provide an element of surprise / twist in the food. It was an absolute pleasure eating the food - and i also would go to say the service was wonderful and very very attentive. I would recommend this place even to vegetarians and i hope to go back there to try the meat.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"CONS: Don't expect high-class service. The help here is more like the people you will find at some boutique on South Street. They were loud and not focused on the customer. Also, their sandwich container was only about 25% fill. So they had about 5 choices. Everything about the place seemed a little ""not finished."" PROS: I opted for the Capri sandwich and felt like I was in Rome again. They grilled it for me, so the prosciutto was warm and the whole sandwich a bit oily but incredible. The price is reasonable seeing that it Le Bus and right next door at La Cigale they charge more for the same sandwich and no reputation. Their chocolate cookies are a great lunch dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"

My friend and I were sitting outside enjoying our food and the nice weather until it became obvious that there was some sort of issue being sorted out on the sidewalk between a customer and the female manager.  It was literally seconds before the manger was yelling at this woman, making a spectacle on the street and ruining our course.  She was so heated and so unprofessional that another manager had to come out to send her inside to calm her down.  Anyone in any sort of service industry would be so embarrassed by the way she acted.  She had no regard for the people on the patio.  It was very obvious she was blowing off steam and made for a very uncomfortable experience.   I love the food here.  If you are looking for something quick and different I would absolutely recommend this place, only I would send you to the other location.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"El Vez deserves 4 stars if for no other reason than their Bazooka guacamole...it is the most amazing thing ever...And also for their photobooth because I'm totally corny. My boyfriend, parents, and I went to El Vez this past weekend for a birthday celebration, and we pretty much forgot to leave room for dinner because of this guacamole. In addition to the velvety avocado, there is also goat cheese, chile flake, pistachio, and roasted tomato. The roasted tomato adds the perfect amount of sweet roasty goodness and the chile flake the perfect amount of heat. After the chips and guac we had the Roasted Corn Soup with pan seared scallop, tomatillo and jalapeño mermelada. The soup is delicious, combining many of my favorite things. The corn soup alone is a bit sweet, but the salsa balances it perfectly. I also ordered the crispy mahi mahi tacos, but was only able to eat a few bites. And because there is always room for dessert, the four of us split the El Vez...a flourless chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream (I've had better but was happy to have a few bites). Next time I'll grab a bar seat just for drinks and Bazooka guac. El Vez is always a good time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Overall, this is a great restaurant.  The menu choices are really interesting and delicious, and the servers are attentive.  I have eaten here twice now, and both have been great dining experiences. The ONLY negative about this place are the two ridiculous greeters at the front door.  Even though I had scheduled an early dinner reservation and the restaurant was relatively empty, these two clowns made a point of making my guest and I wait in the bar area in the hopes that ""we would order a drink.""  I just hate restaurants that do this to their guests.  Do you really think that we are stupid and don't realize that you're simply trying to get us to spend more money?  And then, when I called them out on this, the two greeters copped all this attitude with me about how ""they will seat me when they are ready."" So, I did what any good New Yorker would do.  I grabbed two menus from the front desk and announced, ""Thanks, we'll just go seat ourselves and you can send the manager over to speak with us.""  And then my guest and I sat down. Then, a woman claiming to be the manager (I'm pretty sure that she wasn't the manager) came by our table and offered my guest and I a free drink.  She apologized to us for the poor treatment by the greeters. So 5 stars minus 2 stars for the nasty greeters at the front door.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Finally after 45 minutes told the waitress we couln't wait any longer, and left. At least she didn't try to charge us for the appetizer and beverages. Maybe she forgot to put our order in, or something went wrong in the kitchen, but if your table sits without food for 45 minutes, wouldn't you try to figure out what was wrong?

"It's awesome this cozy gastro-pub still retains its status as a West Village hotspot since its opening in 2004. There are no reservations, and the wait time for dinner can be atrocious on any day of the week.  If you show up past 7pm, be prepared to wait at LEAST 1 hour (more likely 2 hours for a party of 4).  The Pig appears to have a much higher ratio of two-top tables, so coming with a party of 2 will help considerably with quicker seating.  If you must ditch the rest of your party for the sake of delicious comfort pub food, so be it.  Another con that comes with the packed house: slow service.  But I could even see how long it took our server to weave through the crowd to get to our table each time... My must-order dishes include the chicken liver toast, sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, and roasted quail.  The burger's roquefort cheese is a bit too salty but I do love the accompanying rosemary shoestring fries! It's not cheap, it's not convenient, but it's certainly delicious!  Is it worth the hype and the exorbitant wait times?  Still undecided.  I would recommend stopping by The Pig first to put your name on the list and give your mobile number, and then head off to one of the many amazing bars in the vicinity to chill at while you wait for a table.  Keep drinking, stay happy, and you will be eating Chef Bloomfield's finest in no time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Rayfil W. had it very clear when he heard me crying about ""I like sweet corn grains but not in my ramen"".. .. ""You are so picky"" he said, and take those out from my bowl in a failed try to me like the ramen. Now I know that corn grain can be a regular topping in ramen but still... I knew I didn't like it with the first look. Unfortunately, looks like I was right and he wasn't since at the end he didn't like his Basic Pork Broth with thick noodles as well.   I was really excited when I could finally head up to Minca after to hear so many good things about it; some of them from Shyge, a Japanese friend back in Tokyo now, who thinks that the ramen at Minca is really good. ""The taste of broth is very sophisticated (but I felt a bit lack of salt). Probably they don't use artificial seasoning"" is what he told me when I asked him. Said this, I have to admit that maybe I'm that picky and that as I said before personal preferences play a main role when we are judging ramen. I didn't like my Spicy Vegetable Miso Ramen-vege with fried tofu and thick noodles. I didn't like it at all. The noodles had the right texture, but not better than the ones at Ippudo or Menchanko-Tei. Actually, Ippudo reach perfection in terms of noodle texture. The broth had the right spiciness, a little too greasy to me and I use to like more delicate. It looks like if David Chang and Menchanko-Tei.. even Ippudo work more in the broth resulting in a complex combination of ingredients perfectly melted that brings you an elaborate and delicate broth, amazing in flavor as well and not easy to discern; in contrast with the simple Minca's broth, independently that it could be very rich and heavy in flavor for the use of pork and fat. I find Minca noodles and broth quite standard and not the best I had. My main complain is however about the toppings. The few pieces of tofu, as they said in their description, are fried but it was really deep fried and so too dry...The few corn grains that I ate didn't tasted very well and it didn't match with the soup. I didn't like the cabbage pieces as well. The black mushrooms was just a few and there wasn't scallions. In general I founded the topping pretty poor in quality and amount. It was a cold snowing afternoon on December 31st, 2009. The place is small and cozy I wouldn't recommend groups bigger than 4-6 if you wanna seat together. The staff was friendly, but I missed water a tea refilling several times during our lunch. It was half empty and we could stay in for almost 2 hours. I'll not reject future invites to Minca since to me a disagree review with 70% of Yelpers that rate it as 4 or 5 mean; and also this is based in just 2 broths. But ending this year I'll keep proclaiming Menchanko-Tei at 45th street as the best and more sophisticated noodle soup and Ramen among the ones I tried, which includes the most popular ones except for Menkui-Tei, my next destination. And even not being a fan of all the Ramen that Ippudo offers I can't other than recognize that they are the best at East Village.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Like most New Haven pizzerias, Sally's does not live up to the hype. What's up with the charred crust...is this cajun style pizza? My pizza was so thin the slices were disintegrating in my hand. The wait for tables is much too long, and the joint is dirty as heck....a great place to get Hepatitis-A. Seems like whenever I go, the adjacent table consists of a squadron of fat college guys having a personal pizza eating contest. It's not appetizing having to listen to a table of lard asses belching in unison to make room for pie number 6. Do yourself a favor and head to Modern on State Street where you'll find a quieter/cleaner atmosphere and better pizza.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love this place.  It's open 24 hours and they have a great brunch menu that is available 7 days a week instead of just weekends.  Most of the food is organic and amazingly priced. I've been here many times for brunch (especially because it is only $16 & includes 2 free mixed drinks). Today I actually came for dinner and was not disappointed.  We had scallops, chicken milanese, stuffed shells and falafel.  Everything was great. Especially the stuffed shells.

"Yasuda is the beacon on the hill.  It is the shining example of what Edomae sushi should be.  In a country that often values quantity over quality, Yasuda is a breath of fresh air from all the Tomoe's and Yama's of NYC, where inappropriately oversized slabs of fish are carelessly thrown atop beds of rice which act as more of a formality than anything.  It is a saving grace in a city where Sushi Samba or other ""trendy"" japanese places are too often packed. Sushi restaurants that decorate and season their fish with all sorts of distracting ingredients should all be destroyed (except Gari).  Okay, so maybe I'm getting a little carried away here... But really, it is a minimlistic haven that stays true to the purest form of sushi and that is a beautiful thing.  Everything from the sleek and simple decor to the humble plain ti leaf that serves as your plate, Yasuda focuses all your senses onto the excellence of the ingredients and their composition.  Equally impressive is the attention to detail and quality of service demonstrated by the sushi chefs.  Noticing that my girlfriend struggled ever so slightly to chew each piece of sushi whole, the chef began making her pieces smaller.  The expertise and care of these chefs is unrivaled. Yasuda is simply the best. (at least until I win the lottery and can afford to go to Masa). P.S. - Yes, I know I'm a sushi dork.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"When I go to a diner I can dig that ""we don't care that you came in"" vibe from the staff, and PJ's delivers.   If you order an $8+ breakfast plate here, you're going to feel like a chump, plain and simple.  The bacon's weak, the pancakes I can make myself, and the eggs don't dance.  Also, coffee is off the charts pricey. Their saving grace (aside from their graceless service, which I've already said I kind of like) is their rib plate.  It's a special, but for $13.25 I left full up on ribs, mashed potatoes, and cole slaw.  Worth it, especially when it's raining.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I feel like I shouldn't review this place because I have been there like 20 times (like don't date a girl you work with, etc.)...probably once a week (usually saturday mornings) for like three months running.  So obviously it is a good breakfast spot.  I also realize there are some places I have rated three stars that are better than Marathon on the Square (btw this is only for Marathon on the Square I don't really like the other one's all that much), and I have a Yelp rep to uphold. Anyways...as breakfasts go, this place gets the job done...not as good as Parc, not as annoying as Green Eggs, better food than Day by Day, and more convenient that Ant's Pants.  The veggie chili is delicious and the people are always nice.  Sitting outside on a nice day always brings with it great people watching.  It is also definitely the best of the Marathon's. Lunch and dinner are also good; it is a good neighborhood spot (not expensive, good food, nice people).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a sophisticated dinner.

"I was debating b/w 3 and 4 stars, but the burger was really damn good so I'm going to say 3.5 stars. Pros: Delicious burger, fun and lively atmosphere, friendly waitstaff.  Just generally a good time. Cons: Unlike others, I thought the fries were limp and mediocre. And I didn't think the deviled eggs were anything special. The Salty Dog we ordered was good, but not great. The biggest con was, of course, the wait. 1.5 hours is just too damn long for anything that isn't spectacular. That said, it was a relaxed Sunday night with my sister and we happily sipped bears at the Otheroom (loved, great beer selection and atmosphere, highly recommend) while we waited, so the long wait was very tolerable that night. I probably wouldn't go back given the super long wait and cramped quarters, but I wouldn't object if others insisted! All in all, great burger (but I still prefer Minetta's), and everything else was just okay.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Better know what you order though, prices for bottles goes from $60 to $995 from what I remember. Food was good but the gnocchi I ordered were slightly overcooked. The portions served are very small and the pasta entrees are the size of an appetizer. Better have at least an appetizer + two entrees and dessert or you'll stay hungry. (Advice good for men with a normal appetite), portion might be enough for a girl. I would recommend to spend a minimum of $70 per person (only for food). Overall: Not worth It.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I never had a yelp account to make comments but this time I had to set up an account just for this.. I go to school at NYU so me and a bunch of friends used to frequent this place until we encounter such nasty attitude from one particular waitress/hostess. Its funny because students at NYU always seem to mention this one waitress/hostess. She is the skinny one with long hair and always demanding for more tips. First of all she is not even nice or friendly or even give good service and she expects a huge tip. I was there friday night and supposedly my friend and I did not leave enough tip so she threw the tip right back at us and just kept eye balling us. what the hell????? she was so mad that we did not leave an extra buck that she started banging the bowls while clearing our table. so who gets the last laugh now?? with some one like her there just makes me not wanting to leave a tip..

"Ordered one of the lunch specials: Gen. Tso Shrimp, which comes with rice (I chose fried) and a pork egg roll. Positive: LOTS of rice, generous portions all the way. Also a nice surprise not mentioned in the menu, a hefty pile of steamed broccoli came with it. First complaint: as someone else mentioned, the egg rolls have WAY too much dough and are tough. Not to mention the duck sauce comes in a container too small for dipping. Second complaint: While I held it flat ""because of the sauce"" (as instructed), the bag was filled with sauce, the rice was completely soaked with sauce. Let's just say it was tricky eating out of the container and the plastic bag had to stay around it. 3rd: pork fried rice had really not much in it that I can see. A little bit of egg and pork, but that's it. 4th: The shrimp batter was completely flavorless, and soggy 5 minutes after they handed it to me. Bottom line: I threw away most of it. That's $7 I'll never get back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Malt House seemed like the perfect place to have Sunday brunch.  My friend and I entered the restaurant to a warm atmosphere.  With only one other couple in the restaurant, we had a nice selection of empty tables to occupy. The menu was small, and limited for my vegetarian friend.  She ordered the eggs Benedict, sans meat, and I ordered the breakfast burger. After several minutes, my friend's meal arrived, along with a burger that I DIDN'T order-- a portabello burger.  I flagged down the waitress to get it fixed.  She took the mistake and assured me that the correct burger would arrive promptly.  My friend nibbled at her meal, trying to be polite and wait for mine to come. Twenty minutes later, it was delivered to the table.  The meat was a perfect medium, but the fried egg on top was undercooked and lacked flavour.  My friend had trouble enjoying her eggs benny by the time she got to eat it.  The fries on the side were the best part of the meal. The server apologized in a very unapologetic way as she brought the bill for the full price amount.  The warm atmosphere got colder over the course of our brunch. I hope the only other couple sharing brunch had a better experience than we did.  We will NOT be returning.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'll admit it- I totally had an attitude about Momofuku restaurants. Why? Because of the crazy reservation system for Ko (I woke up early two days in a row to try to get a table at Ko... no luck) and their ten page FAQ document on Bo Ssam. This was the first stop on our ""Foodcation"" in NYC and we were praying that we would get a table. Momofuku Ssam Bar, you won me over. First of all, my BFF and I walked in for lunch and get a table right away. My baditude slowly started to dissolve. Then I saw the the Kimchi Bloody Mary- WHAT??? Genius, spicy, flavorful and delicious (well, if you like those two flavors. I know I do!!!). I ordered from the prix fixe menu. I started with the steamed pork buns with hoisin, cucumbers, scallions. Instead of a big, think bun, this was almost more like a sandwich. The outside was pretty light and so delicious. Next was the spicy rice cakes with pork sausage, chinese broccoli, crispy shallots. OMG- the little rice cakes were so crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. This was a spicy dish and I savored every bite- this was a huge portion! Last was the bo ssam... just kidding! I had a grapefruit cream pie with candied grapefruit, black sesame, ritz cracker crust. This was yummy, but the best part was the Ritz cracker crust- sweet and salty... a perfect combo! Oh Momofuku Ssam Bar, you won me over!

I was nervous about having to dissect a lobster in front of my colleagues so I requested they serve the dish with the lobster meat already shelled and it was no problem at all. This dish was delicious. The black linguine had such a depth of flavor that was paired perfectly with the spicy tomato sauce. The shrimp were a bit over cooked but the flavor wasn't affected. They had large front windows that open to the sidewalk which I think would be perfectly romantic and European feeling in the summer.

"I went here for lunch with my boss since it's about a 2 minute walk from my building. I made a reservation, but it seems the lunch crowd isn't too dense here so it was unnecessary. It's nicely decorated interior, although the faintness of the font on the menu and the dim lighting present a little bit of a challenge when perusing the menu. I settled on getting the Hot Pastrami Sandwich. It comes on whole grain bread with mustard, saurkraut, and swiss cheese. It was decent enough, although quite heavy and greasy, but I should have gathered that since there isn't a pastrami sandwich in existence that isn't both of those things. I could have used a little bit more saurkraut on it and the pastrami could have been a little bit more tender. The fries were just ok. Greasy, but somewhat soggy and in very small cuts. The price is a little bit expensive which would be in line with most Flatiron restaurants. I'd be hesitant to come here again as the Pastrami sandwich is actually one of the cheaper options at $14. Most other lunch entrees will run about $20. Oh, and luckily my meal came with a side of fries because otherwise they run you an astounding $7 to order them as a side.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ordered 3 sandwiches earlier today for pickup. Had to throw all of them out unfortunately. Ordered the Rainforest for a vegan friend. 3 bites into it and she pulled out a piece of some sort of wrapper or plastic wrap the length of the sandwich with her teeth. The tofu was not even cooked. It seemed like it was taked out of the package and thrown onto it. Ordered the Vietnamese. Was entirely soaked in grease to the point that the foil it was wrapped in fell apart with the sandwich. The ""steak"" was cooked to the point it chewed like rubber and the fresh asian slaw that should have at least been crunchy was just as soggy as the rest from all the grease. Also ordered a portobello that lacked any type of flavor that could have been involved in it. I called the order in and was hung up on by whoever took the ordet without asking a name or anything.

"I'm a huge fan of Cantina's Northern Liberties location so I never made my way to Los Caballitos but I'm really glad I finally did.   Heading to a popular Philly restaurant on a Sunday at 1:30 is always risky but luckily it wasn't crazy crowded and we were seated right away and brought their chips and 2 salsas - which I could just have that for lunch and be very happy.  We ordered drinks and I tried a special with Bluecoat gin, cucumber purée and sangrita.  It was similar to a bloody mary but cucumber always makes things way more refreshing.  They took about ten minutes to come which wasn't a big deal to us, but our server apologized and bought us that round and that made him awesome in my eyes.

I recommend the Eggs Benedict with green chile cornbread and bacon.  I'll absolutely be back again the food and drinks are great and the servers were all very friendly and happy to help anyone which for me turns a place from good to a favorite.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The first time I went was with a friend on a weeknight, and we squeezed in at the bar to have a beer and order sandwiches that were phenomenal, and far too big to finish in one sitting. The second time was with my family for my birthday. We had a party of eight, including two toddlers, and they managed to get us in within a half hour despite an estimated hour on a Friday night. We ordered a bunch of their specialty pizzas and appetizers, and everything was delicious. And a few members of the wait staff who weren't attending to our table stopped by and entertained my nieces.

"I guess I should pronounce outright that you can't expect too much from Tom's.  I mean we are a breed of 21st century, time wasting snobs that share in common an uncanny level of excitement for eating and truly thinking about what we're eating, but you have to draw the line somewhere... somewhere... somewhere out there over the 20-something air waves Tom's got the knock for being a hipster diner.  Well at least that's how it was revealed to me. Screw that...it's just old and popular.  You get breakfast and lunch food that shouldn't inspire even the most contemptuous NY food snob to think too deeply. Tom's is a lot of fun...like Ryan Gosling's recent movie Drive (a Hipster Fairy Tale!), Tom's is like stepping back in time in a cramped space without ADA consideration (Something I've always liked to a great extent...slightly damp, concrete spaces with layers upon layers of decorative choices made more and more convoluted with each decade of business survival). We finally went after several subconscious, non-verbalized occasions where Tom's lost out to lesser, more obnoxious options, and I'd say all in all that the 30 minutes we sat at the bar and ate... -Danish Pancakes -Veggie Omelette -English Breakfast Tea -Tomato Juice ...were a good 30 minutes of my life.  The Veggie Omelette was cooked to the point the eggs resembled the dry skin that accumulates when you rub your hand over it, but it was packed with veggies and quite tasty, but... it's their pancakes that really seal (well ya never gonna survive...unless) the deal.  The Danish Pancakes are: ricotta, lemon zest, parmesan and blueberries.  They, in contrast to the eggs, were cooked to perfection...fluffy and light.  Not like the vast majority of the malicious world of pancakes that causes shit sweats 4 bites in. Tom's has character, zero space and food that isn't very special, but I guess it's appeal is that it still exists in the same way it probably always has without making big claims or bold statements, the only difference being that Mexicans run it...and that's a welcome change for me instead of a capitalizing old scab, or an old scab who could give a shit.

"I'm going with other sentiment here that if the service bothers you that much you just don't get it. Do you think Sally's doesn't know people complain about the service constantly? Yet natives of New Haven keep going back weekly, and people come from across the country to eat here, and even if they hate the service they'll still come back one day and still eat the pizza(though this time it'll probably be take out). That not caring atmosphere of Sally's is what it's customers like. If you want a waitstaff that will kiss up to you, go further down the street. And as someone else said, Sally was just not built to deal with the amount of customers they get now. But anyways, back to the pizza, what can I say that hasn't been said, it's the most beautiful thing you will experience taste wise.

This was only my third spot to try in Philly, but was seriously way above the other two, one being Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai. They were pretty good as far as what they put in their seafood pho, but not their broth. Nam Phuong's broth was hearty and and sweet and they had shrimp, mussels, fake crab and squid. I would  have been super stoked if they would put some veggies in their seafood pho as well. My friend got the vegetarian pho which was great as well. It has an actual veggie pho (which is often difficult to find) and was full of yummy vieggies. The broth was light and healthy.

"A little respite from the busy streets and life of NY. I can only vouch for the items on the $15 prix-fixe menu served from 5-7pm -- absolutely loved it. It was a blustery Wednesday night and we had passed Paprika a few times in the past vowing to come back to try the prix-fixe since it seemed to be such a deal! 2 course dinner for $15?? How could you go wrong? Except if... the portions were small or the food just tasted horrible. But that was just not the case!! When we entered the restaurant @ 6:15pm there was only one other group there, enjoying their dinner at the corner table nearest the window. The restaurant was dimly lit with candles and votives on every table -- romantic, cozy, a great place to bring a date. Service was great! We were seated within minutes, the hostess, the waitress, everyone who attended to us was friendly and attentive. Our water was never empty for more than a few minutes. The waitress and hostess checked in with us without being intrusive. The only thing that I would suggest is that they should provide bread plates... we used the olive plate and the bread basket as substitutes... As for the food! Let's talk about the food! As mentioned before we ordered off the $15 menu and because of the price I figured that the quality may be good but the quantity would be small, or vice versa. BUT the portions were impressive! The salad was huge considering and the entree was pretty norm, but for its quantity and its flavor you would expect to pay something upwards of $30+ for something equivalent elsewhere. We started with the arugula + shaved parmesan + apple salad & the goat's cheese + pear + arugula salad. I would recommend getting the goat's cheese salad. It's more flavorful and all the components meld together better, you've got the sweetness of the walnuts and pears, you've got the strong flavor of the goat's cheese, and the bitterness of the arugula. The shaved parmesan salad was a little too bitter for me and lacked something I can't identify. As for entrees we ordered the gnocchi in tomato sauce & the salmon over spinach. The salmon was fantastic! It had the perfect crunch on the outside but was still moist, super tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness on the inside. The spinach was a perfect accompaniment, just salty enough and added a great texture to the fish -- I highly recommend it! The gnocchi was unbelievably soft but the plate left something to desire. Besides the tomato sauce & the melted mozzarella there was really no other flavors, no other textures, and I think it was just too much of the same thing. Again this place is fantastic and I would definitely come back -- next time to try the rest of the prix fixe items! Highly recommended! 5-7!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Once I find something I like, I stick with it. I went to have lunch here with 2 fellow doctoral student friends/colleagues of mine. On this cold winter day, I craved a squid bimbimbap. Pricy for lunch? Very....more so than most other korean places in the general area. But worth every penny..... a perfect marriage of flavors. Awesome spread of Korean bites during lunch - fabulous kimchi, the fresh tofu is delicious if that's your thing (has the texture of and looks like the egg white of a properly poached egg). My friend got a chopped chicken dish that came sizzling and bubbling, which she enjoyed but said was too greasy to take home with her. My other friend got a vegetarian/tofu heavy bimbimbap with a traditional egg on top. She seemed to enjoy it a lot... The only thing I find consistently weird about this place is how they serve hot tea in cheap plastic cups. You have to wait until your hot tea is lukewarm to enjoy it. Also, the lack of a big lunch menu is also perturbing, but I know I'll be back again for the squid bimbimbap.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went for brunch this past Sunday with two friends; we had an 11:45 reservation and waited about 10 minutes before sitting down, which wasn't too bad, and it got much more crowded later.  As usual the strawberry butter was delicious and it's always pleasant to get a bread basket for brunch these days, which I feel doesn't happen very often anymore.   I ordered the french toast even though I usually go with eggs, given I'd been reading such rave reviews.  It was really tasty - great and balanced textured - soft and mushy in the middle and crispier around the crust, just like it should be.  The plate did look a little boring and would have benefited from some fresh fruit slices or some other flourish. Overall, the brunch is very good value as most of the meals include a cocktail.  I'd rate the bloody mary as average - not as thick as I like, and could have been a bit spicier.  Service is pretty decent given the volume they do, but keep in mind this isn't a place they let you linger and relax - at least not during weekend brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I like Effie's Place for breakfast, but in the future I should just stick to the basics.  I've been here a handful of times for breakfast and always had some variation of eggs, breakfast meat, homefries, and toast, and have never been disappointed.  Love their homemade corned beef hash, coffee is always served piping hot, staff are always knowledgable and efficient.   Good stuff. Today when I went with my roommate and his lady we were all drawn to items on the specials list, all of which sounded incredible: lox, sauteed onion and cheddar omelet for me, pina colada french toast for roommate's girlfriend, and lobster benedict for the roommate.  We shared a side of corned beef hash. All of our dishes were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  Perhaps it was my mistake to order lox in an omelet because the cooking process changed the texture and taste a bit and overcooked the fish.  The lobster benedict was probably the tastiest dish of the three, in my opinion, as it included chunks of fresh lobster meat on top of hollandaise sauce served on puff pastry.  We liked it, but didn't love it (we all tried each others).  Pina colada french toast was good, but I was not a huge fan of the thick and sweet pineapple jam that was smothered on the pieces of french toast, although the shredded coconut was a nice touch. The corned beef hash was tasty, as usual, but just slightly overcooked this time with some visible burnt spots.  Other times I've had it, it has been perfectly perfect.  Toast and homefries were delicious, as usual.  The homefries have small pieces of chopped onion and green pepper in them, which I like, but others might not. All in all, a good breakfast, but I'll probably skip the specials list next time and order off the regular breakfast menu.  Was it worth the 15 minute wait?  Considering we went during prime brunch hour on a Sunday morning and other places would have been more crowded, absolutely.","[1.0, 0.0]"

WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!?! a: its NOT a tapas place (and can we please spell it correctly if we are going to review?!)   They have a full menu, and every time I've gone, I've had a wonderful 3 course dinner (including awesome cocktails!)  My favorite would be the coconut mojito .. i think they call it a cojito?..  Its wonderful and I highly recommend it to ANYONE who goes here! b: Angelica; you are wrong.  It does age well with time!  Its been around for 10 years or more. I can remember back to when it was Main Street (not as good as Calle Ocho) and I can only say it has gotten better with age! The food has been pretty consistent over the years but it seems they switched up their menu recently (which was not a bad idea!)  The food does, has, and will always BE AMAZING!   The food is not dry, and as for the wait; this is nyc guys!  I have always found the wait to be reasonable and definitely worth it for the food - and the wait is made easier by having a basket of their reallllllllllllllly good bread balls.  They have cheese in them and they kick a**!!! Overall; dinner has always been fantastic there.  I went with family this week, they had never been, and they were blown away. Kudos to Calle Ocho!  All the haters need to go away - it isnt their fault they are a popular and busy restaurant! Which is a BLESSING in this economy! I definitely recommend making a reservation; the brunch seems to fill up very quickly!! The sangria is a good deal...it's free..what more can you ask for?!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came here on a Saturday for dinner with the girls. I like the ambiance and overall atmosphere. Even though all the tables were taken but it didn't feel over-crowded inside. The waiter was really patient as we didn't know what to ordered and he also explained at the beginning when we wanted to order sushi that Ootoya is not famous for sushi but the chicken and pork bowls. We ended up ordering four Yakitori skewers but left the choice of meat to the waiter so he can surprise us. Then we ordered a Mini Kaisen Don, the grilled fish from the special menu, the Tori Tatsuta and the Salmon Sushi Set. I wasn't happy with the Yakitori as I thought the flavor of some skewers wasn't a match for me but their rice dishes were really on point. Each of the set come with Egg Pudding (soft and silky and melt in your mouth), Miso Soup (Ehh) and various small veggies dishes. I thought that they nailed the Grilled Fish (forgot what kind of fish it was) but the fish was grilled to perfection. Not over-cooked, it was very flaky and soft. The fried chicken of the Tori Tatsuta was delicious, as well as the sashimi. The Mini Kaisen Don was big enough to fill me up. The last thing I want to say is that I absolutely love the rice at Ootoya. I don't usually eat white rice but it was really good I almost ate the whole thing and if they give you the option, opt for seaweed rice. That thing was beyond delicious, I could really forget brown rice and all that nutrition stuff for that one bowl of seaweed rice.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here for an early dinner around 5pm on a weekday with my brother and had a great meal. We both got rice vermicelli bowls which were reasonably priced at around $10. They had rice noodles, a meat of your choice, cucumbers, carrots, and some other veggies. with a nice light sauce of some sort. not sure exactly what it was but it had just the right amount of spice for me. The ambiance was nice. It had a more upscale feeling than I had expected. We were there in the daytime and they had the huge windows that make up most of the wall open. The sun was shining and a breeze was blowing. It was great. The servers were attentive and plentiful. I think we had at least three different people as our server, no problems there. I will mention that they only had chopsticks out on the table. They may have had silverware available but I didn't ask. So if you absolutely can't use chopsticks you may wanna call ahead and ask if they have silverware. All in all, we had a great time and it was pretty darn inexpensive so I'll definitely be back in the future","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had an absolutely amazing meal earlier this evening, the service was exquisite, the decor was classy and the food was delicious.  I was immediately drawn to the angel hair pasta dish with a myriad of seafood, but after seeing the previous reviews of the lobster crepes on here, I could not help myself.   After I placed my order, we received bruschetta which was the best I have ever had, I would have been completely content eating more of that as the main course, it was that good.   We ordered two glasses of the house red and when the food came I was thrilled with the clean presentation and my olfactory senses were overwhelmed.   The first bite was as good as the last, and the wine complimented the dish beautifully, personally, I should have probably ordered an appetizer as the crepes alone did not completely fill me up, but I still left extremely satisfied.  I leave in 4 days, but am tempted to return again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mexican cuisine often makes me nervous.  Too frequently it means plates piled high with sticky rice and refried beans; stringy, sinewy meat, slathered with goopy sauce, loosely bound by greasy wheat tortillas.  Whether or not this is ""authentic"" Mexican, is not my problem.  However, the notion of ""fancy Mexican"" food can seem something of an oxymoron.  It is, inherently, a comfort food, with arguably no ambitions of a higher calling.  But for me, the art of good Mexican cuisine is in the balance. And masters of this craft walk the line between tactful elegance and honest humility.  La Calaca Feliz has mastered this balance. My girlfriend and I were running low.  Five hours of shopping on a post-Christmas Saturday had us drained of just about everything.  I live in the Art Museum area and I've been meaning to try out the relatively new neighborhood addition La Calaca Felix for some time.  Now was that time.  We were famished enough not to care about the danger of refried beans and triple cheese chimichangas.  Bring it on.  We were immediately impressed by the décor and service.  The bar is inviting and stylish.  The dining room is warm and tastefully thematic.  Our waitress was an oracle.  She knew what we wanted before we did.  So far, so good.   We started with a round of Mezcal drinks, which for me, sparked fuzzy memories of dark alleys in Tijuana.  The Pork Belly Gordita paved serious inroads into the meaning of life.  Talk about a fantastic medley of mysterious flavors mixed with fresh classic ingredients.  The Pulpo (octopus) skewers were on par with the best octopus in the city (I've had them all).  And the Duck confit stuffed jalapenos were original and bold.  The Baja Fish Taco's were buttery, flaky morsels of fun.  My only critique would be that the tilapia should have been baked instead of fried.  The Carnitias (pulled pork) Tacos were petite little pockets of pure perfection.  Again, the freshness of the ingredients was impossible to miss, and the corn tortillas were a nice, authentic touch.  The wine selection was very nice.  We enjoyed a fantastically spicy La Rioja Tampranillo, which perfectly complimented every flavor of our meal.  Neither of us are particularly desert people, but we didn't want the meal to end.  The warm chocolate cake with spicy fudge drizzle was delightful. La Calaca Feliz has found the balance.  The food is exquisite.  The service is stellar.  The atmosphere is fun.  And the price tag was a relief.  If you're ever in the mood to be pleasantly surprised, I'd highly recommend La Calaca Feliz.  El Vez and Distrito may have the trendy chefs and flashy décor, but La Calaca Feliz has the food.  I'll see you there.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I visited here while I was in Philly on business, because everyone said that it was a ""must visit"" experience. I have to admit, the food was great - the ultimate comfort/treat food, and really affordable too. The only problem is, the noise. I visited during lunch time on a weekday and the place was packed, so it was hard to find a seat. It was really noisy too. Service was quick, and the food was filling and tasty. I would have preferred eating somewhere quieter, though. If you're in the area and fancy an authentic fast-food experience, this is a nice place to eat, but it's not somewhere you'd go for a formal meal. Maybe I just had the place described to me badly since I'm not from the area, but I'd just like to emphasize that it IS fast food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Harold's signature dish - Spicy duck meatballs were SUPER yummy. I could have eaten them as an entree if there was an entree size. The calamari & watercress salad was very good also. The watercress was not served raw but toasted or lightly fried. I had the Three Little Pigs tasting, which is a fun dish, as the waitress had described it but I guess since I'm not a fan of pork dishes, it didn't WOW me. The edamame falafel side was a bit on the salty side but the farro risotto was very good. Not the traditional texture of risotto but the flavors were great. My friend had the Fiddle Head Fern & Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with truffle butter. The flavor was great. I didn't taste the ricotta gnudi but the ferm in the truffle butter was a party in your mouth. I am a fan and can't wait to go back and try his other dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is to chocolate what PF Changs is to Chinese. To sum up in a few words, it is contrived, insanely overpriced, and the quality of food and service falls far short of the sensationalism. Here's the long story... To start, we've heard about this place for awhile, both in Philly and abroad in Australia. We've heard of people making pilgrimages there, so despite the fact that this restaurant might not be our usual style, we decided to try it out. My boyfriend and I planned on meeting with a group of friends, but were told upon arrival that we could not sit with them, a group of 5 who already had a table. None of us had seen each other in a long time, so it was pretty disappointing to be stopped even before getting our hellos in! We have both worked as servers for a few years, so understand that seating can be difficult, but also understand that SIPS tends to draw larger groups and a restaurant should generally be able to accommodate two extra people. Upon walking over to our friends, still standing, we were stormed by multiple servers, who accused us of taking chairs from another table (we hadn't), assumed we were with a different group, and told us that we could not, under any circumstances, sit with them. It's one thing to politely explain the situation, but it's COMPLETELY different to make assumptions and blatant accusations of your soon-to-be-paying customers, before they have even considered sitting! They told the two of us that we could sit at the bar, and though I was already inclined to leave, I was encouraged to stay (and we did). At the bar, we ordered their signature chocolate martini and white sangria. Both were good, but not exceptional. The chocolate martini glass was small to begin with, and filled with ice. It's worth a try, but I would never pay the full $12 for a few ounces of glorified chocolate milk. Our friends ordered the fondue dessert...we tasted some of the remains later on, but the chocolate tasted more syrupy and sweet than rich or luscious - something I would have expected from a chocolate place. We did not order food ourselves, after taking a look at the prices. $15 for a BLT?! Why did they have asian chicken skewers on the menu? Kobe beef? Weird. It gave me the same feeling as any other chain restaurant...despite sensationalism, they are serving food that lacks true creativity and spontaneity. It felt very contrived and corporate. This place seems confused...like they're doing a lot, but none of it particularly well. In general, the layout of this place is just crowded and weird...from the poorly placed wait stations and tables by the door, to the kitchen entrance itself. At one point, I was waiting for my friend to leave the bathroom (single bathrooms, which quickly form lines) and was told that I would have to move because I was blocking the kitchen. What?? Again, understandable, but the waitress just scolded me, in the same tone that a mother might to her 5 year old child, and continued to walk away. Overall, we wound up spending close to two hours there, but I just found myself feeling very baffled by the experience. Though I tried to remain open minded, I felt unwelcome the whole time. This place is nothing to rave over and it is far from a chocolate wonderland. The décor is contrived, and as another reviewer put it, seemed like a manic Starbucks. From the fake chocolate machines in the front to the ""chocolate pipes"" along the ceiling, I felt skeptical rather than enchanted, as if I were standing behind the scenes of some cheesy magic show, watching the magician pull all the strings. The is an example of a place that should scale back and focus on doing one thing right...and where personality and politeness would go a long way. The type of person who would be impressed by this place is the same type of person who goes to Outback for a good steak. Nice try on the marketing scheme, but I'm not buying it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Iced coffee was nicely done (some places make it too bitter)  They have coca cola in the glass bottle too- which I love. The eclair we tried was good, but not out of this world like the sandwich was.  The next pastries we had - the chocolate cake (Sorry cannot remember name!) and the custard were pretty good as well.

"The idea of mayo on fries disgusted me at first, but boy was I mistaken.

I got the small, which was more than enough for me. Top that off with some sundried tomato mayo and I was in heaven. If you're sharing and hungry, definitely bump up to the reg or large.

"4.4 Stars Short: Nice folks, great and creative dog on a superb roll, wish there were more side dishes. Less Short: I went to Hot Diggity for the first time, thanks to a great offer on LevelUp ($6 off your first purchase). 'Desert Dog' + Soda for $8, perfectly reasonable. The bun was really good (chewier and more substantial than a normal roll), the dog itself was really good (thin and long, crisped nicely), and the toppings were very good (pinto beans, tortilla strips [which fell out constantly], green salsa [which could have had more kick], chopped onion and tomato). The pinto beans worked with the tomato and onion to give the impression of a fresh tasting, less messy, less fatty chilli. Recommended. Also, the guys behind the counter were very nice. Only criticism: give us at least one not-french-fry side dish. I mean, look: I LOVE fries. And I've heard good things about their's. But I'm already eating a hot dog, which, for me, is somewhat guilt inducing. Give me a side of stewed greens, or succotash, or something as a side dish option that isn't even worse for me than the dog. Aside from that, great spot for a workday lunch. I'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place really proves to not judge a book by its cover.  Looking at the decor and the way this place presents itself, I would expect it to be a lot more expensive (and a lot lower in quality) than it is.  But I must say, this place surprised me in terms of its prices, quality of the food, and speed of service. The decor screams ""slightly fancy nightclub"" more than restaurant...the sleek, modern look, the slight bizarreness of just about everything.  But it's not that bad.  There are two layers of seating, and then a separate area on the roof (which is very nice in the right weather). The menu is surprisingly small, and the offerings are not quite as diverse as I expected--which I think is how this place does what it does well.  The prices range pretty widely.  You could easily drop $20-30 a person, but you can also get out of here eating for under $10 a person if you're not terribly hungry and order one of the larger, more inexpensive items. Service was very fast...the food was brought out very quickly, which makes me think that they have many of the things pre-made or in a form that can be easily made.  But it's not fast food: it's very fresh, with whole ingredients, very high quality.  The food was relatively transparent: it's pretty easy to see what goes into each dish, which is fun in case you want to reverse-engineer them to make something similar at home.  Some items were better than others but overall it was pretty good, and much of it was light and healthy, the stuff that leaves you feeling good after eating it. Bottom line?  I'm surprised, but I'd actually come back here.  It's not my style, not my type of place, in terms of the ambiance, but for what it is, it is very well-executed.  It looks pretentious but it's not.  This is a place that could please a broad range of people.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here for a birthday dinner for a party of 10 or so. We showed up at 7 for a 7pm dinner and were expecting to be early and grab a drink before everybody else arrived.  Surprisingly half the table was actually already there! You don't have that happen often in this city. I'm typically not a big fan of doing tapas when it's a huge party because things get complicated but I figured what the hell.  I went as a guest of a friend who was invited so I didn't know many of the people at the table.This initially made ordering a bit difficult because communication was not the strong point at the table that evening. However, after a glass or two of their delicious sangria we just started ordering everything and it turned out fine. It's very easy to want to order everything they have, so their option of doing just that for $420 is a great deal! Unfortunately we had some vegetarians at the table so that option got dismissed. I think Alta does a lot better with seafood dishes than meat dishes. The scallops, bacon wrapped dates, and grilled octopus were probably my 3 favorite dishes from the evening. Delish! The ambiance was great here. It is one of those few places where you can easily have a large party or an intimate dinner and have a great evening either way. It was loud and lively with the buzz of good conversations all over and I really enjoyed the huge fire  they had going. It made the place very cozy.   My only issue with the place was our waitress. She had some sort of attitude thing going on that I did not appreciate. Service is always a huge factor in my book and that knocked this place down a star. But I liked the complimentary coat check!  Very necessary in this city. Overall a great restaurant that needs a minor attitude adjustment.","[1.0, 0.0]"

When the order finally arrived, I paid in cash.  The delivery guy did not have change, so I was forced to give him a very large tip.  Once I got upstairs and checked the order, I realized that one of the four orders was missing completely, and only part of another order had arrived.  I called to ask for my money back since it was already so late and we didn't want to wait for them to bring the rest of the order.  The manager agreed, but then called back a little while later to offer me a store credit instead, since his kitchen guy thought he had sent the full order.  He did not, and I did not appreciate being called a liar.  I explained that a credit wouldn't help since I was never ordering from his restaurant again, and that I wanted back the cash I paid for items that were not received.  He did eventually send back the cash for the missing items, but it took a lot of arguing to get there. I was very surprised at the level of rudeness, incompetence, and general unpleasantness shown by the staff at Crisp.  Though I've enjoyed their food in the past, I will not be frequenting this restaurant anymore.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Weird, oily fried rice and flavorless ribs, but amazing, juicy chicken. Just make sure you get the half piece. The quarter piece we got was kind of dry. The green sauce is also really tasty. Could use a bit more spiciness, but adds good flavor to the dry parts of the ribs and the bland fried rice and ribs. This place is a hole in the wall, but lines are long. It's kind of weird that they charge you extra just for the act of choosing dark meat vs. white and not the actual piece you choose. Still, probably one of the best rotisserie chickens I had, and I would definitely come back just for the sauce.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So my wife and our son went to Champs yesterday. It's a fave of theirs because all of the food is vegan/vegan friendly. But what occurred to them yesterday almost changed that sentiment. The restaurant is a hipster place where they play heavy metal, industrial goth type of rock music at certain times, along with hip-hop and other genres. Anyway, the wife who's eaten at Champs many times before said she didn't pay attention to the music until yesterday. One of the songs made references to satan, and she was shocked, as the music was blaring. She called over one of the servers and made some comments about the type of music, saying ""I didn't know this was a heavy metal music playing place..."" The server commented that it was. My wife was basically making a complaint, saying that she didn't think it was appropriate for our son to hear that type of music. The server said she will speak to the manager, and went to speaking to some of her coworkers, and nothing was done. My wife said as she paid the bill and left with our son, there was no acknowledgement of ""goodbye"" or a ""thank you."" I went there this morning to speak to a manager, and I was introduced to the house manager or one of the manager's by the name of Jane. I re-told the situation to her and she asked around what time did it occur, and I gave her the times. She was very apologetic and added, ""it could've been as simple as skipping a song or two to avoid this..."" She offered for me and my family to come by Champs on Sunday and said she would hook us up with a ""Champs breakfast or brunch."" My family eats there all the time and if I did not get the acknowledgement I felt my family deserved, I definitely was planning on making this issue bigger than it needed to be. Kudos to Jane. Champs says its a ""Family Bakery/Diner."" When kids are in the place, adults should defer them, and staff should be mindful of that too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This has been our go-to French bistro for several years since they were dba Cosette.  We adore the warmth of the restaurant and it's staff.  A couple of weeks ago, hubby and I went with our son and his girl.  Our son's gf and I shared an order of the mussels in white wine and garlic sauce, hubby had the escargots.  GF and I DIED for the mussels and vowed never to share one order again.  For entrees, I had the duck, girlie had the salmon, sonny had the lamb shanks and hubby, the steak frites. 10 across the board!  Last Saturday night, we decided to walk over because I just had to have the mussels. I ordered them even before we sat down at ""our table.""  Hubby had their perfect French Onion Soup which he gladly shared with me.  He had to.  I was foaming at the mouth for my mussels!  His steak frites were, of course, excellent and my mussels were exactly how I dreamed they would be. It took a lot of self control not to put pot to lips for the last drops of the sauce. I could've easily killed another order of them.  I AM a lady. Hah!  They offer their mussels in several other ways.  In the very near future (this weekend, mayhaps?),  I will have what our enchanting hostess told me is their best seller - the Parisien.  BTW,  word has gone out on this little piece of heaven so I strongly advise making reservations.

"Atera was the perfect place for my celebratory Birthday dinner. I felt truly pampered, The food was beautiful and the service was first class. A memorable experience. Upon entering Atera, you're ushered into what seemed to be a secretive kitchen that is dimly light. I was completely blowned away by the cozy main seating area- a U shaped  bar counter, that accomodates about 6 couples with a birds' eye view of the chef and his many assistants meticulously preparing your food. Our server for the evening was most courteous and magically knew it was my birthday, wished me well and then reviewed our dietary restrictions as requested in our reservation. The 3 hour long show consisted of 20 courses, most of mine were seafood based and indistinguishable vegetarian dishes for my friend. They were beautiful pieces of art, that appealed to all the senses.  Each one presented in an organized manner followed by detailed explanation of the ingredients used in creating the masterpiece. Some of the highlights from my meal were the Trout Roe, Stripped Bass, Roasted Duck, Lobster Roll and Sunchoke Chips. My complete MENU was as follows: KING CRAB-garnished with Dianthus With lemongrass & wild ginger FLUKE- garnished with wasabi With Daikon, mushroom sauce FALL SALAD-garnished with gold leaf Yellow vegetables LAMB TARTARE- garnished with nasturtium With Spot Prawn SEA URCHIN With Carrot & lobster sauce TROUT ROE With Corn & sunflower SMOKED TROUT- garnished with Queen Ann's lace With brown butter & liver TROUT LIVER With Apple & brown butter LOBSTER ROLL With Yeast & meringue GEODUCK With buttermilk & air baguette CRISPY SUNCHOKE - garnished with sunflower With aioli HUSHPUPPY smoked yoke & corn BEET JERKY With crustecean cream SMOKED MUSSELS Mussel jus & purple carrot DUMPLING- garnished with sudachi Shrimp STRIPPED BASS- garnished with okra With cranberry bean ABALONE- garnished with emerald ice lettuce With wheat berry, blue foot ROASTED DUCK- garnished with wrinkled crinkled cress With green tea SORBET Raspberry with Licorice caramel ALMOND- garnished with buckler leaf Grapes ROASTED SQUASH With marshmallow & brown butter Followed by chocolates for dessert. All of the dishes were stellar and quite satisfying, did not leave hungry (which was a concern I had earlier). As per the service, it was very detailed and all of my needs were met (which included providing me with a pashmina when I exhibited signs that I was feeling cold). Atera is an indulgent dining experience, it will intrigue and amaze your senses, supercede your expectations and leave you fantasizing about another rendezvous.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This restaurant isn't on the map with advertised restaurants that the hotels and businesses in Burlington pass out.  I scoped it out during the day while my hubby was at a conference. Great choices.  They take reservations.  They honor the reservation you made.  Service was prompt.  Food tasted good and atmosphere was pleasant.  For an area that screams ""tourist"" or ""college town"" this was a nice place. We would come here many times if we lived in this area.  One other reviewer said the food was bland and nothing he couldn't whip up at home.  Sure, it's not high gourmet - but it's good, and lives up to what they describe on the menu.

"This place is 2 blocks from my house and i was pretty excited when it opened because i lived in Texas for 20 years and i LOVE BBQ! I don't know where most of you writing good reviews are from, but this place is no good man. DavidM from 14 days ago is probably being paid by Morgans or just hasn't had good bbq. If you're gonna charge $20-22/lb for brisket, I expect a certain quality. If they charged $12/lb that would be about right. The brisket wasn't even as good as Rudy's(Texans get it) and the turkey was juicy but rubbery and didn't taste good. Sausage was dry and horribly average. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I will not go back. The staff is friendly, that's the only positive I can think of. The best bbq I've had in Brooklyn, without a doubt, is Fetta Sau. Expensive as s@#t but kinda worth it. Brisket is great, sides are pretty awesome","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So, what do you do when you miss your flight back to SF on Thanksgiving by minutes because of crazy traffic?  You go to Harlem for chicken and waffles, of course.  After a quick subway ride from the UES (I already miss not driving ever) and a 15 minute wait in line outside, we were seated.   The restaurant was casual and homey with a good R&B mix perfectly complimenting the ambience.  It was a great place to relax after a stressful afternoon. We had: chicken and waffles, fried catfish, okra, mac 'n cheese, green beans, cornbread and red velvet cake.  The chicken was really flavorful and juicy and the waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'd pass on the catfish and okra next time and get the greens because it was just too much fried stuff for us.  The red velvet cake was excellent, moist and not too sweet. We had a ton of leftovers and the chicken and waffle were still good the next day on the plane.  It was a nice and fatty end to my stay in New York.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is in my top 10 restaurants in the city for many reasons. 1) Meatballs are one of my favorite foods, and if they are on any menu, I am probably ordering them. 2) The ambiance is super cool, with exposed brick, fun music, lively crowd, and dim lighting so you always look sexy. 3) Not only are the meat balls great, they let you build your own meal, which for someone that can sometimes be on the picker side, is amazing because everything is customizable. 4) The wine is pretty good, and even better when you see the prices. One can leave this joint with a 35 dollar tab with tip and be stuffed. 5) Although you might have to wait a couple of hours to sit, they can accommodate sizable crowds - aka I wouldn't go with more then 6/7. 6) The owners frequently are at the restaurants, busing tables, which I think is amazing and proves how dedicated they are to their business. Overall I have NEVER had a bad meal here - go if you haven't already... and soon. I love this place so much I had my caterer at my wedding recreate their pork and turkey balls for one of the stations - it was one of the hottest items on the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Vesta was a great experience.  We met the owner and he let us sample a few of the local beers they carry.  The servers were great, the interior was cozy and had a very warm feeling to it.   You've gotta try the Potato and Pancetta Pizza.  It has potato, pancetta, caramelized onion, arugula, apple, and goat cheese.  Tastes nothing like a traditional pizza but amazing none the less. The Baked Orecchiette was great! The Brussels Sprouts were a little too charred for my taste but had good flavor behind it.  The mussels were decent but the broth had more flavor than the mussels themselves.   Overall a great experience and a great time!  The pizza is definitely something I'm going back for.  I hear their brunch is awesome!","[1.0, 0.0]"

When we sat down we were served whole wheat bread dipped in olive oil and oregano and fresh olives in garlic and olive oil and it was so delicious.

"Occasion & Setting: Roommate's birthday dinner on a Saturday night, so we had a party of about 9. We had originally placed the in-person reservation (only way) at around 7pm and were told that it would be a 2 -2.5 hour wait. However, at 8 the restaurant called to tell us that we had 5 minutes for everyone to arrive or lose our reservation. Not a great way to start the night. Needless to say, we lost that reservation and had to place another one (additional 1.5 hour wait). The atmosphere is great for either a small gathering or a intimate meal. Service: Once we were all seated the services was quite good. So don't let the wait deter you, especially if you have time. The waitress came by frequently, and our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. Food: I ordered the veggie meatballs and mushroom gravy sauce. The meatballs were decent, but the sauce was excellent. As a side, I had the risotto (I recommend that the risotto be placed under, not to the side). For desert, I had the snicker-doodle cookie and special (Mexican chocolate) ice cream. Price: For a NY dinner, the price was pretty good. I ended up paying $27 (tip included) for a drink and 2 course meal. If I were to go again, I would not go with a large group.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"For the first time ever, Yelpsters led me astray. I had been eager to try JL for a few months and I was so disappointed! The good: We went at 6:30 and were seated immediately. We had a lovely waiter who was knowledgeable and put up with odd questions/requests from my friends (I never ask odd questions).  I liked the rose they had on the menu. And...that's it for the good. On to the rest: First of all, I didn't like the bread which is always a bad sign. It's not that it was bad...it just wasn't good. I ordered the watermelon salad to start. It was $11 and I thought -- this better be some damn good watermelon. It wasn't. It was fine. Got better watermelon from my local fruit stand. For dinner my two friends ordered the pollack and I ordered the lobster roll. This lobster roll was....fine. The lobster was actually pretty tasty, but my beef was with the bread. The bread took away from the lobster. The menu said it was a brioche, but it wasn't remotely buttery. The fries it cam with were decent, but I could have easily not finished them. Another not good sign. The pollack. Both dishes came....raw. Okay, maybe not raw, but grossly under-cooked, to the point where a knife could not pass through the fish. The waiter immediately took care of the problem (and both friends liked the fish well enough when it was served cooked) but...come on!   They did bring us a freebee: Some sort of stuffing that was actually the tastiest thing we ordered. The waiter really did his best to make things up to us, and for that I am grateful, but 4 stars??? No way. Not even 3.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Once you have patiently waited (and everyone is patient), you are greatly rewarded with what is to my taste, perhaps one of the top 3  best pizzas I have had in NY Ciy or Italy.

"Zahav hummus lunch, anyone? Unctuously smooth and delicious, I could lather myself in the stuff day in, day out - there's no better hummus out there, folks.  Even if you'd have to eat it off my body.  Truly. I've been there more times than I can admit - and I've tried the spectrum of hummus bowls they offer. Lamb, chicken (skin, too!), beef, roasted tomato, cucumber, kohlrabi, what-have-you, I've taken their menu for a spin.  Fresh ingredients, great aromatics, nuts-a-plenty, liberal use of olive oil, pita right out of the oven, and some pickled veg for a nice spike of acidity that these bowls need to cut into the richness of the whole meal. Place gets packed quickly so come early (before noon, or shortly thereafter) to get your pick of the litter.  Even when it's been packed, I don't wait for more than fifteen or less for my to-go order.  Which brings me to my next point, unless you're here when they open the doors, or come much later, don't expect to be guaranteed a seat to dine in.  The place is extremely small.  Two sets of picnic size length tables, a couple seats at the front bar area, and they fill up. Seating outside, too, but those get cobbled up quickly.  Get this stuff to go. I almost gave this place five stars, but it is just a few micro-steps off - The fresh limonnata is refreshing, but so ridiculously sweet I had a hard time finishing it - I loved the fresh mint, but it's unfortunate that you feel you're getting cavities while drinking it.  The pita though delightful, could stand another minute or two in the oven, and less flour.  Each time my pitas are literally doused in the stuff, and I'm covered - the flour also coats the tongue a bit which is a shame as it can mask your bites of food.  As for the pickled veg, I might be in the minority here, but I wish there were more of it - there's just never enough - and I wish that the veg hummus bowl offerings didn't overlap with the pickled veg.  Don't offer a cucumber dish, if you're offering cucumber pickled veg, and so forth.... and lastly, if you take an order to go, make sure everything you need is in there - a few times, I was left with no pickled veg... the horror!  The price point is a wee bit high, but willing to fork over the dineiros for quality and freshness every time. Otherwise, hummus dream world!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The table next to us was getting Italian-style over-service from their server, while our server spoke maybe 3 words to us, couldn't remember who ordered what (there were 2 of us), and we had to flag the hostess down to get menus. Our server was clearly burned out. They need a service manager in there, and maybe a female server (all servers that night were male). Too bad, it ruined the experience for us. I live around the corner and will NOT be going back. The place is also over-run with Manhattanites who read the recent NY Times review.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So my four star review is based on just the food. I really don't see what anyone is complaining about when it comes to this place. We went there on a saturday night around seven pm and the place was packed. The entrees we had were the standard thai staples, pad thai, drunken noodles and the a beef curry dish... massaman curry to be exact and it was delicious. Everything was great. The portions were huge and it was just about eight dollars for each. We eat a lot, and we had plenty to bring home. Also, the food came out fast and it was fresh and the staff were very attentive. The only downfall is the the decor and lack of ambiance. Its a bit basement like. You are below street level and much of the place is black except for some tapestries on the wall. Really the place is pretty ugly. My booth was kind of broken and the chairs are old. If this place had a make over I think it would be the best thai place in new haven. You can't beat the price and the quality.. but its time for an update on the decor. Also, get the thai iced tea - think bubble tea without the bubbles.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Too bad this is the only karaoke place downtown. Subpar service makes this a disappointment. Coming for karaoke? It's a decent time. The machines are reasonably up to date and the rooms don't cost too much. The touch screens can be a bit frustrating, especially when you want to enter Chinese songs but once you can find them, the selection is good. Coming with a group to eat? Not such a good time. I don't believe I've ever come here and not had to argue about the bill. Several waiters take your orders and it seems they double charge for at least three plates per 6 people in your group. Yakitori comes out one skewer at a time, which is weirdly inefficient and takes up too much of the limited table space. Prices aren't that bad, and the specials seem to be pretty decent but the overall experience for me has never been too pleasant. I'd eat elsewhere and come for karaoke given the option. Cheers.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Given the abundance of Thai restaurants on 9th Ave, it's sometimes hard to keep track of all of them and remembering which ones are stand above the rest. I personally think Obao is under appreciated compared to some of its more popular neighbors a few streets north. Maybe it's because Obao easily seats 3x the amount of customers as some of the other places that makes it always seem half-full. But that means you almost never need a reservation or to wait to be seated. Diehard pho fans will probably disagree, but I think Obao offers a solid bowl of pho, and not just because there are limited competitors in the area. The broth is packed with flavor without being overly salty, and it comes with a generous serving of sliced and braised beef. They also bring you a bottle of hoisin sauce and Sriracha so you can personalize to your tastes. I've also found they're not afraid to turn up the heat. I think I have a decent (not insane though) spice tolerance, and asked for spicy when they asked how I wanted my Laksa, thinking it would probably be dialed back given the fusion vibe here. Nope. Not at all. Full disclosure: the waiter did try to warn me but I was feeling confident in my tolerance pre-3 glasses of water and a bowl of rice.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yes, this is a little biased as I live in the neighborhood but I must say I walked away feeling so pleased that it wouldn't matter where this place is located. Service was attentive across the board (quickly had our wine on ice, water always full, wine glass always full, friendly). When you think miso soup you don't really expect anything unique. The clam miso soup was a welcomed option and was a delicious, savory soup. The clams came in the shell which gave you a nice sign that they were fresh. I didn't know what to expect with tuna tartar but I'm pretty sure I'll order it again on the next visit. A salmon-colored form of tuna-deliciousness. I don't know how they make it or really care to, but it was just a really nice flavor (much more easily enjoyed than the beef equivalent). We asked for a little extra of the mayo-type thing on that was drizzled on top as that added to it so nicely. In terms of sushi, I decided to go with 3 rolls. At this point it is worth noting that I was with my wife and this quantity of food had us stuffed. Rolls were a Fire Dragaon, the Kidari and a Philadelphia. All beautifully presented, substantial and tasty. I particularly liked the jalepenos on the Kidari. In the world of good sushi I've had in my lifetime, this stands up if not out.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went for the first time with a couple of friends and we all thought the food was fantastic!! I got the chicken and shrimp hibachi dinner. Both the chicken and shrimp had great flavor and the chicken was not dry, which I have experienced in many other hibachi restaurants. The fried rice was a little bit different (they seem to use a different sauce) but was excellent!! However, the menu does not clearly state in all hibachi dinner sections that the fried rice is $2 extra. I have never seen an extra fee for fried rice at any other hibachi place I have been to, but the rice was definitely the best I have ever had!! The restaurant was clean and there is ample parking. There is no designated waiting area which caused some confusion. We sit an area with tables and chairs we assumed to be the waiting area (others had done the same) but then a waitress from the bar area came over and asked if we wanted anything, so it was actually the bar area.  The service here is adequate. The hostesses were not rude but were definitely not too friendly. We were brought our drinks and our order was taken but the waiters did not come back once during the meal to see if we needed anything or to see if everything was okay. The chef was pretty good but definitely not as enthusiastic as I have seen elsewhere. We are definitely all coming here again!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Thank goodness for places like this and criticizing it for lack of ambiance is like saying Frank Sinatra was a terrible singer because you didn't like his shoes.  On the other hand, I've traveled a lot in China and it's EXACTLY what you'd find at most neighborhood noodle places; extremely efficient and utilitarian.  For instance, you never have to ask for another cup, since there's a stack of styrofoam cups on the table...same goes for spoons, and napkins, and forks, and condiments...I guess what I'm trying to say is while the dive-iness may turn some people off, it makes it very easy and comfortable to eat here at least as far as I'm concerned. Now to the food...I prefer the knife cut noodles...but the hand pulled ones are good and you do see them making them in the kitchen constantly.  They taste great.  Get the thicker ones.  The oxtail soup was really nice (and it was helpful to be able to grab a styrofoam cup to dispose of the bones.)  The oxtail was extremely flavorful.  The version with vegetables and tofu came with the tofu outside the soup so you could add it as you see fit.  A beef tendon salad also came with its own bowl of soup: another really nice touch, so you could eat the chewy, crunchy beef tendon as is, or put it in the soup and soften it up, or a little of both...The broth, while not complex or anything, is pretty straightforward, brawny, on the salty side...I think in winter it'd be even more satisfying. The weakest thing here are the dumplings, but they're passable and you do get a lot for pretty cheap. In addition, the staff is EXTREMELY friendly and accommodating.  We came in with a 5 year old kid who was just dying to open a recently-purchased Transformer and they took it into the kitchen and opened the packaging up for him...it made his day....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is destined for greatness and thus, I am deeming this as my go-to place whenever I am in the area! ""Holy Khao"", damn straight it's good. And it's only 4 weeks young (as of 10/18/12)!! Great ambience. Hipster, yes. They also have great music playing in the background while you eat. Sat on the counter. Saw the wonderful chef work it, dazzling and sprinkling things here and there onto the plates. I ended up getting 2 small plates (Pork Jowl and Sizzling Sisig) and coconut rice. Each small tapas range from $13-16 and the coconut rice was $3. The coconut rice is a MUST have! Thankfully they brought the meals one at a time so that we could both share the meal without it going cold on us. First got the Pork Jowl. Right amount of spice and sweetness to it. I wonder what it was. The server said it was ""thai suet?"" but I have my doubts that it was. Whatever it was, it was great. I even thought that they didn't need to serve the plate with the crispy chicharron and they still would have had a great plate. The chicharron was a nice addition though. Next was the Sizzling Sisig with a side order of the coconut rice. OMG, must, must, must, must have. Comes out on a hot frying pan, and with an egg over it. Mix the egg with the rest and Holy Khao, it's an absolute winner. I will definitely be coming to this place more often. Even might go here over cocoron which is nearby even with the weather getting colder. Also on a side note: There's an ""all you can drink"" option here at $15/pp. Currently they are serving Miller High Life. Keep that in mind if y'all wanna eat and drink cheap! ----------- 10/29 Update: Girlfriend and I have been here a couple more times, and then she went HAM and brought everyone here without me a couple more times after that. This is our consensus... STILL AMAZZZIIIIINGGGGG... Yes, Sizzling Sigsig is a STILL def with the coconut rice. Never ceases to fail. Khao Soi - It is a DELICIOUS Thai curry with noodles. There is also crispy noodles in it to give that extra crunch. Lots of flavor and love in that thing. I was tempted to order another bowl of coconut rice for the curry after the noodles. Quail Adobo, according to my gf, is good. But nothing really to rave about. I shall update more and more and more as I continue going to this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here on several occasions, and have never been wowed.  However, the last time I was there was game 4 of the World Series on Sunday.  Maybe it was the excitement of the game, or the current love of everything Philly, but I finally had an experience worth mentioning (I tend to get lazy to write a review right after I've tried a place). My friend and I ordered the Cuban sandwich, Thai mussels, duck confit fries, one chicken and one pork gorditas.  If this sounds like a lot of food for two people, it is.  I never got to try the gorditas, since we were so full and he ended up taking them home.  He says they were good.  The Cuban and the duck fries, I can and will vouch for.  You can't go wrong when smothering fries with cheese and duck meat.  The mussels however were a bit bland, and I probably could have taken or leave them.  The few times I've tried the mussels here have resulted in the same opinion.   I agree with everyone, in that this is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  It's a good cross between gastro pub and sports bar.  And the beer list is not too shabby I should add.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After having eaten here several times and meeting the owners, I really want Beehive Oven to succeed.  The owners seem like good people .... BUT..... the restaurant has a few issues.  First of all the location s*cks.  It may not be there fault (do to budget etc.) but THAT corner, in THAT building...it has a really negative vibe.  Could go into more detail here but I'll refrain.  They are trying to spruce it up but ultimately the location has a lot to be desired.  As far as the food.  Its good.  Its decent.  But one cant help comparing it to Pie's & Thigh's 2 blocks over.  My take is that they (Beehive) shouldn't have to tried to do the fancy/southern food thing.  Williamsburg has tons (too many) nice, fine dining, fusion establishments already.  If people want that there are plenty of places to go.  But if they want good ole fashioned southern food, home cooking (however you categorize it) there are very few options.  So therefore they (Beehive) should STICK TO THAT!  Don't try to make if fancy, just DO IT RIGHT!  Keep it simple.  That's why Pie's & Thigh's is so successful because they serve up what its meant to be.  Not something that's obviously trying too hard to be a new and contemporary take on southern fare etc.  Btw, the biscuits are kinda small. And like I mentioned before, the entrees are trying way too hard to be something different.  Also they don't transfer well into a takeout meal.  Did that once and it was a cold mess.  As far as atmosphere, its a little bright (at night) for my taste.  And the hours are posted outside the door in front but they don't seem to be accurate...or at least not yet.  ANYWAY, I feel bad for writing a lot of this because I like them and I want them to succeed.  I just figured I should be honest and hope that it helps them in the long run.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As far as sushi west of Broad in South Philly, this isn't TOO bad... but it's not that great, either... but how many good options are there, anyway? While I do like their salmon avocado and shrimp tempura rolls, but my other 2 favorites, the spicy tuna and eel avocado are a little different here in how they look and taste with the spicy mayo and eel sauce. The chicken teriyaki is pretty much terrible and if you want an unpleasant surprise, get a party platter with the chef's choice of rolls. You'll get some pretty experimental rolls that are unappetizing like an onion ring roll or something with peanuts in it. Lesson learned. I'll still order here but I'll refrain from ordering anything than what I usually ever get. Luckily, Toyotomi seems to be a much better spot but east side of Broad.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After reading the many good reviews, I went to Cantina Dos Segundos last night.  So many things were mediocre about my visit... 1. This place is chaotic! Large parties everywhere, very loud and the servers and host seemed overwhelmed and therefore, not exactly on their A-game. 2. Had one house margarita while waiting for our table...I think it was just lemonade (very tangy and way too sweet!). At the table we ordered a pitcher of blood orange margs and the first glass was pretty much all tequila because the pitcher was not mixed, the top was tequila the bottom was all juice and mixers...not good. 3. The food was okay. I had mahi mahi tacos which had good flavor, but were just fish and tortillas - kind of boring. Their lump crab ceviche special was decent at best, with way too much cilantro. The burrito was mostly rice and beans with very little meat in it.  Guacamole and salsa were tasty. Overall, I was ready to get out of there after our meal and don't think I'll be back...there were a bunch of ""eclectic"" groups of people there which did make for some good people watching, which was a plus.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Upon being seated, I was served water and a small bag of pork fat popped popcorn. I don't know if popcorn can be considered an amuse bouche, but it sure set the tone of Salt & Fat.

I have a general gripe against sweet buns, like the potato buns you get at Shake Shack. But if you don't have a problem with that, the pork and the sauce are nice and mildly spicy. The service was prompt and friendly despite the good sized crowd. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'm going to try the mussels. Addendum: I had the mussels. Dear Lord up in Heaven, they were fabulous! It was my first time having mussels ever and I truly enjoyed them. The broth was fantastic. I could have picked up the bowl and drained it dry it was so good. It's served with garlic toast but it really should be served with a soft piece of bread so you can soak up that yummy broth. Other than the now discontinued Pork buns, in my opinion, the mussels are the best dish in the house.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here for dinner with a group of eight for a BYO dinner on Saturday night. When we made the reservation in advance, they asked that each person order a minimum of one entree, and there was of course the automatic 20% gratuity because of our party size. I'd say that the food was above average, but not every dish was necessarily rave-worthy. Things that stood out: 1. Tahdig. These are fried balls of risotto (so, similar to arancini), served with a spicy arrabbiata sauce and parmesan shavings. These were honestly probably the highlight of the meal. My friend said that he honestly could have ordered three of the tahdig and have been happy, and I agree. I prefer the arancini at Barbuzzo, but the tahdig here were excellent as well, and I loved the spicy arrabbiata. 2. Jumbo shrimp pil-pil. I'll be honest, I am not a fan of shrimp. At all. But having tried a bite of my friend's, this was pretty amazing. The shrimp were moderately spicy and flavorful. 3. Moroccan braised lamb shank. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but it complemented the lamb well. The lamb itself was amazingly tender and fell off the bone. It was extremely well-done; my only complaint would probably be that it was somewhat of a one-note dish in terms of flavor. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant; the space is gorgeous! In terms of service, for some reason it took us a good fifteen minutes to be given menus, which was odd--I had to actually catch the attention of one of the waitresses and ask for them. To be fair, though, there seemed to be only one or two waitresses managing the entire peak dinnertime.   Overall, the food was great.

"wonderful gem of a restaurant - contemporary casual seating facing the East river, friendly staff.  The dining area is not that large but the place is very comfortable.  There is parking downstairs. There was confusion in the order, I had my appetizer duplicated and the entree forgotten but the server was very friendly and my entree was the lamb salad.  There were many many choices for restaurant week. Colecchio's staff has prepared an excellent creative menu for restaurant week.  The beer choices are many. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the variety of breads and menu choices. The seating is comfortable - not on top of each other but not as spacious as places in hotels. I enjoy  the variety and creativity of Collechio's casual Riverpark and Tap room restaurants much better than Keller's casual Bouchon and Ad Hoc restaurants.   No one rushed us out but we had an odd experience of someone following us to the restroom when we exited and complaining  to us when we departed that they didn't mean to be rude but were waiting for our table for ten minutes.. We had better manners than to respond..  No one at the restaurant pushed us to leave or even suggested that there was any rush - they were asking us if we wanted more coffee and our order was only slightly delayed because of the forgotten salad entree.  Now I don't know how or why this New Yorker was targeting our table for themselves and we were only dining there for 1.5 hours and I believe that all upscale restaurants space bookings 1.5-2 hours apart.    But I will leave this to frentic hyperactive  rat race life of New York City vs. California.  It didn't make sense as in a public environment next to the hospital who knows who you are speaking to?  We still thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would return again as the menu is extensive.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I was seriously raving about the salad I had until I found a bug in it...I'm not sure if that has to do with the fact that they grown their own veggies?  Don't let that stop you from ordering it...it was unlike any salad I'd ever had, even with my little guest.

"Seeking pork and sauerkraut to bring in the new year, we headed Brauhaus Schmitz and made our way past groups of Mummer revelers to the back room. I got the Bratwurst (very tasty, but fatty). the Kartoffelpuffe with apple sauce subbed in for sour cream (the potato pancake was good, but the apple sauce is WAY too sweet), Kartoffelsalat (really delicious potato salad), and of course Sauerkraut. A great way to bring in the new year with a traditional meal!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We were almost 30 min late for out 8 pm reservation at Cuba, but fortunately they have kept our table. We had delicious coctails. For starter I had Tiradito de Pargo; Marinated red snapper, lemon citrus, red onions, jalapens, cilantroand fresh mango, and for main course Pounded sirloin steak, sauteed onions and delicious chimichurri. My friend had Bacalatios Cubanos; Cod fish fritters with chipotle mayo and Red snapper, green plantain crust, sofrito sauce. Everything was really good, I especially enjoyed the chimichurri. With coffee our waiter recommended old Metusalem rhum. I normally don´t like strong liquors straight up, but this was delicious and very smooth!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place is THE BEST. PERIOD. I'm a pretty big fan of their Milwaukee roaster, Anodyne. Dark coffee is much better than the medium roast. Really diggin' the drinks...always made to perfection. Not to mention, they make their syrup in house...LOVE!!! Food is superb -- and with vegan and dairy-free options. I love a lot of things on the menu. Tuna sandwich is my favorite. Specials are usually pretty great too. Rule of thumb: ALWAYS order any type of tacos they are making as a special. Little known fact: you can also special order pies and such from the baker. She made me a gluten and dairy-free pumpkin pie for a Thanksgiving party I had and everyone loved it! Some of my guests had dietary issues, so I was happy to be able to offer something to them (and didn't want to have to make it myself). It can get a little chilly in there in the winter or on a windy day, but that can be solved with a sweater and some warm socks. It's totally worth it for the warm days in which they open up the garage doors! Lastly, the staff is awesome! DO engage in conversation with them! They're super friendly and fun -- which I certainly CANNOT say for many employees of many coffee houses in this wonderful city. Plus Lori does an amazing job at managing! Woooo Go OCF, Go!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Sampan is a great place, period. If you are alone, or out with just one other person, I highly recommend their  fantastic Happy Hour. It is reasonably priced and includes a wide variety of drinks and small bites (and in a place where portions are made for sharing this is important when you are alone or with only one other person), ranging from $2-$5. Some of my favorites are the edamame dumplings, the brussel sprouts and broccoli, and really all of their satays. Truly delicious. I also recommend Sampan for large groups, as the environment is beautiful, the family style feel is relaxed (think tapas meet hot pots), and it is truly a place where you can spend hours (though the bill can rack up too, so be careful).","[0.0, 1.0]"

Maybe its the tremendous hype on here or something, but I set my expectations high and was let down. We waited a long time too. I left this place with the feeling that I missed something because everyone raves about this place. I got the Paitan ramen and the avo tuna appetizer. Both were meh. I will credit the ramen though that the broth was nice and light, not oily and greasy. If this place had no wait or a little wait (half hour or so) id come back again, but no way 2 hours.

"Had a bro date this past Friday and we stopped here for a late lunch. Disclaimer: While I like to drink tasty beers, I don't pretend to know a damn thing about the subject. That being said I was impressed with what was on tap, and my buddies were equally impressed with their international selection. Food: We shared the Irish nachos between the three of us, and I have to say the amount you got was pretty impressive. Not only a generous portion but also very tasty crispy potato chips, and quality bacon, sour cream, homemade cheese sauce,and black beans... what's not to love.   For entrees my friends got the steak and cheese (face palm totally wish I ordered that), and I had the French Dip. My sandwich was fantastic, fries were well cooked, I just wish I had ordered the steak and cheese, from the bite I had it seemed pretty amazing and my friends were equally impressed. Ambiance: Its got a good intimate pub feel, not to large, dark wooden booths, and multiple TV's make for an ideal location to watch a game with your mates (it seemed an appropriate term to use). Will definitely be returning for the brunch, sounds fantastic, be sure to check this place out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to in New England, and the food didn't disapoint. I got the enchilladas with red sauce, and it was flavorful and filling. The salsa that came with the meal was fresh and not too spicy. We also got guacamole, which I was pleased to find was also fresh, with big chunks of avacado and tomato. It's hard to find good guacamole, and this place had it, though the portion was small for the price. Overall, a pretty good meal. The service, however, was sub-par. I am hoping, judging by the other reviews, that this was just a fluke. Our server looked the other way while we were ordering, and our (flat) drinks went dry for quite a long time. He delivered our plates and we didn't see him until well after we were done. But overall, this was a nice dining experience. It has patio seats with a fountain, which I love.

"When we arrived there was a 1.5 hour wait so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and professional. We were first served a basket of bread which i pretty much swallowed. Then I ordered mussels luciano (white wine broth) It was AMAZING! I ate every single one of those critters AND had some of the broth on its own by using the shell to scoop it up. It was one of the best pot of mussels i've had. The broth had a hint of lemon and i just couldn't stop eating it! Then we ordered Penne alla Vodka with chicken. The chicken, penne sauce, and noodles were all served seperately. I guess to control our portions? Oh, this is all served family style by the way! So you can definetely share this dish with 2-3 people. The sauce was amazing. So creamy, fresh and tasty. The penne noodles though were a bit chewy, i was giving my jaw a workout with the extra hard chewing i had to do just to be able to swallow it! Buuuut, i still ate everything on my dish because the penne sauce saved the day. I didn't mix in any chicken, i had it separately and it was cooked well. For dessert I got the mother of all Strawberry shortcakes. This dessert is served family style and is meant for 2-3 people. But, i really wanted to try it so i said sure. My husband didn't want any so this hunk of cake was set in front of me and I tried my best to eat as much as possible. If i had not eaten all the bread, mussels and pasta before I definitely would've finished this dessert! It was short cake with layers of ice cream topped with strawberry syrup and fresh strawberries and two puffs of whip cream sitting on each end. It was dessert heaven!!!!! definetely get this dessert if you go to Tony's! Definitely a good experience. Definitely coming back. It's nothing fancy, it's just a classic theatre district restaurant. But it is very popular so make a reservation! Or risk waiting a while for a table. We waited about 15 minutes between each dish so if you have theatre tickets plan accordingly. NOW GO! for a food coma. (but worth it)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I want to start off by saying that I am never one to take the time to write a negative review of a restaurant.  HOWEVER, our experience on New Year's Eve was SO AWFUL that I feel it is due diligence to inform the public about the horrid service we received. When we made our reservation over the phone, we were told it was a regular dinner menu that evening.  When we sat down for our 9:30 reservation we were given a $175 pre-fixe menu.  The manager apologized and offered us two rounds of complementary drinks.  It was all downhill from there... We did not receive a single drink from the bar for 50 minutes after sitting down.  At this point, we called the manager over again to complain about the delay.  He brought us a bottle of champagne which was a nice gesture, but not what we wanted.  Our first course actually came out before our drinks.  After that we were served soup without spoons.  It took the server 10 minutes to get us spoons and by then, our soups were cold.  When our entrees arrived, my sister was served Salmon although she ordered arctic char. Because the service was so slow, we did not have enough time to enjoy the fourth course (dessert) because it was midnight and we wanted to watch the fireworks.  Our server suggested we enjoy the dessert buffet on the deck (which was gone when we got there). To add insult to injury, our server added a 20% gratuity to our check.  No where on the menu did it mention gratuity was  to be automatically added.  We surmised that she added it on because she assumed we would not tip due to the horrible service. Overall, this was the absolute worst fine dining experience we have ever had in Philadelphia.  We will NEVER return to this joke of a restaurant.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The service was efficient and proper without being overbearing. 1 star off because I had made a reservation, they claimed I hadn't made one, and made us wait for 15 minutes to get a table.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The staff is friendly.  And even if you just want a quick drink at the bar - stop in - Natalie will take great care of you!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I almost don't want to review this place. I want people to continue disliking it so I can have it all for me. 7 months into New Haven this is by far my favorite restaurant: fresh, tasty food, cheap prices, casual atmosphere and reasonable service. I am not a connoisseur of Vietnamese so I can't vouch for its authenticity, but the menu has plenty choices including vegetarian: dim sum and salads, noodle soups, noodle/rice dishes, and a variety of bubble teas. THE FOOD: My faves are the steamed dumplings, coconut curry or tom yum soup, spicy basil or wide wok noodles, and I don't like bubble tea but the lychee slushy drink minus the bubbles is delicious! Unlike Ivy Noodle where the noodles are oily yet feel dry in your mouth and the chicken over your noodles consists of tiny strips of greasy thigh meat (yuk), at York they're generous with the sauces, they use plenty of fresh cilantro, big chunks of chicken breast or other meats, and best of all, plenty of fresh veggies like chard and sprouts. Yummy. THE PRICE: I'm a student. I'm smart with my money. It's a recession. I don't think you can beat this place. Lunch or dinner, top your noodles with tofu or with seafood, same price:$5 to $7.50 for a heaping, fairly healthy meal. Awesome! ATMOSPHERE AND SERVICE: Small location but alright. Upstairs is best with a large window and the open kitchen. I hate televisions in restaurants but at least the volume is off and it's CNN. God bless them for not playing that cheesy nondescript Asian elevator music. I see many complaints about service, but I only had to wait for too long on one visit out of many, during a very busy lunch hour. I also dine with good company so I don't care for it to be super fast. When I don't want a sandwich or the usual American fare available for lunch around Yale, or when I don't want to cook on a week night and it's really friggin' cold, I head to York Noodle for a heaping hot plate of noodles or a noodle soup... yeah!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"OK, now, I've never left a Yelp review before, but after my experience with Mayfield last night, I was motivated to actually create an account based on three factors: 1. SO FAR, ""Mayfield"" seems like one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn, and I wanted to give them a shout and say good job and beg them to KEEP IT UP! Don't let the quality slip like happens to so many new endeavors. 2. I wanted to say that whoever the owner of this restaurant is is basically a hero for investing in a REAL, un-gentrified community and likely single-handedly raising property values. 3. I was so taken aback by the reviewer ""DAN S."" below, that I simply had to come online to laugh at him. Dude: You're complaining about a FOUR dollar beer because you can get them cheaper in bulk at Target? Classy. I wanna click the ""follow this reviewer"" button next to your name so that I can see which Ruby Tuesday's and Applebees you feel have the best Riblets. You say you could ""barely understand the menu?"" So, in Uttica y'all don't have terms like ""BURGER?"" Stick to upstate my man - don't come to my hood and order a drink at this brave and (literally) ground-breaking new restaurant and think that entitles you to leave a review bashing the place. In summary, fantastic food, great people, and a proud moment for my neighborhood. Thanks to the owner - much appreciated and we pledge to support you.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The other weekend however I decided to have brunch there with a friend and we had a great time. The food was really good so I understand the long lines that this place can have. But even though I don't think that one more body could actually get into the cafe...the wait was not very long, what looked like 45minutes was more like 15/20. I had the Dill Scrambled Eggs with avocado which was divine and my friend had the Bacon Stack which also gave our taste buds some serious lovin.

"My colleague and I heard great things and were seriously disappointed. We arrived at 12:15, ordered right away and never received our food. The waitress only came by to give us water. I approached her at 12:40 that we had to leave and we wanted the check - which we also never got. She asked if we wanted the food and we said to go only if ready. It wasn't and she just stood in the back. I approached her again that we had to go now and couldn't wait and she said she's get a manager and none came over. At 12:50 she brought us plates which was ridiculous since I had made it clear I had to leave. So she left to wrap them and at 12:55 she hadn't come back. We left $30 on the table to cover our food.

"Yum! Yum! I came here for brunch on a drizzly Saturday afternoon because my friend chose this spot so I wasn't sure what to expect. However, when I saw arepas on the menu, I was in! I love arepas so I'm picky about how they're prepared but these were done just right. They were perfectly crispy around the outside and soft and chewy. The dish came with eggs benedict and an herb hollandaise sauce. The eggs were done perfectly and the sauce was really unique and delicious. So my rating is really just based on my one dish that I tried, but it looked like everyone else in my party enjoyed what they got too so it's a pretty valid rating, I think. I chose to get a mimosa with my meal, which was fresh and yummy, but alcohol is alcohol (unless it's HORRIBLE alcohol, obviously).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I visited this restaurant with some colleagues for a business dinner. I am, annoyingly, allergic to onions. It's a challenge no matter where I go, but if you are a fan of Spanish cuisine, you know that onions are a staple. Well, our server was absolutely over-the-top helpful. We placed our order for the small plates, and after consulting with the chefs, she came back to our table with a menu that was marked up. She documented the items we ordered that did not have onions, and then also marked dishes that we didn't order that didn't have onions, in case we wanted to amend the order. I knew exactly which dishes I could have and which I should avoid. I've NEVER had anyone make such a kind effort for me before. Now.. let's talk about the food. The roasted artichokes were Ah-MAY-zing!! It was my first ever indulgence in this little morsel of heaven, and I am a fan! They were full of flavor, and almost ""meaty"". Impeccable! The goat cheese drizzled in honey... delectable. Shrimp and chorizo skewers... to die for. There was another little salad that was delicious... a little house made pizza that was covered in mushrooms. YUM! But perhaps my most favorite treat was the Philadelphia Truffle Surprise. I have no idea what's in it... it is a surprise after all. But there's no onions but TONS of deliciousness. Oh and let's talk Sangria. Most places give you a small wine glass about 1/2 to 3/4 full. Not Alta. It's a big ole goblet filled to the rim. I had 2 glasses of the red, and was quite comfy. :) On the down-ish side... we were a party of 8. One of the offerings is ""the whole shebang"" where you get one of every small plate offered. On the menu, it's recommended for parties of 10 or more; or fewer if you are really hungry. They wouldn't let us order because we were only a party of 8 and they only allow it for parties of 12 or more. In my mind, if I want to pay $500 for the whole shebang, why should they care as long as they get my $500? But it's their rule or whatever, so it is what it is. Also, it doesn't appear that they have to-go/take out. Which is really unfortunate. Would be so easy to pop in and grab a to-go order on my way home from work. But it is what it is. I will definitely be back for some artichokes, truffle surprise, shrimp and chorizo skewers and red sangria! Other treats too, I am sure....  Yum Yum!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm not sure why this place isn't better known. The food is delicious, the prices are very reasonable, the owners are incredibly friendly, and it's BYO. There aren't really any Balkan places in Philly, so you get something a little different here. The owners, a lovely couple, suggested that we get the family style option--which is great for groups and gives you a well-rounded introduction to the cuisine. They then took charge and paraded an awesome and seemingly endless meat feast.  Try the meat stew, which is quite tasty. We went with a big group of people after graduation with no reservation and didn't have to wait.  Most comparably good Philly restaurants make you reserve a table days in advance or squeeze you in at an awkward dining time. All in all, the place was good enough to actually make me sign up for a Yelp account just so I could post this review.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My favorite thing about Public is the wall paper in the back room with the fireplace. Out for an evening walk, BF and I stopped in to Public where we decided to have appetizers. There was a forty minute wait, but fortunately there are many options for dining where you don't have to wait for a table. We sat in the back room where there is a fireplace (love radiant heating) and cozy seating. The room was a little warm, so a host turned on the ac along with the fireplace which solved the problem, albeit not in the most energy efficient way. We decided to sample some of  the more exotic items and had kangaroo, oxtail and snail ravioli, and a lentil salad. Everything was good (I would be more specific, but we were both getting over colds and couldn't truly appreciate the nuances of the flavors), but I got a little nostalgic two bites into the kangaroo and wouldn't eat it again. I know they are supposedly pests in Australia, but still, they are so cute.  Also, the cocktails were nice. The ginger cosmo and lemon/basil martini were not the best I have had, but the pico sour (what was it again??) was awesome! Loved it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went there with my parents and my sister 1 week ago. It was absolutely amazing! I am Greek, my family is Greek so we like to think we know when we find authentic Greek food. In Astoria there are many Greek tavernas and restaurants. There is an already great selection. MP Taverna is an absolutely wonderful addition to the Greek food scene here in Astoria. I loved the design and I had anticipated its opening for months. We had a great time eating there. The service was exceptional and the I loved the wine and beer selection. We ordered the grilled octopus, mussels, fried calamari and other types of sea fare. It was all so so good. The food was true to its authentic Greek roots but also had some very interesting twists. All in all it was a great experience that left my family full, tipsy and happy lol. I will definitely  go back again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat.  But last night was inexcusable.   First, the server was rude, cold, and unfriendly. Second, a few of our favorite dishes were not on the menu (winter salad, cheddar cheese curds, risotto) Third, and most disturbingly, I found a jagged, hard piece of plastic in my butter lettuce salad! I told our server because I was concerned something may have broken in the kitchen and gotten into other people's dishes.  He did not say a word, disappeared to confer with the host at the front, and returned 15 minutes later asking if we wanted dessert.  We paid the bill and were about to leave when they arrived with a dry cake of some sort.  The server said, ""this is on the house because of the plastic.""  While I was glad he finally acknowledged the plastic incident, we were disappointed that there was no apology, no assurance that they had checked the kitchen properly, and no choice about their remedy for the situation.   In short, the service was terrible and the food was subpar on this visit.  I think we'll be taking Char 4 out of the rotation for now.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So, my overall experience was a bit like the review by Maya S from 1/6/2014.  Overall, the food was very good.  However, I had two experiences here that left a bad impression.  One, quite common these days, another, was a first for me. First, the waitress forgot the 2 glasses of wine we ordered.  When we reminded her of it, she sort of made us feel like it was somehow our fault for not reminding her earlier. Second, and this is the 'first', maybe about 10 minutes after we sat down, but before we ordered, a waiter brought a plate with warm bread and a bowl of hummus and a spoon.  He put it right next to my 4 year old daughter, before we'd had a chance to wash her hands from a day out and about in the city, picked up the bread, dragged her knife across it, and started to pull it apart.  At this point, a waiter came over and I could tell he realized he'd taken it to the wrong table.  It was indeed not a 'free appetizer'.....Remember, it was a place where dinner for the 4 of us was $100 including tip and two of the four people were not over 6 years old!  Do you think he? 1)  Intimated that it was a mistake, but just left it and didn't dwell on it. 2)  Told us it was mistake, said it was on the house this time, but was a mistake. 3)  Told us it was a mistake, taking it back to the kitchen leaving us to wonder what they did with it. 4)  Told us it was a mistake and simply took it and put it on the correct table, one table away. You've probably already guessed #4.  So, for a $6 plate of food, that probably costs them somewhere around $1 I will for sure not be going back to this place.  And, if you were there on Sunday the 12th and had the hummus and break as a appetizer, well, you might also want to reconsider!  In today's world where experiences can be posted on social media in a matter of seconds, taking 'used food' from one table to the next to save $6 in revenue seems ill-advised!  Having said that, the food was pretty good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"1. We planned arriving in Philly around 6:00PM so were looking for something close to convention center and being BBQ, and Beer lovers  the description was appealing the beer list was long and there were plenty of BBQ type dishes on menu. so we were happy to see Smokin Betty's close to hotel and booked for 7:30 PM on a Friday night.  Arrived 15 minutes early, 7:15 PM and were told to cool heels at bar and come back at our reservation time and then they would ""start looking"" for seats. There are 2 bars there both were packed so we  waited by the door, witnessed 3 or 4 parties seated ahead of us on walk in basis and no there were no big tips passed. At 7:30 after standing in front of podium presenting ourselves were actually seated promptly. 2. Ordered St Louis Ribs and Chicken with Rabe sandwich. Presentation was good, flavor bland I have had better ribs out of frozen food box??? Chicken sandwich not on type of bread that was advertised.  For a place with Smokin in name food was well presented but lacking any hint of smoke. 3. After being insulted during seating process service was ok but not great, had to ask for flatware. 4. Be careful with beer selection, as well, portions are different for many selections but the sizes are noted in the smallest font I have ever seen on a menu. I ordered a pale ale and was brought a very small portion I genuinely felt ripped off. My wife ordered a stoudt that came in standard full size beer glass the type you would expect in a craft beer type bar. 5. The crowd was young and very loud even though there was no music, conversation impossible.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yes, the Chargrilled Burger & Shoestring Fries is amazing, every part of it is good, but is it worth it? First, I had to wait for almost three hours for a table that was supposed to be available in 1:30. Second: When they finally took me to my table, well, it was better if I had stayed in the bar. The table for 3 people was the size of a table for one, it was ridiculously small, the chairs didn't provide any comfort and my chair was located beside a wall in diagonal, so I couldn't even sit properly! Just in part of it! Third: we order 3 cosmopolitans to relax while waiting another long time for our burguers. U$14,00 for a little glass of drink that tasted like pink lemonade with alchool, no sugar! Doesn't even resemble a cosmopolitan, pure lime! For me, the Chargrilled Burger & Shoestring Fries is incredible, but it was a one time thing only, there are other places with amazing burguers that can provide better service!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Rye is the epitome of what Brooklyn foodie's desire in a pub. The old world feel of the interior, dark stained woods, simple back-lit bar, and wooden stools, compliment the classic array of well mixed cocktails. My favorite is the house take on a Dark & Stormy, although their Blood & Smoke is a deeply, delicious surprise. The food is good. At times, tries to be overly refined, but the former chef of Dumont certainly is up to something good. I prefer the bar menu, particularly the braised short-rib sandwich and creamy baked mac n' cheese. This place can get super crowded, so I suggest going on a week night or starting out here early to set the tone for a good evening. Also, the bar tenders are really great, service has always been fine.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Yummy food.  Our daughter insisted on fried rice and it was notable for the individual tastes of the contents - it was not overdone with soy sauce like most.  We had the pea greens and garlic which was a bit too salty and oily; it could have been a great dish.  The Kung pao chicken was very good, but for asking it be spiced as a 1 I was disappointed at how many pieces of dried hot pepper I had to pick out (after eating one by mistake, as I wasn't thinking about them).  The hot tea was tasty, not bitter.  Great service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I absolutely LOVE the food at Sapthagiri.  I think I have written a review for their Jersey City location raving about the fabulousness, especially for a vegan such as myself. We live nearly exactly in between Jersey City and Franklin Park and we began going to their Franklin Park location more often because it is much easier to park. I wanted to issue a review for this location in particular after we visited there again last weekend.  The last two times we have been there the service hasn't really been friendly.  I am not looking for over the top cheer (this is New Jersey, after all).  I mean general friendliness.  We always order way more food than we can eat (not at a buffet time--everything we order is off the menu, non-buffet stuff) and the last few times we have been there we have literally had to beg for containers to take our leftovers home.  They would only give us one tiny box, which we would fill, and then have to show them we filled the tiny box, as we begged for a few more tiny boxes.  Not sure why this is. When we were there last weekend, I let them know we were having a big party in August and wanted to order catering trays to carry out.  Could we see their catering menus so we could place our order?  The waiter said, ""That is our catering menu.""  I explained that there were not catering prices or sizes on this menu. I really wanted to place the order.  The waiter just stared at me.  I eventually gave up and we just ordered the food we were eating that day. It is hard to give a business your money that doesn't seem to want to take it.   But the food--phenomenal!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is yummy, but a little overpriced, $1 extra each for cheese, greens and peppers (or $1.75 if you pick two....) Now the sandwich itself is yummy, I had roast pork , sharp provolone, and broccoli Rabe (once I got it with spinach, bad move), the roast pork is thinly sliced and perfect for a sandwich.

"BEST THAI IN TOWN!!! This is definitely a must try restaurant in NYC. We walked in at about 8 on a saturday night and had to wait for half an hour. But it was totally worth it!! The staffs are really nice and friendly. They even sang long with the music playing in the restaurant (which is Thailand and sounds ridiculously funny but who cares). We had the special noodles that day called Know Soy or smt...and Ratchaburi, Krabi, and Natomh-ratoh or smt duck noodle soup. They all tasted great! It feels like real Thai food, not the fake one in other restaturants. Even Thai iced tea is better than that in anywhere else i've tried. The pumpkin custard with coconut sticky rice was the perfect ending (i was a little bit upset cause i wanna try mango sticky rice at the first place and they didnt serve it that day but who cares). The small place may get too crowded but that's what makes it so cozy and cute. But it's better not to come more than 4. Price is relatively cheap for a restaurant in the city~$10-15/dish.

The location is convenient, located a block from the YMCA (kidding).  Tiny yet cute outdoor seating area for some decent people-watching on Park... it's right next to a liquor store, directly across the street from Mexicali Rose and Jake's... you will see some interesting things, depending on the hour of the day.  Give it a shot, the slices are big and thin and between $2-3 dollars, the staff is friendly....it does get crowded and stuffy, however, be forewarned.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You are surprised at the prices--very reasonable for a center-city restaurant of any stripe, much less a sushi bar. Your order arrives, and---WHOA! That's some GOOD SUSHI! Then--given the price and the quality--you of course stuff yourself beyond all reason, and stagger out feeling a bit sheepish, but definitely satisfied.  Bear in mind they don't serve anything alcoholic, but you can BYO. Also because it's small, plan to get there early (5pm is not at all too early), or there will be a wait. Probably not too long though--the chefs are fast, and people tend not to linger.

"Decent food and decent service. However, I have no idea why NY Times' Frank Bruni called this place the best steakhouse in town (his review on May 20, 2009). The steak was good, but not the best in town. It had a nice crust, but it didn't have much flavor and it was a bit tough. Maybe I was there on a bad day, or maybe they served Frank Bruni the best thing they ever had. I won't know until I go there again. But everything else was wonderful. However, ordinary reviewers on NY Times also mentioned tough steaks. The burger was good though. It is very tight though. Can't blame them since it's a small place, but depending on where they seat you, you may be too close to another table. It's so loud though that you wouldn't have to worry about the other table listening to your conversation. It gets way to crowded though and it's tough to make a reservation. We took a chance and went there without reservation, and luckily someone canceled and we got a table on a Saturday night, but don't count on that.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After 7pm, this cart is the BOMB! Don't pour all the hot sauce over your meal, it will burn a hole in your face (and light up another part of your body).

"Le Barricou is hands-down my favorite brunch spot in the Williamsburg area.  I've been going there for a once-monthly brunch religiously since I discovered it about a year ago.  The Eggs Benedict are the best I've had and my roommate swears by the Croque Madame.  I went for dinner the other night, which was equally delicious.  Think rustic, cozy French comfort food.  My companions and I shared the Coq au Vin, Bar Steak and the fish special, steamed Black Bass.  We all had a hard time finishing the hearty portions. There is rarely a wait, even on the busiest of weekends.  The prices are totally reasonable (for both brunch and dinner).  The atmosphere is lovely--a good eclectic mix of music playing and quirky, rustic French decor.  The staff is equally exceptional.  Our favorite waitress knows what we usually order and usually chats with us for a few minutes.  Last night she brought us a complimentary Creme Brulee. I've also been to Le Barricou with large groups, and they are very accomodating. 5+ stars!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Delightful, this place.  The food is fantastic, the ambience is beautiful, simple, uncluttered.  Had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which was so perfect for a cool autumn day.  Prepare for some SERIOUSLY BUTTERED BREAD.  No exaggeration.  Think of it as breaded butter.  Delicious, just a bit messy for the hands and corners of the mouth.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Had a 9:15 reservation. Didn't get our first drinks at our table until 10:30. I understand that you have to ""get a drink at the bar"" and wait until the prior seating leaves, but I think 1:15 minutes is pushing it. Especially without any apologies or complimentary items from the chef for the excessive wait. Additionally,  pretty arrogant to include 20% tip on a table of 7 that waited that long for horrible service. Ambiance is cool, which probably causes the arrogance. Overall, good food.

"AMAZING!!!!!!! This place is the best!!!!!  I order from them at least once a week and sometimes like, everyday.  I can't stay away. Their lunch special is awesome- $6.50 for a an entree with rice and an egg roll (they're the best, get this option) or soup.  You get a ton of food and it is all always sooo tasty.  Sometimes I save half of it for another meal. I always get the mango chicken, it's amazing!  The chicken nuggets (an appetizer) are also pretty good, but I'm not too impressed with their sweet and sour chicken (the sauce just isn't sweet or sour enough). The service is great, too.  I always call ahead and pick it up since I live around the corner.  The food is always ready and waiting on time, but also always hot and fresh when I get home and open it all up.  Ugh, I am salivating just thinking of this place.  Also, the woman on the phone/at the register is very sweet- she's even starting giving me back even change on the lunch specials (which come to like 7.05 or something but she always charges me 7; for a very very broke person this is very very nice!).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I had a great meal at Venturo last night.  The cocktail, appetizer, pasta and dessert were all delicious and the service was great.  The dining room was attractive, and the noise level was comfortable.   While more expensive than most restaurants in Sunnyside, the cost was still well below what a comparable meal would cost in Manhattan.   Venturo is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and hopefully it's success will encourage others to check out Sunnyside :).","[0.0, 1.0]"
I would have given them 4 stars but the delivery service...a bike driven driver always seems to get mixed up and deliver the wrong food so your 30 minute wait is well over an hour.   The restaurant always corrects it but frustrating the say the least.  The food quality is good and portions are hearty.  Tres Leches cake is good here.  One of the better ones I had.  I love the Verde's beef enchiladas.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really like this place for the chewy, al-dente noodles. It is delicious and super cheap for fulfilling meal. I crave their sesame sauce noodle on a hot day when I just want a simple and satisfying meal.  It usually comes with a few green leafy veggies and the sauce is so addicting. I especially love to add a few drops of the chili oil that are dispersed on different tables in this no-frills, no ambiance restaurant. Turn over rate is pretty fast as most people just get in, eat, and get out. There are lots of other restaurants in the area and bubble tea place across the street. Parking can be a bit problematic but usually I can find something. Other dishes I have tried before are the beef noodle soup noodle. They separate the noodle and the soup for you in different containers so the noodle doesn't get soggy. So thoughtful!!! Lots of meat too! Also tried the dan dan noodle - not as good as the zha jiang noodle. Noodles are between $4.50-$6. The cold dishes are awesome. The meat and vegetable cold appetizers are different pricing. Take out is also more expensive than eat in, but large (take out container) vs. medium (plate). They do load it to the rim. :) Chinese speaking mostly and the staff aren't the most friendly but I really don't care","[1.0, 0.0]"
I love their pizza. It's the best I've had thus far. But I absolutely HATE the long lines. On a good day it takes 2 hours to get in. On days where they partition a section for a party then you're lucky to get in 3 hours. There have been countless times where we want to go there but are turned away by the lines. It doesn't seem like management really cares about moving the line along and get more customers in and out especially when we see empty tables. The long lines makes them feel more attractive as a eating location.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Both my visits to Rasoi ""III"" as its called were banquet events. Ive never eaten at the restaurant but I have tasted the food. I commend my family for throwing a great wedding ceremony, and baby shower here. The food is pretty good, I liked the north indian dishes and they even have a panipuri stall set up if you request it. The only downsides I saw were the staff which serviced our parties were not very professional not helpful, they did clear plates and fill water in a timely manner, but the lady working the bar looked like she hated being there and wanted to go home. We had an incident where the pani for the panipuri was left out over night and tasted horrible, they quickly made new pani. Also, they misplaced 3 cakes in their kitchen so that delayed the cake cutting part of our event. I think that their hall needs a remodeling, the carpet is old and smells a bit. The bathrooms need to be renovated badly, you cant have nasty bathrooms at a banquet hall! Overall, the food is good, the fact that we've had good memories here is a plus. I wouldnt hold my own events here but I would come back for a family party again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been here twice and both times found the bartenders incredibly rude. The first time I was waiting for a bartender to serve me and even motioned for his attention and he basically ignored me until my married friend came and was very eager to serve her (they did not know each other). We were joining a group of friends so we stayed for dinner. Waiter service was better, but nothing to rave about (fortunately I had a good group of friends to distract me!) The 2nd time I visited Barbuto was on a Saturday night. I sat at the bar (same seats, ironically as the last time)I didn't care for my wine and told the bartender, very politely, that I just didn't care for it. Then, he says ok, and gives me another glass. I say, It tastes very sweet. His response, was that it's from grapes, and then he launches into a dialogue in which he explains to me what a super tuscan is (his explanation was wrong, btw). I refrained from admonishing this silly kid, because we've all been young and foolish, but I don't appreciate a 20-something bartender making flippant comments or talking to me so condescendingly. I, um, know how wine is made.  Then the  bartender walked away before I could respond. His colleague was normal and civilized and helped me from there on. It was late in the evening and this was the only easily accessible spot. I didn't stay to eat anything, nor did I finish the beer I ordered to replace the wine. I would avoid this place. You'll be treated better at the rowdy collegiate beer garden across the street. If you want a civilized dining experience with delicious food and wine, hit up the fig & olive. It is just down the road, the staff behaves themselves, and the food is delicious. I will be writing a letter of complaint to the owner so he knows how his staff is behaving. Ridiculous!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for this place.   I've been a vegetarian for three and a half years and I still cherish the day I discovered Govinda's.  The chicken cheesesteak is simply amazing.  I usually get regular cheese but I have tried the soy and it's actually quite good...it has a cheese-wiz consistency.  The sesame buns are great but they are very filling so I think I'm going to start ordering it on a wrap.  The chicken salsa soup and the split pea soup are good.  I think we have noticed that the fries are sometimes soggy. The sometimes less than stellar service and the strange atmosphere don't drop my rating because the chicken cheesesteak makes up for all of this.   Oh, one more thing: I bring my carnivorous friends here all the time and they end up leaving pleasantly surprised and pleasantly full.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Classic American seafood bar and restaurant in the Rittenhouse district. Oyster House stays true to its heritage - you'll find plenty of wood trim and an impressive array of whiskeys behind the bar. The atmosphere rides the line between classic and trendy, making it a great setting for anything from a casual happy hour with friends to a dinner date. A friend and I came in for happy hour on a Friday. The place was pretty packed, and we were lucky to be seated right away. We ordered a couple rounds of oysters, which arrived at our table a couple minutes later. Mmm, they were fresh! Slightly briny, and I could definitely taste hints of cucumber and melon in the finish. Add a dab of cocktail sauce, horseradish, and a squeeze of lemon to give them the perfect combination of flavors. We also ordered the fried Ipswich clams which were excellent! It's similar to calamari, but the buttery flavor of the clams gives them a wonderful savory twist. We finished off with rosemary lemonade -- crisp, cool, and oh-so-refreshing. Just don't try and eat the table crackers if you're in the midst of a good conversation, they'll turn your mouth drier than your last college philosophy lecture.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wish I could give 4.5 (Cmon Yelp, work with me here...) but not quite a 5.  Still, an exceptional meal. Got there at 8 on a Fri nite without reservations, but a deuce at the bar opened up within 15 minutes.   What we ordered: a glass of Rioja homemade citrus soda (inCREDIBLE) A mixed drink (can't remember, but it was good albeit teeny) lobster pot pie- husband loved it soup special (winter vegetable) venison ragout w/buttermilk biscuits- excellent some kind of steak w/mashed potatoes (for hubby)- excellent The most expensive thing on the menu was $25, which is not breaking the bank by any means, but beware- the portions aren't huge.  Definitely enough food, esp. with the melt-in-your-mouth homemade bread w/pate that's generously passed around. ALL the food was great, except for the pedestrian soup, but still good.  Service wonderful, everyone was kind and professional and gracious.  The ambience, btw, is adorable and romantic.

"Amazing dinner! Matthew and I came here during Hartford Restaurant Week and got a great deal on a stellar dinner. To start, we were brought a bread basket that had a few different varieties, then I had the caesar salad and Matthew had the field greens. I went with the Filet Mignon with Grilled Jumbo Shrimp and herb butter--steak cooked to perfection and the shrimp were large and flavorful. Matthew had the bone-in dry aged sirloin steak--nice flavor and also cooked as ordered. We split the mashed potatoes and the french green beans with shallots and heirloom tomatoes--both were excellent. To top off an excelllent meal, we shared desserts of flourless chocolate espresso cake and cheesecake with fresh strawberry puree--we couldn't pick a favorite! Overall, service was professional but dry, our meals were nicely presented and portioned, and we left feeling completely satisfied.

"FOOD QUALITY: GREAT SERVICE: SHODDY PRICE: FAIR ATMOSPHERE/CLEANLINESS: Small place, very clean, but felt a bit too close to other tables/groups at times Walked in for dinner a few nights ago and they were able to seat us immediately-- the place was fairly packed but keep in mind that it's a pretty small place. The selection was good (Thai and standard Japanese menu) and most of the fish was fresh. The sushi here is excellent and very reasonably priced. My biggest issue with Vic's was the service from our waitress. She cursed several times while serving us and just generally seemed to be acting way too casual-- as if she was joining us at the table ha. It took 40+ MINUTES TO GET WATER TO THE TABLE. The first time I asked her for water, we already had appetizers at the table and her response was that ""we're out of cups."" It took at least another ~15 minutes, seeing another table get water, and reminding her again before we got water. When we were looking at the sushi menu she bluntly told us that the kitchen was ""slammed"" at the moment and sushi would take a while-- this didn't make much sense to me because, by this time, there were only a couple of tables dining in an already tiny restaurant. There were a couple of other small faults in the service but these were the main things I thought worth mentioning. All in all, a place worth trying out in my opinion.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"ok where to begin...I was very excited to go here as I only heard wonderful things about this place. I went here with my brother last Sunday before a concert at the Welmont. Montclair has many restaurants but I really wanted to try Ah"" Pizz. The only positive this place gets from me is the scenery. Very nice place inside. We shared 3 pizza's and a pasta and oh boy did I have better. We got a pesto pizza, one with sausage and one with cheese, garlic and tomatoes. The pizza was just ok for me. Nothing special about it at all. It was actually very soggy and alot of oil. Not sure if this place changed the style of how they make the pizza, but it was very under par for a place that considers them self's the best around. I was very disappointed. The flavor was also very bland. We shared a big bowl of Cavatelli with Sausage in a marinara sauce. Not sure if they make their sauce homemade, but if they do...they need to change up the recipe. The sauce was like a soup with no flavor and the pasta was very well done. Overall this was a very big disappointment for me. That god I was in good company so the experience was not all bad. But I will never return to this place and or recommend it to anyone. They are many better brick over pizza places that are authentic. The place is over priced for under par Pizza and Pasta. They might have been very good when they first opened, but they def went down hill. This place might have the name so people will keep going, but i don't see a place lasting this long in Montclair if they don't start taking pride in their food.

"Will not eat here again. We were excited to eat here based upon the Yelp reviews. We're new to the city and are still discovering places.  We love a good hearty breakfast and the location and menu looked perfect.  We knew we would have to wait in line., but having lived on NYC's upper west side for years, we were fine with that.  During the 15 minute wait outside, I bought a coffee at The Coffee Pedaler.  I took my cup in when we were seated, and after about 10 minutes, one of the staff came up and said I had to give them my coffee cup, it wasn't allowed.  I gave her the half full cup, but told her that it was a bit silly as they don't offer anything to people waiting on line (which would be a great idea!).  It's one thing to take the cup - but no one came to take our order, give us water or offer coffee or anything for 10 MORE minutes.  Not that I would order coffee anyway as it was hot out and the place didn't seem to be air conditioned, or if it was, it was woefully inadequate.  Finally, a very harried waitress took our order.  Unbelievably, we waited 20 more minutes for eggs and pancakes.  At about the 15 minute mark of waiting for food, I asked the guy refilling our water about our food and he said ""I'm just the guy pouring the water, I have no idea. But believe me, more people are waiting for food than have food.""  Seriously??!! What kind of answer is that?  Is The Pantry not interested in training the staff or giving customers a pleasant experience?  We were about to leave when our food came.  The tragedy is that the food was really good.  But not worth the incredibly bad service, uncomfortable heat, and zero overall hospitality.  I was also a bit disappointed in the cleanliness of the place. As we were about to leave, a cook came out of the kitchen in a filthy apron and I think he went into the bathroom - it was not a pleasant sight. We left a 20% tip as I don't think it's the staff's fault - they don't know any better.  Silver lining - we discovered The Coffee Pedaler across the street, which does not have an extensive menu, but the things on offer are of high quality, the coffee is great, the place is spotless and most importantly, the people working there are super friendly and take their jobs seriously. A much better, and less time consuming experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Areal hidden gem. and less then 2 miles from the willowbrook mall. Me and my friend have been driving withen a few blocks of this place for years and never knew it was there. Its good to finaly find a place that plays modern music and not just stuf from 20 years ago. this is a real 21st century lounge. my friend and i were joking that it almost looks like the bridge of the enterprise in that new star treck movie. in other words its very white. but with cool glowing purples and blues that change the mood. there are mini video screens everywear that show music videos. So no matter wear you sit you can watch the videos. we saw the poker face video the other night. talk about shoulder pads. and the nuuf nuff song. last week we saw timber lake and madona doing that 4 minnuts to save the world song jumping alot of cars. And they had shikera wear else but on a beach with horse what's up with that. lol alot of realy modern  videos. Alot of realy post modern chairs and tables . wow like you realise you can have fun in the present. it doesnt have to always be about remembering an old song and dancing to a memory. interesting concept living in the here and now. other places should try it.  and the people that work there are very friendly.lol the drinks are the best tasting martinies ive ever had. This week i had the gummy bear martini with actual gummy bears at the bottom. and the tropical bliss. not only were they both sweet but they were strong. alot of vodka. A few of them and my friend and i were making sound affects ooooo. last week i had the chocolot eclair which is addictive. my friend Chris had 2 or 3 chocolots this week. When you walk in you walk over a glass fish tank. the fishes make faces at you if you lean over the railing. ooooohh. The seating at this place is very comfortable. So basicly if you are looking for a place that people would go to if they knew about it but is still unknown to many, and you want something with modern music great drinks and friendly people you can end your search. People who find 381 dont have to look any further. this is that place you are talking about when you say if only i knew a great place with great music wear i can also have conversation. if only i could stop looking. i think once you find 381the search is over. i think it is the, i wish they had a place like this place.  Its just the people saying that havnt found it yet.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Great concept, well executed. Super busy during weekday lunch and weekend nights. Long lines and you hardly ever get a place to sit. You do want to eat your Kati roll hot. I would actually suggest them to do away with the tables and go for bar stools and tables like most of other places. My all time favorite is the Mixed Veg Kati roll. Can't believe they actually increased its price. Also love the Shrimp Kati roll.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We made a reservation to go here with our children on Sunday evening solely based on the high Yelp rating. Disappointing is an understatement. The $13-15 price for three bites of pasta is absolutely ridiculous. They stated that they were meant for tasting. In that case, either lower the price or provide a somewhat larger portion. We were flabbergasted! The food overall had a good flavor but was consistently over salted.The waitress was friendly but mostly stood over by the kitchen and chatted with her cohorts. Getting her to get us a check or for more water was impossible. Definitely not going here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Once you get past the fact that Difara's probably has not been cleaned since the Nixon administration, you are in for a real treat by way of the best pizza in New York.  The old man is some kind of genius, with herb garden growing beside the ovens, and his meticulous attention to detail.  Some things in life are worth the wait...like the Jay-Z and Nas reunion *tear*...and a slice from Difara's is equally worth the wait.  I once waited 40 minutes to get a slice, only to devour it in seconds, and then return for a 25 minute wait to get a second slice.  I think your best bet is to spring for a pie, because if you opt for a single slice, you will be left pining for more.  Sitting and waiting has its advantages at Difara, though.  When the joint gets really packed, you get to witness this neurotic ballet performed by locals, hipsters (who probably read about Difara's in the Village Voice's Best of NY) and whoever else is waiting for the divine offerings of Difara's.  People will get up ten times or more during their wait and nervously pace the floor by the counter, as if after 40 years in the business, the old man is finally going to fuck up and it's going to be THEIR order.  The old man is so calm, though, it's almost scary.  If I had to run a booming mom & pop business like that, with minimal help, I'd be a nervous wreck.  But if one TRULY wants to measure the greatness of a Difara slice, first, head over to one of Avenue J's countless kosher pizza joints.  Try one of THEIR slices, and then grab one at Difara's.  The choice is clear:  The Jews may be God's chosen people, but Difara's is God's chosen pizza.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I arrived at this Lanzhou Noodle location unintentionally, when I was looking for some quick food before my Chinatown bus' departure (AA Bus, cheap and efficient) in 20 minutes. The restaurant was not big, with about 4-5 tables, and there were about 4 what looked like to be Chinese illegal immigrants eating and slurping, trying to fill their stomachs before their shifts began. The moment I stepped, a young female, perhaps a waitress or perhaps the owner, yelled at me quickly in Chinese. I didn't catch what she said for a second, then realized she said ""what do you want?"". I said ""Oh!"" and quickly looked at the Chinese-only menu on the wall and opted for a spicy beef noodle plus a serving of dumplings. (Lanzhou Beef Noodle: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La… , this is the original product of which the Japanese Ramen was a poor and incomplete derivative.) While I waited, I noticed a huge electronic ""clock"" on the wall, with displays of day, month, year, time, minute, calendar. It was apparently made from an Electronic University in Shenzhen, China. The noodle came in a plastic bowl - hot and spicy-looking. I picked up a pair of disposable chopsticks and dug in. The noodles were well pulled, tender but with enough elasticity, beat the Japanese Ramen handily. The beef was of a good cut, probably from the leg, with a good mixture of lean and fatty meat. The soup was strong, spicy, and had the familiar aroma of cilantro. The bowl looked not so big when it was handed to me, yet there was surprisingly more noodle and beef inside than I initially anticipated, delivering enough spice and chewiness to my stomach to make a complete meal in itself (unlike the Japanese Ramen, of which a typical healthy male eater needs to order 3 servings just to be full ). The 6 steamed dumplings came on a plastic plate when I had almost emptied my bowl. Each one was plump, and full of meat and chives. They even came with a separate container filled with dipping sauce (a mixture of soy sauce and garlic), very considerate. The dipping sauce was not strong enough, so I added a few drips of vinegar, and suddenly it became full-bodied, perfect for injecting an extra layer of flavor into the skin and meat of the dumplings. Overall cost of the meal was $7.50, and I was beyond full. For one person with a small appetite, a bowl of noodle is enough for a meal. For 2 people, I recommend getting two bowls and sharing one serving of dumplings. Oh no, my Chinatown bus is leaving! I ran out the door, down Eldridge Street, turned right on East Broadway, and luckily boarded the bus just as it was about to depart.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'm personally not into any Italian food just because I feel discouraged by how pricey the food are ($20++) as compared to how cheap pasta really is! ($2/box, c'mon!) However, Luca's Ristorante did alter my perspective of Italian food! The interior was cozy, dim-lighted & the service was excellent. The waiter was professional & came back once in a while to make sure everything was ok & get our drinks refilled. Ok, let's start with appetizers, Burrata: really cool presentation! We literally felt guilty for ruining it. Bruschetta Caprese: Didn't get a chance to taste it ~_~ but still looked good! Fried Calamari: meh, nothing special, not crispy at all, DO NOT ORDER!

Crab meat & Corn: This SOUP IS DELICIOUS!!! they put  REAL Crab meat there & it was a lot! I'm not a fan of creamy soup & it was a bit salty for me, but the overall experience was amazing!

Penne Vodca was a creamy pasta with shrimp & Parsley (YUCK). The Penne was cooked well into perfection & the shrimp was fresh and crunchy!

But the reviews are so outstanding, high expectations were in order. It definitely lived up to all the reviews here that say it is amazing. IT IS. And I will add my praise to the rest of the crowd.

Even things you would never have thought of putting onto a hot dog is done. Decided to come to South Street because my husband wanted to check out some tattoo shops. I decided to yelp ""fries"" and Hot Diggity was one of the places that popped up. So, in we go. Soooo overwhelming. I had no idea what to order. Like I said earlier, they have tons of toppings. You could make your own, or order from a set menu they have. I went with the Cinncinnati. It was a 3 cheese sauce with beef chili and onions and scallions. It was great! The sauce and chili was so flavorful. I normally do not get full off of one hotdog, but they stuff these things to the max that I was overly stuffed 3/4 of the way through. I also ordered fries (cause that's what I was currently craving) with a cilantro lime mayo. Loved the sauce! I don't know how to describe the sauce, so you just have to get it. My husband ordered he surf n turf dog. It was fried fish with a hot dog and topped with veggies. I too really enjoyed this. For my son, I ordered just a plain dog. I don't really recommend it though. The dog is very very thin compared to the bread. You definately need toppings with the type of bread that is used. I mean, it's great for children, but an adult might be pretty dissappointed.

I placed an order for delivery and gave the address to the woman on the phone just to make sure the delivery driver knew where to go. They also had our room number. An hour later we started getting calls from the front desk because the driver kept calling the hotel saying he was at our room and we weren't answering. Their security swept the building and NO ONE was here. We called the restaurant and were reassured by someone in broken English he would be here soon. Come to find out he went to the completely WRONG hotel, even after we had given him the correct address. An hour and 15 minutes after placing our order the driver finally showed up. With NO apology whatsoever. The food was average at best and they didn't even give us enough chips and utensils. To top it off, after calling the restaurant to complain and ask for SOME kind of compensation, whoever we spoke to was extremely rude and combative.

"After arriving in Philly a little too early to check into our hotel, the beau and I were ravenously hungry. We've passed by 500 Degrees a handful of times on our visits to Philly, and we finally decided that this was the time to go in, as a burger sounded like heaven. I was a bit overwhelmed (in a good way) with their choices of specialty burgers and their ""build your own"" menu. I eventually just went with the 500 Burger; seemingly plain compared to others, but you can't go too wrong with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and bacon, I figured. The beau made his own with Kobe beef, lettuce, and provolone. Both done medium rare and made to order, we reached that heaven we were hoping for. I devoured mine.The special sauce, made with garlic and horseradish mayo, gave it a great tang. The Kobe burger was just as delicious, with the provolone adding a great sour sharpness. The French fries were also on point, and we were lucky enough to get ours fresh from the fryer. A good choice for a burger and fries, indeed! By my typical NYC standards, they are cheap, too, about $6 - $8 for a good burger. (Man, I'd kill for those prices in NYC sometimes. Ha!) I'd definitely make the trip back here should a burger craving strike me while I'm in Philly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The first time I tried to come here for brunch, the wait was ridiculously long. We had a party of four. I heard great things about this place (mostly from Yelp) and I so wanted to eat there that day but it was impossible. Second time's a charm... if you come on a Friday at 2pm with a party of 2. The wait was only 10-15 minutes. This place is SMALL. If you don't want to wait, they have take-out available behind the restaurant. There's like 2 servers at this place so service can get slow at times. I knew I should've ordered the Cuban sandwich but I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich that day so I ordered the fish tacos and my friend ordered steak and eggs. We had also ordered corn but it didn't come out until after our entrees. The corn was delicious! It was so good, we got another one after we had eaten eaten our main course. Sad to say that the only reason I would come back here is for the corn. The other food, cramped atmosphere, slow service isn't worth waiting around for. My fish tacos were bland and soggy while my friend's steak was chewy and tough even though it was medium rare. If it had been cooked further, it'd be inedible. The iced tea was also warm. I give them credit as the waitresses don't really have control over when food comes out of the kitchen and they were nice about seating us in a more spacious area as my friend was pregnant at the time, but I think I'll opt for take-out next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"AMAZING. Must call for reservations if they allow you to make them because its always packed. So worth going too. I have been twice now and both times were amazing. This particular time we went for Saturday lunch, I had the lamb sandwich which was like a pulled pork sandwich but with lamb, it was delicious and was served with chickpea french fries, I still don't know how I felt about the fries but the sandwich was delicious...heavy but delicious. My mom had the Trofie pasta and OMG it was SO good. Both these items are off their weekend Brunch menu so they might not be on their regular weekday lunch or dinner menus. BUT the lamb meatball sliders which are on the non-brunch menu are OUT OF THIS WORLD. Also, they are known for this cookie they make, the Nero cookie, have to get one, its delicious too! I will for sure go back here. Enjoy!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Peppinos is far superior to your typical neighborhood slice shop but it isn't a destination pizza place. The staff is friendly to a fault, which almost makes up for the errors in their food. 2 out of the last 3 times that I've ordered pies from them, they have put the wrong toppings on the pies. I'm not a picky guy but it is annoying when you are paying $20 + for a pizza. I'm not sure what the issue is but I hope they get it fixed. Delivery service is inconsistent in delivery time (15-45 minutes) but the food does arrive hot every time. In addition to their pies their salads and sandwiches are also delicious, especially the pepperoni hero.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love to try gourmet burgers and Bobby Flay's has a lot of them.  Obviously, they use a lot of high end cheese and ingredients.  Considering the ingredients going in, I think Bobby's Burgers are higher quality than In N Out or Shake Shack.  However, taste wise, I think Shake Shack tastes better to me.  However, if you pick uniqueness over taste, I recommend this place to you.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Totto Ramen was pretty delicious. I am new to the city and have been craving good ramen. I don't particularly want to travel too far since I walk almost everywhere and it was getting a bit late. Totto is about 10 blocks away from me so it's close in walking distance. They are open to midnight which is great as well. When I got there, I saw a huge line of people waiting (sometimes a good sign) so I rushed down the steps to add my name to the wait list. Although my bf and I waited almost 40 mins for a table to open, and ended up having to sit next another couple at one of the tables for 4 (a bit awkward) it still was ok. I got the Miso Ramen and my bf got the Spicy Ramen. Both were great, personally I enjoyed the Miso better, the broth was a bit thicker and had a better flavor for my taste buds. This is a place I would definitely recommend, just as long as you don't mind the wait, which is worth it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Hands down #1 pizza(tied with L&B's) in the world.  I say ""world"" because New York has the best pizza in the world and I've tried pizza everywhere! Come here when you have time and have a plan B just in case they're closed or making new bread.  The man himself is going to take his time and cook with a lot of heart and care.   Don't order slices- better off getting a pie because it's way cheaper in the end and fresh out the oven. Someone was complaining about Board of Health issues, etc...  This is an old school hole in the wall joint!  Think of it as going to your gramps crib for some good authentic cooking...","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Let it be said, I only ordered take-out from here. However, I would gladly return and sit down at this lovely picturesque restaurant. The woman on the phone (I believe one of the owners) pleasantly took my order. We arrived and our food took about the same amount of time to prepare as she said it would. Taking a quick glance around, we saw a lovely outdoor seating area with flowers and a stylish romanticesque inside dining area. My fillet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare. The port wine reduction is very sweet (you are warned!) but strangely tasty... The salad came with a nice blue cheese and we even got hot dinner rolls! My friend's NY Strip looked decent. The ""Neptune"" shrimp he got as an add-on were deliciously garlicky and buttery. Sadly, over the phone we foolishly did not ask about the Specials. Looking at the menu, they were amazing! Checking over the dessert menu, I wish we could have eaten at the restaurant. BLUEBERRY PEACH COBBLER. Go! Eat cow! Be merry!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After walking by this place one million times, and saying ""I really want to try this place"" one million times, I finally made a reservation for my husband's graduation. This is hands-down the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Philadelphia. Every single course that every person ordered was both interesting and delicious. We started with the mozzerela di bufala with brussel sprouts, which is an amazing combination of my two favorite foods- as well as some pork soup dumping appetizer which was amazing. For the entree, I had the ribs, which were amazing, and my husband had the trout, which he also loved (but said the ribs were better). The service was incredible, the ambiance was incredible, I can't wait to come back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

An hour later after I called them someone who was supposed to deliver the pie, called me and asked for the address. When got it he said its to far and they will not deliver it.

She said he is all about the customer and takes pride in his service...that much I will give him as he certainly walks the talk. When we make our annual visit to this area, we will return for this reason alone! And the mexican burger was delicious as well :-)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Great appetizer and dessert. Horrible entrees... La Sirene's been on my restaurant list for 2 years now. Finally went there last Friday evening. We had a reservation and were seated promptly, though it was quite difficult to actually get to my seat in this small and overly cramped space. Anyway, the restaurant smelled great, and with all the raves, I was expecting mouth orgasm, but walked away disappointed. For appetizer we had the goat cheese tart. The tart was delicious. The chopped mango on the side however was pretty bad. Now of course that's not the chef's fault because it is not mango season right now. However, I'd expect a place like this to know that and not serve out of season fruits. It just seemed unprofessional and careless. For entree we ordered Pan Seared Skate fish and Rosted Lamb Leg. Both were very unappetizing. The fish was overly oily, and the lamb was very tough and chewy. The texture was also very inconsistent, the center was very pink and barely warm, but the outside was very charred. It didn't have enough lamb flavor either. I like lamb for its unique gaminess, but this I could have easily confused with veal or steak. The toppings that came with the fish and the sauce that was on the lamb were both tasty and complex. But the actual fish and lamb were both unacceptable. The side veggie plate was forgetful. The two purees were somewhat decent, but the other two were very bland with unrefined cuts. Finally for dessert, we shared Meringue, with Caramel and Vanilla Custard. It had an unique texture, great combination of subtle flavors. It was probably the best part of dinner. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to be the saving grace. The ambiance was fine, I'm wasn't fond of the tightness of all the tables. And the service, while extremely friendly and prompt, seems a little contrived... The the end, the bill was $84, $100 including tip, for two people, who brought their own wine, had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert. Definitely was not worth the price.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"called and picked up a to-go order from here.  Bacon pizza, chorizo pizza, pickles, and kale salad.   pizzas were very good, and we'll definitely be ordering from here again.  The restaurant is quite spacious and had a really nice decor so I wished we had come out for dinner..  It felt more upscale than a typical pizza joint.  They had a nice bar area, and it felt fairly relaxed.  There were 4-5 people at the bar just hanging out, and had a nice vibe for a Wednesday night.  Maybe next time. We were at Marta last week, and we loved the pizza there. Not sure if it's fair to compare the two restaurants, but 10Devoe was still pretty darned good. Chorizo pizza was my favorite.   I do wish the pizzas had a bit more cheese and the bottom of the crust was slightly, slightly less burnt, but we just picked out some of the crust.  Nothing out of the ordinary though. Overall a fine pizza joint!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Love this place and not because its a BYOB...My friends and I have been coming here for years and we love the staff and the food is exceptional.  They treat us like family probably because we have shared a lot of parties from birthdays to engagements in the back room.  The place is jumpin on a weekend and you cannot make reservations for less than 6 people, so I suggest convince some friends to come with you or you might be waiting a bit for a table.  Bring your appetite and definitely have a cappuccino and piece of cake to finish the night, average price soup to nuts is $43.00/person","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I declare you as the KING OF HALAL carts of NEW YORK. Ever since moving to NYC, I've immediately fell in love with the ubiquitous Halal carts around the city and the super tasty and orgasmic (most of the time) chicken/lamb over rice that they serve at the most affordable price ever (cheaper than a Subway sandwich or Mickie D's). It's definitely one of the greatest options for lunch if you work in the city. But what this place sets apart from the rest is that their meat is shredded, they give you free slices of Pita, their White sauce is AMAZING, Hot sauce that is actually Fiery Hot and wimpy, and their portions are HUGE!!! I mean come on, a HUGE Lamb/Chicken over Rice and Slices of Pita to go with it for $6?? SHUT UP!!! Other Halal Carts around the city actually CHARGE you an extra $1 for Pita Slices you know...But this place, it comes with the combo!!  It also makes it the BEST Late night grub after a night out drinking to feed your hungry souls.

"I am not from the city and do not get in as often as I would like; henceforth, I do not know my way around Philly too well.  Also, I have a shitty sense of direction.   But on the plus side of my personality traits, I am adventurous.  One thing I love to do is park my car wherever I can find street parking and just walk with no destination in mind.  Last Thursday eve the weather was beautiful and I did just that. I was with a friend and we decided we were going to go to a bar that we picked randomly.  We parked near Center City, walked down Sansom for a few blocks, and I saw this gem hidden on a side street.  At once we knew this was the bar that we were meant to stumble upon.   The downstairs to McGillin's Olde Ale House, which has the main bar and a bunch of big tables, was packed and noisy.  It was only 8 pm and not even completely dark out yet. So we went upstairs to the smaller bar.  The room was at about half capacity, and it seemed to get fuller by the time we left.  We stayed there for an hour, just before the open mic started.  (To the singer-songwriters out there - if you want to get heard and be taken seriously, please do not come to McGillin's for the open mic.  It is by no means a music venue...unless you count having a karaoke night as being a music venue, which I don't.  I would bet money on the fact that the crowd that goes here has absolutely no interest in hearing your music and will not listen to you.  Go to World Café Live's or Doc Watson's open mic instead.) The beer selection seemed decent.  Since I was in an Irish pub, I chose Beamish, which is an Irish stout.  It was pretty tasty! For my second selection I went with my standard 7&7. My experience here was definitely above average and I am going to make it a point to come back at a later time on a Friday or Saturday night.  I will also have to partake in sampling some of the food choices.   I'm sure if I lived in Philadelphia within a few blocks of McGillin's, it would become my watering hole.","[1.0, 0.0]"

People just need to get off of this line and go explore.

"This is my first review on Yelp. I often visit here to read other people's opinions, but the servce I received last night at La Viola angered me so much that i had to vent. I went to the restaurant with 10 other people. We had reservations. When we were seated, we could barely move and we are all THIN women. I'd rather them turn me away then have me sit like i would in a crowded basement. When i had to get up to use the bathroom, i could not becuase the table behind us was so up against us! Now onto the service, when our waiter read outloud our specials, i was putting my camera phone away in my purse after taking pictures of our group, the waiter said to me in a VERY unpolite way ""PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY"" Excuuuse me! Maybe i did not want to hear about your specials. Maybe i was putting it away. who the hell are you to tell me what to do, i thought the customer was always right! When we ordered, my cousin just wanted a salad. The waiter looked at her with such disgust. 'how could u order just a salad in our establishment!"" then when our plates came out, it was so crowded that i tried to move some plates around to help out the same waiter who was so rude to me . he yelled at me again 'IT is hot plate!'. i tried to hand him my dish when done so he did not have to squeeze into the 1/2 ft distance we were from the other table and he said 'no rush no rush' I felt like i was in a crowded basement. i could barely tlak to the people in my group. i was also appauled to see that they sit couples who are probably out for romantic evenings at the same tables with COMPLETE strangers. my meal was mediocre. actually they can stick it up their viola. there are so many other BYOs in the city that would appreciate my business. i will not return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I really wanted to like this place. The food was nothing special, but definitely overpriced for what it was. You would do better at a smaller steak shop elsewhere in town as far as getting a tastier sandwich. Eventually we did. The big turn off for me were the homophobic and racist comments. I thought I was hearing it from another customer standing at an adjacent locaton but when I looked over, the conversation was with what appeared to be a patron and  two employees. They were hurling around profanities and hateful words. I guess because Im white and with my wife and child, they felt comfortable to be ignorant, but theymade be VERY uncomfortable in front of my child. I really wanted to speak up but didn't want to have our food spit on.  It's one of those places that the tourists have to try out, but the locals would be able to direct you to a better place that is less well known.

I had the Carciofo Fritelle artichoke, chickpeas, red pepper, nepitella crema and it was awesome. I could have had two orders. The GARGANELLI pasta quills, cream, truffle butter, prosciutto but without the prosciutto and I could have had a second bowl. I tried the three flavors of their gelato: pistachio, strawberry, and amaro vanilla. Pistachio is my favorite. And GIANDUJA BUDINO chocolate-hazelnut custard, gelato alla caffe.

Good food, but does it live up to the hype?  Some say ""nah"" - but I am going to go with ""Hell. Yes."" It is what it is - they make a delicious omelet.  But again... is it worth, like, 8, 9 or 10 dollars?  Well, yes.  I say it's worth that amount of money, because in all likelihood, you will not find any other place within walking distance serving a better and cheaper omelet.  So take it for what it's worth.  What else, what else... hmm, corn flour pancakes.  One of the best items on the menu for breakfast.  Seriously.

They did not have any roast pork or duck; but that was ok since there was plenty of items to choose from. We had the shanghai crispy noodles and shanghai minced pork. If you can't tell, we were really hungry! Good traditional food that specializes in dumplings. Good variety and service too. Close to Reading market and 10 min walk from 8th at staton.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Every time I bit into the snappy dog of my Cincinnati Skyline on Saturday, I couldn't help but think that it was the best hot dog I'd ever eaten. I probably said it at least three times. The experience reminded me of a fond hot dog memory of my childhood. Christine B was the lucky recipient of that tale, and if she was bored to death hearing the story of my favorite hot dog, she was a good sport and didn't show it. This particular link was nestled in a soft bun which held up to the ingredients: chili, chopped onions, creamy nacho cheese and fresh diced green onions. The entire thing was delicious. Adding to the experience were the thick cut French fries. I felt they needed a tad more salt, but they were great otherwise. We opted for garlic aioli and peppercorn ranch dipping sauces, but I tried the honey mustard also and liked it best out of the three. Not sure why it took me so long to give in to the temptations of Hot Diggity, but it definitely won't be long until my next visit.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went here for my best friends birthday dinner. It was a great place to get a bottle of wine and share some small plates. Lovely decor, friendly staff and the food was delicious. I am still dreaming about the beef carpacio and scallops - they were fantastic! I would definitely recommend giving it a try. I'd like to go back and sit at the bar and watch them making the food.

"I have been here twice and everything was great both times! Best bar in the city. I went both times with my best friend and the first time, I had a lot of wine, Chardonnay, which was good. Met some cute guys too. The second time, last night, I had a couple of amaretto sours and a couple of glasses of reisling. The prices were a little high, especially for the wine...$8.80 per glass. My friend and I shared vegan pulled pork nachos with no sour cream and no cheese, and I didn't even miss the dairy and meat. (My friend is vegan so I eat vegan when I'm out with her.) We both met a guy we hit it off with too! (Tip: ask for Ritchie's vegan wings...haven't had em yet but they're supposed to be good, coming from the upstairs manager.) Enjoy! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I can't lie to you, it's hard to get a 5 from me, but Amada certainly earned it.  The restaurant may be a little too loud and the decor is a little overrated (nice, but I think the 2012 zagat gave it a 24 in decor...it's not a 24), but the food and service is simply outstanding. I have been here for lunch and dinner.  For lunch, everything is a la carte, and the portions are rather small.  But it's definitely some of the best food I've ever eaten.  The ham croquettas are an absolute must.  I went here for a first date and the total bill came to about $110 after tax and tip...this got us 5 awesome tapas dishes and 2 glasses of sangria each.  Definitely expensive for a lunch, but oh so tasty. For dinner, a friend and I got the $65 tasting menu.  You can either order a la carte (bill could easily get out of control I'm sure) or choose 1 of 2 tasting menus ($55 or $65).  Not sure the difference in what you're getting with these, but I doubt you can go wrong with either.  Our dinner came with about 9 different tapas and a flourless chocolate cake.  Every dish was impressive.  By the end of the meal, I was satisfied, but did not have the roll me out of there kinda feeling that you get from Fogo or Chima.  It was perfect. Oh, and their apple cinnamon sangria is the best I've ever drunk.  Weighing everything, price is fairly high, atmosphere/noise is decent, food and service beyond excellent.  5 star restaurant","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Food nirvana is the best way to describe this place. Everything from matzo balls to the best grilled cheese sandwiches you'll ever have to fresh produce and seafood and the pot to cook it in.  On Sundays several of the vendors close up shop, so to get the full experience plan for another day.  A couple of hours is good to wander through the market and take everything in. The cheesemaker in the back is beyond belief (Valley Shepherd Creamery?). If you love cheese, this place has your number.  And the sandwiches from Melt Kraft? Absurdly delicious. Dessert can be had at the Flying Monkey Bakery, or a huge, fresh baked cookie from the Philadelphia General Store.   Come here with an appetite and someone to help carry everything back to the car!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Very solid choice for a fun night out in Williamsburg. They have a good variety of drinks and make good use of a smaller-than-average space to maintain a dark, cool vibe. The DJ had a great selection of tracks (e.g., trap, 2000's/90's hip-hop), but man this guy could not transition. The tracks came abruptly after each other with no sense of flow, which to me is a sign of poor DJ'ing. Otherwise, it was a good time had by all, and certainly a place I'd return to for drinks and dancing.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The service was horrible; my friend and I were asked to move because presumably someone famous wanted to sit where we were. The food was mediocre at best; the pancakes are good, only 1 step above diner quality. The prices were way too high; MUCH more expensive than it should be considering the quality of the food. The wait is simply ridiculous; I don't have to say more than that, every review on Yelp mentions the wait because it's THAT long. The place is too crowded; almost no room to move around let alone get comfortable. Honestly, I can't figure out why people would wait as long as they do for mediocre overpriced food. Pause cafe is just across the street, tastes better, is cheaper, and the people there are awesome. Cornerstone on B and 2nd is also much better and cheaper. This is by far the most overrated establishment in all of New York.  If you're actually from Manhattan you'll probably just go to whatever is most popular anyway, in which case you shouldn't read reviews. If you're not from Manhattan, DO NOT GO HERE.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I wouldn't go back to this restaurant if they paid me.  This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had dining in all my years living in Manhattan.  We arrived at 8:30 for an 8:15 reservation (calling ahead as a courtesy to alert the restaurant) and were told that our table wasn't ready yet, not that they'd given it away.  We were told to wait at the bar, which only had rail alcohol and we'd be seated shortly.  After checking back w/ the front desk a few times finally at 9:10 I asked to speak to the manager who tried to walk by me to ignore the issue.  Keep in mind that there had been two or three four tops open for the last ten mins.  long story short; I've never been spoken to like this EVER.  Never has a host raised is voice to me, flailing his arms...His name is Eric and I plan on boycotting ALL of his restaurants.  He kept calling me ""dude"" like I was 17 years old, have some respect, other patrons at the bar were mortified and had thought we were friends getting into a fight.  There are way too many good restaurants in the city (and the Hamptons) to throw away money to get abused.  Word to the wise, take $100/person out of your wallet and just burn it now.  You'll get more out of it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If I would need to summarize STIX in one sentence it would be ""Going to a very good friend's house for dinner, except your friend really knows how to cook"". This restaurant offers a friendly welcome, delicious bites and wallet-friendly prices. The food is in a way sophisticated but at the same time tastes so clean and fresh where you feel at home, eating your mother's food (only better version). I should say everything I tried was amazing but some dishes are a must- such as chicken soup, green shishito peppers, meatballs (yummiest) , farmers salad, spreads with homemade whole wheat pita bread, Greek fries and of course all variety of Stix. And to finish up this amazing food, you should try their desserts (kadaifi/sweet stix is to die for) and their heavenly coffee where each of them is made as if it were the barista's last. If you live in the neighborhood this place is a must and even if you are not, the trip will worth it and you will be leaving very satisfied, since you don't typically find cooking this good and prices this reasonable in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Perhaps my expectations were too high or I should have gone for dinner instead of brunch, but I wasn't that thrilled about this place.  It was a teeny tiny space and there was not much selection for brunch. I had the tortilla with a watercress salad, and shared the churros.  The tortilla was very salty (which seemed to be the trend in NY on that particular weekend), the salad was quite good, but a bit heavy on the dressing for my taste.  The churros were very nice and light, but the chocolate couldn't compare to the stuff I had in Spain.  All in all, a relatively mediocre experience.  I should note, however, that service was very lovely.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here on a gift certificate given to us by my parents who rave about this place. We were 1 of three tables in the place and the service was awful. Being a server myself, its hard for my to tip under 20%, for the first time, we did. Thank god we had a gift certificate to pay for the meal. First we found a produce sticker on the onion in our appetizer, meaning the produce isnt washed when it is delivered. We later found out they did NOT take this off the bill, we paid for the tainted app. Next my boyfriend got the filet mignon and i got the stuffed shrimp. From my work experience I know that a kitchen knows how to time the meal, especially since we were one of three tables. Obviously the steak takes longer to cook than my Shrimp, when the food came out it was OBVIOUS my dish sat in a heat window, waiting for my boyfriends filet to cook. My shrimp needed a steak knife to cut them, they had been turned to rubber from the heat window, and the stuffing on top was rubbery also. My boyfriends steak was cooked to order perfectly, and was a great dish with a great presentation. From working in lots of kitchens and places, I would say the service was beyond poor, the manager didn't greet our table as he did the other two tables, even after there was a problem! We arrived at 6:30 and left at 8:30, thats how slow it was. The inexperienced kitchen made my time at Tejo awful and I would not go back. MoveTogetherFitness@gmai…","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love this shop.  It fills up the hole in my heart that Spain left when I had to move back to the States.  The food is completely fabulous, but I do take away a star for the price.  Pinchos (aka pintxos) are almost 2-3X more expensive than what I was used to paying in Madrid, but it can't be helped.  We're not in Spain anymore.  Churros con chocolate could use some work, too, but since it is cheaper to travel to Despana than it is to travel to Espana, I'll get my fix at Despana - just not too often.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Nyonya is the last true Southeast Asian fusion restaurant I've been to and it did not disappoint. The food, the curries particularly were mouth-watering and fantastic. The first thing that hits you about the place is the smell. That smell! I wish my apt smelled like that everyday, they should bottle the aroma and sell it as incense. I also enjoyed a crab dish which was grandly presented and heartily shared among myself and friends. Nyonya's decor is dark with flickering candles and bustling tables. Loved it. Verdict: This is a reliable place for Malaysian and Singaporean food. Perfect for a date, girls' night, work dinner, or just chilling with a group of friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This will definitely not be on my list. I probably won't be back. While I must give its props for a fun, trendy atmosphere and awesomely, unnecessarily decadent decor, I found the over all experience lacking, especially considering the price. I brought my family that was visiting from out of town here to show them a fun nyc restaurant. They were excited about the decorations etc. But, despite the fact that I had already lowered my expectations for the food, and the fact that my family are definitely not thai food connoisseurs, we were all disappointed in the food. Do not get any duck dishes. We had two at out table, and yuck. It had a very squishy texture which was not pleasant. The tamarind, more spice than taste. The shrimp pad thai - maybe four shrimp in there and it was overly greasy with overcooked noodles. The best dish was the pork chops - we alll cleaned the plate since my sisters dish was the only one we liked. pretty yummy. If I ever come back, i'll get that. The bill was about $70 for four people. Not really a value for thai food, but then again we got duck dishes and two drinks. It is what it is. I've experienced better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Food is good, well prices (especially their monthly lunch specials), and seemingly very very healthy.  They make their food to order so be ready to wait in line then wait for them to make your food.  Or, just call ahead.  Great place, try the chicken avocado wrap with turkey bacon.  amazing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've now been to Agricola five times - three for meals and twice just for drinks.  I hadn't written any comments because it's new, and I thought it fair to wait several months until the kinks were worked out. Bottom line:  It isn't worth your time and money. The food is not special, many of the ingredients aren't local at all because they're out of season, and there's nothing on the menu that is unique or can't be ordered elsewhere.  Every restaurant needs a few ""can't touch anywhere else items"" and Agricola has not a single one. The service is cold, absent and uncaring.  There are many people, but they mostly are talking to each other or standing behind the bar doing nothing. There are too many great places within a block to spend time here.  The atmosphere and design are OK, but not enough  to offset the kitchen.  And, while I usually don't weigh quality with price, Agricola is extremely expensive, even if it were great.  You're paying for superior service and extraordinary food; you're getting something worth a lot less. I'm sad about all of this, because I like businesses to be successfully, especially locally owned and operated ones. But I really hope the owner and chef are reading these comments and does a makeover.  The general buzz in town is turning negative, time is short, and people have a lot of options.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's November 27th, I'm turning 28 and where did I go for brunch? One of my tried and trues: The Parc Bistro. Parc bistro may only get 3 stars but it gets ""tried and true"" business from me on a regular basis for the following reasons: Good red wine selection. If you like côtes-du-rhône, they have it for $10 a glass. I also adore the sparkling Rosè they sell by the glass. They have delicious options for breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner. The biggest selling point for me is that--- in the right weather you can bring your PUPPY! They have outside seating that faces a relaxing view of rittenhouse Sq park. You might be wondering why I only give Parc 3 stars. I have been to Parc many times and the service is not always on point. I have been brought the wrong order twice on different occasions. The food is good but I do not feel it has an authentic French taste. The 1/2 roast chicken seems to be as close to French cooking as they get. The salads, beer, wine, and atmosphere keep me coming back. However, if you think this place is French, order the French macaroons and then you will know it is all a facade. The seating is also not comfortable. I would not suggest this to an older crowd, or power scene. However, a lot of good looking people eat out here. Popular for the dating scene. Here are my favorite dishes: saladelyonnaise Frisée,  lardons, poached egg Roasted beets, hazelnuts, feta cheese, horseradish dill vinaigrette 1/2 roast chicken Pommes purée, jus de poulet","[0.0, 1.0]"

"No, I did not attend their Wednesday and Thursday Kamayan night but my first Jeepney experience was delicious and I will definitely be back again. Jeepney labels itself as a gastropub but it's more of a hipster, grungy, casual, not-so-cheap eating option if you're in the East Village. It is ""not-so-cheap"" because a drink can easily go for $12-$15 and an entrée is about $20-$25. That's NOT cheap if you ask me. Its storefront looks like that of a rundown pub or deli. But when you walk in, you'll notice that it is a bit shabby because of the street food theme that the owners at Jeepney wished to portray and embrace. Right by the entrance, there's a bar seating area where you can enjoy a drink and a few bites. Along the walls are a few tables that lead straight into the back seating area, where there are a cluster of tables facing photos and magazine spreads of half naked Asian women. They also have an outdoor garden area that is open during warmer months, delightfully decorated with globe string lights. One MAJOR CON was how uncomfortably warm it was. It was a murky, humid 85-88 degrees outside and they only had a fan on. I saw a couple of waiters and busboys playing around with the thermostat but when we nicely asked them to crank up the AC, they nonchalantly responded that the AC was set on 'high' and that there was nothing that could be done. Let me tell you though, our meal wasn't as enjoyable as it would have been, since we were sweating bullets. As much as I want to go back, I am hesitant, concerned that my makeup will drip down my face. As for the food, it was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared their roasted chicken entree, a bowl of coconut rice, with a side of yam fries. The coconut rice is sweet and has little pieces of coconut shavings. It went really well with the chicken entree, since the chicken was also on the sweeter side, with a slight coconut vinegar after taste. The entree came with two huge pieces of white and dark meat, bak choy, and caramelized bananas, which tastes very much like fried plantains. The yam fries look like thin french fries, but was a bit dryer and chalkier, similar to yuca. Like aforementioned, I'll definitely be back but maybe on a cooler day with a few friends who I know have an appreciation for culture and good food. I think Jeepney is a great restaurant choice for a more casual date or a dinner get-together with friends. Facial hair, tattoos, and cloth totes encouraged.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This was my first visit to Vinted.  I used to frequent Uncorked, which occupied this space prior to Vinted and always loved it there.  I was a little worried that I wouldn't have as good an experience with it under the management of The Federal.   I was pleasantly surprised to find that the atmosphere was fun and light.  The staff was knowledgeable about the food and the wine and were able to make good recommendations for parings. We started off with a meat and cheese plate.  We had roquefort, bleu cheese, and prosciutto.  It came with a honey comb, a few grapes, and raisin toast.  We had a glass of zinfandel that went perfectly with it.   For dinner we got the soft shell crab and the short ribs.  The crab came in a bowl of spicy corn chowder.  The crab was very good, but the corn chowder was the star of the dish.  It was well balanced with good flavor and just a hint of spice from chili oil that lingered for just a minute after you ate it.  The short rib came on a Panzanella salad, which was fantastic.  The rib, although tasty, was not as flavorful as I would have expected.   The staff was fantastic and we struck up a conversation with the couple at the next table.  Our waitress, Tracy, was friendly and joking around with us and the table next to us.  The manager, Gary, visited our table and found that I have a love of Italian wines.  He told us about large format bottles of great wine that the open on Friday nights.   It is so nice to have a place that I can get an affordable taste of a wine before I purchase a glass or a bottle.  They had a beautiful Amarone on the wine list that was nothing short of spectacular, but a glass or a bottle is outside my price range, but we were able to get a 1oz taste of it (and it was totally worth it!).   We skipped desert, as we were too full to eat any more, but the table next to us raved about the smores, and they looked delicious.  We plan to put this on our regular list of restaurants we visit, and I plan on coming back on a Friday night to try out some of the wines they get in the large format bottles.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The bartender was super helpful and suggested Malbec which we stuck to all evening.  The wine list is affordable and I have never tried anything here that I didn't like - kudos to the helpful bar staff! We comfortably gathered by the bar while waiting for our party to all show up.  Once we were all there, they didn't rush us upstairs to our table and seamlessly transferred the tab. All food was excellent - the lamb meatball appetizer was scrumptious and I never come to Landmarc without getting a crock pot of their steamed mussels in wine/parsley broth.  Our food came out quickly and all well-timed.

"As I was planning my NYC trip I asked a few people where to go. Two of them had Ippudo on their list but it was the East Village location. Then I found out that one of my friends from High School actually works at this one in the Westside and I just had to support her store, unfortunately she was not working when I went, but the food and service were definitely excellent. Growing up in Hawaii I have had lots and lots of ramen. I must say that Ippudo is in the top 3 list of best Ramen I ever had. I honestly do not know why, but the taste, noodles, and meat were excellent. I ordered the Karaka Men and even added Bakuden for extra spiciness. Noodles were great texture, just enough broth, and the meat was very flavorful. Definitely worth it. People say that the wait is long, but on a Sunday Night I was the only one in line. There really was no wait at all. I would love to come here again and try another flavor and maybe some appetizers. Really good Japanese Noodles for sure!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So being that this joint is in my neighborhood, and I have have heard such rave reviews I decided to walk in and see the what the fuss was about... Upon first glance from their modest outdoor signs, the place looks on par with your neighborhood pizza joint, but upon smelling the beautiful aromas of freshly baking bread and nicely browning toppings you know there's something special inside.   I decided to order two slices of their zucchini, goat cheese, and mozzarella pizza.  My only deduction of a star comes here since the pie was resting a storage case and reheated upon order (I figured a fresh pie would have gotten the 5 star stamp of approval). Even at the reheated state, the pie was GOOD.  They reheated the pizza a little too much for my liking, but nonetheless the freshness of the grilled zucchini and goat cheese was really evident from the first to last bite.  Best part was the price tag...$4.50 snagged me the two slices.  At California Pizza Kitchen (the only low point of my home state), $4.50 gets you table bread and iced tap water.  You can only image what fresh goat cheese and zucchini will run. Lastly, the people there were great.  The owner is normally manning the ovens, and he sings at the High Note Cafe located right next to the pizza shop.  Francoluigi is another great find in Philly.  I also intend to check out the High Note Cafe in the very near future.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After living in Japan for several years, I can honestly say that the ramen here is legit. It's not the best ramen in the world, but it is the best ramen I've had in the states, and I've tried quite a few places. I personally recommend the classic as the thick tonkotsu broth and thin noodles match perfectly in the traditional Hakata style. If you're in the mood to make a time of it the pork buns, pickled cucumber, and shishito peppers are all excellent (a bit pricey but worth it if you're only here once in a great while). Add excellent service (although beastly waits), and you have a 5 star restaurant, new York could use a few more like it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Last night we took my wife for her birthday dinner here after family highly recommended it.  We were a party of 6.  We were disappointed with the experience.  It should be noted that the restaurant was not very busy so the review that follows is not based on a rough night at the restaurant. When ordering, we asked the server about ingredients for dishes and she did not have answers or offer to find out.  Fifteen minutes later, the server asked me to confirm my order, which I did.  Forty-five minutes after originally ordering, we inquired about our meal and were told  it would be out in 5 minutes. The delay was explained as a kitchen issue.   Ten minutes later,  a different server apologized and said that it would be out in 5 minutes and delivered a complimentary pastry.  We asked what was the pastry and the server said he did not know.  Another 10 minutes goes by when the server says it will be out in two minutes.  Four of the six dishes came out ten minutes later.  One dish was cold.  All dishes ordered broccoli and the broccoli was almost raw. The other two dished owed were nowhere to be found.  Another server asked what was ordered which seemed strange because the person who took our order had written things down and she was still present.  At that point they said they would have it out in about 2 minutes explaining that they were not sure if the dishes made were for our table or another table.   Five minutes later, a person who appeared to be the manager came out and said that the order was never placed for the two dishes. This is well over an hour after originally ordering.  We were assured it would be out within five minutes.  Five  minutes later, they asked my son if he was willing to have another pasta  because spaghetti takes too long to make (not sure why spaghetti would take longer than any other pasta).  Ten minutes latert the food came out with spaghetti rather than the amended request of rigatoni.   The food sent back for coming out cold came back hot but was dried out while most of us had completed our meal when the last two meals had come out.  T he restaurant did not charge for the two late meals. But, the  aggravation was not worth the discount.  Two of the servers were pleasant and were given tips for trying to help out but the original server and the server who brought us the complimentary pastry were given nothing based on their indifference to customer service and a complete lack of knowledge of what they were serving.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this restaurant.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I am really disturbed by this and might not be considering visiting this place on Saturday's and I usually try to eat out only on Saturday's. Looks like Guru Palace management is not interested in this kind of business and want to loose customers.

"Much more out of the way and a little more rustic than its sister restaurant Amis, Osteria is a wonderful restaurant that definitely warrants the ""trek"" out to North Broad. I am a huge fan of the atmosphere of the place. Very warm and cozy, as if you were in an old barn or a rustic ski lodge. But in Italy. Not sure if that's a real thing or not. The food was outstanding and everything we shared was well complimented by the wine we chose. The pizza is definitely a must! We also shared the ""vegetable plate"" which I believe was a special the evening we were there celebrating my birthday, but if you see it, you should get it. Tons of variety, all fresh and delicious. Did I mention I love vegetables? I'd recommend doing a general table ""sharing"" and just ordering a bunch of things. That's pretty much how I'd like to spend any meal, honestly. Could be great for groups, or a romantic date, but either way, this place is awesome. I still like Amis better, though it's not entirely fair to compare the two. The pasta is just slightly better at Amis and the general ambiance/fact that it's in center city makes me want to go back to Amis much more frequently.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So I've only been here late at night after going out but I've gotta say. Good source of protein after a nice dance work out! It's a build your own meal/snack kind of place so you can make whatever it is you feel like! I usually get the ""naked balls"" that come with 4 meatballs and a thin slice of foccacia. Highly recommend the spicy pork meatballs with meat sauce. Really hits the spot for only $7! Deal! It gets pretty crowded after 2 or 3am so don't come with a big ol' group of people! So I just wrote this review on the subway when I was heading toward my going out destination and ended up here again tonight!!  I actually tried the meatball smash and it was quite fantastic.  Their special meatball was a steak, bacon, and cheddar.  OMG so delicious!!  The smash is basically a burger with a brioche bun and meatballs instead.  Seriously, nothing you get here is bad.  My friends ordered ice cream/ ice cream sandwiches which I had only a bite of since I'm lactose intolerant, but let me tell you... if I had my lactaid pills, I'd totally eat that too.

"I've been here twice now...and OK I ordered the same thing twice, but that's because it was delicious! The soup dumplings are pretty good, though they may be more dough than filling and they seem to break easily. I'm no expert at picking them up, but last time when I bit into both my dumplings, it seemed like all the liquid is gone. Either they don't really fill them up, or they broke in the bucket they came in. The scallion pancake was ok. It's only $3.25, but it was a little too fried last time. I didn't taste any scallions either. Still delicious (fried food is still delicious food) and the sauce it came with was good, but don't expect to see any scallions... For the entree I ordered the shrimp wonton noodle soup. It comes with 4 or 5 delicious wontons as well as noodles. They supposedly have different types of noodles to choose from, but both times no one asked me what kind I wanted. I was served ramen noodles with them (which is fine). The regular size was just enough to fill me up with the appetizers. A friend ordered the wonton soup (no noodles). I think she just got 1 or 2 more wontons, so I guess that's the trade off for the noodles. Overall a good place. My go-to when I'm in the mood for shrimp wonton noodle soup!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went with Kathleen D to Bridgid's last week to have a late dinner after a long day at Bloktoberfest (and thus experienced the ensuing Pie Debacle of 2014). I was disbelieving of her insistence that it had Italian food (given the name and the sign), but my confusion was assuaged when I walked past the bar and into the back room, which had a totally different vibe (the front was definitely your neighborhood pub, but the back was closer in atmosphere to a dark corner trattoria). After half a glass of cabernet sauvignon and a lot of hedging about whether to order from the bar menu or the Italian menu, the bar menu won out (I was NOT hungry enough for a large plate of pasta). I ended up ordering a chicken sandwich, which was piled with arugula, goat cheese, and apple slices. I found the whole dish sufficient for my not-so-hungry state. I felt that the fries tasted and looked exactly like Five Guys fries, and the large amount of chicken breast that was on my roll overpowered the other, more delicate flavors, but I left satisfied... until I had to drive back to collect the errant slice of pie.","[1.0, 0.0]"

3.5 stars. Came home to one of these sandwiches waiting for me after work by the awesome BF. I prefered his sandwich w/whiz better though the whiz gets rich and heavy after awhile so I went back to mine which just had the provolone but wasn't as tasty. Loved the peppers that came on the side. If we come back again I would recommend asking for the whiz on the side if possible. I think I prefer Tony Luke's still which is currently my go-to for all the outta state visitors we have coming in the future. Our favorite thing from this meal was the Red Plum Nantucket Nectar juice bottle... best flavor discovery ever. He mentioned they were all business as word around has it with these cheesesteak places when it comes to ordering so know what you want and no hesitating otherwise you'll feel the burn.

"This restaurant could have a better outcome. They have a good concept on the name, decor and menu. I was really intrigue looking at their menu, definitely stand out from other places along 30th ave. We had the chicken&eggo and breakfast burrito. I was surprised when the waffle came out it was actually came from eggo, It could have been a fresh waffle and it will became a great dish.  You can taste the frozen waffle is tough and dry, The presentation though was an innovative one, too bad it doesn't deliver enough. The burrito was delicious and on the large size for the hungry ones. For service I have to give a thumb down. When a customer entering a restaurant/diner, someone need to greet them right away. I witness a group coming in and hv to wait for a minute until someone actually looking at the front door. (sorry a minute is way too long for waitress to acknowledge your present). We also served by our lady waitress, which in my opinion should hv check back after food is arrived if we need anything else, but no action was done. At the end of the meal when she deliver the check she had forgotten our to go food. We had also forgotten about it and realized until we got home. But it should hv been the waitress to remember when she drop the check.   Overall it should be the restaurant effort on improving the service, not single out the waiter. Obviously she didn't get enough training on basic wait staffing. I will give a second try to come back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So as everyone knows, Mamouns is a great place to get cheap falafel.  It fills you up, and is less than $5.  I have had very good experience EVERY time I have been to the one on St. Mark's.  This one however, disappointed me.  Not because it wasn't delicious, but because the guy at the counter basically charged me and gave me something I didn't order. I just order a ""falafel sandwich"" and was charged $3.  I told him I just wanted the falafel sandwich, and he said that ""all sandwiches that come with falafel is $3.""  It clearly stated that a falafel sandwich was $2 and that the hummus sandwich was $3. After paying $3, and after biting into it, there was hummus in the sandwich.  This is not what I ordered.  What if I was allergic to something in the hummus?  Totally not cool.  What was worse, was that when my friend ordered a falafel, he was charged $2.50 and got  a sandwich that didn't have any hummus in it.  In the end, I believe that he just made this sandwich earlier, didn't want to throw it away, and made up some story to sell the sandwich.  I will never go to this Mamoun's again.  I didn't really care about the extra money he charged, but he basically decides what my order is, rather than the reverse.  Go across the street for a falafel sandwich instead....at least for this location!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Heirloom tomatoes - three slices, some leafy lettuce and the unwelcome guest of anchovies made this a waste of money. Dessert was incredible, especially the corn ice cream with seasonal berries. The chocolate cake with milk chocolate ice cream was great as well.

"I ADORE the grits here. So creamy, dreamy. Delicious. Customizable toppings to suit your palate. Kale pesto and soft egg are a must. My other favorites include bacon and jalapeno. Spicy maple chicken sausage is also good, although I find it a tad too sweet. One needs to be in the right mood for it. Their sizes seem to have shrunk in the past year... so definitely get the grits in a large. Everything else that I've tried here- while good- is not quite as amazing. The breakfast sandwich that everyone raves about is good, but there's usually too much bread (which sometimes seems a bit on the hard end) and not enough of the stuffings. Have definitely had better breakfast sandwiches (what up Lincoln Station!). The chai sticky bun is usually a big chunk of gooey awesomeness. But be warned, the chai bun contains large pieces of peppercorn. As other people have pointed out (and as is obvious from the photos)- this is essentially an outdoor stand. There's usually a long line on the weekends and there's no place to eat. So be prepared to wait and to stand and eat. 5 stars for the grits. 3.5/4 for everything else.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You can order as mild or spicy as you want, but the food is authentic, aromatic and Indian! The naan and other breads are fresh and fantastic.

"I have to say that I do not understand why other reviewers found charm or ""fascino"" at this place. In fact based on the reviews, I really thought that the food was going to be fantastic, but I was less than impressed with the dishes we were served. We opted for the vegetarian tasting menu, but alternated our choices. For the first course, I had a very delicious mushroom salad while my sweetie had the butternut squash soup. Both were very good, and I figured that the initial dishes would be indicative of the rest of the meal. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The second courses, mushroom risotto and polenta fries, were not that great. The shape and presentation of the fries reminded me of Burger King french toast. They were tasty, but the option was something I would have expected from a gastro-pub like Egans, and not a fine dining establishment. My better half's mushroom risotto tasted like rice and slugs. It was chewy, extremely salty and inedible. He didn't send it back because he didn't want them to bring more. Finally, the third course arrived and again both dishes were underwhelming. I expected the pumpkin mezzaluna to melt in my mouth, but it did not taste fresh or homemade. Obviously both pasta dishes had been frozen and were not *fresh* as touted on the menu. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food, the preparation and the cost, especially since this place had been well-reviewed. I am giving two stars - 1/2 for the appetizer, 1/2 for the dessert and one for the very attentive service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

THe oysters were pretty good though. THe shrimp salad was ok, not enough shrimp. Dessert was really great...order the carrot cake! We only had wine, which was ok.. very short list.

"I want to give this place five stars. I found the deli during the fall season and I have been a fan ever since. Their hoagies are not just sandwiches, they are meals. My favorites are the American Italian and the Ave Maria. When I am not in the mood for tuna salad, I order the American Italian and vice versa. All was good and dandy until about July when I came in for a hoagie after being out of the country for a month or so. It appears that I am only meant to be a patron during the fall and winter months. After waiting for my Italian to be completed for maybe just 2 minutes, I had accumulated enough sweat to ruin my appetite. Why, you may ask? There was no air conditioning. Yes, that is right...on a 95 degree day, there was no air conditioning. After pitying my over heated body, I quickly realized that if I am suffering after just 2 minutes then the employees of this deli must be in excruciating pain. I asked the poor folk if the air conditioner was broken and they politely chuckled and said that the deli has no air conditioning. I began to laugh in a crazy way and said my goodbyes and went on my way. When I got into my car just a minute later, I opened my sandwich up because I was dying for Sarcone awesomeness. I then noticed that my provolone cheese was completely melted to the bread. You can imagine how confused I was as I did not order my sandwich to be heated in the oven and I watched them make my hoagie right before my eyes. What does this tell me? That the ingredients are sitting out in heat during the summer time. I ate the hoagie anyway, but I was not satisfied. I have not been back there since and I won't be back until the temperature drops. It is one thing to make your customers and employees sweat, but is a completely different thing to make your product suffer too.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Terrible terrible, terrible. We went for brunch for Mother's Day and were the second party in the door (we had reservations). They refused to sit us anywhere outside saying their seating chart was final. Our breakfast was overcooked...and cold. How you manage that when your day is just starting is beyond me. Completely and utterly unacceptable for their slightly higher than average prices. During our meal a few parties without reservations came in and were turned away. When we left, there were many, many, many tables outside that were still open. They could have easily seated us outside--not to mention, they could have generated some more revenue by accepting those walk-ins. I will never eat there again, and I'm pretty sure any of the folks who were turned away and saw how empty they were later won't be too pleased. ""Farina"", the manager was completely inept at trying to improve the situation. She appears to be very young, so perhaps someone with that little experience should not be in a leadership position.

Pretty much everything on the menu looks good and it was wonderfully suited to September.  We shared the watermelon salad, and it was smoky and steak-like - really cool. I normally only like my watermelon au naturel. My friend had the black bass, and I had a bite - would order that another time, even though I hardly ever order fish entrees in restaurants. The dessert was odd - I am a French PhD and was interested in the Far Breton cake, but it wasn't my thing.

"this place serves OBESE PEOPLE PORTIONS! that is what i said to my gf as we were seated at PYLOS. context...the tables on either side of us has enormous portions of entrees. it looked like one dish served enough chicken to rebuild two chickens...either that or the chickens were clients of Barry bond's pharmacy--BALCO! prior to PYLOS, i liked GREEK FOOD. post-PYLOS, i LOVE GREEK FOOD. as we entered the subtley shadowed/lit space. you enter a narrow curtained area that opens up to a long narrow eating space. orange clay pots (Grecian? I assume) compromise the ceiling...and give the restaurant a lowlit glow of earthy tones. one wall is lines with bottles of wine as you head further back into the restaurant, you will find the space lightens a little bit and house another row of tables along the walls---cushioned seating along one side of the table...chairs on the other side. this lighter area shows a very cozy West-Elmish touch--without the overly Asian-inspired design.  highly simplified and subtle sharpness (white with contrasts of really woody dark earthtones). very soft on the eyes and enticing. the back area of the eatery's space contains a slight  open look at the kitchen as well as a wine bar which patrons are allowed to order their meals at. i believe the hostess calls this the communal table, but it is hardly a table and more a wraparound bar space that you don't need reservations to be seated at. small space. great decor. modern romantic without the gushiness and that is still focused on the food... and then your paramour or dining companion.   after the femme and i were seated, i looked at our fellow diners and observed the aforementioned gi-normous portions of certain dishes. and yes while i called them ""obese people portions""---they looked and smelled absolutely marvelous! within minutes of being seated--we got appraoched by our server for drinks (wine only). service is quick, courteous and friendly. in fact, the server reccomended a light white wine (crisp pinot grigio clone) that douse the sober flames within me. right after, the Pylos version of free eats...some quality bread-y substances and an herbed chickpea puree were on the table for nibbles. the femme partook i did not as i wanted every inch of my stomach for inhalation of all that glorious food that surrounded us! onto to appz, we opted to share the haloumi--which is a sliced cheese deliciousness known as sauteed haloumi with some sort of grape/grappa reduction...so f'ing tasty. pre-eats are definitely big enough to share by a duo and some looked like they could be shared by a trio. we went for only one because we wanted to save room for the titanic main eatz. next up, the entrees---the femme went with a short braised ribs and i quacked up the braised duck breast. each came with a different kind of infused/essenced mashed potatoes. i savored  the duck and it was cooked/prepared perfectly. the taste was clean and just so satisfying. the accompanying flavors of thyme&honey as well as garlic mashed spuds made the dish a sight to devour. the gf's braised ribs which i partook a little of were not served in some prehistoric manner...but as delicatley as red meat can be served. the ribs melted in your mouth with ooziness of being fatty. the red wine sauce as well as the porcini mashed spuds made it a feast for the senses. thankfully because we didn't front-end our meals with appetizers--we were able to share a dessert without feeling like bloated balloons. i will say the sweets menu has something for eveyone. we shared the mouzo which is chocolate mousse with a shot of ouzo. sweet deliciousness without being too sweet. it is served in one of those 50s soda shop tall dessert glasses...we caffeined up with some greek java. and sadly had to bid adieu to the restaurant once the check came. the wait staff is youngish, fun, and informative. the servers areand a strong command of the menu and seem to deftly handle my dunderheaded q'z throughout the night. one of the desserts is called ""galaktobourekakia""--i our asked our waiter to pronounce and he did so without missing a beat...   i would highly reccomend making reservations for Pylos and it does book up rather quickly. there aren't a ton of table and the communal table/bar is a free-for-all. the energy of the place is constant---the symphony of spoons, forks, knives, lively conversations, the din of the kitchen, and the wait staff weaving about the busy eatery...makes for a night of great eats and more! the plus of this eatery is that they serve dinner relatively late (midnight or 1 am-ish), so you can totally make night plans and dine on fine fare like the gf and i did the menu has quite a bit of depth and breadth which means Pylos probably has a steady stream of repeat customers who are looking to try everything on the menu at least once...which explains the constant stream of people cominc in from the early hours to he latter end.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Worst Sandwich Ever  Eager for a new dining experience, my friends and I recently tried out Hawthorne.  Sadly, we were extremely disappointed.  From the get go, something seemed askew as we sat down and waited quite a long time before the waitress came to greet us and give us our menus.  If you are dining at the restaurant and want a beer, you have to go up to the coolers in the back, pick it out, and take it to the cash register to be added to your check.  The problem is that they do not have prices on the beer and so it's kind of a gamble.    There wasn't much variety on the menu, but I was willing to look past that.  Many of the items on the menu, however, are smaller portions and they suggest getting at least 2-3 plates.  For instance, a regular burger is not available at Hawthorne, only a ""baby"" burger- which comes in a set of premature twins.  Fries are extinct in Hawthorne land- only homemade chips or a few onion rings are possible sides.  Once we ordered, we waited an extremely long time for our food.  I was starving by the time my meal came out, which was served way ahead of my friend's meals.  Each meal was served separately and one item was forgotten completely, which added to the feeling that this place needs to get more organized.  I was so hungry that I gobbled up the homemade chips- which tasted like nothing.  My sandwich was burnt so badly that the bread it came on was literally black.  The mushrooms inside the sandwich were so hard, I could hardly bite through them.  The indeterminable sauce and cheese inside was just a greasy mess.  I gave up after one bite.    I felt more than a little ripped off after shelling out a combined $30 for dinner and still felt undernourished.  I rushed home to scrounge up any loose bits of chocolate that were hiding in my cabinets and stuffed my face along with some trail mix in order to erase the atrocities that had taken place in my mouth earlier at Hawthorne.  Too negative?  The fireplace was a nice touch.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cash Only! But everything on the menu is pretty cheap anyway. Dim Sum Garden offers a variety of dumplings and other dishes. Definitely try the pork soup dumplings. They are delicious, and the soup inside is probably the best I've had. You can probably skip the crab and pork soup dumpling, which is not as tasty as the original. There's also pan fried version of the pork soup dumplings that are interesting to try. Not much soup is retained within the dumpling, but it's good none the less. I was a little disappointed that thin ginger slices weren't provided to go along with the soup dumplings, but the vinegar and dumpling sauce made do. As for other items, the scallion pancakes were okay. It's a little more on the bland side and not enough scallions were used, but use some sauce and it's all good. The crispy noodle dishes were good. It's a little bland, likely because of the sauce used, but I kind of prefer it that way over the traditionally super salty versions I've had. The eggplant dish, on the other hand, was perfect. So... not bad. If I crave legit soup dumplings next time, looks like I'll have to travel 1.5 hours north.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went to Ani Ramen last night with my son. We went because my daughter raved about it. I thought, what's the big deal? They are only noodles. Well, was I mistaken. Is it wrong to love ramen this much! This was my first ramen experience and it was fantastic, from our server, amazing pork buns and ramen bowl. We ordered several appetizers and split a large bowl, wanted to get the full experience. We started with the pork buns from the menu which were tasty. Daniel, our server, advised we should also order the Shrimp Tempera Pork Bun special and boy are we glad we did. These little fluffy clouds of goodness were awesome. Nice balance of flavor, slightly spicy sauce worked well with the perfectly battered and prepared shrimp (2 in each bun). We also ordered the chicken wings, dry rub 7-spice had just enough heat (we like things spicy, so it may be too much for some) and the soy sauce wings worked well as a follow-up after the 7-spice. My only comment is to add one more 7-spice to order so you get 6 wings total instead of 5 (2 7-spice, 3 soy). For main course we shared No. 6 Ani Ramen with extra noodles (Daniel's advice again). I do not have a comparison to base my review on, but we really enjoyed this dish. Ample amount of noodles, broth, and veggies. Three nice sized pieces of pork which were very tender and flavorful. The both was perfect temperature and seasoned well. Lets just say we will be going back.

"I have been here several times. By far my favorite thing on the menu is the Brodetto (seafood soup in tomato broth), very tasty and surprisingly big portion size. Have also had the Crostini - the Parmesan  ""geleto"" is good, but my favorite one is the smoked trout. The trout is mixed with scallions and sour cream, really nice flavor. The insalata mista salad is delicious, good dressing and nice meal starter. I love veal, but the Petroniana veal dish is just so-so. I opt to get the truffle cream sauce on the side bc I would prefer a pink or marina sauce with it, but it's a little over-breaded and tough. I would skip the veal. Otherwise the place is nice, large tables, but it is loud. You may see the occasional celebrity, Jack Gyllenhal was sitting outside on the bench a few weeks ago and one time they were filming a TV interview in the restaurant.

I travel to NY a lot and was so happy to find this place for dinner. The cozy restaurant almost feels like being in a family kitchen. The food is simple and has that home cooked feel to it. I had the rotisserie chicken with ratatouille and potato salad all of which were simple and delicious. Topped it off with an apple tart which tasted great and the right amount of sweetness for me (I think I could have eaten 2 more). There is only one table to share but everybody else was getting takeout so I had it to myself at 8:30 PM.  A husband and wife own the place and I chatted with the wife and she was very friendly and courteous.  The husband was delivering food because the delivery biker did not show up.

"My wife and I recently dined at Buddakan to celebrate our anniversary. Needless to say, with all the great reviews on Yelp, which we normally find agreeable, our expectations were quite high for a great meal. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed.  The  tuna spring rolls and the chicken dumplings.  The spring rolls and dumplings were bland and for that matter nothing was very tasty or flavorful.   My wife was disappointed with meal as well.

"I found out about the 4/20 collaboration dinner with The Brooklyn Star at Serpico by following Peter Serpico on Instagram. He posted a preliminary menu and I was immediately sold so I went ahead and made reservations. We showed up and were warmly greeted and seated at the chef's counter.  Sitting at the chef's counter is always more fun than sitting at the table and this goes double at Serpico, with an open kitchen design there is always something to watch.   Our server found us and we ended up ordering a few drinks.  Menu started off with some chicharrones with homemade BBQ sauce, woah, this combo was ridiculously awesome.  I can't say enough about the sauce, you could put it on a show and I would eat it. Next came the Shaved Pig Head Salad, the Cornbread with Bacon and Jalapeno, the Bone Marrow, and the Marinated Squid Salad with Green Tomatoes and Herbs.  The salad was great and well balanced, the pig head was so good, the cornbread was unbelievable with the butter and honey that was served with it.  The jalapenos gave it just the right amount of heat.  The bone marrow was so tasty, it wasn't cooked too much to dry it out and the beet pickled onions that came with it were so fricking good.  The squid salad was a perfect play on sweet and sour and everything balanced out very well.   Next they brought out the Chicken Fried Steak with Country Gravy, Shrimp and Grits with a Soft Boiled Egg, a Meatloaf Sandwich with Texas Toast, and Braised Kale with Pig Tails and Tobasco.  The chicken fried steak was awesome and the gravy was the icing on the cake, it's so easy to mess up country gravy with too much pepper and/or salt and they were careful to avoid this.  The shrimp and grits were super interesting, this almost seemed like their southern take on ramen which was really cool, once everything was mixed up it was very tasty.  The meatloaf sandwich was so good, the texas toast was just thick and buttery, perfect, and the meatloaf which was outstanding was topped with mashed potatoes and some greens.  The braised kale had a bit of spice from the tobasco and had a very beefy porky taste from the oxtail and whatever it was braised in, extremely good.   We finished the nice with a big ol' piece of Pecan Pie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Bourbon Caramel.  This was so good as well, I mean the pecan pie was perfect and the ice cream and caramel were the perfect accompaniments. We ate every last piece.   This dinner was awesome and a bargain, it was $45 a person and we got 9 courses plus the chicharonnes.   It was a family style dinner so we were sharing plates but both of us were stuffed by the end.  We really hope that Serpico continues these bargain collab dinners in the future because we will probably be there for all of them.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Seeing this was the day I was driving back and forth from Greyhound to Bolt and Bolt to Greyhound I needed a little pick me up. Now a place called Yummy Yummy would be last  on my mind,  but I am happy I found this spot. This place may seem small, not that big inside but what lured me inside was that sweet smell. They have a menu that is very cheap, with a product that is full of flavors and delights. First if you like the smell of waffles than open that door and go in.. I ordered  some sesame balls, chocolate ones and also rocked out their green tee flavor.. Gotta say It was amazing! Their waffles are sweet  and popular, and there are soooo many different choices you can't just go with one. It takes a little time to prepare some of the items they got but it is worth the wait and the ladies try their best to describe what it is. The next time I go I gotta try their noodles have here, they look tasty as well with a side of radish cake. I hear its also very good and tasty !

"Worst pho I've had in my life. I ordered #27- pho dac biet with beef balls. When the lady brought out my food, I couldn't help but notice how small the bowl was, so I asked the lady, why is the bowl so small? She said that's the standard bowl size, even though it specifically says special BIG BOWL on the menu so I expect to get a somewhat big bowl if I'm paying $7.25. If you're gonna put ""special big bowl"" on your menu, then give me a big bowl. Don't give me a small bowl that's like half the size of an extra large bowl. And then she started to argue with me and raise her voice and I'm pretty sure she's the manager. SUPER unprofessional. Onto the food. I don't think I've had worse pho in my life. I really don't understand the good ratings for this place. The noodles were kinda thick and I HATE thick noodles. Pho noodles are supposed to be thin. The flavor of the meatballs were bland. And everything else was not memorable. It was just not good. I couldn't finish half the bowl. On top of the bad food, the waiter did such a crappy job checking up on me which made me even more mad.

"This place prolly doesn't need another review but I just love this place so much! We waited on line for about 30 mins but that's b/c the hoster will call to the line for smaller parties so if your party is smaller than 4, you might get a spot faster, but you have to listen for it. This place really does have great tasting pizza, but I'm just not sure of the price. My friend and I got the small regular pizza w/ pepperoni and sweet red peppers topping and we DEVOURED it. yelp.com/biz_photos/2ggi… But next time, we'll ask for more tomato sauce cuz there was hardly any. We got seated at the end of a long commune table which we thought at first would be bad but turned out to be very convenient so that we weren't sandwiched between two strangers. They were mostly male waiters when we were there and some of them put on this tough guy face. For example, we asked for more water, and this guy didn't respond verbally for acknowledgement, but he did come back w/ our waters, but it did leave us hanging for a bit on whether he pretended to not hear us and wondering if we should ask another waiter. but thankfully we didn't have to. There is one unisex bathroom and while waiting on line, you can chat w/ the guy who handles the brick oven pizza. That guy only let me take one pic of the oven, but didn't say a word to my friend when she took several, but my friend is italian and gorgeous so maybe that's why? lols We paid our check and headed out for dessert at The Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory located a few blocks down.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Vesta is actually one of the best brunches I've had so far in NY. I went twice for brunch, first time ordering the Warm Bankie (a truffle oil/polenta/fried egg delight), and the second time ordering the bowl of grains (grains, kale, scrambled eggs). Both were ridiculously delicious. The Bankie actually made me extremely full, and the grains were just satisfying enough. Most brunch items are priced between $10-13, which is totally fair, considering that some restaurants make you 1) wait 2) pay cash and 3) regret waiting and paying much more cash than you expected for such mediocre dishes. I also tried a bit of the L'Italiano which was also tasty and well balanced in flavor, as well as the bagel and lox-- though I've had better, I couldn't complain for the homemade factor. Capps are delicious (I think $3.5?), and as for the coffee, I wish was the mug was bigger, if not, then wished we had gotten a complementary refill.   Both times, I went on a Saturday between 12-1pm and never had to wait. The first time, service was exceptional. The second time we were a bit neglected but it simply seemed that they were understaffed. Vesta doesn't seem to fail, and one of the few restaurants we've been to more than once. I would love to see how well they do for dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I must be very forthright here.  This place surprised me in a few different ways. Full disclosure: 1.  I am a long time friend of one of the co-owners 2.  I generally don't like avocados or guacamole 3.  My first knee jerk reaction was to not like their uniquely flavored pickles 4.  I have only been to Brooklyn Commune once 5.  I did travel from NJ to get there, so I was a bit beside myself for spending the $8-$14.50 simply on tolls...  That being said, the prices for the food didn't phase me all that much. That all being put out of the way...  My family and I, I have a 5 year old daughter, and a 7 year old son, and a 30 something year old temptress as a partner/wife...   Before going, I was given a simple caveat: To avoid the rush...  ON THE WEEKENDS, AVOID THE MORNINGS...   If you want to see and be a part of ridiculous lines, I highly recommend the nearest Apple store before a product launch, and the Park Slope food coop, on a Sunday evening. Remember TPO, time, place and opportunity.  We arrived around 5 pm on a Sunday.  It was active, yet not as treacherous as a lot of the people talk about.  I got to meet the staff, and took a tour of the space...  It is quite cozy...  and to think it was formerly a laundromat, was quite impressive. Progress not perfection...  That is a saying I live by.  For the neighbors and the neighborhood, a save haven, and food spot like the Brooklyn Commune is really a home run. I ate everything pork...  Their BLT, and their pork sandwich.  Their open kitchen plan and most of the food made on the premise idea really struck me as 'back to home' good, quality and savory food.  The guacamole that was on both sandwiches really was a interesting compliment for the sandwiches.  (that is coming from a fella' who generally hates everything avocado).  Sadly they ran out of mac and cheese.  I will definitely keep this future meal on my to do list... Chris (one of the co-owners) and I talked about a future multi-cultural/multi-ethnic singles/dating event at the Brooklyn Commune...  (tentatively the idea is called, crackers, oreos and bananas) that will be an event, that you may want to attend... All the best to everyone who shops/eats/works/supplies the Brooklyn Commune...   My kids loved their ""pink stuff""...  (some grapefruit magic love potion).  Their cookies were also devoured in a few moments. In pork, pickles, magic pink love potion, and passion we trust...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We stumbled upon this place during our wondering around NYC.  When you're a tourist and a foodie, you want good food, reasonable since it's lunch and we're dropping $ on dinner and local, nothing I hate more than being surrounded by tourists, yes I can see the hypocrisy here. So here we were in the later afternoon, enjoying the quiet and air conditioning, being from SF we don't get much heat or humidity.  The service was great and friendly, our waitress took the time to explain the dishes we were interested in with great detail.   The food was great, we had the salad nicoise and I had the sandwich, both super fresh, great flavor and combinations of ingredients and balance of flavors.  We had the picked plate to start with which was a great way to get our appetite going.   It looked like they had some great wines on the menu and beers as well, I had a Stella to cool off.   My impression, this is a great neighborhood place, simple food that's healthy and tasty, great atmosphere for food or drinks and a great staff that enjoys what they do and where they do it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I would like to start with not giving a star to this place. A restaurant is not always all about food. It's a combination of Food, Ambiance and Good Service.  Out of which Cuban Pete does not even know the meaning of the word ' Customer Service'. The restaurant manager is doing his best to loose all clientele as quickly as possible. That's putting it mildly. He is the rudest, most un courteous manager that our group has ever had the misfortune to come across. And we go out to eat a lot.  The food has gone down in quality tremendously in the last 6 months. In fact it's more hit or miss. If you are lucky you might get good food or it could be very inedible. Your luck!  If the manager and the hostesses are in a good mood you might get some little service or you would be totally ignored. The place is dirty. The bathrooms are unhygienic and God knows what goes on in the kitchen. I would not advice anyone to go there even if its always full. The only reason it's full is because people want to go see and I can bet you that majority does not come back. I would rather recommend people to go to COSTENERA , another Cuban place just up the street. Food is awesome! Service is great and the Chef comes to your table for any special request. Not only that, prices are almost the same. So Don't waste your money at Cuban Pete!  Regards A Very Disappointed Client:(","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Look, when it comes to food, there can't be many people in New York City who are easier to please than I am.  I'm the guy who's impressed when someone cooks with an ""exotic"" ingredient such as a shallot or uses fresh herbs instead of dried and packaged.  My friends do consider me a ""foodie"" but I've mainly earned that title due to quantity consumed, not quality.  Basically, I'm just a fat guy.  If it tastes good, I like it.  I'm not concerned with fancy presentation, I don't believe in ""eating with your eyes first"", and I don't care what exotic preparation methods went in to creating some ""edible work of art"".  I eat out a lot, but I don't bother reviewing some of the higher-end restaurants on Yelp because I pretty much like everything. This is not true, however, when it comes to my standards in pizza.  There are pitiably few categories of life in which I am an expert, but when it comes to pizza, I am a goddamn connoisseur, monocle and all.  I've eaten more pizza in a year than the average person has seen in a lifetime, and bottom line is, Lombardi's serves one of the best pies in New York City, which is saying a lot.  The crust is thin, with the perfect balance between crispy- and chewy, a little charred and smokey from the fantastic coal oven.  The sauce is tangy and a little sweet, with the wilting basil adding its fresh flavor, and the cheese is bubbly, oozing deliciousness. This isn't one of the best pizzas in Glendale, Arizona.  New York is really known for 3 foods.  Bagels, Jewish Deli, and Pizza.  Pizza being the main thing.  I know I may come off as the typical snobbish New Yorker who believes his city is the best city and yadda yadda but it's not true.  I love NYC, but it doesn't have the best of everything.  It DOES however, have the best pizza.  I've had pizza all around the world (including Italy) and they've all fallen a bit short.  Maybe it really does have something to do with the water here, I don't know.   Some people have written Lombardi's off as a ""tourist trap"" but in my opinion that's lunacy.  When something has been around over 100 years, it's a piece of history, which of course will attract tourists.  But it had to be doing something right for the first 80 or so years to last that long, and Lombardi's hasn't changed a thing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ulivo was a delightful surprise.  A friend who lives in the neighborhood took two of us there for dinner on a Monday night - nice to find a restaurant open on Monday- and everything on the menu looked good.  We had salads and the Brussels sprouts to start.  The Caesar salad had a tad too much dressing, but the radicchio and Bibb lettuce salad was perfect.  The Brussels sprouts, cooked with balsamic and pancetta, were tiny and tender and tangy.  We all ordered the tagliatelle with pork-  rosemary ragu and shaved parmesan,  but all of the entrees looked tempting.  It was delicious, and for the dieter in the group they were kind enough to serve a half portion.  Prices are very reasonable, ranging from $14 for spaghetti alla carbonara to $23 for mahi.  A starter of garlic olives and spiced almonds is only $5.  Since it is a BYO, this makes for a very reasonably priced dinner in the city. The coffee drinks we had, lattes and and cappuccino, were delicious.  The service was informed, professional and friendly and we were never hurried.  The check did not arrive until we had clearly finished our coffees and conversation.  I heard it gets busy on the weekend, so first try a weekday night when you want a lovely meal that does not break the bank.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of the best pizzas I've ever had. Yes, the wait is long, but after waiting even longer at Sally's for much worse pizza, that puts it all in perspective for me. Be aware - the lines can be deceptive.  Pepe's line is longer, but they have a larger dining room and move through it much faster.  Sally's line in shorter, but once you're seated, you WILL still wait more than 2 hours for your pizza. We ordered a bacon and mushroom pizza.  The cheese was perfectly melted and seasoned, the crust was the perfect thickness (actually thinness), the mushrooms were, well just regular mushrooms, and the bacon was the perfect mix of crispy but with plenty of fatty grizzle left on it.  Badly cooked, over-crisped, rock solid bacon can easily ruin a pizza, but Pepe's clearly pays attention to details.

"Be Careful - 1 or 5 stars depending - Don't go when there is a big event at the reception hall.  We love the Pond House Cafe and their menu, but we went last evening while there was a wedding and we were treated like a second class customer.  The food was definitely not as good as usual (the Kale Salad was great, but the fish was done poorly (still ice cold in the middle - when sent back, it was done more but the $30 fillet had 4 bones in the first 4 bites and the side was cold because they didn't keep it warm while they were redoing the fish)).  Go during the week or when the hall does not have an event.  The difference is between 1 and 5 stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"
I came to Saleya for an after work outing and I absolutely loved it!! Happy hour is great here and they have delicious $5 pizza. They had a large space available upstairs for our large party. This place is very chic. The only con to this place is that they only had one bartender. When it got really crowded another bartender came in- he was Asian. He obviously didn't know what he was doing when taking orders. He also messed up our bills/ tabs. I can see myself coming here again because of their happy hour and pizza and also the space available upstairs.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Cast Iron Soul offers a delicious variety of soul food entrees and sides, with a little New Orleans kick. After two recent visits and a lot of plate sharing, I'm confident each dish they serve is cooked to perfection, including their seafood dishes. Each generous entree and every side is uniquely flavored, not one thing on the menu is served up bland and no two items taste alike. Rich flavors meld nicely together whatever your choices are. The meats are well prepared, never dried out and amazingly seasoned. They offer all of your soul food favorites... I was about to list everything that was good, just look at the menu, so far it has all been amazing. Both recent visits with different groups of friends has left everyone stuffed and impressed. They say don't judge a book by its cover, that's the truth. It may not look like much from the outside, but inside the family staff is welcoming and hospitable, happy to make your take-out or dine in meal an enjoyable and memorable experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Banh Mi Saigon consistently serves the best Vietnamese sandwiches in the city. I've had sandwiches from Paris Bakery and Vietnam Banh Mi So 1 and this is easily my favorite. I always order the number 1, the pork sandwich for $3.75. I usually order it spicy by asking for the hot green peppers on the side. The crispy caramelized pork they use is really special. It's a savory seasoned basted pork that clings to the crevices of your teeth. Even though the sandwiches are pre-bagged and ready to sell, the bread is still crusty and the cucumber spears snap when you bite in. I personally like the heft and crunch of the crusty bread, but some people prefer a softer baguette like they serve at Paris Cafe. The roof of your mouth will probably get scraped up after finishing a sandwich, but that doesn't stop you from eating potato chips. They have a $15 minimum delivery and they're fast. I live walking distance 20 mins and I get my food within a half hour. If you're worried that they'll sell out, you can call ahead and pick up.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I ordered the ""grilled lamb kabob with basmati rice"" which was delicious and my daughter ordered Penne Louise, for the simple fact that it had mushrooms.

"I have been to Pig and Khao twice, the first time I had the tasting menu and it was phenomenal. I liked it so much that when I had friends from LA in town I made a reservation to take them here. On a positive note, most of the food was great. We loved the coconut rice, green mango salad, and shan noodles. However, the service was so bad that I was embarassed that I brought my friends here. We were seated toward the front of the restaurant, and it was Memorial Day weekend, so perhaps our table was forgotten about, or it was a smaller staff-but we sat at our table for 20 minutes being ignored while waitresses passed us. It was clear that we needed to be helped, we had our menus closed and we had been there quite awhile. We finally flagged down the hostess who took our orders very quickly, was not very helpful with our questions, and it was clear she did not want to serve us. It took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, and once we had finished those no one came around to ask us if we wanted another. The entire experience we had no waiter or waitress and had to keep flagging people down to help us. In addition, the hostess (not waitress) told us that she recommended 5-7 dishes for 4 girls. We ordered 5 and thankfully did not order more. The portion sizes are way too big to recommend that many dishes, and we only finished half of our meal. I really want to love this restaurant, but there are too many choices in New York for me to consider going back, after my second experience there.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I work in Center City and know all the regular places in the area we head for lunches with clients, but I was recently tasked with finding a business lunch spot in University City. I have a few co-workers who went to Penn and Drexel and when I asked them for a recommendation, they all came back with this as the first choice.  Now a few days afterwards, I think it was a great choice. As a vegetarian, I always look for variety on the menu.  They had a tofu and quinoa dish, which could have been very lackluster, but most certainly was not. A few of the people I was with had the salmon and were also very pleased. Considering we were there at noon the week before Christmas, I was expecting: a)difficulty getting a reservation; b)some delay with service.  We got neither.  It was a totally pleasant and satisfying lunch experience, though maybe a little less formal in atmosphere than a lot of the Center City business lunch spots are.  But that's totally not a knock at the White Dog - just a fact of the neighborhood. Maybe the huge wooden menus were a bit off-putting, but I understand the charm of them. If I worked with more clients in University City, I would confidently bring them here. And if I ever decide to go on a personal dining trip outside of my own neighborhood/comfort zone, I would keep this in mind.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Audrey Claire is amazing. With amazing entrees, a simple but cozy ambiance and the best mussels Philadelphia has tasted, Audrey Claire can guarantee a wonderful evening. The service is top-notch as well; the waiters were knowledgeable, helpful and very friendly. I could go on at some length about the mussels - most restaurants neglect the sauce, choosing to restrict themselves to simply serving fresh mussels. The magic behind Audrey Claire's mussels is in the zesty tomato based soup that the mussels come with. Light but plentiful, the mussels make for ideal appetizers. We order two entrees - the penne arrabiata with the grilled tiger shrimp and the roast duck. The penne and shrimp were superb but the sauce stole the show again. It was similar to the soup that accompanied the mussels but that was hardly reason for complaint. The duck was less than perfect however, it was little too tough and a little too dry for our liking.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Pinto is another ""dime-a-dozen"" Americanized Thai restaurants, but stands out from the pack with its ultimate success in producing tasty dishes.  The space is tight, and the decor/atmosphere makes you wonder if you've stumbled into a trendy bar (a Mexican bar, specifically, considering the name above the door).  The menu features both traditional dishes, as well as some to suit the palates of the less adventurous or spice-friendly patrons.  On the recommendation of other Yelpers, we started with the crab cake.  It was quite tasty, but if you really want a crab cake, don't search out Pinto.  The entrees were basil chicken (called ""Ka Pow"" at most Thai restaurants) and green curry with shrimp.  Both dishes were flavorful, well spiced and offered significant portions (though the shrimp were slightly overcooked).  We finished our meal with beignets (effectively donuts) which, as non-Thai as you can get, were a great finale.  A definite repeat.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is the best banh mi in the East Village. Don't get me wrong, Nicky's is great, and Hanco's is still possibly the best; but V-Nam is now my local go-to banh mi joint. This is what puts V-Nam's banh mi over Nicky's: - The bread is perfectly baked. It's crispy but it doesn't crumble all over the place. - The ground pork has parts that are slightly overdone so it adds a firmer texture in contrast to the tender paté. - The cucumber is sliced thin, so it takes up more surface area without being overpowering. - They spread the pork evenly onto the bread. You don't end up with a sandwich that consists of one side pork and the other side carrots. - The service is great. The person at the counter was friendly and offered me water. - They accept credit cards. Phenomenal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is excellent! Very cool atmosphere, with unique touches here and there.  It is a small place; fits around 50 people.   We ordered drinks first.  I got the pink squirrel- which was fantastic.  I forgot what my fiance ordered but it was excellent.  It took several minute to make them which we appreciated because we know that we were getting a great drink.  We started off with the lobster cobb salad.  It was out of this world.  They mixed together avocado and wasabi (I think) and made it like a mousse.  They gave a very good portion of lobster meat on top.  We always share it was hard to this time ! Then for dinner my fiance ordered the Chicken pot pie.  He would never order something like this, nor eat it but since this was the talk about the restaurant he went for it.  He was blown away by it.  It came 10 inches high of a puffed pastry shell.  He poked it with his fork and got a facial with the steam released! The chicken was cooked just right and the vegetables were so tasty.   I ordered the duck-o boy! It was by far the best duck I ever had! It was seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. For dessert, we ordered the Belgium chocolate cake.  It was so delicious.  I know you are thinking how did we have room for this but 1- we can eat- and 2- the portions are just the right size- not too small and not ginormous- just right.   I had two drinks and the man had three.  So we had a FANTASTIC meal and were feeling very good at the end of the night!

"I'm Croatian and when I first heard a Serbian restaurant opened in Alphabet City, I knew I HAD to go check it out. Mind you, Manhattan has no restaurants specific to these cuisines (only in Astoria, Queens you will find some spots), - I'm from the Dalmatian Coast so yes, I grew up eating cuisine which is extremely similar to Italian loads of seafood, pasta, etc. However, there are no authentic Croatian or Serbian places and the cuisine from the ""mountains"" and ""in-land"" in Croatia and Serbia is different than the coastline, consisting of muchhh more meats and hearty foods. I couldn't wait to see what Kafana was about. I was not disappointed at all with my experience. The restaurant is small, but real cute and has a cozy atmosphere. There are brick walls decorated with old photos and things written in Cyrillic. I went with 2 friends and for the appetizers we got the cheese pie, roasted red peppers, and the complimentary bread with Ajvar (roasted red pepper spread). I absolutely loveeee Ajvar it was delicious and definitely brought me back to home in Croatia, it was great to be able to have it in a restaurant here in the city. For the main course, I ordered the special which was lamb that came with potatoes and chopped cabbage salad on the side. OMG IT WAS DELICIOUS! I recommend this dish to anyone if it is one of the specials on a day that they go. One friend ordered the peasant sausage and another ordered Cevapi - a traditional meal that you must try which is grilled minced meat. All of our dishes were extremely flavorful. For dessert, we had Palacinke or Crepes with Nutella, a very popular dessert from that region...soooo good! The staff all speak Serbian and have accents, I am fluent in Croatian so it was so nice to be able to speak to them in our languages, my 2 friends were real impressed. Overall, they were extremely sweet and attentive. We went on a Friday night and it was PACKED! During our stay, a small band performed that included an accordion, a guitar, and I can't remember the other instrument but they played traditional songs from several regions of former Yugoslavia. It was great I really felt like I was back home in Croatia. If youre from that area I recommend going because it will make you feel very much at home and comfortable.   Its cash only and beer and wine only but whatever. Also if youre a smoker you can smoke outside on the little patio which is convenient. I haven't gone back since but definitely will try and go soon!

"Don't book a party at this place.  The worst service we've ever had.  Booked a party for 50 people that was suppose to start at 1, nothing happened till 2 because the owner was to busy trying to make money at the bar.   When the food finally came out there weren't enough dishes for people to put their food on and when the trays were empty it took 15 minutes for more to come out and that was only after we told them, hey, where's the food.  By the way the owner and staff decided it was time for them to eat so they helped themselves right in the middle of our guests trying to get food. No one cleared the tables of dirty dishes so we stacked them ourselves.  Cake time came and that was another nightmare.  Eight slices at a time came out and all they did was put them on a table leaving the guests to serve themselves and standing around waiting for more to come out. No only is this guy a penny pincher but he def. doesn't know how to run a restaurant.  None of us will ever go back.  Lesson learned.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was in a fantastic mood arriving at this place - ready for a concert at the Wellmont, meeting my bestie whom I hadn't seen in ages and hungry for some great drinks and food. I was escorted to my seat by a very gracious hostess and decided to take in the scene while awaiting my friend. Well, the ambience and decor definitely lived up to the hype - fun, kitschy and relaxing. The polite servers are dressed in Guayabera shirts (sorry for spelling) and Panama hats. It's all very festive and entertaining and it's just around the corner from the theater. My server recommended his favorite Rojas and I have to tell you, it tasted like my grade school juice boxes. Was there even alcohol in this beverage? Tasty and sweet and a great value for a large pitcher of juice at $14.95, but certainly not going to knock any adult back on her heels. After my friend arrived, we excitedly ordered some yummy sounding tapas. What arrived, sadly, was Restaurant Depot quality frozen mozzarella triangles (they tasted like chicken, oddly), eh shrimp with burnt garlic, and dry and heavy albondigas with a white milky sauce that was unappealing and did not reflect its billing as ""manchego."" We hoped for better with our entrees, which actually were brought out about 2 minutes after our tapas, so we sent them back because who can eat that quickly and who wants 6 plates on their table at once? Our hopes were quickly dashed. My hanger steak was the right temperature (medium rare), but it was very chewy and required a ton of mouth work before swallowing each bite (translation = poor quality meat). The supposed chimichurri sauce (which is something I also make at home and for which I have received raves from native Peruvians) was simply diced onions and a few herbs. That is not chimichurri. My friend's chicken was partly burnt and partly undercooked. Her mango sauce featured 3 chunks of mango only. She opted instead for the pretty good black beans and coconut sticky rice. I know it sounds as if this was the worst meal I've ever eaten. Certainly, it wasn't. I ate my steak, because I was hungry and we ate the tapas for the most part, because we were hungry. The pricing is extremely fair, but I live in Manhattan, so I'm skewed. The restaurant is just terribly underwhelming and inauthentic, especially considering the hype over this restaurant. The end of the evening was the most disappointing of all. When I tried to get by the hostess stand, I had to wait for literally 20 people to walk by first (the stand is awkwardly placed near the kitchen). Then, the male manager started dancing and joking around and greeting others in front of him, all the while blocking my exit. I said excuse me twice and then finally said loudly, ""Sir, I've been waiting 3 full minutes to get out of here. My friend is waiting for me in the courtyard!"" He said, ""all you had to do was say excuse me, b*tch."" I don't care where you are or who you are, no one in any service industry should be calling his clients the B word, especially when he was the one at fault, not me. All in all, a very disappointing culinary experience. I won't be back for anything other than a quick beer at the bar with friends.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've never eaten at any of the Eataly restaurants within the supermarket, so this review is mainly for the supermarket itself.  First, the focaccia is awesome, oh my god.  I went on a 3 month kick where I ate their focaccia nearly everyday...yeah, I'm not ashamed.  It's that good.  The classic one is great, pizza is so good, and the prosciutto cotto one is fantastic.  Any of them really, all great.   I've heard good things about their gelato, but I'm not about to stand in line for 30 minutes for dessert anytime soon, so who knows.  I will say, the espresso bar they have near the gelato is really great and very authentic.   As for the rest of the store, it's OK.  Their produce is good, but overpriced, so I rarely come here unless I want a specialty item.  Also, most of their food is not organic (or at least I haven't noticed much organic produce, maybe that's changed).  Their house-made mozzarella is really, really good though!  I'd recommend it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I literally joined Yelp to specifically say how bad this place is, and I went here once before a little under a year ago and it was great, good cocktails, jay-z playing and a fun atmosphere.  But I had a horrible dinner experience here last weekend.  I was a walkin with my girlfriend, and we were definitely one of the last tables to sit down.  But the hostess gave us a really nice table in the back, a couch-type table that was big. She was actually the best thing about our meal, Rebecca I think? Really welcoming and friendly.   For food, everything was giant, all of these huge heavy dishes in mid-summer (risotto, chicken, duck, meatballs, etc)....compensating for anything Harold?? Service was ok, our server was a really nice and jolly guy but after we had to send our food back twice (raw duck) and complained that the cocktails were terrible (hair in one of them), our server first told us that the sous chef was in the kitchen, and that the food usually isn't as good when he is there.....Then he said that HE understood we were having a lousy time and he is trying to leave there because it's such a crappy place to work!  Thanks for the honesty but wow. Then on the way out we asked for the manager and some half-drunk girl got up from the bar (yes, from the bar with purple teeth) with her lacky next to her, some little guy, and half-glazed over they both listened to us tell tham that the food was horrible and that our server basically told us he was quitting. The little guy clearly has never had to deal with a guest issue before, he was stuttering like some manager-in-training, and the girl was just staring over our shoulder at her food and wine sitting at the bar like some hungry cow (she was in a moo-moo.....).  I would never go back here, why would I want to drop over $200 on a place with a server that wants to leave, managers that don't know what they are doing, and crappy food?  What a fall from grace this place.

"The falafel is the freshest you'll find in America. I believe these are mixed fava/chickpea (often Egyptians use straight Fava) but there are plenty of fresh herbs and when you crack open a patty it's nice and moist and green. I get the normal falafel sandwich, sometimes i get it with hummus instead of tahina (crack) but I don't like the meat dishes. I need yogurt or garlic sauce to cut the fat of a shwarma, tahinas not enough. It's too buttery. The falafel in bread is in perfect harmony however, the falafel warm and crunchy, with cool lettuce & tomato and buttery tahina giving your mouth the moisture it so desperately needs to appreciate good falafel. This interior hasn't changed. Ever. My dad first took me here when I was a kid...""an old Client from the bilad."" Wullah? Mabsut. Too bad Mamoun wasn't around to reminisce. The downside to amazing falafel open late is that this closet-sized shop gets PACKED OUT every night when the weather's warm. It's cheap, filling and vegetarian, what's not to like? I mean the guys speaking Telegu in line obviously can't survive on 4th street dosas alone... Also they have delicious Arabic Mint Tea! It gives you the perfectly refreshing hint of mint for your post-fat-feast cigarette palate purge without being oppressive like an actual Menthol Cigarette. Just use caution with the Hot Sauce.

The peppers and cucumbers were pretty refreshing, but be aware that some of peppers are spicy! Hot pepper roulette, but it's not too bad. Those hirata pork buns though! UNREAL.

"I mean, I get it....the food is inventive, they bring you little treats to try before your meal but I have a few gripes. 1. If you are going to have people pay for a nice meal, try sitting them more than 6"" from other tables, I had to ask to move because I felt like I was literally having dinner with the couple next to us. For the price...think people should have a little bitta elbow room. 2. Every dish except for a few on the menu (apps and entrees) had some sort of meat in them. I had to get scallops for the second time in a row because the cod dinner had all these meat sides. Oh wait, I could have gotten brusselsprouts and mash in beer, but...no thanks. That being said, the scallops are declicious, the sticky rice is perfectly sticky and the frazzles (or something) they serve in the beginning are delicious! Also, great water glasses---nice thick rim, sturdy, but not overwhelming.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So big plans to take my boyfriends nephew to Six Flags last Thursday didn't work out because of the rain.   We can't go to the park if the coasters aren't running right!?!? So we are in Jersey and my boyfriend says .. lets just go have pizza at Lombardi's in NYC.  Man what a cool idea! At this time my all time favorite pizza was a Margarita gotten on the Champs Elysees in Paris served with a lovely spicy oil on tables.  My favorite local pie is at Rocco's in Exton (its a brick oven pepperoni pie with fresh basil added at the end).  Other then that, I find most pies are just not that memorable for me. Some have good cheese or good sauce or good crust.  Very few can get the whole package down, at least to my taste. Well this place is now in the category of my personal favorites!  There is a reason to keep a coal oven for a 105 years!   Simple and perfect tastes.   Just wonderful!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have to say that I am VERY picky when it comes to macarons.  I have baked them and tried them coast to coast and also abroad.  So I think I know what I like and don't like in a macaron. A lot of places pass off crappy wannabe macaroons as macarons.   Anywho, I have been WAITING for Laduree to come to NYC!   I had to wait in line...in the rain..I am ashamed to say I was waiting along with the tourists for more than 30 minutes. I HAD to get a lot because I waited for awhile!  So I bought 15 macarons which comes out to be $45.  Yes $45.  Its cheaper than a ticket to Paris, oui? The cookie crust itself was made to perfection, crispy, flaky, hollow cookie made to the correct size. Raspberry--yummo, the jam filling was perfect Pistachio--eh ordinary Chocolate--delicious it was like a piece of chocolate in your mouth Coffee--it was like coffee in your hand Rose--my least favorite it tasted like cheap cream Violet--also one of my favorite, it was lavender and other flavors i never tasted Orange Blossom--my favorite! there were so much fragrant flavors in this cookie Vanilla--ordinary. Randoms: They're actually real French people working there, it's probably part of the import authentic French macarons with the people. Do not go during the weekend. You can get those macaron towers within two hours of order as told by Mr. French guy. The boxes cost more money....but supposedly done by a designer or something like that.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It's quite a loud atmosphere in this hidden little gem which is located so close to the main tourist trap of NYC. Oh em gee! The chicken skin? It doesn't get too much better than that. The skin is the best part of almost any animal. At Sake Bar Hagi, it's excellent. MMmmmm.... And the octopus balls? Well... you wont find more tender and juicy balls than the ones here - I liked the non-fried ones more. The avocado salad? It's like half an avocado served with a side of salad. YUUM. Win! The patrons here are definitely on the rowdier side.* The space is also lacking in moving air. It was ridiculously hot in there! Our little group had come just for the chicken skin, but we were informed that we had to order at least $10 per person. Luckily, our little group didn't even finish the food that we had ordered, so they let us slide this time. But it's good to know for future reference. ------ * Can anyone explain to me why one of the tables near us had a huge container of parmesan cheese sitting on their table?

"We went to La Carreta for lunch but it was closed. So we went there again for dinner, and fortunately, after a long trudge, we finally sat around a table. The restaurant is located in a residential area, quiet and peaceful, with an obscure deep green signboard. It was not convenient to get there, and there were few customers in (to be more exact, zero before we entered). The environment had nothing special, in comparison with other Mexican restaurants. There were small decorations like a picture of a Mexican man. Not much use of bright colors, and the whole room and the furniture looked a little bit old. There were only four tables in it. I guess they possibly provide more delivery service. The kitchen is the main part of the restaurant, and they didn't seem very used to providing table service. We had to ask for silverware, and they only had paper napkins. There were three or four people working in the restaurant, most of time they were cooking food, except that one of them would run out if the customer had any need. We could see pictures of dishes on the wall, and they were extremely useful to foreigners like me and my roommates. The menu was a piece of paper, convenient and easy to understand. I took one, hoping to learn the complex names of Mexican dishes. Haha... It took about 15 minutes until all our dishes were served. Not fast, in my opinion. We had 5 people and we ordered: Chicken Burritos, Beef Burritos. Chicken Quesadillas, Enchiladas and Vegetarian Tacos. Burritos were in an American style, as one of my friends commented, but they tasted good. I found beans, cheese, cabbage and chicken in the fillings, and I liked them all. Quesadillas was soft, and had a strong taste of cheese. Another friend felt that the cheese was not Mexican - the orange color signaled it was likely cheddar cheese. Enchiladas were too sweet and not spicy enough. Vegetarian Tacos was full of vegetables and looked healthy. The flour tortillas served with the tacos did not taste extremely fresh. Maybe they were purchased and stored rather than made in the restaurant. We also ordered Mexico-made sodas. Different flavors, different colors, the right sweetness, made with real sugar, a nice change from normal soda menus. The price was relatively low, and the portion was big. We spent about $9 per person, including tips. I only managed to finish half of my burritos. In conclusion, though the meal was authentic as we expected, they tasted not bad and at least worth the money we paid. The environment and service were barely satisfactory.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Saturday night dinner and it wasn't too crowded.  No reservations, and we walked right in at 7:30 pm.  It was homey, it was sort of loud, but it was nice. Most things seemed on the vegetarian side - there were some options with meat, but I opted for risotto with butternut squash and veggies (read - cauliflower). It was tasty - might have been cooked sliiiiiiiiightly longer, but I ate as much as I could.  The chicken pot pie across from me looked good as well - I like the idea of putting nontraditional vegetables in it.

"The Goat Cheese Nevat is to die for! Duck and ribs are worth writing home about I usually order those and fill in the blanks with selections from whomever else is dining suggests or what is on the specials menu. The food is amazing I have never ordered anything from the menu I wouldn't want again. One negative would be the waitstaff is extremely helpful to the point where they hover. You have to cut them off with the water refills or you leave feeling like a bloated tick. In my experience their mixed drinks leave much to be desired, pass on the Jalapeno Mojito! They are pricey, take way too long to made & last time i checked all tasted similar. Don't waste your money, chose something from their wine list instead! Another factor to consider... the crowd is a bunch of baby boomers  or middle age-rs, who think the place is cool because of the decor and that their friends think its cool.  Unless you are wearing an outfit out of a J.Crew catalog you may feel out of place. Here's the good news... it is one of the few places in Hamden you could visit without risking getting a drink spilled on you by a fist-pumping Quinnipiac student who had had one too many!

When I called the bakery, they said they had the cake sitting right there, and they FORGOT to deliver it! Unacceptable! Don't take the order if you can't bother with remembering to actually give it to your customers! All they offered me was a refund on the delivery fee!

"Ok somebody has to say it. Those who gave this Thai restaurant anything more than 2 stars apparently has never been to Thailand nor tried authentic Thai food (or were just piss drunk when they ate the food). I am of the opinion that if you never traveled to a foreign country and tasted their food, you really shouldn't share your views on Yelp. You guys are just skewing the ratings system. Really, the food here is at best mediocre. Service, well, they managed to screw up my order every time I go. So at least they are consistent. I know, there are so many garbage Asian ""restaurants"" in Manhattan it is hard for those who has never been to Asia to tell the good ones from the bad. So I am going to help you guys out a bit since so many of you can't tell the difference between good and bad Asian food. Often, these restaurants' food has the same quality as McDonald's, but these ""restaurants"" have better furniture and are much more overpriced. I don't know why but you Manhattanites somehow love that combination (ie crappy food, nice decor, and an overpriced menu). As a general rule, you can tell an Asian restaurant has terrible food and is just trying to sell you an image (and not the quality of their food) when you see one or more of the below: 1) Hip, trendy music playing at the restaurant. 2) No (or very few) Asian patrons. Maybe one of two who are just mostly hanging out with their unfortunate non-Asian friends who are about to get ripped off with overpriced and mediocre food, but no groups of Asians (and come on, guys. This is a dead give away. If you haven't figure this one out already then god help you. As a general rule we Asians have a better idea where good Asian food is so you might want to follow us on this one instead of Tom and Dick from Ohio). 3) Food served on over-sized square plates. 4) Over-the-top Buddhism/Hinduism decor. 5) Strong smell of garlic (chef can't cook so he drenched everything in garlic, oil, and MSG and just fried it). For better and authentic Thai food try Jaiya (was there many yrs ago not sure how good they are now) or that little Thai restaurant in Woodside, Queens (right off the 7 train line). Totally forgot the name. Think it starts with an ""S"". Or befriend someone from Thailand and ask them where they go to get good Thai food. And stop messing up Yelp's rating system.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The good: The food here was delicious, and the portions were generous. They also have a great gluten-free selection, which is rare for an Italian place. I'm not personally gluten free but a lot of my friends are. Their chocolate cake for dessert was also delicious, and my table received a complimentary piece to share because we had to wait a very long time for a table. The place is also a BYO, is relatively cheap, and yet still has a much classier atmosphere than the typical BYOs crowded with rowdy college students. The bad: The layout of this restaurant needs serious help. It's impossible to stand and wait for  a table without getting in the way of diners, waiters, and other customers trying to get in the door. The process of asking for a table and waiting was stressful and uncomfortable. We were a party of 3 on a Monday night, and didn't have reservations, so I really recommend reserving a table for this restaurant no matter the day of the week or the size of your party. However, it does seem like they were slammed more than normal on this particular night. They were also extremely understaffed. One poor waiter was responsible for playing the role of hostess, call taker, waiter, and busboy, and there was only one of him. There were some other waitstaff but the hostess should've just been responsible for one thing. Although service wasn't great, I think the staff were frazzled for that unfamiliar Monday rush and I do think they are nice staff members overall. The waiter did bring us complimentary dessert which certainly helped their case. Overall, this is a great spot to try, but make sure you reserve ahead.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Must have: fried soft shell crab, gyoza, miso black cod, any of the tonsoku dishes, and there was a cold tuna dish that was kind of like a tartare that I can't find right now on their menu. One dish that I wasn't particularly impressed with was their chicken wings, just way too salty.  Oh yeah, their mochi ice cream dessert was a good choice and great way to finish off the menu. Another thing that stood out here was how cheap their bottles of wine are.  Unfortunately they have a very limited selection, but if there's a bottle you like, you won't be paying much for it. All in after tax and tip we dropped around $130 I think, not bad when you consider there's a bottle of wine in there and we were incredibly stuffed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to Il Pittore for the first time last Friday, and I am so ecstatically pleased!  Though I usually take myself out to Parc for a treat, I'd been meaning to check out the new kid on the Stephen Starr block...so here's my review: PreCourse: Bread Prior to my ordering, I was brought a basket of fresh, hot bread, simple and delicious.  The two rosemary pieces were particularly good, and the unsalted butter, with salt sprinkled on by hand, was an excellent move.  I always prefer unsalted, so this was the best of both worlds, and I appreciated that attention to detail. Course 1: Contorni - Winter Squash Agrodolce This was my first agrodolce of any kind - any I've never been a fan of the sweet & sour one experiences with some Asian fare - but this was sublime.  Bright, buttery, bold, and the squash was tender without being mushy!  My palette was tuned, I guessed correctly that it was a butternut squash.  I was informed they've used acorn squash before, which I would enjoy.  Also a good idea: try using kabocha! Course 2: Antipasti - Aragosta e Carciofo I've never had such succulent, perfectly poached lobster.  The claws, in particular, were melt-in-your-mouth good.  The artichoke puree was slightly hard to get on the fork, but otherwise a good foil for the lobster, and the pistachio accent worked well.  I appreciated the micro-greens, but they were a little hard to get on the fork as well.  Perhaps a smaller, salad fork? Course 3: Dessert - Napoleon I almost don't know what to say, this was so good.  From first bite, I had my hand to my mouth in disbelief at the awesome yumminess - just ask my waiter, John, who saw this response from across the room.  The salty-caramel-banana nuggets, layers of mousse and cream, amidst some sort of buttery, flat, pastry medium...possibly the best dessert I've ever had.  No small feat.  I remarked to waiter John that I'd like to take another Napoleon home with me, but I had to draw the line somewhere. Drinks: 1. The Fall of Rum - Flor de Cana Anejo Rum, All Spice Dram, Fresh Lemon Juice, Honey Syrup - really, a perfect drink for me. 2. Buona Vita - Vecchia Romagna Brandy, Combier Cherry, Fresh Lemon Juice, Simple, Angostura Bitters - tasted a little too much like cloves for my liking. Staff: Manager Michael Scibilia was gracious and the consummate professional, and John was a most attentive and warm server, and anticipated my needs.  The other waitstaff were just as attentive, I was given fresh plating and silverware for each course, and an eye was always kept on my water glass. Ambience: Warm, medium-lit, and moderate volume (depending on the surrounding guests).  I requested a table with a good view of the restaurant bustle, and I was pleased. My Only Qualm: Higher price, smaller portions.  It would be easier to go more frequently if the cost was reduced.  But otherwise, this is what a gourmet meal should be - slow, satisfying but not stuffing, and covering all the bases in the most delicious way possible.   I am super-satisfied with my first meal there, and I look forward to my next!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Originally my idea was to go to Essex for Sunday brunch, but they didn't have any tables to accommodate 5 people on Opentable, so we came here expecting about a 30-45 minute wait as they didn't take reservations. Getting out of the subway on 8th (Q) and walking throw the East Village, I couldn't help but fall in love with the little shops and boutiques I stumbled across on my journey here.  That alone put me in a good mood for brunch.  Upon arriving, I stepped inside and had to wait about 3-5 minutes before even being greeted.  I deduced which person was the hostess and patiently waited as I saw she was busy.  She did originally tell me it would be 15-20 minutes for the wait, but as we all know, that turned into 45; c'est la guerre. As we waited our friends started drifting in from the market in the park across the street and from their trek downtown.  The wait wasn't so bad, but I was definitely hungry by the time we were seated. Once we were seated inside, I could barely hear my friends over the cacophony of conversation drifting from all the other tables.  You would think people with probable hangovers, sipping brunch cocktails and eating would be a little quieter.  *shrugs*  Anyways, I was completely happy with my order of the churrasco and eggs.  Although it wasn't he best steak I've ever had, it was mouth-watering and tasted just like I'd expect.  They even cooked it a perfect medium rare, the only sensible way to go.   In addition to your brunch selection you get a cocktail of choice: mimosa, bloody mary, or screwdriver.  I just had orange juice instead, as my hangover was just about over with and I didn't want to mess with it.   For $13.50, a southern bistro atmosphere, cocktail, steak, and great company, how can you go wrong?  The only issue we had was the waitress forgot my friend's coffee, but that's negligible at this point.  I loved everything else, and certainly would come back here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Six of us left Eataly walking up 5th Avenue and stumbled on LuLu & Me Gastrobar. It just opened and there were only a couple of tables occupied for dinner. But it's a very pretty, cozy place, and we've enjoyed Gastrobars in Europe, so we gave it a shot. What a pleasant surprise! First, the wine and beer selections are as good as we've seen in Manhattan - and very reasonably priced. The food was excellent. The owners were very welcoming and the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. And our bill including drinks, beer & 3 bottles of  wine was under $100 per couple. Wow, what a find! I heartily recommend it and will definitely return.","[0.0, 1.0]"

From a true Brooklyn guy this is the hands down best pizza youll find anywhere. Dont go in there and order slices. Get a big sheet of squares its amazing. They literally melt in your mouth like no place youve ever been. The restaurant side has good food. they can actually make garlic and oil and alfredo instead of making tasteless pots of oil.

"My family has been coming here for years and will continue. King of Shish Kabab offers amazing Middle Eastern cuisine for a good price. We usually get takeout, so it's been a while since I've dined in house, but from what I remember the place is quite small. Nonetheless, the food is delicious, particularly their hummus and baba ghanoush. It is always so creamy and flavorful, and puts the crappy supermarket hummus to shame. Their falafels are also great as well. I'm always excited to see my dad come home with a bag full of hummus, falafel, and baba ghanoush from this place. It's delicious!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here after touring nearby Liberty Bell and Independence Hall with my team of 9 peeps. On a bit of a time crunch, tired and starving - our grumpy group requested philly cheesesteaks, a must for all our initial visits to Philly. Sonny's came up on yelp and was in walking distance. About a 5-10min walk. Beautiful day. Passed by other interesting eateries, we were on a mission. It was either Sonny's or Campos but we all chose Sonny's. Campos was just down the block. IT WAS A GREAT DECISION because it was so damn delicious. My lactose intolerance as of late has been steadily worsening and so I had a plain steak combo (includes fries+drink for ~$10). I had low hopes for the cheesesteaks without cheese but man oh man was it still amazing. The bread rolls were light, fluffy and the perfect density to soak up the grease of your thin sliced, fresh meat and onions. You are able to order it without onions as well. Those that enjoyed theirs with cheese (both wiz and provolone) also all thoroughly enjoyed theirs. Fries were amazing. Go heavy on the spicy mustard and you'll leave very content. Since then, we had tried out Pat's one of the many but one of the more famous cheesesteak eateries - which ended up with across the board disappointments from everybody in our 9 person group. We all still talk, dream and fantasize about our return to Sonny's. Which we fully intend to fulfill before we leave the area in early June. Come check this place out if you can! Awesome T-shirts here too :D","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food here is good, and the baked goods are always fresh. Their dinner menu is a good size and is pretty varied. The cod fritters were amazing, the artichoke salad is fresh & delicious and for the entree I'm a bigger fan of their pasta than their meat dishes.

"I've been to this place several times with friends and always liked it, but I hadn't been for several years until my grandma just invited me out to dinner. We went on a Sunday night expecting it to be empty, but there was about a 30 minute wait. They were so kind though, and seated us right away because they realized my grandma couldn't stand for that long. Despite the crowd, they had great service. We had the most delicious watermelon mojitos, and the half pitcher was more than enough for the 2 of us. We got some empanadas and goat cheese fritters for our appetizers, both delicious although it took a while to get them. Then our main courses came shortly after, and were AMAZING. I got a whole fried red snapper, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Each came with hearty sides of rice, beans, plantains, and yucca. Needless to say, we were too full for dessert but wished we could try it, because I'm sure it would have been nothing short of excellent.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Also the dinner was meh.. I had the lobster roll and my husband had the burger.

"It was a twenty wait for a Friday dinner (6pm). Not sure if this is the norm, but from the horror stories I was expecting at least an hour (my tolerance was half hour tops). Or perhaps it's just the lunch hour that's awful. Regardless, our party of five was seated on the second floor, which was pretty barren when we walked up, further making me question how this place gets so packed and why there needs to be a wait if there's sufficient space. Having researched the venue before going, I was originally intending on trying the Manly Burger, but ended up going with the Truffle Speciale Burger, with a side of Irish Truffle fries. What can I say? I'm a sucker for specials. Food came pretty fast cause well, they're burgers. The burger was.... pretty darn tasty. The meat was cooked to perfection, the Parmesan crisp gave it a nice crunch, and the fried egg was a perfect sunny side up. There's just something magical about a fried egg in a burger. My only qualm is that the burger was loaded with so much grease/oil that it was impossible to eat without a napkin to wipe my hands after each bite. There's also an aftertaste of truffle that lingers long after the meal. The Irish Truffle fries I enjoyed quite a bit as well. I mean how can you go wrong with fries, cheese and bacon? They offer a variety of sauces to complement their fries, but I think the fries are perfectly fine without them. Best burger I've ever had? Don't think so, but it's still pretty good. I think the place is worth visiting, but I wouldn't wait more than an hour for this. The food is also on the pricier end of burgers so it's not something I could see myself coming back to often, but I know I'll be back at some point. I don't think the food lives up to the hype as being best burger (Shake Shack!), but it's still worth a trip if you're interested in trying out the food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE. It's the concept similar to Smorgasburg where restaurants set up small stands and serve awesome items. The best part is, this is closer than trekking to Brooklyn and it's open every day 11-9, all summer! I was so glad I discovered it. I've been multiple times and am always trying something new. Everything has been good - I've sampled tacos from Brooklyn Taco Co (avocado and chorizo). I've had meatballs from the meatball place. I've had the ice cream sandwiches (today they had a special snickerdoodle that was awesome). I had sliders made with pulled pork and one with burnt chili brisket. I had a pulled pork egg roll. I had some awesome empanadas. Everything was great. But by far, the best is the Arancini Bros pesto rice ball. Fried ball of rice stuffed with homemade fresh basil pesto and cheese. Awesome. Amazing. I could eat it every day. It does get pricy, just like anything else that offers small items like this. But it's a great place to snack and try one or two things.

"I used to only have ramen once a year because of an incident in college... but everything changed once I was introduced to Totto Ramen. I just couldn't get enough! Now you probably already knew this, but the whole process to getting into the restaurant is some serious business. The line for Totto is often insane and if you want any hope of not waiting for what it seems like eternity during your lunch break, you better do what we do at my company. I always had a coworker run in and out around 11 am the day of and put our names down on the list at 11:15 so we could be first/second/third on the sheet. Then we'd all leave our office at exactly 11:55 to be there by noon and voila, no waiting time! It's weird but I feel like such a celebrity walking past all of the people who have to wait a while while standing outside in the elements. Once inside, you'll either sit at the bar or a table. Tables are usually for groups of 2 or 4, bar is for odd numbers. I actually enjoy sitting at the bar because you then get to see the kitchen at work stirring the gigantic pot of broth constantly, torching the fatty pork bits, preparing the ramen bowls and whatever else they do back there. It increases the anticipation and causes the saliva to flow freely. The kitchen delivers pretty fast. I'd say within 10 minutes you'll receive your piping hot bowl of noodles. I loveeeeeeeeeee the spicy ramen with pork and always add seasoned avocado to it. The broth just has such depth and flavor to it whereas at other places I felt like I'm just slurping on MSG water. The chunks of fatty pork are tender and juicy. The avocado oh my GOD the avocado! I don't know what makes it seasoned but whatever it is, I am hooked for life. Oh and if you don't like ramen, don't worry. There are other items on the menu to satisfy you crazy people. Trust me. Yeah, I'll definitely be back once the temperature drops...

This morning my wife and I went to Bella's for their great breakfast/brunch meal. (which has become a Sunday routine for us) However over the last 4 weeks we have noticed a high turnover in staff. As a result the quality of service has severly declined. Most noticable is with the Hostess, who seems disorganized and scattered resulting in frustrated customers. In addition I had ordered the Salmon omlette, which up until this point was my first and favorite meal since dining at Bella's. However on this experience my meal was brought to me cold, half cooked and with a different bread than what was requested. When I asked for the omlette to be fully cooked it came back luke warm at best with the excuse that raw/partially cooked salmon is the way this meal is prepared. My frustration is that this type of service and quality is becoming routine and standard, something we did not experience when first dining here. Bella's PLEASE look into this I would hate to have to change my favorite Sunday treat.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went in for a Sunday brunch, the wait was about 30 minutes. Very very crowded and the tables are quite close to each other. Nonetheless, good atmosphere - I think breakfast time will be somewhat of a different scene, with less people - something I'd like to try. I had the Short Rib Hash, since it is their best dish from what I've heard.. and it is. Simply amazing!! From the first bite I knew I would be returning to Cafe Cluny very shortly... I'm not a big eater so my portions are small, but this dish I DEVOURED.. I ordered the Mimosa and it was good too. Although quite expensive (I think $12). My friend got the Grilled shrimp salad and it was descent. I can't wait to come back for another plate of Short Rib Hash. It is a MUST. Do NOT leave without trying it!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A visit to The Strand with my California surfer-dude brother raised his estimate of New York's cool factor by a hundred points. The atmosphere is sleek and hip, but inviting. We felt welcome as the staff led us past the chic 30-somethings crowding around the bar to a table in what reminded me of a big living room with tall fireplace, huge aquarium, and book shelves set high on the wall. A larger, darker room with well-spaced tables lies beyond that. The menu leans toward fresh, tasty, clean dishes that will appeal to kids as well as adults--essential in a hotel, where this bistro is located. My favorite part of a meal is dessert, so I'll skip to that. The coconut panna cotta with lime-scented pineapple was outstanding. I learned that lime zest (in addition to juice) is what gives the tangy flavor to tiny cubes of fruit atop the silky panna cotta. The mango coulis beneath it was a nice idea, but there wasn't enough to taste. Cheesecake spring roll was terrific too, but the miniature caramelized apple crescents with it were bland. Overall, it was great fun. Go for the interesting food and you'll be rewarded with friendly service in a setting that's unexpectedly elegant for 37th Street. A real find in Midtown.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Coming from Orange County, visiting Philadelphia, obviously it would be sin NOT to try an authentic Philly Cheesesteak.  That and the hell I would catch from everyone, because the first question anybody would ask is how were the philly cheesesteaks!?!?!   Anyways,  so there are two places that are must trys, Geno's and well of course Pat's.  They've been featured on TV, and the locals all have an opinion about which is the best.  Conveniently, they are across the street from each other, so instead of making the hard decision to try one or the other, try both.   Geno's and Pat's are the complete opposites on the outside.  Geno's looking super flashy with lights and vibrant colors, where as Pat's seems a little more hole in the wall. However, being the ""newbie"" that I am, I was scolded by one of the Pat's employees for showing my Geno's sub, while ordering my Pat's one.  So beware.  Also!!! the correct way of ordering is dependent on the type of cheese you order and if you want onions or not.  ie.  the classic would be ""Whiz"" aka. cheese whiz, and if you want onions, ""with,""  I got a ""Whiz with"" at both places. Immediately, it was obvious that Pat's looked more substantial and well more appetizing.  While, both were very similar, I believe Pat's took the cake with this one.  Pat's seemed to have more steak and better bread, and the ""whiz"" seemed to taste better and more substantial.  I also order a side of fries, which were better than most fast food fries, but nothing to write home about either. All and all, if you're in Philly, might as well try the best, even if you don't enjoy it.  You will probably experience food coma afterwards, since to be honest they are a pretty hefty/heavy meal.  So, if you're on a diet, perhaps come with other people and share.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Could be nice for a date- they have outdoor seating and when inside the restaurant it doesn't feel like a pizzeria.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If LaVa After Dark were a horse, I would shoot it to put it out of its misery. As one of many people who visit LaVa Cafe on a frequent basis, I can't say enough about how toxic this failed endeavor has been for our beloved cafe. I have been going to LaVa pretty regularly for the last two years. It is a cozy, comfortable cafe. You can get a cup of coffee, and if you're there at lunch or dinner, even get a good meal. The staff is great and it feels like one big family. And, as a cafe, it's 5 stars. Heck, I'd give it 6 if I could. But, if you're there at 5:15 on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday - you become the enemy. Yes, it's true. LaVa After Dark is ruining LaVa Cafe. 5:15 is about the time when an angry woman makes the announcement that all the ""studiers"" need to vacate. There's nothing worse than being ordered to pack up your stuff and head back to your apartment where your roommate is blasting ""Dark Side of the Moon"" on full blast in his room on a Thursday after getting off his job making sandwiches at WaWa. Well, I suppose there is. You could be lumped into a demographic based on your possession of a laptop at a coffee shop and then persecuted for it by a shrill unloved shrew - just when you're about to buy another latte! No $3.50 for you, LaVa! After getting a drink with friends at Ten Stone, I walked by LaVa After Dark on my way home just to give it a disdainful stare. And, suddenly, I was overcome by sadness. No, I wasn't pushed out of my go-to cafe for the one-percenters to have their precious candle-lit meal. No, this BYO wasn't filled with rambunctious college kids eager to have a place where they could bring their PBR tall cans and chat. I was pushed out of LaVa Cafe so LaVa After Dark could then proceed to...sit empty. Yes, not a soul to be found! So empty for so long that the staff had congregated and chatted idly, most likely about how big someone's miscalculation had been. And that miscalculation was big. Really big. I mean, when the $3.50 I would have spent on my latte would have made the needle move for the place, you know it's bad. I'm not sure who did such a poor job in the conception of LAD. Poor marketing. Poor menu. Poor communication with its hordes of loyal patrons. But, suddenly I understood that woman's frustration. LAD is failing. You see, that wasn't the only night I've seen this place empty. I walk by it every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night on my way to Good Karma Cafe, which has become my new go-to spot, and the place is always empty. Really empty. Hear a pin drop empty. So, LAD, I weep for you. When you decide to open your doors again as LaVa Cafe and welcome us ""studiers"" back with open arms, I'll forgive you. Really. We all make mistakes, and LAD is a doozie. Until then, I'll just have to find some place that doesn't push me out into the cold at 5:15 on a Thursday night. The blustery, merciless cold - into the arms of another coffee shop. We had something, LaVa, we really did. Then, suddenly, I wasn't good enough for you anymore. Enjoy your empty candle lit room as a tear falls into your cold cappuccino. If you look up hoping to see me, I won't be there.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I am appalled by the treatment I just received at City Tap House! It took over 15 minutes for one of the four bartenders working to even acknowledge my friends and I at a not overly-crowded bar. When the bartender finally did come over she stared at us and we said we wanted the beer special. She grunted for ID's and balked when my friend handed her her Spanish ID, as she was from Spain. The bartender insisted that she show her passport, which my friend of course does not carry with her. The policy of needing to see passports is unfair to anyone who wasn't born in the US, which on Penn's campus is many students. That aside, instead of simply informing us of the policy, which is inconsistent between days, the bartender barked at my friend to get away from the bar because she didn't have an American ID. Later, the same bartender raced across the bar when she saw that another of my friends was drinking a glass of wine. She ran up to us and insisted on seeing her ID, embarrassing her in a large group. While she was looking in her purse, the bartender said ""you guys aren't even 21 (untrue) and shouldn't be in here."" Appalled and infuriated, we decided to just leave. The service is terrible. The treatment of guests is terrible and quite frankly, inexcusable. No one should bother going here. There are plenty of places nearby with excellent beer (Local 44, Dock Street) and better food (The Farmacy, Honest Tom's, Mood Cafe) and Chipotle has better customer service. Trust me. Save your money. Go elsewhere. As far as Penn bars go, enjoy a nice cup of gelato and a spiked cider or milkshake at Capogiro right down stairs. You'll have a much better experience. I for one will never set foot in Tap House again.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"When I saw the menu on Thrillist, I knew that this was the kind of food my partner loved -- simple old-fashioned non-trendy French bourgeois fare.   Three of us went for Brunch on Sunday and loved it; we all had terrific oysters to start, followed by either Steak Tartare (for 2 of us) and Mussles Mariniere (for the 3rd).  All were excellent; great flavor and a really good value for the price.  Our waiter couldn't have been nicer, and recommended an excellent reasonably priced French wine. We will definitely be going back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We actually stumbled on this gem by looking on yelp.  I can not say enough positive things about this place.  Had we discovered it at the beginning of our trip we may have eaten all of our meals there.   The staff was on top of everything.  I had read a few reviews saying that you will never run out of water and it's true.  It was almost like the guy that was refilling the water glasses was on a mission that he could not fail.  Every time I took a sip he topped me off. I had also read another review that said to try the olives.  I didn't see olives on the menu and didn't order anything with olives so I almost didn't ask for any.  If you are a fan of olives, ask for a side of them.  They are some of the best olives I have ever had. I ate everything on my plate and then some.  I had the meal with mozzarella and egg plant and my boyfriend ate the chicken and sausage meal.  If we weren't adults (and it was socially acceptable) we totally would have picked up our plates and licked them... and even so I am amazed that we didn't actually do that. If you are in the area and looking for an inexpensive, delicious meal (that will change the way you look at Olive Garden forever), this place is mandatory.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Pros - Food is good. I ordered the chicken pai thai and my friend order the beef pad see you. It was super delicious. It is very cheap as well. The waiteress is nice and gave us water refill.

The host was an a--hole because I asked him like only 2 times like every 30 mins how much longer do we need to wait. In the beginning, he said only 30 mins when we came in so we waited then time passed and he gave US an attitude for asking a general question. He was like you ALREADY asked  10 times...I was like @__@ this is my 2nd time and what's up with the attitude. I believe in customer service so if I'M THE CUSTOMER I should have the right to ask a question and HOPE for a proper attitude. Unfortunately, the restaurant was closing at 11pm and we were seated at 10:15pm. That gives us only half an hour to eat. Very disappointed!!!

"This is a cute restaurant but there was a lot of construction noise outside, which was drowned out by the indoor sound. The menu had a lot of selections, but the service was very very slow.

We ordered nachos, which were very tasty, and ordered tacos and sandwiches as a quick option. The nachos came out quickly, but after 45 minutes passed, we were still without food. Our waiter never checked on our table or noticed that we had not received our orders. Another employee walked by and we asked for our food. No food came. We then asked for it to be boxed, and he seemed put off by this comment. 10 minutes later, our food arrived in boxes and no comp on the receipt (we did get a drink voucher, but would I come back?). The sandwich was soggy. Not worth the wait. Perhaps I would try again as others had a good experience, but our business was not appreciated.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"To be honest any new restaurant in town with home-cooked, loved food is welcomed in my book. What I love about this place is the different angle of a menu, bringing home Jersey favorites like funnel cakes!

"Can only comment on the management and not much else, because they refused to serve me - why?

Yes - it's true.  Why? They don't sit ""partial parties"" and so once my wife was done eating, she (and I)  would need to leave so others that were waiting could take the table. Yes - you heard correctly - they refused to allow me to join my wife and order food - REFUSED!. But wasn't I also a customer? I thought I was. When I asked to speak to the manager she said - yes - that was their policy.  THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO JOIN MY WIFE AND ORDER FOOD, even though she was at a table and in the middle of eating  - This is true.  So I left, my wife quickly finished her food and joined me in another restaurant.

"I like Big Wong.  After reading about it on Chowhound I figured I'd give it a try, I wasn't about to walk into just any Chinese restaurant down in Chinatown.  I followed the advice from other reviewers and only ordered what you could see in the window which is mainly pork and duck. I've been twice and both times ordered the roast pork and congee and it was different each time.  The first time I went the pork was warm and served over rice with a drizzle of some sort of sauce akin Chinese BBQ sauce.  The second time I went the pork was bordering on cold (yet still delicious in its own right) and served in a heaping pile, I had to ask for a bowl of rice. Each time I ordered the congee it was different too, I like plain congee, there is something so comforting about it.  I also like to get it with Big Wong's mixture of ginger and scallion, it's a bit of heat but it dresses up the congee so nicely.  The second time I went though and asked for the ginger/scallion mixture I was presented with a small bowl of dry chopped scallions and a small bowl of raw ginger threads, not what I had asked for.  But since I know I was probably misunderstood and it wasn't going to really cost me in the end I figured I'd leave it at that. So if you're looking for consistency, be warned. But if you're looking for a satisfying meal of roast pork and rice give it a try!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had the sea bass, hubs had the sirloin with Senegalese spices, friend had the filet mignon, and for dessert, we had the profiteroles and the chocolate fondant. Everyone thought their dishes were an 7-9 out of 10, there was also a decent amount of vegetarian options. We did not try any martinis, although the selection was very inventive. Dessert was only okay - relative to the other food it was nothing special. I would definitely come back here again, and also try PB for lunch or brunch.

"This is honestly one of my favorite restaurants/cafe. I always always always order the Milanese panini. It's soooooooo good. I'm carving one as I'm typing this. I love the pesto sauce, the tomatoes, the chicken cutlet, the panini bread, and everything (even though I've listed everything in the panini, including the panini itself). I honestly suggest you to try the Milanese. It's small for $5 but it's so delicious, it's worth it. I've tried the dessert with nutella (sorry, I forgot its name). It is delicious. It's $1, kind of small, but so good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"About as good of an Irish pub as you can ask for. Probably the best Guinness I've had poured in NYC (from an Irish bartender no less).

"Came here with a friend from out of town for some pizza based on a recommendation from one of my good friends who lives in the city.  They sell both slices and pies, and the slices they serve are decently sized.  We went with the margherita and artichoke, which they heated up for us.  Both were quite good, with thin crispy crusts.  The artichoke pizza was on the heavier side with a white creamy sauce, but we couldn't NOT try the namesake slice!  It's kind of pricey for a slice though (ranging from $4 to $4.50 for a single slice) with some other non-pizza options on the menu.  I'm no pizza snob, and would be just as happy downing a $1 slice at some pizza place down the street.  As long as its hot, cheesy, with a thin crust, I'm happy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The only con is it's hard to get in, you need to make reservations well in advance, but you won't be disappointed.

"Ok. So I'll qualify this review by saying I do not eat pork. After a 0.5 mile walk through a very sketchy neighborhood from the train, I observed a sidewalk of restaurant spillage and veered right to observe the tiniest eatery known to man. Traif is packed, LOUD, hot and VERY small.  I'm 5'9 and my date was considerably taller so we painfully squeezed ourselves into the preschool seating in front of us.  I was excited by the turn out and decided to order a combo of six small plates, all seafood. Traif has some of the most creative cuisine that I've ever come across. The food was decent but I'd stay away from the butterfish carpaccio. The shrimp dishes were lovely and I really enjoyed the fried calamari. I think I'd definitely go back but try my hand at the seared scallops. That seemed to be a favorite.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was there in Aroma Royal Thai RT27 Franklin Park with my friends on Wednesday night for dinner the job of a food reviewer is to accurately convey the tastes, textures, smells, presentation and enjoy ability of food eaten at a restaurant. You not only comment on the food but also on the atmosphere, staff knowledge and attentiveness, the way the staff treats you and respects the other customers, the speed of service, the general impression of the restaurant or cafe. It's not a job for anyone squeamish and you won't necessarily be liked by a number of people in the restaurant trade but you can command respect and abeyance if you do a fair and well reasoned job in your write-ups and the way you treat them back.

The buffet luncheon was generous and reasonably priced (under $25 per person in a private room). Many people went back for seconds--I'd say that means the food was good!

"Date Visited: March 14th People: Megan My tab: ~$55 Somehow I've forgotten to review this place in all the half dozen times I've been. It's too bad, because it probably would have gotten 4 stars on my previous visits. Unfortunately Chang stopped making his house version of a cabonated nigori sake. Instead I settled for 2 glasses of sho chiku bai. Megan and I ordered a squid salad with mizuna, ginger scallion, and these cool little ?radishes?  that looked like mini watermelons. Very pretty. Next we had a pork tortelloni: surprisingly great pasta (like at Ko), as well as a yellowtail collar (megan's favorite) on special. It's always great. our last course was a very filling grilled pork shoulder, cut in little strips, and served with some sort of radish, and a cumin yogert for dipping. All in all, pretty good meal, I miss the actual Ssam...the lettuce wraps, as well as the chipotle-style korean burritos they had for lunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

All the items I have tried have been amazing and the service is equally as warm, proficient and pleasant. My favorite part of the experience is the decor and kids room. While I sip my coffee in the largest, coolest mugs I have seen in a while, my 4 year daughter gets to play in the kids room with the train set and chaulk board.

"Love that they have live (jazz.swing) music, very nice and clean cafe, friendly smiling staff, delicious Italian dishes. You will truly enjoy the environment the food and the music. I see comments about their name, what is wrong with ""GoodFellas""? Just look at the decor and the atmosphere of the cafe, it's not as cheesy as you may imagine. Have you watched the Mafia movies? I hear Every Guy in the world is supposedly in love with them? lol, They reference it constantly, the quotations the scenes... It is elegant inside and the decor is definitely something to talk about, it has a nice mood inside especially with the jazzy tunes in the background, and you may also sit outside on the warm days, if the gangster movies are at all disturbing to you. What I was appalled with, was the lack of respect to the musicians. Has everyone lost their good upbringing? I would expect that more from teens, than mature adults, but maybe I need to go back in time, when people actually listened to music and applauded when the song was over. No class these days, I swear. I guess the heads would roll if anyone showed a little respect and appreciation. It's so sad, I see that more and more, guys not taking their hats off inside, people not saying excuse me when they bump into someone... what is happening to this world. I hate it. Not many people say thank you either, they just ""expect"" everything. Whatever happened to being polite? :{","[1.0, 0.0]"
"People talk about Carmine's from miles and miles away. Everytime I tell people I am going to the city, they tell me to try Carmine's. I have been told about Carmine's by at least a dozen people over the course of several years. Here's the only problem. I've already been to Carmine's, and I don't particularly enjoy it here.....at all. So the concept is great right, family style dining - whats not to like about it. It gives you a cozy, family feel to your dining experience, and gives you the chance to share dishes - without feeling like you are stealing the other person's entire dinner, because there is plenty to share! Maybe the problem is I come from an Italian family, and we can make this stuff ourself - but the food doesn't taste authentic - it tastes processed. The sauce even tasted burnt....and burnt sauce......not an appealing flavor. There just was no spark, no magic - nothing was great....and some things were just plain not good. Not enough flavor, seasoning, or innovation to make it worth going back. However, plus side - dessert. Carmine's - your Tiramisu has a lot of good stuff going on. For me though, it's not enough good stuff to get me to walk back through the door.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We (a party of 4) ate at this restaurant last night, a Saturday, and the experience was literally deafening.  We were surrounded by five tables of people whose sole objective appeared to be to scream louder than anyone else at the their table or the ones nearby.  The maitre d' (or owner?) came to the table next to ours to greet some customers (one of the loudest of the tables) and they were standing over our table and were talking so noisily that we actually had to ask them to quiet down.  On the way out, the maitre d' (owner) didn't apologize but explained that the restaurant was noisy because there was a full house.  As for the food, some of the plates were enjoyable but I had ordered the grouper special, one of the more expensive items on the menu, and found it to be overcooked and underspiced.  Maybe we're getting too old and the younger generation needs to holler their lungs out to enjoy themselves, but if you're looking for a place to enjoy a good meal and have a conversation without having to shout down your neighbors, I'd certainly give this restaurant a pass.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I had my first Restaurant Week experience at Tinto, which appeared to me a fantastic opportunity to sample their assortment of tapas. At $35 per person, my lovely lady and I each enjoyed two first courses, two second courses and a dessert, making for a total of ten different platas pequeñas gracing our table. The food ranged from very good to oh-my-god that's amazing. Very good were the arugula, fig and gorgonzola salad and the rich moules basquaise; soon, we'd be swept off our feet by tender beef brochettes and a serrano ham-wrapped duck confit that made me almost fall out of my chair. We doubled our bill with our alcohol, but good wine and Caipirinhas make the splurge almost a requirement. Our server Brianna was professional and knowledgable, and earned a good tip. We would have gone for a bigger table, but it's Restaurant Week so I was just happy to get a seat at all. I'm looking forward to going back when the full menu is available, because our first visit was nothing short of phenomenal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You'll get twice as much stuffing for your burrito.

"My boyfriend took me here last year before heading to a show. On the outside, it looked like any other midtown restaurant. Inside, my preconceived notions melted away as we were greeted by an friendly staff and even friendlier food. The dining room was decorated modestly and the enclosed wine racks took center stage. We began our meal with the bread, bruschetta and olives that are standard. We also ordered a dish to start, which consisted of grilled eggplant, goat cheese, arugula and basil. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli of the day (which happened to be lobster) as his entree and I ordered a chicken dish with speck and fontina. Both meals were cooked and prepared well.

I've never had a bad meal in all the many years we've been going to Heaven.  Their food is very good, drinks are yummy and maybe Gail shouldn't be smoking so much...I say that with concern for her health.  I've never, ever seen her drinking and, if she was as a few have stated, maybe she was thirsty (a normal thing) and quite possibly the drink did NOT contain alcohol.  So, we should not judge based on our own assumptions without really knowing.  It's just nasty if you're doing that over the age of 16!!! So, the food is good.  It's a great place and if you question the cleanliness of the kitchen, you can go through the take out door and you're practically standing right in the middle of the kitchen.  It's in full view.  Pretty hectic place when busy so it's not spic and span....much like my kitchen at Thanksgiving.   While we're enjoying our delicious food tonight from Jalapeno Heaven, I hope you enjoy yours, as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I went to have dinner with my friends last night and I was really impressed. At first, I was a little bit confused due to the complex menu but then I found out that it is a ""cocina de author"" restaurant. The waitress was very helpful explaining the menu for us. As an appetizer, we had the black ant guacamole and we were very surprised when we realized that the salt used was made of real ants but it was really good. I had the crispy duck dumplings and they were exquisite along with the mayan god remedy cocktail which was a little bit sweet but tasted so good!! (this was recommended by the waitress) she was so right! The music was a little bit loud and the lights were dark but maybe it's part of the restaurant's concept. Two of my friends ordered the short ribs and they were delighted. For dessert we got to share the churros and the special dessert of the night that it was a winter sundae which was a pumpkin and chongos ice-cream with brownie at the bottom. We finished it all with the desire of coming back soon. I highly recommend Black Ant Mexican Restaurant!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Man-about-town @KingRex (follow him on Twitter) organized a wine dinner for 6 of us back in late November, which was my first visit to this surprisingly under-the-radar new French-ish BYOB in the FIshtown area of Philly. A very small but quite interesting menu which we ordered from a la carte (no tasting menu option, but with such a small menu it wouldn't make sense): 1) Moules frites, with saffron, mustard and white wine ($12) -- I can never pass up moules frites--this reminded me of dining alone al fresco in Brugge--and almost a meal in itself 2) Seared foie gras, celery root puree, seedless rye bread, caraway jelly ($18) -- straightforward, classic preparation with a good sized piece of foie and some interesting flavors 3) Grilled brace of quail, Swiss chard, foie gras, mushroom risotto ($23) -- DOTN, outstanding, with a wonderful char, and it looked like a 4-legged mutant from Chernobyl (I mean that in a good way) sitting splayed on the plate (see photo) 4) Apple cake, buttermilk cardamom ice cream, caramel sauce ($6) --  Probably the least interesting dish, a bit dry, but tasty enough (and I was stuffed by this point anyway and should probably have skipped dessert) Recommend getting bottled water for the table, since they have the worst chlorinated tap water I've ever had in Philly.  They really need to invest in a charcoal filter.

Quite attractive inside (I particularly love the brass heron door knob!), with lots of space between tables (~50 seats), it was less than 1/3 full on a Tuesday evening and so pretty quite. Todd & Daniela, the Husband/Wife (or Boyfriend/Girlfriend?) who own the place were very charming and accommodating, and also gave us a complementary amuse-bouche of grilled heart from a 250-pound whole pig they had just got in (served with pickled kohlrabi, a delicacy which is normally reserved for their chef friends). Counting after tax 20% tip, $78. I'm surprised that this place doesn't get a lot more press. Perhaps it's the location. I gather they can be quite busy on the weekends, but I hope more people support them during the week, since this is the sort of place Philly really needs to keep around.

"The food was great (I had duck breast), but my experience with the service was unpleasant at best, especially due to the host. From the start he made us feel like he thought we probably couldn't afford to eat at Hudson Clearwater (we are both 24). We didn't have a reservation so he told us we could only sit at the chef's table--which we were totally cool with--but there were 3 or 4 empty tables the whole time we were there, and we weren't allowed to sit at one. I tried to sit catty-corner from my boyfriend at the chef's table so that I could face him, but I was asked to move back to my original seat (there was no one around us). A couple near us asked if the window could be closed because one of them was getting over the flu, the host said ""ehhh I'll ask."" It was never closed while we were there. Like I said, the food was great, but I felt the staff was unaccommodating and unwelcoming.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Their brunch menu has something for everyone and coming from the same Chef as Ela - it doesn't disappoint!  I'm also partial to this place because it is one of the few bottomless brunch spots in town but beware that they significantly water down the drinks after 1 or 2 rounds.   I didn't enjoy their bar snacks which were heavy and over priced.  I'll be sticking to The Gaslight for brunch.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Didnt eat here but came instead for the whiskey selection.  I like that this place has 1 ounce pours, it makes it easier to try a bunch of different whiskeys and then you can always get a normal 2 ounce pour if you like something.  Most 1 ounce pours are in the $3-$5 range, which is a decent price since they are high end whiskeys.  Its a cool looking spot as well, definitely worth checking out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Tried out Paeson's a couple weeks ago.  They were friendly and welcoming but that's besides the point.   My buddy and I decided to grab a couple of their sandwiches to try for the first time.  I called ahead and ordered.  When I stopped in to pick them up they offered free drinks with each sandwich and decided to not charge for extra's like cheese add ons. We split two sandwiches to see how they were.   The Paesano : slow roasted beef, sweet & sour cabbage, perrancino and natural jus.   It was very good.  Their bread is wonderful too.   The other choice was the one that had me in bliss.  The Gustaio: roasted lamb sausage, sun dried cherry mustardo, gorgonzola and roasted fennel.  WOW, this one I fell in love with.  It was more a wrap, which was fine by me.  The flavors were really kicking and a bit spicy.  I cant wait to try this one again.

"Surprisingly there are not that many places in Montclair for breakfast on a Saturday. You would think that with the 101 restaurants in the area - there would be a ton of places that serve breakfast, but no sir. I think there are a total of three that I could find - one being Plum. And since I already tried one (that I wasn't that crazy for) we decided to check this place out. The place is a lot smaller than I thought and the menu that they show outside on the window is not necessarily the menu you will get when you sit down. Yes, I know, strange. As far as the food is concerned, it's okay - not the best. I got the spinach, avocado, and jack omelet. The spinach wasn't cooked and the omelet itself was a bit oily. Other than that, it was good. It comes with homefries and toast. One thing I like is the jam that comes with the toast, not sure if it is homemade, but it's very tasty. I don't like homefries, so I didn't even eat them (sorry). Not sure if I would rush back...I think I am ready to try the next and probably last restaurant on the list of breakfast places in Montclair. If you know of any good place....please please let me know. I am dying to find a GOOD stop for after Yoga.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I considered giving Clinton Street Baking Company 4 stars because of the subpar hostess job, but I didn't think it was fair to the best fried chicken and pancakes I've ever had! Went here with some co-workers for the first time a few months ago and I've been back two times already with my wife.  The fried chicken platter is simply amazing.  Delicious, moist, fried-golden and A LOT OF IT.  Cole slaw is nothing to gawk about, but still yummy.  Pancakes and waffles or crispy and fluffy, a combo rarely seen.  The pre-meal biscuits are also to die for - ask for jelly/jam, because it doesn't come with! The only bad part about this restaurant is/was the hostess.  Two times I've been here with my wife and her table hierarchy always baffles me.  First time we were clearly there before two other couples and both of them got seated before us.  When I asked, she said that they were here before us, which was BS.  Second time there were again 2 other couples, making a  total of 3.  Two, 2-person tables opened up and we were all pretty much fighting for who got the tables because she gave them to the first person standing there (not the first person who made reservations). Nevertheless, the food is just too good, and I didn't think it would be right to give it anything less than 5 stars.  Will be going back soon.  Prices are reasonable.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Very mediocre -- food and service.  Decor and ""vibe"" are good, but that doesn't cut it.  There are too many other restaurants downtown that serve delicious Italian food, I wouldn't bother with this one.  I'm surprised there is still a  buzz around it and that we had to wait 30 minutes for a table on a Monday night with an 8:30 reservation.  Aside from that, the service started out with our waitress bringing a bottle of wine after our appetizers had been served and it turned out to be the wrong vintage.  I hate it when restaurants try to pull that switch-a-roo on you.  Patrons, beware of this trick.  They will bring you a wine of a lesser vintage and charge you the same amount as the menu price for the better vintage.  Then, the food was so lack-luster, from appetizers straight through to dessert, that I had to fill up on the olive bread.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Salute was excellent. Reservations a must and so is the garlic bread. I dined here last night with 2 friends. I arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes ahead of our reservation with friend 1 and the host/hostess recommended we get drinks in the bar before sitting down since it was happy hour. How nice! so we did just that! Once friend 2 arrived and she got a drink we went back to the hostess booth and were seated promptly. Our waiter arrived to fill the water glasses and asked if we were seeing a show and to boast about the garlic bread. He also asked if we were seeing a show so he could move our order through quickly, which he did. We all started with a different salad followed by a pasta dish. The Rose Pasta was excellent. The waiter was really accommodating to special request for 2 of the 3 pastas that were ordered. Splitting the bill was no problem. Since we didn't have time for dessert (even though our waiter gave a good speech about the desserts and we were really tempted) our waiter gave us a to-go bag of biscotti for our walk across the park. It was wonderful. We can't wait to go back and try other dishes! If you are seeing a show at the Bushnell on the same night you dine in Salute you get 10% off your bill :)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been here a few times though last night was by far the best experience. We arrived early as we had  an opening to attend. We were seated at a nice table in the dining room where the ambiance is warm and inviting if a little dark. We ordered, I guess, family style with the intent of sharing each dish. We had two crostini - ricotta and a crabmeat one - which were both fantastic. The ricotta was rich and creamy and the crabmeat was delicate though spiced with a razor thin slice of jalapeno that gave it a crunchy kick. Yum. We had baby kale green salad as well as a bitter green salad which were both tasty. Two pastas which I didn't try but my friends devoured them. Two sides - brussels sprouts with pancetta and cheese and broccoli rabe. Desserts included a chestnut (?) chocolate cake, a lemon tart with some ridiculously delicious gelato (buttermilk I think) and an apple tart-like thing. Wines by the glass and after dinner drinks were all carefully chosen and delish. Service was friendly and fantastic.  A very fun night and one of the bets mealsI have had in Manhattan in a long time.

We were I a rush so we didn't get appetizers. We ordered the pork tacos and I got the burger of the brunch menu.

This rating is mostly based on the food. The ambience is comfy and relaxing; a good place to grab a drink and then go. The food is very bland - pretty mediocre overall. I came here for the $5.95 lunch special (sounded like a great deal!) and ordered the cheese/jalapeno tamale and chicken taco...nothing seemed very seasoned and there was a complete lack of spice throughout each item.

"Broccolino is an excellent choice if you are headed to the Barclay Center. Although the food was very good, I found the claustrophobic seating and sky high prices enough of a turn off to prevent a return visit. Diners are seated on uncomfortable folding chairs at long tables about 6 across. This means that if you are in the middle and need to use the restroom, you need to squeeze past several other guests, interrupting their meal. If you lucky enough to be seated on the end (as I was), you will have the pleasure of getting your back knocked into, or having to get up every few minutes so other guests can  be seated or use the restroom. For the prices Broccolino is charging, this type of distraction while dining is unacceptable. The outdoor area seemed nice, but as the weather cools, I can only imagine how much more crowded the indoor dining room will feel once the close the huge garage door that is open to the sidewalk. It was also difficult to have a conversation with the other members of my party because it was loud and I didn't want to scream across the table being so close to strangers. If you are looking for an intimate, romantic dinner, or want to catch up with friends, you should look elsewhere. There are plenty of other good choices in this area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Taking the time out of my Birthday- will not go back I have never given a bad review for a restaurant, specially on my Birthday. We decided on going to Buttermilk because of all of the reviews. Pros: My gin cocktail was good. Cons Food: Over priced Chicken! We order the Chicken & Waffles $25 a plate, and of course cornbread along with two drinks. We got our plates, which had three big pieces of chicken HALF a waffle, coleslaw and a little cup with maple syrup. The corn bread was dry ad had no flavor. The Chicken was flavorless as well and RAW, yes raw. I waived down what appeared to be the manager and informed her that my chicken was raw. She didn't apologize at all and just said ok. She went and showed it to our server who took it back to the kitchen. I've had this happen to me before in other restaurants no biggie, they usually bring back an entire new plate or piece of meat. Well not Buttermilk, they just put my bitten chicken into the fryer again and brought it back to me, without the curtesy of an apology. By the way the rest of my chicken was pink as well. Service: On top of not being apologetic, they didn't even Comp a portion of my plate at all. I Pretty much didn't eat after they brought me back my half bitten chicken. That was pretty nasty. Our server came by to see if I wanted my food to go and I said no just the check. Which came out to $78.39 she didn't even give us time or asked how was the food before she immediately took the check. Terrible service, it was almost like we should be honored to eat at their restaurant. Which was kind of empty, so I don't know why they rushed our food. I will never go back to this place. I would much rather take a trip to Pies and Thighs.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm not big on going out but when I'm looking to show a guest a nice time I bring them here. The food is incredible and for what it's priced I have to admit it's worth it. Sure your typical $18+ entrees, but they pack a punch and I have yet to leave unsatisfied. One thing I could change is the service. Yeah I get it, this is Williamsburg, waitresses are led to believe that it's bothersome to keep returning to tables full of hipsters talking headlines, but for normal people like me I like my water filled up and just a quick hello now and again. Or at least being spared the sight of our servers behind the bar on their cellphones (smoke screens for reality) would have been nice. I own a business. A business full of military veterans. If I ever caught one of my men on the phone while they were supposed to be working they would probably be sent home. You guys should tighten that up. It's not a good look, and you're not only representing yourselves you're representing a pretty fine establishment in a great city. So take some pride.

"Absolutely insane in the membrane. Let's get straight to the food Steamed bun- this was really good (but then again who hasn't had steamed buns in other places). What sets this apart from the rest is simply this, the meat in this restaurant is phenomenal and unlike any you've had before Grilled Flat Iron Steak- this had peanut sauce and fish sauce and again together they sound absolutely atrocious but David Chang made this work-amaze...forget it that word is overrated Mackerel with XO sauce- anyone who can make fish skin not soggy (this is rare) is good in my book. Rib Chop with Apple- this was the winner of the night for me. I saw this as ""eh just another meat dish"" but it wasn't. The meat has distinguishable layers of flavor from the crispiness, to the fat and the tender part of the meat -it was a freaking symphony. No words for this one. And he adds apples!

I think we waited over an hour and a half, but I guess that's just because it's so popular. We had to end up going to a bar down the street while we waited until we could be seated. The pizza was nothing far from delicious. Between my friends and I some of the food the pies that we ate were the Regina, the Vegan Daniela Spinachi, King Harry Classic, and the Hellboy. The pizzas were already tasty themselves, but I personally liked adding the spicy honey or chili oil to it because it just woke up all the flavors in the pizza.

For crying out loud, this is not a large restaurant! I get better service at the truck!

Mistake number two was ordering the steak with onions and the roast pork. I've hardly ever seen finish stake in my entire life and the taste, well, there wasn't really much of a taste. As far as the roast pork goes I think they ran out of real pieces of roast pork and gave me everything that was on the bottom of the pan. A word on cleanliness... So the owner of the place wrapping up knives and spoons and forks in tissue to place down on tables. She dropped a spoon on the floor, looked down pick it up and then proceeded to put it right back in the pile of clean utensils...

"+1 Akamaru Ramen If you're into ramen and you are in NY - it's worth a try, since it's pretty damn good. Definitely not a place to go often as it is overpriced - even for the flavor the value isn't there. Be prepared to wait - our wait was about two hours. Get there early as they stop serving as soon as they are out of ramen. $2 for extra noodles - make sure you don't drink all of the soup if you're a big eater. (They don't give you that much anyways)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ordered the 3 dish tasting menu. Didn't love our waitress and she was not able to differentiate the champagnes for me. Overall, I felt that the restaurant put more emphasis on the dessert than the entrees. For my first plate I got a special of the Plum and Lobster Salad; both of which were delicious. My friend got the Gazpacho with tomato and watermelon; it was also delicious. For our main courses: the Flounder was phenomenal. I ordered the lamb, it was good but not spectacular. Dessert: The upside plum cake is delicious, by far the best we had. The first plate is extremely small and size while the main entree is a little more of a substantial serving. Do not come here expecting to be full to the brim based on your first and second plates alone. However, after dessert you'll feel like you can't take another bite. Overall, would definitely go back, you never leave this restaurant unhappy but at the same time I didn't feel I quite got my moneys worth this time around.","[0.0, 1.0]"
What a cute place! I loved the atmosphere and I loved the food. I got the Ricotta Pancakes and they were delicious. My friend got the French Toast and it was huge!

"Delicious and authentic Thai/Laos BYOB that I would definitely try again. I don't usually wander too far into West Philadelphia but I'll have to make an exception for this place. With the cute interior and the papaya salad along with beef jerky was nothing short of amazing, I'll have to return sooner than later. Especially for the Thai tea as well. Some places make it watery but it was made just the way I liked it. Staff was friendly and attentive. Service was a little slow but it was a busy Saturday night, so it was understandable.

"I got there at 5:30 on a Saturday and the line was only about 15 min long, though it took 40 min for them to bring us pizza after we ordered. Really great thin, fluffy crust, with fresh tomato and cheese. And by thin I really do mean thin - by the time the pizza cools, the crust is pretty much soggy from the toppings. This is meant to be eaten right after ordered. All in all, it was a very good pizza - I'm just not sure it merits the long wait times and all the hype.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place pissed me off. All I wanted was a good dinner. I ordered the Malaysia Sweet & Sour pork. What I got was about 80% vegetables and 20% pork. But wait, it gets worse. Since it was battered and stir fried, I got even LESS meat. I felt like I was eating batter the whole time. I would have rather eaten at Panda Express. So disappointed. .","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Well, their new ""thing"" is that they ""can only split tender between two credit cards"". The wait staff blamed it on their ""manager"" and the fact that the credit card companies charge money for every transaction. I was in the restaurant with a group of 5 people-- all trying to pay with cards...needless to say, this new ""rule"" caused a lot of drama when it came time to pay. It is frustrating that a group of people spending well over $100 had to be inconvenienced in this way. And the worst part is, the staff acted like it was OUR problem. It's 2012...get over it...credit cards are pretty common. The truth is-- people are likely to revisit a restaurant with bad food and good service, but most people will never return to a restaurant with such utter disregard for convenience, respect, and just plain good business practice.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love Vanessa's Dumpling House. I ordered pork and chive dumpling to stay, and it was delish, Great meat to wrapper ratio. Flavorful. Although, I found it a bit strange that the Sriacha was thinned out. Vanessa's was definitely packed for a Sunday afternoon, but still good! Wait a few minutes and you will find a seat. First come, first served. Lots of other delicious options! I'd be interested in trying some of their soups next time, when it isn't so humid outside. I love love love the fact that they also serve bubble tea. SO YUM. I ALREADY WANNA GO BACK. Decent sized space with seating also available. Cash only. Bring your greenbacks.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One of the my top 5 favorite establishments in Chinatown for authentic affordable and delicious Cantonese food. You can get completely stuffed at dinner for $12 with tax and tip! Pros: * Takes credit cards! :) * Make sure to check in on Yelp for 10% off! Love the: * Pan Fried Seafood Ramen * Rice Noodles with Peanut Soy Sauce and Sesame Seeds (this dish should always be served with a plethora of sauce and sesame seeds, so I was disappointed when they skimped on this the 2nd time I came) * Braised Beef Brisket Tendon Yee Mein w/ curry sauce * Pan Fried dumplings Don't recommend the: * Soup Dumplings: they are simply OK at Noodle Village- the skin is so thin it tears when you pick them up and you lose a lot of the soup. Better to get at Shanghai Cafe for superior taste. * Hot Pot Rice: Although all the pictures look amazing, this dish is underwhelming because the rice had absolutely no sauce or seasoning. The meats were succulent but it doesn't flavor the rice at all!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This review is long over due.  When I was in Philly for business I made it a goal to hit up Geno's, Pats, Tony Luke and Dinic's.  I won't go into the others, but DiNic's was the only place I didn't feel like I was a number rushed in and out. Tony's son is there and so is Tony, he asked how I like the sandwich and was genuinely interested in my feedback. I had the roast pork with sharp provolone, it was the best food I had all week.  It was so good I stopped in again at the end of the week and was first in line to get a second one.  The bread, the flavor of the meat, the whole experience was awesome.  I might not ever get to eat his steak or veal because I don't want to not get a roasted pork. Atmosphere is Reading Terminal, it's busy with hustle and bustle.  Food?  The best.  I've been wanting another since I left and can honestly say I would go out of my way and endure Philly traffic (even if i wasn't going to Philly) just to grab another.   Tommy, thanks for high standards in your food and a couple great lunches.  I'll see you next time I'm in PA.

"Went for breakfast as I wanted an outdoor setting with wireless and great food. All I got was the outdoor setting (sorta'), POOR wireless connection, and the WORST was the food. Tried both the home fries and sweet potato home fries (which the cubes were hard as rocks); both were saturated with a TERRIBLE Lawrey/Paprika seasoning. My eggs were under cooked. Asked for the home fries to go and the server put an orange wedge in with them, so it ruined even the orange! Got up charges for both the sweet potato and multi-grain bread I ordered; except that I was never told about the additional costs. When I sat outdoors, there were 2 cats and was told that the restaurant is their home. I mentioned that I have allergies so please try to keep them away. But instead, the server said I should go inside. Finally, bring CASH as they only accept cards over $30. I can see $20 but $30 really?

"My wife and I heard about this new restaurant that had opened up in our neighborhood where Tazzina used to be (and La Tavernetta) before that. The buzz was that the chef was on Hell's Kitchen and the we were excited to try it out. We came on a stormy Thursday night  a few weeks ago and due to the weather there were only 2 other dining parties in the place. So we had pretty attentive service. They had received their liquor license the week prior so we were asked how our drinks were. My wife tried the white sangria which was very good and good choice for a humid summer night. I had one of their beer selections. They had a nice small selection of beers from smaller breweries. Lisa had the hangar steak and I had the pork entree. Both were simply delicious and savory. Enough so to make us ask for another basket of bread and mop our plates clean. We had the trio selection for dessert of the Creme Brulee, flourless chocolate cake and the cheesecake. All were very good. The one negative was there was a malfunction in the coffee machine that night and it wasn't quite right. Aside from that glitch, it was a wonderful dining experience. We hope to return soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food at Ai Fiori was very medicore. I ordered the acclaimed lobster dish and it was cold. I went there a couple months ago and don't remember what I had, so most of the food was very forgettable. However, the reason I give it 1 star instead of 2 for its high prices and mediocrity is that my friend ordered dessert and it had a hair in it! The waiter came over, apologized and took it back to the kitchen. When he came back, he stated that the kitchen staff had scoured over the dish and did not find a hair. I assure you there was a hair in the dish. At restaurants of this caliber, I would expect a comp or something. We all had drinks, appetizers, entrees and there were 6 of us so the bill was substantial. Comping the $15 dessert would have been the thing to do in my opinion.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love Good Dog. The thing I love most is the food. Though some reviews say the food has become disappointing, I've never left here disappointed. I love the fries, they're a mix of sweet potato and regular. I love the burgers, though sometimes I wish they were a bit more seasoned. I never order the burger with the cheese in the middle because it doesn't come well done. Their regular burger is just fine by me. I love the BLT, the bacon is always cooked to perfection (note: BLT is very salty. But- in a good way, if that's your thing. It's definitely my thing.). I love the Mac & Cheese. The mashed potatoes are to die for. They're like mashed potatoes from heaven. The sides of veggies are always good. I mean it- I've never been let down here. The beer list is great, it always includes such a good variety of beers. The staff is wonderful. My only complaint is that after a certain time, you can't get a seat in this place. You have to either go early or be willing to wait.

"It's time to finally give this place a review. I don't know where to start with this review, everything is just simply amazing. I'm not really the type of guy that goes for Panini's or Crostini's. Hell I didn't even know what a Crostini was until I came here awhile back, I was definitely missing out. Reason being I've never had a Panini that was made the way they do. Normally places take a sandwich they made and press it, then call it a Panini. Not this place. Everything here is made with such detail. To the taste of the food, right down to the way it presentation. I serious applaud these cooks in working such a tight space, and pump out food the way they do. Last night is what really stuck with me but I should have made my review sooner. Here's what happened: My friend Paul and I work at a restaurant downtown and after we finished closing shop we were starving (Ironic right?). We both live in queens and decided to shoot over to Bambino. Half way there we realized that they would be closing in 30 mins, so we gun it to the restaurant. Upon arrival we were greeted by the adorable young lady at the register. She had polity told us that we aren't seating anymore. We respond by asking if we can grab take out. She said ""not a problem"", we decided to order quickly so not to hold them back any long then they need too. My default order is always the Truffle egg salad crostini. I can eat that for the rest of my life and die happy from all the cholesterol. I forgot what Panini I ordered as well but it was yummy as well. I feel the crostini's are always a better choice than the Panini because they are always amazing. The problem I have with the Panini's is everyone I have has it was a bit salty or not balanced. Hey, I can't complain, they're still is the best Panini's I've ever had. All in all. Hands down the best Panini's and Crostini's I've ever had, I dream about this place once in a while.","[1.0, 0.0]"

For main course, as a vegetarian I got the crisp rice and black lentil cake. I didn't expect much from the description and thought it could be boring but this dish was fantastic with unique flavors!

"OVERRATED!!!!  Since working in and around Tribeca since 2006 this place to me seems to have lost it luster and IT FACTOR!  I gave it another try after having brunch here one day and it didn't impress me not one bit.  On a business lunch meeting, I tried the meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  WHY???  So apparently the meatloaf was wrapped in bacon... I did my research prior to ordering and the plate arrived, and the food was cold.  The bacon was rubbery and the meatloaf lacked flavor.  Topped with onion ring crisp, I still didn't enjoy after every bite.  It was a very busy lunch hour and I understand the business part, but if you know your'e going to be busy, everything from the kitchen to the front door needs to be up to standards.  Later that evening, let's just say the food didn't ""hit me well""  I'm so glad I was home to relieve myself.

"Let me start off by saying the food was GOOD. Real good. Super delicious. Service was excellent, sabrina (the bartender) was awesome! Here comes the honest truth: the food was by no means authentic. We had appetizers: sisig tacos, longa dog, chicarron bulaklak. Sisig tacos: AMAZING, probably (apart from the bartender) the best part of this experience, so much flavor, great avocado/mayo/calamansi sauce on it. Nonetheless, you lose some of that authentic, sizzling pig cheek experience, without it it's really just a carnita with a creative twist of a sauce on it. Super delicious, but some of that PI authenticity is lost. Longa dog: also good. Dont know what the bun and slaw was doing there, but sure. Chicharron bulaklak: cant really go wrong here, fried fat, which you dip in (spicy) vinegar. Good! Now the main dishes: bicol express, minudo pie, sinigang. Bicol express: again, delicious. But it really just was a steak with a somewhat spicy somewhat coconutty gravy. My family is from bicol so i LOVE bicol express, and know, that wasnt it. Sinigang: anybody who's ever been to the philippines or has a filipino mother knows that sinigan is a mix of fatty pork, super sour tamarind soup with some kind of asian veggie in it. They had some kind of irish tasting roast beef floating in there, god only knows who accidentally dropped that in there. It tasted weird, i wont support this sacrilege. Broth still tasted good, the long chinese string beans were a nice exotic twist and probably the only green item i saw throughout this entire experience. To sum up, the food was really delicious, but by no means authentic. The meals had filipino twists to them, however I wont be taking my mom here if she's craving food that tastes like home.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"decent food, not great, but the price is reasonable as well. definitely a good hangout place for fast service and acceptable food. i wouldn't go here looking for something great or for a special occasion though. $1 skewer nights are great, with the downside that it attracts all the riffraff from the street trying to get in for cheap skewers and cheap beer. i understand they do this to draw people on a normally quiet tuesday night, but it's like walking into a wannabe ghetto fried chicken joint (and i say wannabe because the crowd is usually comprised of little college kids / dropouts who make loud noises). avoid on those nights, but keep this as a back pocket option on all others.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Def a place to stop by if you a ""I am ok eating non lean-healthy-I-don't-eat-grease-food"", because it is actually pretty good. The prices are cheap, about $2.75 per empanada, some dishes from $10-$20 dollars, apps for ~$6, and so on. Though it can get pretty $$ if you need to eat more than empanadas. We usually have only empanadas, all are good (they have baked, fried, etc.). However, the yellow rice is pretty good, but I do not like the one with chicken (dish), it is too messy looking. The planatos maduros are as good as they can get in any part of Latin America, I just wish they had the condensed sweet milk and served it as a dessert. I have also had the arepa made with sweet corn and mozzarella, which is exactly what I have been looking for since I had it at a Colombian Festival some years ago. Drinks-wise, I recommend you have their Sangria, because all their other drinks are bland. I make great Margaritas for cheaper than the $8 they charge - no bueno. Anyways, stick to the Sangria if you are picky about your mixed drinks like I am.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here for a date with my boyfriend and the place was really nice. I think the sunset menu is really worth it. Their pinto ice tea is really thai iced tea. The way this place has it is very different compared to the other thai places we been to. It is like a make it yourself thai iced tea, you set the sweetness and amount of tea. There are little thai iced tea ice cubes already in there. The pad thai tasted pretty good but the salad they gave me was alot bigger then expected along with very little amount of sauce. Overall the service was good and the food was good. Will come back here when i am in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was pretty excited to get a Sat night dinner reservation.  We arrived for our 8:45 reservation and were seated immediately.  It started off well.  Maybe 20 tables so I see why it's so hard to get a reserv plus being the hottest new place in town.   Our server was very friendly, pretty low key.  The sommelier was hysterical guy.  The wine list is extensive and a nice selection of by the glass but pricey by the glass.  Much better value to buy a bottle.   It was late so my friend and I shared stuff - pasta w/spicy red sauce.  OUTSTANDING.  The pasta was so fresh, light and the sauce was a perfect spicy but not too combo.  We also had the shank steak with parsnip puree.  It was OK and maybe if hadn't followed the pasta course I would have thought more of it but it was hard to compete with the pasta.  The bread was delicious but we had to ask for olive oil, kinda strange. Our final course was cheese.  It was OK, not the best or worst I've had.  Very small samplings.  2 of the 3 were better; 1 was not good at all.  pecorino was the best.   The atmosphere is energetic w/o being loud so they got that right and it was easy to talk and dine.  (not often found in NY rests).  Overall, really good but not sure I'd wait months or hours.   Didn't have a long time to spend in the market but I didn't find it confusing at all.  It was closed up when we left so.....next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"
I am so upset we come here all the time we made a reservation for 7 which we made 2 weeks ago and today we showed up for my moms memorial dinner and when we get here the guys tells us we don't have a table and we didn't take your number so we couldn't call you im so up set right now .

No management came to speak to us and you let us just walk out i understand you make your money here from big parties but my money is just as green and we are regulars  we found another resturant bella roma the food is excellent and the service is amazing in so upset i hope people read this and see how we treated,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Waited for an hour and they kept on gg the tables with other ppl who came after us. Totally not a baby or kid friendly place. And the worst thing is the staff is very rude. Won't recommend at all.iving g Pretty horrible service - went to Risotteria thinking that the food is good and there are so many positive reviews. The waiting was 30-40 mins, and we waited. I asked after 40 mins, how we doing on the time and she checked the list and told me ohh still 20-30 mins. I saw the list and realized that they gave tables to others who came after us. She kept on giving the table to others, as if she just didn't want to give a table for 4 to us. I told her and she is like bcos you are 4 ppl , you will have to wait or i can do a take out . Whatt??? seriously after 1 hour of wait she had gutts to say that take out ?? I was polite and was like its ok give us a table of 2 and we will squeeze in. Thinking the food will be atleast good. We ordered risotos and the good came in quickly. The risoto was pretty ok, not at all worth waiting for so long. The waitress was like sorry we did not get the seat earlier, without really meaning even a litle bit of sorry. To sum it up, this place is very over rated. The food is very ordinary , and has no ambience , bad service and pricey. I would have not cared about the ambiance or being pricey if the food and service was good. But both horrible. Stay away from this place. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL. There are better places in NYC and in the village for sure.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It was a struggle to give even 1 star. This place disappoints on every level. Maybe you could forgive the mediocre food, except that the prices are so high! I have been several times, each time  looking to try their crepes, which weren't available. The service here is the absolute worst!!! First, you are ignored. Then she looks at you with a frown & bad attitude. Asking a question will get you a rude, impatient, sometimes angry retort. Orders get mixed up and take wayyyy too long to get. It's like this even when they're not busy. Tables are not wiped off and are wobbly, chairs aren't comfortable. Those working here don't seem to care about their job, customers, quality of food, or their reputation. If they don't start taking their negative reviews & feedback seriously, I doubt they will stay in business. Especially now that there is a new place in town, where one can go for French food & pastries! I noticed Alexandra ( owner) replies to the more positive reviews but not to the negative ones, which is too bad. There really is no reason for me to go back, unless there were some acknowledgement & assurances that they care about making necessary changes. I leave there so angry, each time, but no more. I will go elsewhere, to a more welcomingplace. Nancy R.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love Yuca Bar. The happy hour specials are excellent and their drinks are fantastic - margaritas, sangria, sangria mixed with margaritas, caipirinhas...just so tasty and strong. Two drinks and I was having a blast...three and i'm not even sure what went down. Just a good time all around. Fun, friendly bartenders and waiters, also. The food is also tasty. I've been for both brunch and dinner. For dinner we usually share tapas with a big group - great guacamole, arepas, calamari and quesadillas. For brunch, I strongly recommend the ""yuca benedictos"" (shrimp and yuca topped with poached eggs and guacamole). Come here for a fun time - especially during happy hour!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had two tacos, one catfish and one avocado. Got a buck off each because it was happy hour so it totaled at six fifty. Not bad. The avocado one was spicy with the pickled jalepenos. The catfish one had good flavor but got soggy before I ate it...a few too many juices. It got crowded quickly right as thy opened at four, so the minimal seating became an issue rather quickly. But people do move in and out pretty fast. Overall, it's a nice quick spot to grab some tasty tacos in the area. Will return to try their queso...it looked good!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We had a really annoying meal at this place last week.  We were a party of three, and arrived at 7:30.  We were told that there would be a table for us in an hour.  At 8:45 the hostess came over to us and offered to make space for us at the bar.  We sat at the bar for another hour - the bartender at this time never once asked us if we wanted a drink - while we watched the restaurant seat several four tops with people who arrived after us.  When we complained, they said that they reserved the fourtops for groups of four when they were crowded, and that we had to be seated at the end of the communal table, which was apparently the only place that they seated groups of three.  At 9:30 the manager actually asked the group of three that had been hogging ""our"" table to leave, and we finally sat down. The service was okay, although it took me about 1/2 an hour to get the refill of the water i asked for.  The food, however, was really disappointing.  The cheddar waffles on the vegetarian menu were cold, and served with an anomolous group of random vegetables.  The soup I had was fine, but had way too much cream.  Dessert was good. All in all, don't think we'll be going back","[0.0, 1.0]"
I have been hearing about Frank Pepes for a long time yet had never had the chance to stop in and sample the goods. I was driving from RI to NYC and decided it was time to make a detour. Last time I came here the line was down the block so I just left. Tonight the place was a ghost town so it was perfect. Stuck to the basics and just got a pie w cheese and a pie w cheese/pepperoni. The pizza lived up to the hype. Quite possibly the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had (and my fat ass has eaten a lot of pizza in my time). Make the time to stop in and eat a slice you won't be disappointed.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I might be one of the few that liked this place better pre-renovation. I'm not sure what vibe they are going for here, but it's a freaking mess. Diner-esque fare, but it feels more like a tacky lounge inside -- ridiculously loud house & pop music included. Not too long after they reopened, we tried to order for delivery one night and found out, according to the guy on the phone, that they no longer make half the menu they used to. Ok, fair enough. Change can be good. A couple months ago I stopped in and asked for a new menu, only to be told by the bitchy hostess that they ""no longer *do* menus"". Alrighty, then. That's a good business move.... Finally, we found an updated menu on another website and were shocked by the prices. $12.95 for a wrap?? $11 for an appetizer?? Are you kidding me? This ain't Soho, kids. On a final note, don't even bother with their website. The prices are about $3 - $4 off and they haven't been listed on SeamlessWeb for about a year now. Fail.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You can tell everything's been thought out and fussed over. This is not a place for d-bags just looking for a place because they can afford it.  Please go to appreciate the food! The combinations were refreshing and surprising. With the chef there overseeing dinner, you do have a better connection and understanding with the food you're eating. You can tell that the chef is very meticulous and serious about what he does and he wants his customers to enjoy it.  While I hear that the menu changes from day to day, my meal was heavily focused on fish--sashimi style--a good thing since I'm a fan.

You can add many sandwich topping like tomato, lettuce, pickles and so on. The sandwich is put on a panini grill for about 45 seconds.  The price was reasonable being under $11. The sandwich was ok, where the bread was good as well as the toppings.  My main complaint is the temperature of the chicken in the sandwich.   It was barely warm.

"3.5 stars. I finally visited Joe's after avoiding it for some time for fear of it being over-hyped. My verdict? They do serve some really solid soup dumplings, but not necessarily worth such a long wait. I've eaten similar soup dumplings in California in restaurants with absolutely no wait. Also, I'm not sure if it's just me or I'm going crazy, but for some reason I find the dumpling skin at all the XLB places in NYC to be a bit too thick. And Joe's was no exception. They did have a great soup, and were generally quite good. However, the crab soup dumplings weren't very good - definitely just stick with pork.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Miya's has been a part of my life for over a decade and I have watched it transform year to year into something innovative, unique and sustainable. While I am now a vegetarian and adore and appreciate all of the vegetarian options available, at the start of my journey I was all about the fish (check out OO LA LA MITZVAH! and ONE EYED CRAB MONSTER). After having Miya's specially blended whole-grain sushi rice (brown rice, quinoa, amaranth, oat grains, and flax seed) I have been ruined for all others - to me, it just tastes so much better and adds to the texture and flavor of the rolls. It's clear that Chef Bun Lai puts extraordinary thought into his menu. Not only does he aim to have great tasting food while being sustainable, he wants the cuisine to be healthy, represent a myriad of cultures and be financially available to all (""Sushi for the Masses"" menu items and Miya's gives to numerous charities). I appreciate businesses trying to be ecologically responsible, socially responsible and culturally diverse. Miya's is different and I love that.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here once about two summers ago, and to be completely honest, I was more than disappointed. Why come here for a Philly Cheesesteak when food carts all over Philadelphia offer equally authentic cheesesteak sandwiches? The magic cheese whiz was a little unappetizing, but people don't come here for the food, but more for the ""been-there, done-that experience."" To my disappointment, the cashier shouted at me for seemingly to have taken my time to order, and corrected me for incorrectly calling the fries ""French Fries"" instead of ""American Fries."" Sorry but not sorry, I didn't have the time to finish reading the menu before I was yelled at. I think being Asian-American here made the situation worse (based on the way I was treated by the cashier), and the Italian Market up the street past 6pm made me feel out of place and uncomfortable. To be fair, that was one of my first experiences anywhere outside of UCity. I heart Pat's across the street is nicer, but I haven't been there personally. Aside from the bad treatment, I'm just glad I've made a trip down there, and whenever asked the ""Pat's or Geno's"" question, I always gladly pick Pat's even though I haven't been. At least I don't think I'll be yelled at my the cashier there.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It offers an awesome alternative to a lot of the ""heavy"" food experiences I've had eating out at other places. To be honest, I almost always get the 4 markets sides for $15 dollar deal . . . so I'm not qualified to weigh in on all the other items on the menu, but I LOVE that you can make a meal out of four of their very well done vegetable sides. Restaurants that do their vegetables well are hard to come by, but Westville does them up right. I'm mad about their kale and their brussel sprouts. I have gotten some of their more traditional entrees too (like the Almond Crusted Trout) , and have never been disappointed. I've also brought several folks with me and never seen any of them disappointed! It's always delicious, and when I leave I'm full in a happy I-just-ate-something-wholesome way. If only I was the only one who loved Westville . . . unfortunately everyone else knows it too! This place does get crowded real fast.

Still, even if you do have to wait a little while, it really is worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went to Tashan with friends for restaurant week and we were very pleasantly surprised by how many options we were given on the restaurant week menu, how big the portions were, and how delicious everything was! Yes, this is clearly an Indian restaurant, but the food is not just standard Indian.  Great flavors presented in some interesting ways.  This was especially true with the appetizers. The best were the Samosa Chaat (samosa buried under a pile of yogurt, chickpeas, and other things) and Palak Tikki (a kind-of spiced spinach patty).   The Tandoori Shrimp  and the Spicy Kakori Kebab were also good, but was good but not as much if a flavor highlight. The Butter Chicken (same as tikki masala) was great, especially the creamy rich sauce.  My friend had the Kashmiri Lamb Shank and raved about the dates in the sauce.  Another had the Goan Masala Dusted Lobster (yes, lobster was on the restaurant week menu!) and said it was very tasty. Naan came as a part of the meal (maybe just for restaurant week but regardless, it was nice to not have to pay extra for it) as did complementary sparkling water.  Rice came with the chicken and was the one downside, food-wise.  The rice definitely needed some seasoning, and the blandness took away a bit  from the butter chicken sauce.  Sauce definitely tasted better on the naan than with the rice! Service was SUPER attentive: we started off seated outside, but when it got cold after the apps course they moved us inside, then switched tables again on our request, all with a smile. Very impressive.  The downside was that we had to wait a long time for all of the mains to come out (chicken came first, lobster 5 minutes later, lamb 10 minutes after that) but the fact that the delay in the food did not affect our enjoyment of dinner says a lot about how full we were from the apps and how nice the overall experience was.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ekta or Tiffin? This review is coming from someone who has had Tiffin as their go-to Indian for delivery. After seeing Ekta as having the same amount of reviews as Tiffin with a little better rating, I decided to order it tonight instead of Tiffin. Long story short, after ordering the same staples I love from Tiffin, I have decided I am still a tiffin fan. What I ordered: Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer, and Goan Shrimp Curry Chicken Tikka- Ekta has nice spicing while still having a creamy taste.However, i still prefer tiffin's chicken tikka. Creamier, and just more addictive IMO Saag Paneer- Again i have to go with Tiffin. It seems like tiffin's spinach was not quite as mushy as Ekta. I will say i definitely had more spicing in Ekta than tiffin, although at one point was a bit too much since i bit into a whole cardamom pod and had to fish it out of my mouth. In general, it seems they both have the same price point, both are as good with portions of rice and entrees, but i will say Tiffin gives memore chicken in my tikka masala and more cheese chunks in my Saag Paneer. Ekta did give a desert witheach entree which i will say is a neat little surprise. In conclusion: Ekta is a great choice for some good, authentic (from my perspective) indian fare. However, with Tiffin just around the corner and delivering in the same Areas as both Ekta locations. I would have to recommend Tiffin over Ekta.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Originally, we thought of a 4 stars... Although we encounter a few bummers during the night and this morning after having unslept on it... we are giving a 3 but really because we like Traif (same owners). First, it was really cold inside. The AC was over cooling the place and it did not establish a comfortable mood for our dinner. Cocktails were good but the only disappointing part is that with the ice cubes cocktail you really drink it when you are almost at dessert... Which is not a cocktail / aperitif anymore. The toasted black sesame - almond with house tequila was good . The food comes first ready, first served , as Traif. Until there no problem... Except when they forget one of the most important ones : the sliders. The bone marrow taste was good, maybe not melting enough like butter and the beef tartare was not good. The butterfish hamachi was good, the Mexican spicy edamame was good. The Coconut tuna was not pleasant and almost frozen... and the Brussels sprouts are fried so it removes all that deliciousness about them. Life and food is about balance... Not here. The scallops were good, the foie gras was good, the ribs were ok. We are still cold with goosebumps all over our arms and waiting for the sliders which never came. Meanwhile, someone refilled tap water on our bottled sparkling water. What a waste. One of us expressed it and the manager brought some sparkling water from the gun bar (sorry, that does not replace bottled sparkling water with minerals). We thought of leaving at this point but again, because it's the same owners as Traif, we thought of not leaving on a bad note. So we gave the desserts a try. We got the tres leche carrot cake and the maple flan. And that was good !!! Pfiou.... Something at least alchemic and as fine as you can find next door. But one of us could not digest the food. He got sick during the night, and another one is still trying to calm an unhappy stomach. We will not be back, we'll keep it at Traif only.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Like most of the best BBQ/pork stores, the sauce is on the side and it's all about the smoked meat. And boy do these guys know to smoke some pork! One bun is never enough and I always want seconds.

"I would like to give this place 4.5 stars but am settling on 4 as 5 is a tad generous. The wine selection is great and the food, very good. Most of all, when you dine out, you are looking for the experience and ambience. This place has both and proved for a lovely meal for myself and my girlfriend. We both enjoyed our meal but more so loved the relaxed vibe of the restaurant and decor. There is a small bar at the front, a coved dining area at the back and in the main restaurant also. Unfortunately for me, it's not near my usual outing spots, else I would have been back but should make the effort to return, given the memories of a fond evening there.

"My daughter talks about this place a lot when she visits me so I gave in when she suggested it  for our late lunch when it was my turn to visit. That day was the 1st of the 90-degree days in the city, but we still walked it from Times Square. From outside I say it is nice and quiet.... but wow... when walked in all tables were taken, except for one .... talking about good timing. When we were presented with the menu, I was taken. It had to be authentic so I chose the Brasil, Cuban, and Pernil. For dessert, the caramel one was the best! Great wait service. Now I know why daughter can't stop talking about it.

"Went there for lunch on Sat. hoping to avoid going there in the evening and having to wait for a table. Started with the kale salad then straight to the appetizers. All the appetizers sampled were amazing but too bad they didn't have the shishito peppers. My top three favorites were the brussell sprouts, fried eggplant and salt and pepper chicken wings. The miso broth was quite delicious and the noodles were cooked just right. If I have it again, I'm going to ask for the soft boil egg in the soy broth instead. Had to pass on the green tea ice cream but my partner was more than happy to take my share. Price is reasonable and cheap compared to going into NY.

Service was attentive and the floral decor makes for a lovely atmosphere. I'd recommend a weekday visit.

I had the spinach, goat cheese and caramelized onion omelet, and my girlfriend had the brekkie (3 eggs with toast and bacon). The standout of the meal, by far, was the side order of sweet potato fries, which came with sweet chili sauce that was really great. As for seating, the place was fairly crowded, and groups larger than 2 seem to be in for a wait, as there are only a few tables that seat more than a couple. The ambiance was very casual - servers and staff were all in jeans. All considered, it was a mediocre experience I won't be looking to repeat any time soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A decent banh mi, I'd say. 3.75 stars, rounded up. Pros: + Cheap! $3.75 for the #1 pork sandwich!  Good pricing. + The sandwich is HUGE.  I eat a lot of banh mi in my hometown of San Francisco since there's a lot of great Viet places there, but I've never had one quite as huge as this one.  I split one with my friend, and it effectively stuffed me for the rest of the day. + The pork is delish.   Cons: - Too much radish, though that's a personal preference.  I could go for a little less of that orange and white stuff. - The bread wasn't the best I've tried; in fact, it was the kind that hurts the roof of the your mouth when you bite into it.  Owww. It's a little weird that the sandwich shop is in the back of a jewelry store, that was totally a WTF moment.  I mean, that's still pretty tight, though.  Weird but cool. Overall, it was a tasty sandwich, with good meat and so-so bread.  I've had much better banh mi sandwiches, and I think this sandwich would be more awesome if the bread had a better crispycrunchy, not-painful texture.  Sometimes, it really is all about the bread.   If you're walking by, though, and need a quick, cheap, and reliable meal, this place satisfies all those requirements and should stuff you in no time.  Wash it down with a bottle of soymilk, conveniently available at the store and also cheap!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Max's is a staple for us when visiting my grandma in West Hartford. Likes:  Fun, trendy place.  The food is decent, I've ordered some great things there over the years.  My family loves the horseradish carrots they give everyone along with the bread basket.  The chopped salad is my favorite thing on the menu: it is downright delicious, I wish I could replicate it at home.   Dislikes:  The seafood has always struck me as really up-and-down.  I'm not an oyster person, but I'm pretty adventurous with the rest of the menu: soups, mussels, fish, or whatever sounds interesting.  I would say half the time it's awesome, but half the time I leave Max's wishing I had ordered something else.  We ordered a stuffed lobster the last time we went: it was a lot of food but just eh as far as lobster goes (I guess that means it wasnt that fresh?).  Max's is also really, really noisy, so it's downright impossible to have a conversation without yelling. Take it or leave it:  Take it occasionally.  It's fun for a trendy place, but not the best seafood I've ever had.  But the menu is always changing, so that's at least fun.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It's been a while since I've had some decent brick oven pizza. Craving it for the past two weeks, I finally decided to yelp a location and meet up with a friend for lunch. So glad I decided on Luzzo's! When you first walk in, you notice that the restaurant is pretty narrow. It's relatively long, just not as wide as you would hope for. The environment was pretty quiet when we stopped in, so a plus on our end. It had an italian pizzeria type feel to it, very interesting if you ask me. As I sat down and skimmed through the menu, I suddenly became very indecisive. So many different pizzas to choose from, how could I just pick one?! After careful consideration, because food is a serious matter, I finally decided on the Diavola and my friend concurred. Intrigued by the ingredients and suddenly craving salami, this was definitely the way to go! Originally deciding on a 12"", we were advised to order a 16"". Glad we did but I felt that we should have ordered another one. IT WAS THAT GOOD! Although a 16"" would be enough for a normal party of two, my friend and I consume food like there's no tomorrow. We're very well aware of our appetite, we can eat! The strong brick oven taste, the aroma of the basil, the taste of perfection from the mozzarella, tomato sauce, and spicy salami combination; what more could I ask for in a brick oven pizza? Just typing this review has me craving it all over again! The service was relatively decent, no complaints there. The only reason I'm knocking out a star from this review is because this place ONLY ACCEPTS AMERICAN EXPRESS. How is it that a restaurant only accepts American Express in NYC? I found it very weird, especially since their charge percentage happens to be the highest out of all major credit cards normally accepted. My friend ended up paying for our meal, but I promised to grab the next check. Sorry Luzzo's, but you actually let me down on that end. So what have we learned here, people? When coming to Luzzo's, make sure you have cash or an American Express on hand. Otherwise, I highly recommend and definitely plan to be back, very soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I stepped outside to make a phone call and the doorman wouldn't let me back in because he did not see me leave and was only allowing women to enter.    Naturally, this was a problem because my friends were inside as well as my bag.  The wait staff ended up getting stiffed because I was paying for drinks and was not able to enter the premises to receive the check.  The doorman is a creepy pathetic lowlife whose insecurities manifest themselves in the abusive way he treats others and I invite people to stop by to remind him of that.  I hope the health department inspects the kitchen soon too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to Olea with a friend, and found this little unassuming restaurant to be quite a pleasant surprise. We ordered a bunch of small plates. Nothing was bad but there were a few standouts. The brussel sprouts were so delicious- crispy, salty, and a little sweet with some honey glaze. I was worried that the honey would make the dish too sweet for my liking but I found it to be very balanced. The goat cheese croquettes were similarly very tasty and balanced. I found the food to be inventive but simple and very satisfying. The service was good- attentive but not overbearing.  The atmosphere was intimate, but with a good hum of lively conversation and ambient music. I definitely recommend this restaurant for dinner with a friend or a date. Not good for big groups or families with young children.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I purchased a groupon for Mcladdens in 2012.  Unfortunately, I let it expire so I could no longer use the promotional value but the original $15 I paid for the groupon was still valid.  I decided to go ahead and order take out.  When I got to the McLadden's, I went to pay the almost $30 bill.   I handed over my groupon and the rest in cash. The waitress came back and informed me that my groupon was valid only for dine in.  While I understand why this policy is in place when there is a promotional value (i.e  $30 worth of food for $15), I do not think it is a fair policy if the promotional value has expired.  If I purchased a $15 gift card, McLadden's would not dictate how I could use my gift card.  I see this expired groupon purchase as the same thing as a gift card (I am not getting more than my original investment).  I tried explaining this to the manager but he would not budge on this issue.  So I ended up not being able to use my groupon and having to use cash for my take out.  On top of it, the food was a disappointment. I will not be going back to McLaddens.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I finally checked out this place today after having discovered it on a yelp search. Having grown up eating banh mi as a native, there are certain expectations one has. 1) bread quality. EXCELLENT crunch in the baguette was perfect.  Just wish the bread was scooped out -- less carbs, more crunch. 2) preserved veggies. OKAY. Needs to be a bit more sour and more well drained so as to not make the bread soggy. 3) fresh veggies. Okay. Missing crunch of the cucumber. 4) meats filling. EXCELLENT. Great taste. Maybe just one ore two more slices to fill it out more. Pate was AMAZING 5) $6 is a bit high. But great price given the hood. The Vietnamese coffee lacked a bit of sweetness. Did they use something that isn't condensed milk? And for iced coffee they need to brew it a bit more concentrated. Otherwise the ice melting makes it taste a bit watery. Overall, good. Show them some love. Keep them open. Warning, place only has 4 stools (4th stool is in an odd position) and a small bench.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Poor service with a slightly bad attitude. I live in Philly and eat out a lot. I just happened to be at a seminar next to this restaurant. I went for lunch. I ordered one appetizer and one flatbread. The hostess was polite. The server didn't seem like she wanted to be there. She wasn't rude to me, but she was condescending and obvious about her feelings about being there. I asked for a soda (I wasn't in the mood for a shake). She rolled her eyes - rolled them - and pointed behind me and told me, ""Sweeties, this is all we have."" I turned around to see a 2ft. x 6ft. soda cooler - barely stocked - that was situated behind a table. Of course, I didn't notice it when I sat down; it wasn't obvious and the menu suggested a lot more of a selection. The server rushed me out as well. I began to ask her for more napkins and she cut me off and said, ""Oh, you're finished? Let me get your check."" I had to tell he no and that I really just needed a napkin. The food was okay. It seems like it would be different, and it kind-of is. But, I could order most of the protein from the menu from any India restaurant. I did not have the opportunity to try a smoothie, but I don't see myself trying this place again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I visited Alma de Cuba last Friday night for the last night of restaurant week.  I have to say, it always makes me laugh a little when Cuban restaurants are as expensive as Alma de Cuba or Cuba Libre, since Cuban food is not expensive or particularly fancy.  But for as pricey as the menu is, we were definitely not disappointed. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by an entirely professional and impressive staff.  The restaurant itself is really beautiful, very simple, but fresh and visually pleasing.  We were seated immediately, which was impressive, especially for restaurant week, and doted on by the server throughout our meal.   The restaurant week menu featured items from their normal menu, which is always appreciated.  In addition, they had an extra ceviche course available for $15, which we were tempted to try.  Our appetizers (a corn soup) was tasty but not life-altering.  The main courses were both really quite good. We tried both the the skirt steak and the salmon and were pleased with both of them.  The desserts were a little bit of a let down; the tapioca pudding was good but not profound and the banana cake was pretty much just banana bread. All in all, we were thoroughly impressed.  Although not all of the food was earth-shattering, it was all really quite good, and the service and atmosphere more than made up for it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We found Vitae by looking at Yelp, and were so impressed!  We called for a table last-minute on a Friday evening, and were able to get right in. When we arrived, the first impression was Wow! Ultra modern, clean lines, beautiful lighting, tables nicely spaced -- just lovely. The service was even more amazing. From the first greeting to the hugs when we departed -- we received attentive care from, I think, 5 different people, and all were professional, friendly, and just plain wonderful. The wine list was good, though I would like a few more of the buttery Calif Chardonnays -- my personal favorite. The manager did point us to a good wine choice, though, and we were happy with it. The menu was artfully prepared, and the food was equally artfully executed. The three of us had: Seared Diver Scallop with Cauliflower, Golden Raisins, Cashews, Thai Curry Sauce for appetizer (shared), duck breast (superb), Alaskan wild salmon (an unusual preparation but nicely cooked), and Grilled Mayan Prawns (appetizer - delicious) paired with a small serving (nice idea) of the Maltagliati with Lamb Sausage, Baby Zucchini, Roasted Tomatoes San Tumas (different and quite good). We enjoyed a chef offering of a small bite-size risotto ball in a divine sauce, and after dinner another chef-offered bite of meringue with raspberry filling. We also shared two desserts: Rosemary-Honey Panna Cotta with Blueberries, Peanut Crumble, and Churros & Chocolate -- both delightful. This chef-owned restaurant has only been open five months, and in our experience a new restaurant often under-delivers - at least for the first year or so. This one was superlative on all counts, right down to the ""Vitae"" printed hand towels in the bathroom. We predict it will gain rapidly in popularity.

"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, and was very pleased with the decor and ambiance of the place. However, the rest of the experience did not match... First, we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes before we had to hunt someone down to take our order (even though they were just chillin near the kitchen having a blast). One of us ordered coffee, and he also had to hunt someone down to get some coffee after 10 minutes past without a single drip. After about 25 minutes of waiting for our food, we called a server (not our server, because she seemed to have disappeared) to ask about our food. We saw him talk to the chef, and then confusingly look around the kitchen (which is never comforting), and THEN pull out ticket to the chef. The server came over and stated, ""He is working on your ticket now."" GREAT, thanks. After our food was served, our server disappeared again and we had to hunt down another server to get our check, since she seemed to have forgotten we were there. I got the huevos rancheros, which was bland and TINY. i'm a 5'3 110 lb girl and don't eat much, but finished my plate hungry. My friend ordered a corn place, which also TINY. The burger and hangover food options looked pretty hearty, at least. Overall, poor service, even when the place is half-filled, and small portions.

We came over here after a 200-mile trek from New Hampshire to meet family on the way back to Philly.  The enormous place is suitable for a family gathering and we did, having to have my dog tied outside instead of in one of their three outdoor patios.  And by the way, the doors from the patio to the outside are closed to customers.  Which for me didn't matter, even though a rude manager yelled at me for checking on my Lab.   The food comes quickly, the place being more of a cafeteria than a restaurant, as food tastes as if it were cooked beforehand.  Yes, their fried clams were passable, but their baked potato was hockey-puck dry, either overcooked in a micro or left for hours in a hot oven.   Although it is a nice place to bring a large gathering, one must be aware this is not a place where the customer should have any expectations of haute cuisine.  It simply is a cafeteria with slow service.   My dog ate about half my food which I brought to him despite the manager screaming at me again. Not at all worth the price.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Viewing Million Dollar Jewelry at Christie's can work up an appetite. So I was off to a small hole in the wall restaurant on 10th Avenue, when I remembered that I bookmarked a recommendation from fellow Yelper Chris D. To be honest, I was just beat from walking those long avenues. Haha........ As I approached 9th Avenue, I found Istanbul Kebab House storefront with a couple of sandwich boards up front. It had daily specials and deals; like free soda from 2 to 5 PM every day of the week with purchase of sandwich. I was sold. As I walked in, there was this huge chunk of meat on a spit. Now I was ready to chow down. Stay out of my way since I love Gyros, Shawarma and Doner sandwiches. This is a very small place with 4 or 5 four top tables. It is decorated with Turkish period carpets on the wall and a TV playing background Turkish music. The place was very welcoming and wifey and I just felted right at home. We ordered one hummus as an appetizer and two Shawarma sandwiches. The hummus was creamy, cold and very tasty. It came with a basket of pita, side of Turkish hot sauce and yogurt base sauce. Lots of flavor here when you dip pita in different sequence of items or sauces. Very nice. The Shawarma is one of the BEST in NYC. A definite top 5 in my book. It was moist with flavor and a spice profile from the Middle East that was just delicious. All the components was perfectly prepared. The ratio of meat to pita to veggies to sauce was just perfect. Just writing this I could taste the flavor of the lamb with that spicy Turkish sauce. Ouch! Good............... This is a must place for Gyros. If you appreciate a good Shawarma sandwich make the trip to 9th Avenue, you will not be disappointed. This is a must destination place for this style of food. Wonderful................","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I Don't even know where to start on how good this place is... After 10 years in NYC I had given up all hope of finding a solid seafood spot that perfectly nails southern cooking with a new yorkers foodie twist. Food: -The crawfish are to die for, regardless of the season. The owners must have the best hookup in the states, always fresh, perfectly sized, juicy, and cooked to perfection. -The Sauce: You cant go wrong, but I do have a favorite. Old bay dry... with a side of the boil special in medium. The boil special adds this perfect sweet,salty, but spiced to perfection addition that is a perfect dunk to crab, lobster, shrimp or of course crawfish. However, many of my friends like the boil special in their bags. To each their own, the beauty of this place is that you can try many different combinations till you find your favorite. (And trust me, its impossible to only go to the boil once... it will quickly become your favorite spot) -The food: (Outside of the perfect seafood that has yet to ever be even remotely off). The chicken wings are hands down the best I have ever had. Skin is perfectly crispy, meet is juicy and falls off the bone, spice (While I dont know what their special recipe is, is UNREAL). Ambiance: Its the only seafood place that can somehow make a cold winter night feel cozy. The music is perfect. TV's are always playing sports... nothing beat Sunday football snacking on bags of crawfish and beer. However, it also manages to be romantic if on a date.. or fun if in a group. Again, the owners nailed the landing here. I rarely yelp.. but this place deserve the 5 stars... and more.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"One of the best dinners that I've had in a long time. A friend has wanted to try this place out for a while, and so, we made reservations for the night and were seated immediately upon arrival. There could have been more space between the tables, but coming from Manhattan, I'm used to eating in close quarters with dining neighbors so it didn't bother me as much as it would others. Ordered some cocktails, which were really delicious. I like how their cocktails have unique ingredients, which reminded me of drinks from a mixology bar. Now, food. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese was my favorite dish of the night. It was melt in your mouth good. Second favorite was the scallops on a bed of risotto. The bacon doughnuts were quite delicious too at the end of the meal, so that would be my third favorite. We ordered seared foie gras, broccoli rabe with truffle toast, and breaded lamb as well. Although all were good, I wouldn't order them again next time like I would the other three dishes. Overall, I'd give this place a 4.5. Food came out with perfect timing in between each dish. It was also an open kitchen, so you can see the chef creating your food. However, minus .5 since I would've been more comfortable with more space and three out of the six dishes were good but not 5 stars good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I first visited Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1972.  I fell in love with the culture and, especially, the food.  It was so different than the Tex/Mex or California/Mex we were all used to back then.  It was lighter, far more sophisticated, and clearly required more preparation and thought than mere tacos or burritos.  I've returned there often enough to become familiar with the food in Oaxaca, which I still love and now miss, because it has been more difficult in recent years to get there.   If you are looking for authentic Oaxacan cuisine, do not come to the Oaxaca Kitchen in New Haven.   This is not to say that the food is bad, but it is not authentic, despite reviews to the contrary. The Margaritas were expensive ($10) and watery.  Not nearly enough lime or tequila.  Beware of these.  They are 3/4 ice, with salt around the rim.   The Mariscada a la Parrilla Ensalada (seafood salad) was quite good.  The pieces of scallop, shrimp, and teeny-tiny bit of lobster (I think there was only one piece of each) were perfectly cooked  and the dressing was light and flavorful.  But the seafood was overwhelmed by a large pile of arugula, and a few cherry tomatoes, neither of which I have ever encountered in Mexico in more than 20 years of eating there.  Good to eat, but far from authentic.   The mole, on the other hand, was awful:  thick, overspiced, and heavy.  After a few bites the heat of the sauce became overwhelming, not even remotely softened by a little extra chicken broth or sweetened by the traditional chocolate.  And the chicken, which was drowned and nearly obliterated by this heavy sauce, was tasteless and without texture, sort of like spam.  In Mexico, the mole is decorated with a light touch of cilantro, green onion thinly sliced, and white cheese sprinkled over the top.  Not so here.  What was served was just a bowl of monotonous brown stuff, with the chicken/spam hiding underneath all of the sauce. Oaxaca, Mexico has a long culture and tradition of hand made, colorful ceramics.  The serving pieces at the Oaxaca Kitchen in New Haven are 100% white, in rather odd shapes, with no place to set aside a knife or fork.  This will seem petty to anyone not familiar with Mexican dishes, but it is simply a shame that a restaurant claiming authenticity would use dishes like this.  Ditto the loud music. Finally, we had a bad experience with glasses of wine, which were decidedly ""corky"" (with a mildew smell and taste).  When we complained to the waitress she returned with glasses of a different wine but rather pointedly told us that the bar tender thought the ""corky"" wine was ""fine.""  Again, a little disconcerting for a glass of wine, well, let's be honest, 1/3 of a glass of wine, that cost $9.00. It was the evening of Commencement Day.  No doubt the staff, and the chef, were exhausted; and perhaps the ingredients were exhausted, too.  But I found this restaurant noisy, inauthentic, overpriced, and completely unsatisfying.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here because of the favorable reviews, and the byob policy.  I had never brought my own wine into a place before, and thought it might be a cool little moneysaver.  Anyway, the scene is young, trendy and hip, the appetizers, crostinis and paninis were all very nice, and our James Joyce-esque waiter was very courtious and knowledgable.  I had no problem with the $5 corkage fee, but at the end of the day, you realize how this little place stays in business without a liquor license.  A couple can easily spend $40-$60 on some apps, crostinis and pannini(s), and still leave hungry.  When you add the cost of the wine that you bring yourself, you suddenly realize that you could have eaten much more upscale for the price. This food is all very, very nice.  It's just not as inexpensive as it may seem. I still go back frequently.  That should say something.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Paesano's did not disappoint!  I had the eggplant sandwich with roasted potatoes and I am currently in a coma after stuffing my face.  The sandwich was toasted just right with a yummy mixture of onions, mozzarella, pesto, peppers, and eggplant.  The menu boasts that the potatoes are made with all of the fat and flavor that they can muster and they are definitely worth the heart attack risk.   I highly enjoyed the absolutely over-the-top charming, helpful, and enthusiastic waiter/chef that took our order.  He was patient and explained things well, even letting us know that he could make the potatoes without the animal fat.   Reasonably priced, delicious, ample portions, and great service- methinks I found a new favorite place!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for years. While I have always enjoyed their Italian food (especially the Chicken Sorrentino), tonight was a special treat. Owner Raima was in the kitchen cooking and prepared several Mediterranean dishes. We ordered the spicy shrimp as an appetizer, and the sauce was amazing! We also ordered two of her entree specials..A baked salmon dish and a lamb skewer dish that were both phenomenal. A homemade Baklava for dessert was the perfect ending to an exceptional meal.

"This place is a gem! I was looking for a place to go for dinner with my family since my brother came home for spring break. My dad wasn't feeling Italian so I opted to find a Thai restaurant in the city. This place is definitely what everyone else says it is. Here is the break down: Food: Not too overwhelming and spicy and salty like other Thai restaurants I've been to. Also, every dish had it's own unique taste (other places tend to have dishes that all taste the same). Portions are generous... I left looking like I was at leas 6 months pregnant LOL Pricing: Entrees are very affordable! They range from $10- $27 Ambiance: So so sooo pretty. Kind of like I walked into the set of a Midsummer Night's Dream meets the Mediterranean. It was slightly loud, but I did not mind it at all. Service: ON POINT! Our waiter was so nice and kept refilling our glasses and made sure empty plates were taken as soon as we were done.

"The Spotty Gig:  We were so excited that our NYC ""kids"" chose The Spotted Pig -- a restaurant we'd read about and greatly looked forward to trying. We knew it was popular and crowded, so we weren't surprised when the host told us we'd need our whole party of six there to put our name in. That happened at 7:00 pm -- we gave them our phone number and went around the corner to the Rusty Knot (fun tiki bar with an excellent frozen mojito, by the way) to wait. At 7:45, the host called us and told us a table would be ready by the time we returned. But it wasn't. The host said our table was ready, but he had to put in some orders before seating us. We cheerfully waited outside, expecting to be called inside any minute. After another half hour, we politely asked again about out table and were told, again, that our table was ready, but they had to put a few more orders in before seating us. No attempt to be more creative/plausible with their excuses, no apologies. Finally, at 8:40, after patiently waiting an additional 55 minutes past the time they called and said our table would be ready, we left. We'll never wait for the Snotty Pig again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food is really great and the location is good. You can take a walk after dinner to the water to digest the heavy pasta sauces :) My cheese ravioli with pink sauce was excellent. The sauce was creamy and tangy. My friend's seafood ravioli was not as good, but still quite good. Finally, the steak is humungous! Literally a wood plank with greens, cheese flakes, and tons of steak. Recommended maybe for two people. But the service left something to be desired. We were there on a Sunday night around 7pm. The restaurant was at least 50% empty but still the hostess kept us waiting for 10-20 minutes outside. When we asked a few times when we could be seated, she didn't offer any explanation. Others were waiting too. Why -- to make the place look busy with ppl standing outside?? When we were finally seated, it was a tiny table for the 3 of us, when there were plenty of free tables around. We could barely put the bread on the table. Even when we finished eating, the restaurant was not completely full, so it's not like they had a ton of reservations or anything.","[1.0, 0.0]"

If you're not really a beer, like me, you can't really appreciate the overwhelming selection available at your fingertips. Thank god, I know what I do like and I stuck to my pilsners. The beer was good but like I said I'm not much of a beer drinker and can't truly appreciate the taste or freshness or whatever I'm supposed to analyze. The food was a definite no go! I ordered the lamb shepherd's pie so overwhelmingly greasy and too gamey. I like lamb but something about that lamb was too wild, maybe he/she really frolicked in the wild, thus my inability to recognized real game.... Yea I don't really think so, it wasn't good. And the grease! Ewww it created a red pool of yuck in the dish, no thank you. I didn't finish it, I tried to pawn it off but no takes. Service was great things came fast and she was around to get drink orders. Décor was nicely themed going for the beer around the world look. Tables were large slabs of wood on top of barrels. It good for a medium size group because our always large group was pouring out the sides of the table and stealing chairs from other tables...  Yes we are that crew!

"This weekend we got a bunch of friends together to ""trek"" to Red Hook (and by trek, I mean we had varying routes of subways/buses/fine-I'll-just-take-a-car to get there). After going to a few other places, we ended up staying at Ice House for longer than we planned. For good reason! Although it had rained earlier in the day, the backyard was pleasant and we were able to grab some paper towels to dry off the seats. The servers were on. the. ball. We weren't the only large party there, but they were constantly circulating making sure everyone had drinks, food, and were generally satisfied. Seriously, everyone on staff this past Saturday was super helpful and incredibly efficient. Because I'd never been there before, I hadn't had the pleasure of partaking in $5 Tecate-and-tequila deals. Wait for it: that isn't even a happy hour special, you can get it all the darn time. The cluster of Tecate cans and shot glasses left in our wake was a good indication of how quickly we took advantage of it. On top of that, the onion rings were superb. Friends got french fries, wings, burgers and sandwiches, and everything was tasty (and delivered fairly quickly, considering the limited kitchen space). Great for a group, great for a few hours in the fresh Red Hook air, I'd recommend this ten times over if I could. Go there.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow!  What a great new bar in Old City!   So many places to choose from, but my sister and I decided to try Sto's for lunch today.  Couldn't have picked a better place.   Great beers on tap -- I had Troegs Dreamweaver, a wheat beer, and Walt Wit, a Belgian White.  Both were great, and the Walt Wit was a special so only $3.50 for a pint!  They also had a huge selection of bottled beers available and some nice drink specials.  The food was awesome -- lot's of bar food classics, but also some unique offerings.  While tempted by the wings (various sauces and a great price), I had to try something different.  Scrapple sticks = awesome!  I don't know if they have them anywhere else in Philly (you'd kinda think its a no brainer since scrapple is a Philly favorite), but I've never seen them.  Crispy and delicious with applesauce dip.  The cream cheese balls were also amazing.  I've had cream cheese in poppers before but never just cream cheese in a crispy coating with a yummy strawberry dipping sauce.  So good!  Their signature sandwich, the Stogie, was to die for.  Hoagie meats in an amazing crust (not quite calzone since open and not quite flatbread, but whatever it is it's delicious) with romaine, thinly sliced onions and the tastiest sauce ever!  Great portion sizes (thankfully the waitress warned us that the Stogie was huge, so we shared).  The staff was friendly and efficient, especially our waitress, Lindsey.  We even chatted a bit with the owner, who was a great guy.  I'm sure this place will be a great success. Great beers, awesome food, great prices, nice atmosphere and tons of TVs.  I know I'll be back frequently!   More beers to try, and I think the Stogie might be addicting, though I'm determined to try the wings next time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Most of the restaurants catering to the other south Indian cuisines. Was delightfully surprised to find a restaurant that can make a difference. Not like most of the Indian restaurants in the area. I had my parents with me as well, who are more well versed with Kerala cuisine. Had the chemeen ularthiyathu and the  attirachi ullarthiyathu as appetizers. The flavors were really nice and quite authentic. The meen pollichathu was tasty with all the masala having thoroughly caught in the fish. The presentation of the fish was awesome as well. The choice of menu was really nice. Presentation and ambience also excellent, I wish we had a branch opening in Virginia as well. I also would try to catch their buffet next time I am in the region. The staff, Chef Mathew and Thomas are quite attentive and gave more insight on to some of these items I have been having for a while.

"This place had decent reviews so we decided to try it. I don't like writing bad reviews but since I depend on them to choose where we will eat, I have to be honest. . We were very disappointed. The service was good but I can't say the same for the food or the value.  We had the Buffalo shrimp appetizer - medium size shrimp at best. It was $7.95 for 5 shrimp. They were not breaded and they were served with cheap tasting blue cheese dressing. The seafood chowder was watery - not creamy. . The fried shrimp were tasteless and rubbery. The french fries tasted like they were frozen before being fried. The fish and chips - priced at $13.95 on the menu but according to our server ""that is for a thinner fish called 'bassi' or 'basa."" (not sure which). If you want cod, the thicker fish, it's an additional $3. There was one piece of cod with some french fries and cole slaw for $16.95. A total let down...this is supposed to be ""what they do best."" It was also a turn off to be told we had to pay $3 extra for cod which is what should be used anyway. Don't advertise $13.95 fish and chips and then tell me when I order that basically I have to pay an additional $3  for the real thing. We will not be going back to Argyle...not good and pricey.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of the most delicious places to eat with so many options that are vegetarian friendly. Whether it's dining in our take out, the ingredients always taste fresh. Thang (tofu noodle soup) has some kick to it from the ginger and feels healthier to eat than chicken noodle soup when you're feeling a little under the weather. The broth isn't oily. The spicy potato salads are fantastic and have great flavors! We will always order momos, which are hearty dumplings, either pan fried (my preference) or steamed. I think the beef ones are taster than the chicken. Their momos are a must try! Chili dofu is another one of my favorite dishes here. The tofu soaks up all the flavors of the accompanied veggies that are in the dish and just tastes super fresh with the help of cilantro. Another tasty vegetarian dish is the tsel shesha, which has sautéed mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini and other veggies. I mean, who doesn't like zucchini? They have non vegetarian variations of this dish, but there are times the beef dishes are tough to chew. Regardless, they are still yummy! There's a chili shrimp dish that is pretty damn good. It's got great flavor that isn't just melt your mouth spicy. However, if you would like more spice, all the dishes come with a spicy chutney.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Oil:water::indoor seating:Philly steak joints. -A brief recounting of how your gentle correspondent came to eat hot cheesesteak whilest shivering in frigid cold and cursing the gods of weather- In all my time in San Francisco, I have never lost my absolute contempt for the wimpyness my fellow citizens express at the slightest hint of actual weather.  Temps below 58 degrees, rainfall beyond a slight misting, and even the slightest hint of wind drive people into a Chicken Little-esque panic.  Meanwhile, I've lived places where the high was occasionally -10, and I've watched a tornado make its way through a valley while on horseback, wearing only a t-shirt.  Am I saying I'm better than my neighbors?  Not necessarily.  But maybe. Right about the time I was sinking my teeth into 6 inches of hot cheesy steak, this attitude was coming back to haunt me.  See, I had accidentally journeyed back into the land of real weather (and real cheesesteak), in the form of Philly in October.  And, apparently, the gods of wind and rain had missed kicking my ass for the last several years, and attempted to make up for it by visiting upon the greater Eastern Seaboard a fall storm of truly epic proportions.  And all I had brought with me was some long sleeve shirts and my rain jacket.  Plenty enough protection for San Francisco winter, but sadly inadequate for a Philly Phall storm. You simply cannot visit Philly without devouring a cheesesteak or 2 or 12, and so a group of us headed out to the Great Corner, wherein Pat's King of Steak faces off against another cheesesteak legend.  I opted for Pat's, because both restaurants were equally devoid of any kind of real shelter or heat.  It can safely be said that few visitors attacked their cheesesteak and fries with greater ferocity than I, if only because I knew I had to get that cheesesteak up in me before I could escape to the artificial heat of the nearby sports bar. Lasting impressions: be authentic and go for the Velveeta cheese; fries aren't great; the hot peppers would be more enjoyable if they were sliced rather than served whole; I'm glad the bell peppers were optional, because I'm very allergic and I was nervous.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Best cheesesteaks in Philly? A definite NO. I've found more flavor in a microwave sandwich. In combination to the unappealing food you've got the unappealing ""staff"" who acted like they just hate their customers. Combine the last element a gawdy right wing ""God bless America and nowhere else"" element made the whole experience unpleasant. Seriously they had ""freedom fries"" on the menu. I must have fallen into a time warp because apparently it was 2003 there. Also, I'm from the US and I really wanted to order in German just to make them angry over the ""speak American"" sign. I like my fast food to come without a political message being forced down my throat. Geno's is a long lined, unfriendly, overtly political, tourist trap serving overpriced and bland food. Also if you are a foreign tourist, or have some difficulty speaking English I'd check to make sure they didn't spit in your food. Best part of Geno's? Leaving Geno's and resolving never to return.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This restarant  is the best kept secret in Montclair. It's  THE place to go if you want quality Haitian Food with excellent presentation. I have been here on a date with my Significant Other, a late lunch with my best friend, hosted my brothers birthday party here, and even called and picked up some food to go. Each time we had a great experience.  There is something for everybody, from vegetarians to the most pickiest of eaters! The owner is attentive to your every need and very professional. I can say the same for his staff as well. The ambience is amazing. The decor and music paired with the delicious Carribean food almost makes you feel like you are on a mini island vacation. I cant wait to go back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Like many of the other reviewers, I love La Colombe coffees, and as such I put a visit to their Fishtown spot on my to-do list for the holidays.  Beautiful facility, but in two visits in two successive days, my coffee was cold.  The first day was brewed, the 2nd day was a latte.  2 visits, two people, four lukewarm cups of Joe.  Also on the 2nd visit, the cashier, when talking to the barista, felt the need to put her hand on our plates and spoons that were set out waiting for our cups. Hands that handle money shouldn't handle eating utensils.   BTW I bought the Rum, pricy for rum, but very tasty.  They call it a rum for bourbon drinkers.  It's not really a substitute for bourbon, but has an close similarity to Patron coffee tequila.  I recommend adding it to your bar.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My wife is from Vermont, and this location is quite close to her house.  She has been visiting here for a decade or more, but today's visit was my first time in for something to eat.   First thing I noticed was they have several beers on tap.  Something like 10-12 different beers to choose from.  But since I don't like my wife's driving, I opted not to drink on this stop. :-)   The Setup:  Pretty casual in here, with plenty of space, and a TV playing the ESPN Bowl Games. They've also got several 'old style' video games in here as well. Pinball machines and arcade games from the '80's era.  Therefore, if you have kids, great place to stop in and let them play around a little bit. The Pizza:  We ordered up a Vegetarian (for one of my sons who has now been a Vegetarian for - 2 days, wonder how long that kick lasts, bwahah!)  And also a pizza with everything (for me).  The vegetarian pizza was not greasy and very tasty actually,  and the pizza with everything was greasier, but that is the way I would expect a pizza with a lot of meat and cheese toppings to be.  Very good pizza, cooked right, and tasty.   Summing it up:  Nice little place to stop in with the kids (for video games), or without the kids (for a beer).  And great pizza.   Next time I visit VT, we'll be stopping in here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Getting into a debate about pizza with someone can be just as dangerous as opening up a discussion about religion or politics...it is something that can lead to a huge argument. But when we decide we want pizza...there is usually no debate about where we're headed. And we'll defy anyone to show us if there is any better pizza than the square pizzas at L&B Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn , N.Y. This place is simply iconic. It has been around for generations and continues to be as popular as it ever was. During the warmer weather, the lines for pizza and their famous spumoni can be winding around the large area of picnic-style tables which are always packed. And during the colder months, there are always people vying for a table inside the pizzeria which is separate from the more formal restaurant. We can never get enough of the pizza...which explains why we recently went for dinner and drove back over the two bridges the very next day to get more for lunch. And, of course, you can't leave without finishing it all off with the best spumoni you will ever find. This place is frequented by the locals...and it is also revisited often by those who have moved away. During our last visit someone said that they traveled a great distance to bring their family for dinner because, ""You just can't find this kind of pizza and dessert any place else. It makes you feel like you are home."" Hmmm...he is so right. Visit the Karmin Kuisine Tour at our website or on Facebook.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Mes Reves is a wonderful French restaurant that has found it's way to Bloomfield, but close enough to both Montclair and Glen Ridge. For those of us who dine often in Montclair and the city, I am happy to add this to our list of ""go to"" spots! The menu touches on everything from steak frites to sauteed skate, duck and a roasted chicken entree. Appetizers include a lovely puff pastry mushroom tart, crabcake, salads, etc. When souffles are offered upon ordering dinner as specials for dessert, order one! They are light and airy and not eggy. Portions are generous and everything is meticulously prepared. The waitstaff is attentive and not at all intrusive. BYOB is always a plus. Mes Reves is on par with any and every fine dining spot in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had the short ribs with noodles abd goat cheese, my husband had the steak and crab cake, my sister had the crab cake and mom had the farm chicken. All the dishes were cooked to perfection.

"Good, pricey food with papercuts!!  The food was good - really satisfying - fried chicken and waffles was great. Burger was delicious. Pecan sundae, delish. Ambiance great. They accomodate the early kid crowd really well. Two things left me kind of feeling like 'eh, it was good but...' And those two things were 1. price - through down way too much for what we got - it's great to get sold food, but man, so pricey. $18 for fried chicken is hard to swallow (but went down great). But I guess that can be written off to living in this area, an area where burritos are about $9...so what can you do. My second negative is kind of side note - but the paper that they cover the table top is  a serious paper cut causer! I got one and this morning (day after) we noticed our 7 month old had a paper cut on her hand. This is an easy fix...question is...will they?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been traveling to New York once a year and the first time I ventured out on my own, I was determined to try some authentic NYC pizza. I did my research and decided on Lombardis. It was walking distance from where I'd be and it's Americas first Pizzaria. Can't argue with that. I went in by myself and ordered the tomato and mozzarella with basil. Let me just say, it was everything I was hoping it would be. The crust was thin and super crispy. It had that slight oven char on the bottom, which I love. The cheese was delicious. Nice and stretchy. The tomatos were so fresh and they were still juicy even though they were just cooked in a very hot oven. The basil added that perfect bright herby flavor and complemented everything wonderfuly. The best thing about their pizza is their sauce. The tomato sauce was absolutley perfect. It was savory and acidic. Thats the way tomato sauce should always be. Some places like to put too much sugar in their tomato sauce and I hate that. Lombardis makes their sauce EXACTLY how I like it. The great thing about this place is that you really can taste the freshness of all their ingredients. It's like they get fresh batches of everything every day. I wouldn't be surprised if they do, I mean it's New York. Another great thing about their pizza is their super crispy crust. It provides a real variation of texture with the other soft ingredients. Lombardis Pizza is the best pizza I have had so far, but I'm always on the look out for something better. Oh, and if you come to visit Lombardis, don't forget cash, as it is a CASH ONLY establishment. They do have an ATM inside, but you'll be charged that annoying fee.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had the turkey burger with a sirachi (sp?) sauce and cheddar cheese (option to also have avocado on it).  The burger was actually juicy and the sauce was a nice touch. My friend had the Grande mac 'n cheese which was delicious.  A lot of reviews commented on the strong truffle oil presence, which I don't like, but I didn't think it was too strong. Mimosas were good.  Not too much pulp in the o.j. which is my pet peeve. I would love to go back and try one of their egg dishes or one of their croque monsieur dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Kefi = greek for tasty in my universal translator. Try getting the dipping spread plate for the table and everyone will be happy after the long wait for a table.

I have been here a couple times, and everyone I have been with has been a fan. I had the ravioli and the egglant 'falafel pita.' I felt the falafel could have been cooked more thoroughly and there should have been more of the 'white crack sauce' to balance the dry-ness. I really wished I could have switched the forgettable fries for something else without paying an extra $2. The ravioli was scrumptious, including the fried onion toppings.

"I came to Saxon and Parole not long after they opened, and I've been back several times since. it's rare to find a new hotspot like this one that actually takes such great care of its customers. They had notes on my previous visits, and sent me a complimentary mushroom pot once because they remembered that I loved it the previous time! and the owner himself delivered it to me, nicest guy ever. that scores BIG points in my books. Okay, now onto brunch. They started doing brunch a couple of weeks ago, and it's UM-AZING!!! First of all, the bloody mary bar: when you order a DIY bloody mary, they give you a glass filled with vodka and the most amazing bloody mary mix I've ever had. I asked them why I tasted so good and so fresh, and they said they squeeze the tomatoes (and other 'secret ingredients'!) in the morning. The juice tastes amazing, and knowing I was drinking fresh juice felt like my bloody mary was actually healthy? um, um... I then went to their beautiful display of items to add to the already delicious bloody mary. The biggest task there is not to go overboard and ruin your drink by adding too many of these tempting, delicious ingredients. I knew I could easily get carried away, so I packed my drink with the fresh pickles they had there (no risk of ruining my drink with pickles!) - all these amazing Rick's Pickles they have are ridonculously good. I did, as expected, go overboard, and my drink looked like a vegetable garden! Was delicious though. I had 2 of these, then switched to one of their 'seasonal bellinis', which was equally delicious and fresh. okay, now onto the food. love love love. LOVE. my boyfriend and I shared a bunch of dishes. Not something I normally do at brunch, but the menu looked so good, I just couldn't choose. we had the BIG BLAT - Bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato. This sandwich was HUMONGOUS, and absolutely delicious. came on a really cute chopping board with a serious steak knife. That dish alone would have fed the 2 of us. We also had the pancakes, which were delicious, and the celery oatmeal. The oatmeal was not savory nor sweet, and packed unusual yet addictive flavors. Very intriguing dish. I'll be back for that one alone. We sat at the bar, and had very attentive service from one of their cute aussie bartenders. we sat for hours with the newspapers, they played some fine tunes, and we watched the Bowery madness from the comfort of the Saxon + Parole bar.

Totally reminded us of places back home in Capitol Hill and Ballard, Seattle as well as SE Portland, so it was a nice way to start off our trip. Portions are small, so be prepared to order multiple items if you've got an appetite. The Angry Hippie was great, I could've easily devoured 2 orders of those creamy eggs and grits.

"By far THE WORST service I have ever had at a restaurant/bar. First it took at least 15 minutes to get our drink menu, then when the waitress finally brought out our drinks she spilled mine and didn't even bring me a napkin to clean it up or a replacement that wasn't half full. Then when we the baked macaroni and corn on the Cobb (as well as some other food that was delicious). When our food came out it was baked macaroni and a Cobb salad? When we questioned the Cobb salad the waitress said ""well the corn on the Cobb is part of an entree... You ordered something that isn't on the menu"" with attitude. WHY DIDNT SHE SAY THAY WHEN WE ORDERED IT? The last straw was when she brought out our check and it included our party of four and the party of 2 seated next to us (friends of ours that we met while there). We asked her if she would split the check bc we weren't together and she refused. Told us to just do the math and tell her who is paying for what. When we asked if we could just circle what was ours she said ""NO you can do the math and tell me what you want on each card"" and then she walked away. (Never even gave us a pen to write down totals) I've never been so disrespected by someone in the food industry. When we left I handed her the check all divided per table and told her to let me know if she needed me to do anything else for her before I left. Service was laughable.

"I went here with a friend for lunch once. Before I spoke to anyone, I noticed that I really liked the ""uniforms"" or outfits the waitresses were wearing. Unfortunately, once I started talking to the hostess, I wasn't excited anymore. I must admit my friend and I were being a bit indecisive about where we wanted to eat (inside or outside) and I wasn't hungry at that moment but I told her that I would sit with her while she ate. The hostess told us that we couldn't sit down unless both of us were eating, which I thought was a little odd. We decided to leave (mostly because of the hostess' attitude) so we went outside and then we decided to stay after all (I told you we were being indecisive). She reminded us with her rude tone that we couldn't sit down if we weren't both eating and we told her we would both get a little something. She took us to our table and literally threw our menus at us. As someone who used to live in LA (for 5 hellish years), I know pretense when I see it and this place just gives off that vibe. Like, ""Are you good enough to eat here?"" I don't eat at places because everyone else does--I eat at them because they're good and I enjoy myself.

"Went to dinner here for the first time last night with a few friends and it was amazing. I think It was probably the best Thai food I've ever had.  NYC is completely over saturated with THai food and I think I just realized what Thai food is actually supposed to taste like.  The flavors and spice combinations where right on. Nothing was over seasoned but just left a great taste in your mouth. Nothing was too saucy or greasy(even the fried food). Often times when you order spring rolls you bite into them and all you taste is the fried wrapper and grease is all over the place. Chef Hong's spring rolls, even though they are fried there is no grease and you actually taste all of the veggies inside. THere were 4 of us and we all ordered something different so we could taste everything. Every dish we had was just as good as the other(Grandma's Fried Rice,Braised Short Ribs,Pad THai Special,Lobster in Coconut Sauce)  You can tell that Chef Hong is truly passionate about food and preparing it. She takes the time to walk around and check in with the tables and is very sweet!!  This last comment is coming from someone that worked in NYC restaurants for years with Chef's and owners yelling and screaming no stop.You can always tell if a chef is truly a good person based on the energy of her staff and the energy at Ngam is great!! It is open style kitchen so you can she that she is engaging her staff and kind to them as opposed to screaming and yelling at them . This is  a breathe of fresh air in an industry that is surrounded by arrogant,rock star chef's that like to rule based on fear and anger.  Check it out.... you won't be disappointed!!! PS- Forgot to mention the homemade strawberry chili soda is amazing!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

First time customer and I ordered a easy chicken parm. Three pieces of ultra thin non existant chicken loaded with bread crumbs. The bread crumbs was thicker than the meat! it was like eating a loaf of sticky  bread. The bread was not good at all aswell and Hardly any red sauce. And it was 7 bucks I wish I never spent.

"This place is so beautiful.  I want to know who designed it.  I first saw it one night about a month ago when I was coming back from the Bell House. They have this adorable facade along one of the outdoor walls made up to look like apartments, complete with curtains and flower baskets and lights in the windows.  There's a ""for rent"" sign in one of the windows and I turned to my boyfriend and whispered, ""I want to live here"" (whispered low enough that no one could overhear and snatch it up before me).  I kept squinting and trying to read the phone number on the sign so I could call the next morning (even though I'm not even in the market for a new apartment), and then finally I realized that there was no way to enter these apartments when the restaurant gates were closed for the night, and that the doorways led to the walls of the neighboring warehouse, and finally I said, ""Nope, I don't think these are real apartments."" But I wasn't upset.  It was a fun illusion. This was two weeks before the Bahche officially opened but even then everything looked cute and perfect, and so I kept walking by and checking on the progress, and I noticed that during the day they would take down the chairs and set it up as if the restaurant were already running, as if they were trying to prepare in advance for every contingency.  I think whoever created this place must be very meticulous, which you can see in every perfect little detail of the design, and the spotlessness of the kitchen, and the glistening loveliness of the pastries. I've heard that bakers have to be meticulous and exacting in their craft, so maybe when you're a baker, it naturally extends to everything else. When I finally went here for dinner I was delighted, like a child, to see that the lights in the windows of the little faux apartments occasionally turn off, and then another turns on, like windows might do in a real apartment building.  Was it necessary that they put in the time and care to coordinate the lights behind the fake windows?  No, of course not.  But perhaps that's what made it so utterly delightful.  I like it when people put in that extra touch.  It's a long walk for me but I'm looking forward to going back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I finally got around to trying Hummus and I'm pretty happy that I did. It was a step above fast fast food Falafel making it much better than Maoz. Yet it still fell a step below places like Alyan's (probably biased because everything does to my taste buds). It delivered on fresh ingredients and had an addicting hummus. The only flaws I found was that the Falafel balls were big enough to push all of the other ingredients towards the back of the sandwich instead of it being a little more spread out. The ""hot"" sauce also left a lot to be desired. I also picked up fries on the side, and for a middle eastern place they were much better than I expected them to be. They easily made my top ten in fact. seasoned to perfection with all kinds of spices. good with ketchup but better without. Hummus is a spot that I'm definitely keeping my eye on in the future.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The spaghetti and meatballs seems like a simple dish to order at a restaurant, but theirs is delicious.

"Spanish cuisine is, perhaps, my favorite. Casa Mono is thought by many to be the best place for tapas in NY. We were excited. The place is small, the tables were packed and the ambiance was casual. Service was pretty good. We ordered and the food arrived quickly. We started with Pan con Tomate which was more like a bruschetta than what I typically see in Bilbao or San Sebastian. Well...OK but more Italian than Spanish. Next was Bacalao Croquetas with Orange Alioli. This cod and potato croquet was fine. Next came Pumpkin and Goat Cheese Croquetas. These were better. The felicitous combination of pumpkin and goat cheese was delightful. Next we ordered Jamón Iberico. This was a disaster. This should be sliced paper thin...almost translucent. Here it was offered in chunks. All the flavor was wasted. What is the chef thinking? Oxtail Stuffed Piquillo Peppers was fine...nothing revelatory is seemed a bit bland actually. Patatas Bravas filled out the order. It was bland as well. All of what we ordered made me long for Contigo in San Francisco. In a place as large as Manhattan, there has got to be a good tapas place. This aint it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"No one does it like Mama's When is the last time you asked yourself, ""Where can I get some good vegetarian food?"" After visiting this Kosher Middle Eastern restaurant in Center City, a short walk from the 22nd st Trader Joes, you'll slap yourself for not asking more often. To say the least, Mama's Vegetarian was a pleasant surprise from the monotony of the average college diet of pizza, ramen, and buffalo wings. The menu is dedicated to a handful of popular eats including, falafel, latkes, hummus platters, borekas, (thin and flakey phyllo dough pockets stuffed with spinach, potato, or mushroom) stuffed grape leaves, and desserts such as baklava and apple cake.   We ordered the house specialty, the falafel sandwich, a side of fries, a soda, and some baklava for dessert. The falafels were fresh from the fryer and were crunchy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside like they should be. Yum. Shaped like a golf balls, they were stuffed into a freshly baked pita pocket with its usual accompaniments. These included cabbage, hummus, tahini sauce, spicy sauce, cucumbers, diced tomatoes and an unusual choice, pickled mango sauce. My first bite was a satisfying one. The warmth and crunch of an expertly cooked falafel ball covered with three homemade sauces and the cool and refreshing taste of cucumber and tomato. My second bite was even better, now including the cabbage and even more of the spicy sauce, which delivered more heat than your average diner counter version. This however, complemented the whole sandwich wonderfully. While enjoying my well-made (good job guys!) sandwich,  I soaked in the atmosphere of the place. Mama's is small, only seating about 20  and is sparingly decorated save for a wall cluttered with awards from over the years and a large framed poster of the Western Wall, one of the most sacred sites of Judaism in Jerusalem. I let my mind's eye transport me to the wall, where I was under an awning escaping the heat of the day and enjoying a wonderfully composed falafel; a filling, flavorful, and refreshing experience. The open bar salad bar is complementary to anyone who orders a sandwich and is filled with pickles hot peppers, olives, and other random salty vinegary tidbits which I took a generous cup of back to my table to nibble in between my bites from my hefty- sized sandwich. We misjudged the size of our appetite since our side of fries was also more than meets the eye. To our surprise, the paper boat was stacked at least a solo cup high with fries! At first glance we exchanged looks of defeat since to our surprise our sandwich nearly made us want to roll over and take a nap, in a stuffed, satisfied sort of way. None the less, we gladly found room for the baklava which was not overly sweet from the sugar syrup which harmonized not dominated the nutty interior. Truly a treat to savor. The honest friendliness of the two guys behind the counter reminded me of old friends trading jokes with each other at the grill during a summer time bbq. They proved to be both knowledgeable and friendly, sensing our timid curiosity, they opened us up to asking questions about the menu which they where happy to do. Their service was as warm as the freshly fried falafel they served. While we did not get to sample nearly as much as we would have liked from the menu, it was off to a great start. This tiny gem makes you feel like a scout for Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and a penny pinching college student at the same time. This feast for two to my wallet's delight only set me back around $17. A good deal even in Moses' time I joked on the walk back to the apartment. Next time you're in the area, stop by Mama's Vegetarian; she'll do you right.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Ya Ya Noodles offers a wide variety of Asian noodles and rices, they serve dishes with Chinese, Japanese, Singapore, and Thai fare, etc. My all-time favorite is the Thai silver noodles. The home style noodles are really good too.  The rice dishes are just OK (fried rice tastes overly greasy).   I also enjoy their ""xiao long bao"" or steamed pork buns as indicated under the appetizer section.  Or, ""little dragon buns"" as my friends and I call it.  The steamed buns aren't as heavy/starchy as some of the other places.  It's a must try!

"My husband and I explored this little gem's fare one Saturday evening. Beware, there will be a waiting list if after 5 or 6. Luckily, it wasn't too chilly that night, so we strolled around the neighborhood to kill time. When we returned, they seated us immediately. The place is fairly tiny, so expect to squeeze into your booth or table and be seated extremely close to other parties. We ordered a pitcher of the red sangria. It was alright, but tasted like it had not been aged long enough. (3 days is the norm, right?!) The waiter wasn't extremely friendly. He sensed our Southern Accents and immediately started ex-plain-ing thing ver-ry slowly for us so as to not overwhelm us by the ""foreign"" tapas menu. We asked specifically for the Piquillo Peppers, which they were ""out"" of that night due to a ""nationwide shortage"". We asked if he had an inkling as to when they might return. He asked us the daunting no-no question: ""How long are you guys in town for?"" Ha. I love that one. We LIVE here, ya jerk! Then, when my husband began explaining that he had the peppers in Barcelona a few weeks ago, (and a few months before that in vegas) and we'd come the especially for that. Needless to say, he stopped talking down to us.... Okay, it sounded like my review was going down-hill, but why the 4 stars you say? Because the taste is absolutely AMAZING! I mean, melt in your mouth, heaven on a spoon, fabulosity. From the tender and amazing lamb, to the prosciutto, to the bread smothered in tomato and spices... everything was absolutely de-LISH! The portions are even tinier than most tapas venues, and the bill will not be cheap, but you must experience the taste of this little tapas Heaven. I'll be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Best nachos and tacos in the city. The good: All their tacos (yes...I've had them all). Carne asada nachos w/ black beans & guac on the side The could-be-improved: Seating. Since I don't live in EV, and since tacos presumably wouldn't travel too well up to midtown, I'm forced to eat my tacos where I buy them.  Due to Diana's limited seating (7-8 stools in the back of the place), this could potentially be a problem. So far, though, I'm 2 for 2 in finding a place to sit, and I'd 100% wait 15-20 minutes for a seat to open up just so I could enjoy the food hot & fresh at this place. Hands down, Taqueria Diana has the best mexican food in the city (limited to tacos and nachos from my experiences this far), arguably the best I've ever had anywhere.

"My boyfriend and I made a 8:45pm reservation for Friday night but we got there early and they were able to accommodate us. Where do I begin... White linen table cloths, waiters in traditional outfits..it really is in the details that make experiences memorable. We started off with their Black Label Burger as an app(recommended by our waiter). They even split it in half for us. What can I say, it's famous for a reason! So juicy, so decadent, I could've eaten 2 of them. Literally devoured my half in 2 bites. Which brings me to my ONLY con, it was a tad on the small side for the price. But Hey, quality over quantity right? We then split the Steak for 2, perfectly cooked to our medium rare specifications. My boyfriend even hailed it as the best steak he's ever had! Lastly, we topped it all off with the soufle which I could've done without but I always need a sweet ending to a meal. It was rich but nothing spectacular to write home about. Oh Yea, we also got a bottle of their French Cab that our waiter gave us a brief tutorial/history on. It tasted sweeter than other cabs we've had in the past, apparently it's because French grapes are different..Who knew?

"This place came highly recommended by several friends, so I was eager to try it out. After reading a bunch of yelp reviews, I realized that this place probably wasn't the best place to bring a bottle of wine, but I did anyway. My friend asked for glasses, and they happily fetched us some wine glasses. But they didn't have an ice bucket, and didn't offer any way to chill the ice, so we ended up drinking a glass each and putting the wine away. I ordered the roast duck noodles, while my friend got the beef brisket. We also split the coconut curry chicken dumplings. Everything was delicious! I wish I could eat it forever. The roast duck still had bone in it, but the waitress warned me of that before I ordered. My friend's beef brisket was more like short rib, and was delicious. The soups are incredibly rich and savory. However, I really think that there is a bit too much MSG in the food here.. of course I'm not 100% positive, but too much MSG always makes me feel sick and I wasn't feeling the best half way through my meal. The waitress was glad to pack the rest of for me, which I finished later that night (but I got the same sick feeling as before). Maybe it was the duck or some other factor, so next time I'll try the beef brisket. Without an appetizer. Our waitress was great. We had originally ordered a type of dumplings (don't remember), but realized that the curry chicken dumplings sounded so much better. She let us change our order right away without complaint or hesitation. And this place is open late! My friend and I actually came in about half an hour before close, and the staff there seemingly had their dinner next to us. Their food looked amazing, and I'm eager to return just to try what they were having - some kind of roasted fish or something.

"I've been to [the new] Dim Sum Garden about five times.  I really want to give it 3.5 stars because I feel it's slowly slipping due to the high volume of people it gets.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that this Dim Sum Garden has a nice location, ambiance, and great food selection; however the quality of the food that really counts ie xiaolongbaos (soup dumplings) and scallion pancakes has slowly decreased. For the first couple of visits I thought I wouldn't return to the original Dim Sum Garden.  The restaurant was new, clean, and organized and the food was comparable to the original restaurant.  Waiters seemed to be more attentive than the original restaurant and were careful to get orders correct.  They also have started pushing ""special"" dishes of late.  Last visit I got a peanut noodle dish which, while good, was overpriced in my opinion (and my mom makes better). However the soup dumplings have lost some of their lustre of late.  I've found that the dough of the soup dumpling has become increasingly thick.  While this is nice for keeping the soup dumplings from spilling out prior to you eating them, it's a lazy preparation and not how good soup dumplings are prepared.  They are still very tasty, but if we're rating soup dumplings against soup dumplings this isn't a favorable characteristic.  I've also gotten what I'd consider ""underfried"" scallion pancakes where its not just completely fried through and a little soggy on the inside.   All in all this is still one of the better restaurants in Chinatown simply because of the xiaolongbao offering, but I've since started to frequent the original restaurant again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was a little stuffy but it was understandable because they were kind of busy. The waiter came and took our order right away so it was quick. The Summer Rolls we ordered came out quick. The rolls was kinda messy but it was still pretty yummy. The Pho on the other hand was nothing special. We had Pho Tai and the meat cut was fine but the soup is kinda bland.

When people say Philly is a beer capital, it's because of places like Devil's Den.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Discovered by chance on a weekend trip...definitely going back! Don't waste your time trolling reviews for any other place...this is where you want to go. Jack the Horse Tavern is exactly what you look for when in New York; a cozy restaurant with great food at a good price; an attentive, friendly staff; not overcrowded; great beer/wine selection. We were making our way back to the High St subway terminal when we decided to have dinner in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan. As luck would have it, we made our way down Hicks Street instead of Henry St. Henry St is lined with restaurants and we would've been lured into a place to dine, but Hicks St has very few restaurants making this a hidden gem. EVERYONE on the staff was really kind. We were treated like regular customers. Their menu seems to be seasonal and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and very fresh. I'm happy to give this restaurant 5 stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is one good halal cart!!! the reson is simple... they have survived the tense competition in the primordial soup. I have lived in new york for over 40 years and when i first went to them they started out as simple celled organisms. overtime, eventually with the evolutionary process, they developed into more complex, intricate rather, organisms capable of surviving over the next hundred years. for this matter, thier menu consists of multi-celled organisms such as chicken, lamb, beef, bread, rice, salad and mexicans. their food, therefore, is part of the historical process, in the hegelian sense. Marxists, too, love this place because it is the point where the proletariats overthrow the status quo and overcome history. Sincerely, Mr. Birch White","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After a horrifically disgusting experience at the Jean Georges by Columbus Circle, and the microwaved egg incident at the  Jean Georges in the St. Regis Baha Beach I had sworn off anything Jean Georges for years. However, I kept hearing ABC this and ABC Kitchen that, for the last two years or so, so i finally caved in and gave it a go last night. After all, it was only a few short blocks from my house, and I was hungry with nothing to loose. I was pleasantly surprised, this spot redeemed the Jean Georges name for me. I actually even gave it a yelp bookmark. It wasn't bad at all, actually it was 4 stars good. We ordered six different dishes  (Pork and chicken sausage, house made strawberry ricotta, peach tomato gazpacho, fried chicken, chocolate cake, lemon chiffon cake), nothing was bad. It was all actually quite tasty. It's interesting how this was the cheapest of the three Jean Georges I have been to, and yet somehow the best tasting. I recommend giving this place a try!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"In Hartford for a business meeting and Salute was suggested.  What a great Idea!  Classy with out being too formal.  Large glass of wine, delicious house Sauvignon Blanc, and the salmon.  Maybe the best I have ever had.  Generous portion without being too large, and just superbly done.   Moist and hot with a scrumptious sauce.  I could have been satisfied with the potato lasagna side alone. Honestly, I don't stuff myself too often, but we had to try one dessert.  Lemon Italian cake.  Very good.  I would come back here without any question.

"1 of the 2 great pizza places in the Route 206 Princeton-Montgomery area (the other being Rodolfo's in Skillman).  Consistently excellent pizza... my favorite is their Margherita; however, I like eating in (rather than take out) so that I can sample a couple different slices.  Also, they have the BEST wings in the area!  Perfectly crispy and served to your desired level of spiciness.  This is one of the few places that will actually give you hot, if that's what you ask for.  The owners are also very friendly and personable.  If they delivered to my neighborhood, I'd give them a perfect 5 stars.  For delivery, I have to resort to New World Pizza in Skillman which can sometimes be good, but they're too inconsistent.","[1.0, 0.0]"

My girlfriend got chicken tenders(for whatever reason in a burger place?), and those were greasy and after she ate about 1.5 of them, I tried to kill them off but wasn't even interested to after a few bites.

"If you're looking for a Mexican themed place to spend a night amidst hipsters and margaritas, Dos Segundos is the spot.  Fiesta style decor covers the entire location from bright Christmas lights and sombreros, to the bathroom with its hammered metal sink and bright paints.  The dim lighting is a nice balance to make it feel welcoming.   The margaritas are fantastic with an extensive selection.  I'm a big fan of the raspberry as well as El Caliente (though you can really only have one before you're mouth burns and your tired of a drink that tastes vaguely of BBQ sauce).  My last visit also included guacamole and the vegetarian nachos which I couldn't get enough of.  The portions are generous, the price is right, and the flavor is amazing.  A tip of my hat to the responsibility of the employees there as well.  They keep water glasses and baskets of taco chips full at all times - a must do when you're sipping tequila all night. Overall not the right spot to go for dancing or being rowdy, but a really great place to relax and chat with friends if you're interested in sitting at a table or a bar.","[1.0, 0.0]"

But the chicken tikka masala lacked flavor. The chicken also was overcooked with a weird grainy texture. To wash all this down, I had the Mango Lassi which is AMAZING.

The ramen was reasonably priced and the staff were very nice and attentive. We had the takoyaki and I agree with my fellow yelpers that they are a must try. The fish skin-stuff at the top wasn't my favorite but I liked the appetizer in its entirety. My husband got the Mayu Ramen and I had the spicy ramen minus the meat.

"Pommes Frites is a great hole in the wall location. The wonderful FRIED aroma always tends to bring many drunkies, which the workers (on their bad days) have a low tolerance for, but the flavors have always remained  consistent since I first discovered this place back in 2007. This great after-bar (and pretty much any time you're craving it spot) is tiny with a single walk way to get in and out. You might have to suck it in a little just so that people can pass behind you as you order at the counter where you can peep over and watch as the friendly workers fry your Belgian fries, gather your sauces or even put together poutine! Surely their poutine doesn't compare to that of Canadian poutine as the gravy can sometimes be too salty, but if you're craving.. that's closest thing to Canadian poutine that you can get. The sauces are what really makes this place great. The have just over 25 different savory sauces, and offer a few  complimentary sauces as well (the especial sauce consisting of frites sauce, onions and ketchup is one of my faves! It's so simple!).  My top three favorites have to be the Pomegrante Terriyaki, Sweet Mango Chutney and Vietnamese Pineapple. The names of these sauces sound so overbearing and strong, but their flavors are just right. You can never go wrong with these flavors! If you're a sucker for 'packaging' this place can also appeal to you because of the paper cones they serve the frites in! There is very limited seating inside, but there is seating available, I hope you don't mind cozying up next to the stranger neighbors next to you! :) I'd definitely come back and would always suggest this as a simple quick eat of a spot!","[1.0, 0.0]"

We were seated within 5 minutes, and for our first trip here, my friend and I decided to share the signature stuffed French toast and the barking chihuahua breakfast burrito. The mammoth stuffed challah was amazing- we had to bring some home, even though we were tempted to keep stuffing in the bananas and cream! The marinara on the side of the burrito was such a delicious surprise, and everything stayed together in the tight burrito- you could taste each of the fresh ingredients. The kitchen delivered everything already split  onto two plates each for us, which was a very nice bonus!  We had the best of both worlds- savory and sweet, along with hot steaming coffee. The staff were so friendly and helpful- they showed us where to find the bathroom, refilled our water and coffee, and brought extra napkins without being asked. The owner heard it was our first time there and stopped by to say hello and inquire about our meals! It was a gorgeous fall Saturday; the Italian market was in full swing and the restaurant was pleasantly bustling. Next time we will bring a bottle of champagne and order a carafe of orange juice to be extra festive. The prices were so reasonable; I can't wait to go back and try two more dishes!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"One of the better food trucks in the midtown lunch scene. My go-to here is the lemon grilled chicken over cous cous, which is served with a healthy portion of carrots, chickpeas and other veggies with your choice of sauces. Personally, I like to take it easy on the mayo-based sauces, so I opt for the spicy mint (made with yogurt) and the spicy andalusian (red). At $9, it is a decent value considering the amount of chicken and is a good portion for lunch without the dreaded post-lunch itis that you would normally get with chicken over rice. Very friendly service and you can clearly tell that the guys here truly take pride in their craft, which is always refreshing.

"Last sunday, three of my friends and I were hoping to get an early boozy brunch in and when we saw that this place opens at like 8 am for brunch we figured why not!  My one friend got a simple egg, meat, and toast platter while two of my other friends and myself got the healthy eggs benedict.  Not gonna lie, I almost defeated the healthy part and ordered a side of hollondaise on the side for me to slather my plate in.  However, I kept it healthy. The dish arrived with two slices of wheat toast, two poached (but slightly overcooked aka hard yolks) eggs, and a salad that def did not skimp on the avocado and goat cheese. We were all very happy. But enough about that boring stuff. Let's talk about the star of the show.  The night before we went, being the fatty that I am, I was reading reviews to see what I was gonna get for breakfast.  Some random blogger had mentioned apple cider donuts. I pretty much stopped reading the rest of her review once I laid my eyes on those three glorious words.  So, when looking at the menu I didn't see them on there and went ahead and asked our waitress.  She was the best and brought us four donuts as our breakfast appetizer. Aaaaaand then as we were leaving we asked for four donuts to go.  Not only did she package them up all nice, but she gave us an extra donut and gave us that round on the house. My day was made.   Please, I am urging you to drop in and simply order all of the donuts they have in stock (made fresh daily!!!).  Then, take them in all their doughy, delicious, fried, sugary, cinnamony glory and walk to the nearest park and just be happy and fat while stufing your face with these bad boys.  At $1 a piece, I say a minimum of 12 (per person) should suffice. You're welcome.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I don't think you can beat this place. There's an assuredness of preparation and materials that would be expected in a much fancier and more expensive restaurant. A simple $8 rice and beans plate comes out with a pressed form of perfectly-cooked long-grain basmati rice. The beans are covered with an amazing smoky green/brown spicy salsa that I haven't seen the likes of anywhere else north of DC. The fried plantains that come with it are awesome little bundles of plantain fried in a batter like some kind of fritter or something. And it all comes with a zingy cucumber & tomato salad in vinaigrette that blends in perfectly with everything. Order a side of the chorizo, which is outstanding. (Better than anything I found on a recent two week swing through the Yucatan.) And the wine list is really great: nothing over $9 a glass, and you get really high quality selections for that. This is a quality restaurant kitchen masquerading as a simple cafe. Go often (not just for brunch), and explore the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The $13 lunch special (available till 3 or 4) is a good deal. It includes an appetizer (soup or salad), a drink (juices, thai iced tea, sodas, etc) & an entree (red or green curry, basil chicken, etc). The laminated, binder that serves as the menu is colorful & has helpful photos, but it doesn't always indicate how spicy a dish is. We were taken by surprise by how spicy the basil chicken was. Sure, we expected some heat but it fully cleared my sinuses &then some. The coconut chicken soup is delicious. As is the peanut sauce that accompanies the salads, The thai iced tea was wasn't particularly tasty & I can't disagree with what other Yelpers have written - it can take aeons for the staff to take your order.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We had a 5:45 reservation for Valentines day, there were maybe 4 or 5 other couples in the place. As the time went on the place was getting filled.  They were becoming very busy, which in turn made them very disorganized and lacked in service. We got the menu (which was fixed), that's fine, everything seemed to look good. Our waiter takes our drink order, brings our drinks and takes our order, i wanted the fillet, the waiter replied sorry but we ran out of them, which seemed  odd, considering its only 6:00 you have a fixed menu and a whole night a head, dint you plan for these things????? well, he replaced the fillet with a prime rib, fine, I wanted it rare. 45 min goes by we get our food, my steak looked Delicious until i started to cut into it, it was nothing but pure grizzle and fat, i couldn't even cut my rare piece of meat. our waiter was no where in sight, it just hap pend the manager was standing there and and i gave him the fatty steak and told him  I cant eat it. I try and order something else and they told me it would take too long to make,  i picked something else again too long, finally he tells me to get the pasta which was wheat lasagna like pasta, with a sauce and some seafood. 1. I dint like wheat pasta, 2. its like eating cardboard, 3. they were awfully too big.  It was sop pose to take 5 Min's. 45 min later the pasta arrives, at this point I'm not hungry because i am so aggravated, I ask the waiter for a container to take it home and we also asked for the check, as we were packing up I looked down the rows of tables and sure enough, and to my amazement  they had file ts on their plates. Hmmmmm.......NOT RIGHT!!!!!!! I willing to give the place another try  until I was lied to. By them trying to save their pennies, they lost a customer, and i will make damn sure people know what they have done. I forgot to add our waiter disappeared on us after bringing the first round of food, to be never seen again that night.

"A new restaurant in the downtown Princeton area that has definitely drawn some attention. A ""farm to plate"" type restaurant, the chef brings what is currently available from his farm directly to the restaurant. I would definitely give Agricola a solid 3.5 stars with some of the downside being the price/value for the drinks/dishes. The ambience on the day we went for Happy Hour was extremely lively. It was during a March madness game and the open seating bar area was packed (good thing we got there early). The service was excellent with some great recommendations from our waiter. The decor was nice as well. We ordered a variety of their specialty cocktails which ranged in price from about $10-12. The appetizers and dishes that we ordered were good, but for the amount of food provided, it did not justify the price - 3 cod fritters for $12, potato fries for $8, and the strozzapreti pasta for $17. I am interested in coming back to try the full menu in their dining room, especially want to try the braised colorado veal shank.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was looking forward to dining at this restaurant and went there on a Friday night. We were greeted with indifference and seated at a table which was so close to each other that I felt that I was in a aeroplane rather than a restaurant. The waiters were literally touching me while serving the table next to me. I could hear everything from the next table . The food was good but very overpriced as were the drinks. The service was decent. I have dined at many good restaurants and enjoy fine dining. So, if you value some basic things such as comfortable seating, good service, personal space and your wallet , one 53 will disappoint you. As for me, I would rather spend my money at a real good restaurant and get what I have paid for.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I would say, just like Sushi Yasuda, Ippudo's is worth the wait.  It's not as ridiculously expensive, but an appetizer, standard ramen, and dessert as well as drinks (tea) ran up to about $50.  Still, it's pretty standard for NYC.  If you come to NYC, be ready to throw down.  Photos here: rammiegirl.wordpress.com .  I can actually do a pros-cons list for this because there were only 3 things that I ordered: 1.  Ebi-Kani (crab-shrimp) croquettes 2.  Hakata Classic ramen, plus one egg (not recommended but my personal staple for ramen) 3.  Hirata Milk dessert Ebi-Kani Croquettes PROS good to split for 2 (4 pieces each) goes great with the grape tomatoes awesome texture: crispy on the outside, not burnt and then soft and creamy on the inside great ratio of crab and shrimp (kani & ebi, respectively) CONS: not much, maybe price for some people but it is snow crab and it is NYC. Hakata Classic Ramen, plus egg PROS -amazing broth, very flavorful and super savory, pork based -good quantity: I'm a pretty light eater though so don't quote me on this. -request for extra ramen noodles applicable: for those of you who want extra carbs to go with that awesome soup. -egg was perfect. perfect.  Not too salty either. CONS Personally, I'd like more pickled ginger and menma, but that's just my own preference.  Not a carb-heavy girl here. Hirata Milk Dessert: First a brief description literally word for word: ""green tea ice cream parfait with red bean, shiratama mochi, matcha (green tea) jelly, and almond-coconut milk"". I think I just died retyping out that description. PROS -perfect combination of flavors and textures. -you're supposed to dump the milk into the parfait: Admittedly, I was the dumb noob who was sipping it out of the shot glass. Still tasted good though! CONS - Again, my own personal preference, but it needs more matcha jelly haha. AMAZING.  So amazing that some of my ladies at Hopkins and I booked a trip in Jan for Ippudo's again.  :) Cant' wait for round 2!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The cold Buffalo chicken pizza was good. The salad with the shrimp, brought ""a"" shrimp, the pizza wasn't hot, the muscles were small. All in all, not bad but you don't get what you pay for.

"If negative stars were available I would give Lillie's negative 10 stars.  The service was horrible and despicable.  As other reviewers posted, Lillies is especially incompetent when it comes to specialized menus such as brunch menus.  But even aside from that it's just common sense to take the customers' orders 5-10 minutes after they sat down.  We were a group of 40 with reserved seats on October 28, 2012 Sunday and arrived at 12:30pm.  Only after repeated prodding of the 2 waitresses and the hostess, did they finally take our brunch orders.  It took Lillies 1.5 hours to bring out our food while we All commiserated and derisively concurred that we would NEVER return again!   You only get one chance at a first impression. Lillies screwed up in an astronomical and irreparable way and multiplicatively by 40 to the infinite power since We will All tell our friends, relatives and co-workers NEVER to go to Lillies (both locations-in Times Square and Lower Manhattan).   And the person who was paying the entire bill got her food absolutely Last!  The waitresses, waiters, cooks and hostesses seemed inexperienced and oblivious to what their jobs entail.  You don't wait 30-45 minutes to take people's orders!  It didn't matter that the restaurant gave us complimentary wine and mimosas to toast the special event which was the reason why we reserved 40 seats. To add insult to injury, the patrons who arrived long after us got their orders first while We All sat there for One Hour to One Hour and 30 minutes Starving to death!  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but the waitresses, hostesses, waiters and cooks were Totally Incompetent!  They could have brought out 100 bottles of Free Liquor but the Damage Was Done in a Major Way!  All 40 of us Agreed multiplied by the Trillions of Other People we'll Forewarn that We will NEVER go Back to Lillie's Restaurant again!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was a bit skeptical when I told my friend I wanted to get some tea, and he made me go to this place. I was like ""what's the point of paying so much for tea, I could just go to Starbucks""...but it's worth it! :) They have a variety of teas to choose from. I honestly can't even recall the tea that I ordered (so many different names, and I am definitely not a tea-connoisseur) However, they bring your cup of tea (of course) and then a pot of the tea.. So I guess it's worth the 5 or more bucks that you spend on it! The place itself is really cute! I loved the bathrooms...so high tech! I guess it's the Japanese techy-part of it! :) There are private rooms that you can get for like 20-40 a person, depending if you want food or just dessert, which I think would be so awesome to utilize if you want a really romantic date!

"My boyfriend and I accepted  a new years invitation from a friend to join a group of 13 people at Le Barricou for dinner. We were seated about 45 minutes late (reservation for 9pm) and informed the only dinner option was a pre-fixe menu. This was not mentioned on their website which I had checked out before arriving. Having had a late lunch,  sick with a cold, and being a vegetarian the pre-fixe menu did not sound appetizing. Our waitress was at first accommodating saying she would ask the manager if we could instead order some appetizers or small plates. Upon returning from her talk with the manager she informed us we HAD to have the pre-fixe and even if we did not eat it our party would be charged the $35 each for our dinners. In a party of 15 only 3 people did not want the full dinner and we ALL were ordering plenty of cocktails--This was the most absurd thing I've ever experienced. The restaurant had PLENTY of available tables so we definitely were not holding up service by not eating and we all ordered more than $35 in drinks. Drinks, I might add, that took forever to arrive. Finally, when our party was eating dessert one of our party found a wire in his chocolate mousse. The organizer of our party complained and was told they don't even make the dessert in-house. Basically this is singly the very WORST and rudest dining experience I've ever had in Brooklyn. I would never recommend this restaurant. A french restaurant that can't even make mousse?

We had some okay food.

The waiter told us he can't do anything because he is working on cash And cannot legally work in the us. And was very unhappy of the living situation aswel. He told us they live upstairs And was asking us to help them with there status. I wish we could help them , look how owners take advantage of the staff who can't help it.

"So, I decided to try this place out after I saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The food looked pretty good,and it seemed to have a cool atmosphere in general. Although this has nothing to do with the quality of service, or the food, I have to add that the walk from the train to this place was the worst. Especially in the middle of July. So, by the time I got to the restaurant I was in a shitty mood, but I expected the food and good service I saw on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives would uplift my spirits. I was wrong. When I walked in I immediately sat down because I was so hot and tired. The waitress walked over and brought me a menu and a glass of water. When I told her I was ordering to go she snatched the glass of water up so fast I can't even be sure it was actually ever there lol. In retrospect that was pretty funny. I ordered the fried chicken, Mac and cheese, and hush puppies and to be honest it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was average at best. I didn't try the pie, but I'm guessing that's their stand out dish that earns them the recognition that they have because the chicken wasn't amazing by any standards. Maybe someone whose never had good fried chicken in their life would be impressed by this? As far as service and atmosphere goes that was pretty bland as well. The set up of the restaurant it self is very nice, but the people in there bring everything down. Everyone looked miserable like they didn't even want to be there. Far from the smiling faces on tv that coaxed me into going there in the first place. I'd say save your money.

"Continental Midtown was obviously designed by somebody with good taste and a sense of humor. The first thing you notice upon entering is the decor. It's a blast from the past fused with futuristic accents and a significant pop element. Somehow, it all comes together and makes for a very interesting and yet pleasing environment in which to eat. The food was sapid and scrumptious. There are big dishes, which you can eat family style and share with the rest of the table, as well as small dishes if you'd just like something for your self. Everything I sampled was tasty. I especially enjoyed the Thai chicken and spinach ravioli. Dishes ranged from plentiful to sparse, but in the end I think everybody got their fill. All of the food was very well presented, and discussing and sharing food was a springboard for conversation. I wish I had read the rave reviews on yelp about the drinks before eating here. We were a little conservative, ordering just beers and wine, but it was good. They have a big drink menu, and drinks are a little expensive, but you'll get what you pay for. The service was great. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. A fun side note about the bathrooms, the mirrors inside are actually two-way, as in people from outside the bathroom can see through them, as one girl from our party excitedly pointed out upon returning. This just another example of the whimsy and humor in the design. So in short, if you're willing to splurge a little, try Continental for fun ambiance and good food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm giving this location two stars because the food is somewhat redeeming, though not entirely. I rate it only as two stars because their staff is pretty bad, and their management is even worse. The food just isn't worth the wait on a weekend. During the week when you don't need to fight crowds or wait 1.75 hours for a table? Sure. But when they're packed  (as they are during brunch hours every weekend), their staff seems overwhelmed to the point that getting any attention for things like straws or coffee refills is a struggle.  And the food's just not that outstanding to make it worth it.  I'd call it overrated, generally. And don't expect their management to show any level of professionalism if you have an issue, where, for example, you and your family are seated next to four loud, obnoxious, offensive young men in the tiny three-table tin-lined room in the back who completely ruin your casual dining experience by cursing, using offensive language, hitting on the waitresses, and laughing and screeching at ridiculous volumes.  The situation should have been fairly obvious to the staff, but given that they're so busy and inattentive, especially in the back room where there's only three tables, I had to get up and bring it to their attention without causing a scene, myself. By that point, so much time had gone by that moving either the obnoxious foursome or my party would have been pointless. We pretty much got excuses from the manager (who essentially told us it was our fault for not letting anyone know sooner), and didn't so much as offer complimentary coffee after knowing that we'd endured their unruly patrons throughout our entire meal. Basically, she admitted that the group was bad enough to ruin our brunch but basically said, ""sorry, tough luck.""  I realize that a restaurant/cafe only has so much control over the behavior of its patrons, but it also should be generally cognizant of what's going on around its tables and should be willing to offer some sort of acknowledgement when their customers' experience has been ruined by other folks in the cafe. I'm not expecting fine dining, but In a place like that I am at least expecting that I won't be made to feel completely uncomfortable sitting next my 66-year-old parents when eating brunch. Members of a party should be able to talk to each other across the table without having to scream, and if we can't, someone at the restaurant really needs to take some level of responsibility. Bottom line: food was ok, huge portions, but not worth the wait. Their management could use an attitude adjustment, some education in dealing with the fallout of unruly customers, and an overhaul of just their general manner in dealing with the paying public.  They also need more staff during busy times, as their current staff, while seemingly earnest, are too overwhelmed. After about a half dozen brunch visits there over the years and particularly considering the way the patron issue was dealt with today, I won't be bringing my family back, nor will I be recommending this place to friends.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Yeah, the decor is dazzling and trendy, making this place look like a 5-star restaurant while the prices are a bit above the average for a thai/vietnamese restaurant. The reason for one star is very poor service. We sat there for 30 minutes and we were still not getting our food. We didn't order something difficult to make or something involving catching a fish, just a pho bo and a pad see ew. It was 9 p.m. when we walked in and the restaurant was not even busy. Whilst we were waiting, the busboy and the manager came around our table twice but ignored us. So there we canceled our orders and walked out of the restaurant. There are a ton of less expensive thai/vietnamese restaurants with great food in the city. It's totally not worth my time coming back for a $12 pad thai and lousy service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Maddy's is one of my favorite places to eat. Their chips are hand made and delicious, and I aways ask for both the red and green salsas (the green is much spicier, and I really like dipping into both to get a nice mix of spicy and flavorful). I love the Mexican Tacos with spicy pulled pork. The fresh onion and cilantro on top is so much better than Americanized taco toppings. The enchiladas are also fantastic, and you get so much food. They will let you mix sauces on your order too. My boyfriend always raves about their burritos, and my best friend (a flan aficionado), couldn't stop raving about how delicious the flan was.

The prices are more than reasonable and the experience is cool too. If you come to Philly and get your cheesesteak somewhere else... well, you've done yourself a disservice.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So my friend and I originally wanted to try El Vez last Saturday night, but because we hadn't made reservations and didn't want to wait for seats, we instead tried it last night. Earlier in the week, we tried to make reservations but alas, there was ""no availability."" Apparently, they only take reservations for half of the seats, and leave the remainder of them open on a first-come-first-served basis. Okay, whatever. Then we would just get there early, which we did, just around 5:00. However, we were still told that it would be an hour wait, but that we could sit at the bar, which we did. While sitting there sipping our drinks and munching on chips and guacamole (which, by the way, is amaaaazing- freshly made, natural-tasting, and room temperature), we noticed that there were quite a few open tables. Then, suddenly, we were alerted that a reservation canceled at the last minute, so a table was ready for us. Hmmm... interesting. We wondered if the table had been available all along, for it certainly seemed like it was a place that pretended to always be full just to create hype- and to push people to the bar to inflate drink and appetizer sales. That said, I didn't really mind as I enjoy drinking and dining at the bar, and because we were notified half an hour before we had been scheduled to be seated, we opted to stay. And because the guacamole (and the chips, for that matter) had been so filling, we simply shared a taco tasting platter as our ""main course."" Replete with a steak taco, a carnitas taco, a chicken taco, a mahi mahi taco, and a sea bass taco, it was more than enough to leave us satisfied. Furthermore, the fillings were perfectly prepared, seasoned, cooked, and served to perfection. Also, since I had overheard another customer inquiring about the margaritas, and learned that there are two that are not on the menu, one being a habanero-flavored one, I also gave it a try, and it was delicious! So in sum, because the food and the drinks are so well-prepared, I'm going to let slide that little seating issue, and give El Vez the five stars that it deserves. After all, it is a business!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We wanted to go to Blue Ribbon for brunch, but since the wait was 45 mins, we decided to come here instead.  We were just passing by and the food looked good.   I had the french toast and my fiancee the burger, which was nominated the ""best burger in NY"" by Tony Magazine.  (What?  Never heard of it.)  That's what the chalkboard inside the restaurant said anyway.  We were both starving, so as the waitresses brought out other people's food we stared at the food and said mmm that looks good - I wish I ordered that.  Eggs benedict looked good, came with a side salad.  So did some sandwich.  Everything looked good. The french toast was decent, it came with carmelized pears and glazed walnuts which added a yummy dessert-like quality and fruity crunch.  It was good but nothing to rave about.  My fiancee said his burger was one of those where the bread is really buttery, but the meat wasn't too juicy or flavorful.  All the taste came from the bread.  It came with lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles on the side, and fries.  The fries were pretty good.  I decided to get a cup of coffee just because the brown sugar cubes and milk set on the counter in front of us looked so delightfully picture perfect.  The coffee itself was good stuff.     The restaurant had a clean, fresh morning ambiance, with sunlight streaming in the windows.  Overall, an ok meal.  Brunch entrees average at about $10, and sides are kind of expensive at $6.  Our meal totaled around $27 or so: french toast, burger, coffee and coke.  Average all around.  Oh yeah we saw A-list 2 celebs and a supermodel having brunch at the table next to us.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It's a small restaurant with a little bit of outdoor seating.  They have an amazing beer selection and the food is a solid 7/10.  My mom ordered the ""Grand Mere"" mussels which were good but in my opinion, didn't have enough bacon in the sauce (but really, is there EVER enough bacon?!)  I ordered one of the specials they had that day which was a roasted chicken dish.  It was excellent.  Juicy and massive, I had dinner for two days!  The pommes frites that came with my mom's fries were amazing and they were served with mayo...authentic!

Most of the store owners are friendly and you can usually find exactly what you're looking for. As a matter of advice, I would say avoid this place at noon on a weekday- no no, toooooo busy.

Yum, finger licking (literally) good.  The grape soda I also hear is a common favorite, I didn't however indulge in the grape goodness, I would definitely try it the next time.

"I love this place. I think it was the highlight of our trip to NYC. The city can be a little too hectic and our vacation there didn't feel like a vacation at all. Cha-An was really a perfect place for us at the end of a ridiculously busy day and a vacation loaded with spectacular, over-the-top fancy food. First, the space is really nice-- not crazily cramped, very clean, very Japanese-y. We split a tea set / bento box thing which included some fancy green tea, tea-smoked salmon, 15 grain rice, lotus & eggplant, some tofu thing, soup, and a soy/mushroom quiche. Everything was seriously awesome, especially the quiche. What I really love about Cha-An is that all the dishes taste different. A lot of restaurants throw a bento box at you and it is the same sauce or the same ingredients or stock in it. Every dish had a nice, distinctive taste but managed to be light and flavorful, keeping in touch with the fact that you are drinking some gourmet tea. I think Cha-An reminds me a lot of food I get at home or make myself but wayy better. They should make a recipe book and sell it...to me. Come here for great service, great Asian comfort / homestyle food, and to just relax. Love this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been to El Camino twice now in as many weeks and look forward to going back. Both times we had midsized parties of 5-7 people and got seated pretty quickly. There was a wait for the outdoor seating (picnic table-style), but it was worth it for the people watching and to be able to spectate as the table next to us rang up a $700 bill and then had to cut through their tequila haze to deal with it. The food was excellent both times, and between the two groups we sampled quite a few dishes, including: Beef ribs half rack (more like Brontosaurus ribs), pork ribs (excellent), pork shoulder (also excellent), grilled corn, seitan, pulled pork sandwich, a single rib appetizer (the ""loosey"") and sweet potato ice cream. In short, the BBQ is excellent, but it is texas-style, so the sauces are in squeeze bottles on the table and not on your meat. The draft list is local/regional and the margaritas are delicious. For a small supplement, you can have them add a spicy smack to your marg, which I've heard from several sources is well worth the investment.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My second experience at Amada was much better! but that may or may not have been because my employer treated us all out to the chef's tasting menu (Barcelona menu)... haha. This time, I got to sit in the private closed-off room hidden deep inside instead of the rickety tables outside. We were allowed to be as loud as we wanted, and there was ample space for everyone. I also enjoy the ambiance more the deeper I walked into Amada. The food was better this time, too! (Or maybe because I wasn't so careful with the prices.) In particular, I was surprised the asparagus was so soft and tasty--I've never had good asparagus before! The sausages, New York strip, pepperoni, and even the anchovies were also good choices. I personally don't like cheese, but apparently that was phenomenal. The salad was passable, and I thought the seafood paella paled in comparison to the one I had in Barcelona. Still, I can't forget that my glass of water tasted like tequila the first time I came. The piquillos rellenos, croquetas de jamon, revuelto (I can make better mushrooms and I barely cook), chorizo, etc. did not impress me the first time. I definitely liked my server last time better. He happily held conversations with us and explained the menu. This time, the servers kept asking us to pass plates down to them so they wouldn't have to walk around the whole table, collecting. As a former waitress, I understand it's harder to serve groups, but I was astonished at how many times this happened! First it was just one plate, then they would come back and just ask us to pass everything down to other people or ask people to stand up to get their own plate.","[1.0, 0.0]"

This lounge was chic and artsy, but not in an obnoxious way.  I was able to obtain a table on a saturday night around 9:00pm w/o reservations.  I recommend that you DO reserve a table, or you may have to resort to indelible charm as I did.  I was able to snake a table reserved for a group two hours later which was fine because 2 hours (and 6 drinks later) I was planning on shaking my birthday boy tail feathers.  Speaking of my 6 drinks, the first three were Verlaine's infamous Lychee Martinis.  They will be your favorite in the city.  Subtle yet well-balanced taste or Very Asian-girl friendly.  Same goes for the 3 white sangrias I had thereafter.  $5 hhour specials also includes Bloody Mary's and Yuengling which is random, but it's a solid beer so whatev.  The food was as satisfying and tasty as asian-inspired apps can be outside of an asian restaurant, feel me?  Portions were on the lighter side even though I was only looking for food to finger {in the sense of consuming sparingly.] Overall, I would come back for the specials, dumpling dipping sauce, and chill vibe to get the night off right.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Technically, I'd like to give a rating of 2.5. I was very excited to try Sugar Freak and was delighted when my boyfriend and a friend of mine planned a date to finally go. However, I was disappointed with the meal. I wish I could offer a higher review, but unfortunately the food at Sugar Freak doesn't really warrant it. I ordered the crawfish étouffée, my boyfriend had the blackened catfish po'boy with mac and cheese, and our friend the fried chicken. The boy's mac and cheese was fine at the top, but the lower layers were quite bland. I didn't taste his sandwich but he said it was just ok. My friend's fried chicken was dry but well seasoned. Her biscuit however was pretty terrible, which is a sad thing to say about a place touting their southern food. My crawfish étouffée was pleasant, but could have used a bit of spice and some fresh herbs. There was plenty of crawfish, which was very nice, but on the whole I think the dish is overpriced at $18. At the very least they should offer a side salad with entrees. Dessert, however, was delicious. We got the fried pound cake, which was more than plenty to split between three people. It tasted like a cross between a beignet and a funnel cake. So obviously, I was swooning. And it was the best bang for the buck at $6. I might come back for a nightcap and dessert, but most likely not for a meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My girlfriend and I had just moved into the area and we were looking for a new staple thai place. We had tried a few other places in the vicinity and were dissatisfied with the service (inattentive waiters and poor atmosphere). We had just found this place tucked away in a robbinsville stripmall and decided to go give it a shot on date night. What we first noticed was the gorgeous and apparently custom made imported art of the restaurant. I particularly liked the center fountain and the wood carvings. The second was the very upbeat, respectful, and attentive staff. We must have had 3-4 different waiters coming by and clearing the table and cleaning when ever we looked like we were done with the different portions of our meal. The food itself was the best I've had in the area within a reasonable driving distance. The staff was very interested in our opinions of the meal. The chef 'Nui' came out and inquired about our experience in his thick accent. He was very humble as we praised his cooking and presentation of the various dishes we tried. I recommend requesting that he prepare your dish if you want a sure thing. (I'm sure the other chef's are great but I like him) At the end of our meal, the manager (her name was kanika I think) dropped by our table and offered us a mango/rice dish that had a coconut glaze sauce. Now I am really not a fruit fan but my girlfriend and I just couldn't resist indulging. We left stuffed and happy. *Prices: Very respectable, about 12-18 per a dish. Typical. *Atmosphere: Unmatched by any place i've been to in the tri-state area. No joke *What to wear: There were a few folks in t-shirts but most were dressed very well. I'd recommend dressing business casual like you would at any other nice restaurant. *Food: Decent selection, but they are willing to cook some meals outside of the menu as long as it isnt too exotic. They do have a different spice ratio I guess. Medium in most places burns tongues but I eat a lot of spicy food and perhaps my perception was off. *Staff: Most attentive I've seen, but I also make eye contact and signal like any intelligent patron should.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"OK...been coming here for almost 30 years, but you really need to consider if you want to go to a wonderful brunch restaurant and get treated like a tourist just because it is the summer.   Is it really necessary to ask me basic restaurant related questions almost implying that I have  NEVER eaten in a restaurant before....was in the business for 10+ years actually??  And it is even worse to have a college student or aspiring actor or even a graduate of NYU who is old enough to be my child talk to me as if I can't read what's on the menu.   But the WORST is charging me $3.50 for an iced tea (in the summer no less) that is HIGHLY diluted to begin with in a glass FILLED with ice, remove the glass from the table before the initial iced tea is even finished and pointedly ask me if I'd like ""ANOTHER"" iced tea, all for the benefit of charging me another $3.50 for another glass of above mentioned beverage.  Really.....not everyone who goes to brunch in NYC in July is a tourist....maybe just an old time TriBeCa resident, who has patronized the place since the 80's who'd like a wonderful Eggs Benedict to start my lazy Sunday!!!  The foods great but the restaurant attitude of years gone by has got to go away!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Bacon.                  Doughnuts.     Bacon....      Doughnuts. Bacon, Doughnuts. BaconDoughnuts. Not to go all Grover-from-Sesame-Street on you, but the most extraordinary food experiences I've had in this town tend to unite two concepts that had heretofore been disparate, and unites them into a glorious new harmony (the Tarragon Mojito at Artisal way back when had the same effect...).  And now, thanks to Traif, the ""BaconDoughnuts"" experience will be one I relish for some time.  As the Darling Husband said on the short walk home, the BaconDoughnuts alone would be worth a trip to Traif.  However, the entire experience was a joyful exploration of gustatory pleasures, exemplifying the pork/shellfish theme (like the original Iron Chef episodes airing above the bar, which appear to have been selected for their pork-related key ingredients). It was nice, and unusual, to be treated with an amuse-bouche of warm carrot soup with bacon (of course!) and raisins (why not?).  Yummy, buttery, fresh and flavorful.  I agreed with the guy at the next table who said he could eat about ten shotglasses-full. As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a ""small plates/tapas style"" restaurant, which means that we were able to try a wide range of dishes.  We started with a seasonally fresh and zingy snap pea salad with feta, grape tomatoes, avocado, dill, and mint, which was a nice way to warm up the palate before we jumped into the meatier portions of the evening (I'm gathering, from the prior reviews that mention dishes that were not on the menu tonight, that there may be a core set of dishes and then some seasonally-influenced rotating features?) Next up, the bacon-wrapped dates, filled with blue cheese, which had been recommended by our server. (Incidentally, the service was great, we did NOT get the ""have you eaten at Traif before?"" speech, and the experience was altogether speedy and efficient, especially considering that they opened all of a week ago....)  But I digress.  The savory/sweet combo of the dates (presaging the BaconDoughnuts!) was perfectly balanced and exquisite. Next up were the lamb/chorizo meatballs, which were just delicious, slightly gamy, just the right amount of spice, in a mellow tomato sauce.  We followed this with the pork croquettes... which were pretty much what you'd expect from deep-fried chopped barbecue...  athough, from what other reviewers are saying, we might have been better off with the sliders.  The shell-on shrimp were decent, but nothing super-special.   But the bacon doughnuts.... oh man.  Trust me, just go.  Try them, you'll understand.  And then, after all that yumminess?  A dark chocolate/raspberry jam petit fours...  All in all, a great addition to the neighborhood.  Good luck, Traif!  We loved it and we'll be back!  Save us some bacondoughnuts!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Cafe 72 with friends and family. I felt immediately right at home the minute I walked through the doors. The new owners are very down to earth and super nice guys. It is a small, quaint place with seating for approximately 60 people. It is BYOB, so we started off relaxing with a nice bottle of wine. The staff was quick to assist and were there within minutes with a bucket to keep the bottle chilled. The food was phenominal!! We all ordered something different and sampled a little of each others. I had the italian chicken which was wonderful! The crab cake, chicken parm and italian meatloaf dishes are equally as good. My compliments to the chef!!

"I've been here twice; the first time, right when they opened, was pretty good.  The sushi was made-to-order and all-you-can-eat, rather than the pre-made stuff that's been sitting out for god knows how long at buffet places, so it seemed like a good deal.  The second time we went out, just today, I was very disappointed.  The rolls were almost entirely rice with very little fish, some were literally overstuffed with rice.  I picked through all of my rolls (because chewing on chewy flavorless rice is not my thing), and got more than a cup of excess rice out of my rolls.  The service was fine, and other dishes were ok, but I won't be going back any time soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Stopped here for a happy hour date on a Friday; We had walked passed it a few weeks before so I kept it in mind, especially with my attraction to $1 oysters during happy hour. The decor was nice, gave a 30's vibe with the music that blended nicely with the scenery. My bf was a fan of the simple menu that was just the right size. The oysters were good, clean and nicely presented. The horseradish was freshly grated on the cocktail sauce , which was a  nice touch. They featured cocktails they called Bubbly's for $5. We got the Southern Belle and the Clever Name, which were fine but our favorite was hands down the Treaty of Paris, which had the blend of honeydew and St.Germaine and it was carbonated, hence the name bubbly. It was so good. Lastly, we got the Duck Fat fries which were really great. Hot, crispy, and well seasoned and the accompanying dipping sauce was perfect. I can see coming here again soon.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My family and I first went to Huong Viet when it was Little Saigon in Nutley, followed it to Montclair, and now are happy to have this fine Vietnamese restaurant back in Nutley.  We eat there about once a week and, due to generous portions, usually get a second meal at home out of our leftovers.  We start our meals with either one of their tasty soups and/or dlicately flavored salads.  For a main course, my husband loves their chicken with lemongrass and vegetables with a hint of spice and I thoroughly enjoy vegetables with egg noodles, tofu & ginger.  When we go with others, we  sample other choices and have enjoyed just about every dish we've tried.  The restaurant is a family affair and the wait staff is attentive and eager to please.  You can't beat the prices and since it's a byob establishment, that also keeps the price down.  Go and enjoy!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Finally, a different kind of Spanish restaurant! Unlike other Spanish restaurants that repeat the same old cliches, Salinas has several tapas and main dishes drawn from the food from the Balearic Islands. I've eaten at Salinas three times and every time I went, the food was impressively consistent and the place reminds me of a resort on Majorca Island in Spain. By the way, the picture doesn't do justice since it doesn't show the beautiful garden with a fireplace. If I want to impress anyone from foodie friends to colleagues or go on a date, I'd take them to Salinas without a doubt. ""Crujiente""  and ""coles and coliflor"" are ones that I'd recommend for those who aren't familiar with the Balearic cuisine.

Door left open although I commented clearly about how cold I was and conspicuously put on my rain coat.  Door left open throughout dinner.  Food interesting.  Bread terrific but the dipping sauce accompanying it was addictive.  Got a couple of oysters- expensive but oh so good.  Charred mackerel was terrific, although the presence of a very rich chicken liver Pate seemed gratuitous and didn't fit with the fish or the sauce. Husband ordered entree size of spaghetti with clams.  Didn't see much evidence of anything but the pasta and red sauce, which was okay but not to die for.  At $36 for what was still a smallish serving, it should have sung.  Service attentive.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I quite literally stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to drop in on for dinner.  I had already wandered pass the too trendy Church Street and bypassed the places that seemed to have lines out the door.  Coming from NYC, I have found that those places tend to be overhyped and prefer the hole-in-the-wall, oft overlooked places.  Duino Duende fit the bill. It was the music coming from the adjacent Radio Bean Coffeehouse that drew me in.  The eclectic menu featuring fresh local foods made me stay.   I went for the mushroom burger with a side of steamed kale.  The food was light but filling, definitely fresh and didn't really need too much going to make it taste delicious.  The live music didn't hurt either...the night started off with a folksy band called Lunar Carnival from Alabama and ended (for me at least) with a local group called The Likeness.

I said, let's start with waters.. and since we were waiting so long we can order our meal. the garlic bread that is usually served tasted a bit different than it used to, the soup is smaller, no extra bread on the table like you used to get, and no special attention from the wait staff. my fiance ordered the Penne CBT and i ordered the chicken francese with artichokes - it was good. nothing to write home about though. unfortunately, we will not be going there again. the service really ruined this meal for us..","[1.0, 0.0]"

I ordered the Jagnjeca Kapama (lamb and spinach stew), which was wonderfully tender and flavorful. Service was attentive and very quick. We were seated the moment we walked in the door and waited no time at all for our food (which was very reasonably priced and afforded HUGE portions, by the way).

"I've been to this place 3 times now and I love it.  It's true, the main dining room can be very warm, but the back room has huge windows and there is a very nice back patio as well providing a cooler and comfortable setting.  I had the spicy pork pizza (can't remember the real name on the menu but the knowledgeable and attentive staff should be able to tell you) and a calamari salad which was one of the specials that day.  The calamari was perfect, fresh and clean tasting like all the ingredients I've had here so far.  As others have pointed out, it's BYOB for now but there is a wine store (Olivino I think) a couple of blocks away that Saraghina provided a wine list to that pairs dishes with their menu, a detail that I think says a lot about how much they care about the customer experience. The restaurant is also family friendly, with high chairs and a change table in the bigger bathroom (there are two).

The food truck was never dropped off.  Instead I received a white van 5 minutes late to the event with two employees who set-up a card table and set out mini egg sausage & cheese quiche that quickly became cold (early morning event), store bought, mini plain bagels and coffee bins with coffee that quickly became cold as well.  The quiche was served in sterno trays but there were no sternos to keep it warm.  I'm not sure why we needed two employees because it was self serve.  They literally just had to stand there.  I make no exaggeration here at all.  I was charged $1200 for this service that lasted 2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN!  There were about 50 guests at the event.  Let me restate, that was $600 per hour for cold food and coffee.  TOTAL RIPOFF!

"Came here on a cold Saturday evening to meet a friend for a quick bite and to satisfy a craving for some Cuban food. We walked in and noticed two spots at the bar area of this very small diner and decided to sit there rather than their few tables as it seemed very crowded and claustrophobic. Not much of a wait during prime dinner time considering how cold it was that day. After enjoying the Cuban decor and some Cuban music, I decided to go with a Cuban sandwich as the description pulled me in, ""Best in New York"". I can't pass on that! My friend ordered the roast pork after our bartender suggested it. Next to us was one of the waitresses/managers who was having a quick dinner before her shift started. She was very bubbly and was livening up the already vivacious atmosphere of the restaurant. She shared with us sweet plantains which were some of the best I've had. We had some Cuban coffee to end the dining experience and it was also very good. Very sweet, strong double espresso. Our food came quickly and I began scarfing down the best Cuban sandwich in New York. Yup, the pork, ham and everything else was delicious especially with the chipotle mayo. Next time I have to ask for more of the sauce, so good. I tried my friends dish and found his roasted pork to be very delicious also. There were many sauces on the counter that he tried with it. We didn't want to get too messy so we decided against ordered the grilled corn. In hindsight I regret it as it looked amazing when our neighbors ordered. Wish I had tried some of the cocktails also but was not in the mood at the time. Oh well, it gives me reason to come back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have only gone to Sabrina's for brunch but thought it would be a great place to try for dinner when my out of town friend asked for a ""philly-style"" restaurant.  It was really disappointing unfortunately.  Out of the 4 entrees we ordered, 3 of them came out with under cooked meat.  And I am not talking ""slightly pink"", I'm talking salmonella poisoning.  My two friends both got the chicken pineapple skewers and they came out raw and charred on the outside.  My salmon was basically sashimi style.  The 4th person with us got the catfish & chips and while that was cooked and didn't need to go back to the kitchen, not only did he ate alone but the hush puppies were the consistency of hockey pucks and there was not enough tartar sauce (nor did they bring any extra when we asked). While the appetizers were great and came out steaming hot, it just dawned on me that neither were meat products (we ordered the spring rolls and mussels). We never heard one apology out of the waitress, who by the way rushed us several times to order, the manager on duty was more understanding.  He did however claim to first give us those entrees 'on the house' but then retracted that and gave us a discount, which turned out to be a comp on the apps and dessert on the house.  We were all unsatisfyingly full and had no appetite for dessert so I sent the check back and asked for another revision. He took another $25 off but he didn't look happy (I don't blame him, he didn't cook the food!) Overall, I say stick to brunch or not at all!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place has awesome food and good service. I find it unfair that people like MS B. decides it's nice to give bad reviews without stating the real facts. When I left her a comment asking him/her why she did this she replied: ""Did you do poorly on your English comprehension exams in school?  Your comments make it clear that you're partisan for this restaurant given that you simply are ignoring the most important fact described.  Yes, there was a street festival, now explain why you think that makes it acceptable to [well - let me refer you to the comment for more details].  I'm not going to do that work for you, read it, you can disagree about many things, but, not about the behavior I've described."" She blocked me, but here I go again...I am not telling you not to write your hateful review, but did you at any point mention the special situation that was going on at the moment of your visit??! That would explain why the scheduling was not being followed (your first complaint). Concerning your second complaint, the server's response, were you aware that he had probably been there all day long trying to get things moving for as many people there as possible? and probably being pressured by other staff members to hurry to open? I bet you don't really care, but I would have thought: gee, maybe tonight is not a good night to dine here, or at any of the other restaurants on this block due the the hundreds of people that are at this festival.  If He was rude or not, I do not know as you are obviously describing the whole situation in a way that serves you better. As for my English comprehension, I  would like to think that being English my fourth language learned, I am pretty on point.  On being partisan TO the restaurant, yes, I have dined here hundreds of times, and happen to be very good friends with the owners and their family...

"Eco Bean & Juice is hands down the best coffee, fresh juice and smoothie spot in Burlington.  FINALLY - some where I can walk into and know that absolutely everything is organic.  This surprisingly just does not exist anywhere else around here.  It's very frustrating when you order food from a place that you think uses local, organic ingredients, yet it is served with Heinz Ketchup - third ingredient, high fructose corn syrup - NO THANKS!!!! I have asked almost every coffee shop in Burlington if they use almond milk and the answer was no at every single one, except Eco Bean & Juice - and to go many steps above that they make their almond milk fresh on a daily basis from unpasteurized, organic almonds from Sicily!!!!  The mocha latte with almond milk is to die for.  They also make organic coconut milk fresh daily.  There really is no other place that even compares to Eco Bean - their smoothies and juices are super fresh, creative and amazing.

"Came a with a friend this morning to grab some brunch before catching our movies.  The restaurant was cute.  I liked the decorations and the feel.   I ordered crepes with bacon, onion and Swiss cheese.  I usually love anything with either Swiss cheese or bacon and in this case, both.  Unfortunately, the crepes was not that great.  The onion was cut a little too big and was not cooked enough to bring out the sweetness.  The bacon, on the other hand, was cut into too small pieces which didn't allow the flavor to come out.  Well, the cheese...I love Swiss cheese so that's hard to go wrong.   Overall, the food was not too bad but could have been a lot better.  I really like the look and feel of the restaurant.  I would probably give it another try if I'm ever around the area and wanted to meet a friend for brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I actually plotted to go here after researching on yelp.  I had a very early arrival in Philly on a Saturday, so I knew good breakfast options would be limited.  This place was interesting enough and a pleasant walk from 30th Street Station. The service is what I would call ""slacker gracious"", meaning they don't do anything super special, but they do support your right to hang out and slack.  I was there right when they opened, so I'm sure it's a different story when they're busy. I got the special french toast, which was caramelized pear and honey.  YUM.  It wasn't super sweet, and the bread was substantial without being too heavy. There are two reasons, however, that I can't give them four stars.  One: the French toast was good, but about $3 too much.  Two: they served my cappuccino in one of those generic clear plastic water glasses. Um, since when does one drink a cappuccino from that kind of glass? I am going to go back again and try that creme brulee French toast, though.  It might be good enough to push my opinion to four stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"

As has been mentioned before, the food is wonderfully tasty, inventive and varied -- one might even hope for more variation on the menu, but a look at the size of the kitchen shows how difficult that might be. What's probably best is the incredible hospitality shown by the host, who designed and built the restaurant (his wife does the menu and cooking).

"The roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone is edible sin at its absolute best.   The night prior to eating this sandwich for the first time, I dined at a restaurant that I'd been looking forward to for a couple of weeks, hoping that it would ring true to all the positive word of mouth going around.  (I'll probably write a review on this gem later.)  Long story short, I came away somewhat pleased, but also a bit miffed at a few of the details of my dish.  It was your standard mid-twenties per plate dinner - a price that's worthy of pleasing my own price vs. palate (albeit meager) expectations.   DiNic's delivered in taste and tummy satisfaction in a way that I've rarely experienced.  After paying eight bucks, I was elevated into a kind of food nirvana that completely erased the bad memory of my overpriced, under-cared-for plate from the night before.  Such a simple combination: the thinly sliced, juicy pork shoulder, the bite of the broccoli rabe, the creamy zest of the provolone, and the roll that held together while soaking up the drippings.  I will never need to look any further than DiNic's to satiate my cravings, sandwich or otherwise.   And as far as the would-be competition brewing between the beloved cheesesteak and the roast pork sandwich, it's a moot endeavor.  Each sandwich stands alone.  However, if asked personally, I would freely admit to my utter devotion to the roast pork.  Plainly and simply put, it's pig.  In my humble opinion, nothing compares to the taste of pork.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here for a group dinner Friday night. The place takes reservations, which is always nice. The place is not big or average-sized. It is small.

It was a little too strong for my taste. My fellow diners said theirs were fine...but I got the impression that it was nothing life-changing. The food menu follows the pattern of the restarant size. Small. I am not against small menus, but most of the items we ordered (tapas sharing style) were either mediocre or poor tasting. The good: the beef jerky, and butternut squash.

"This place truly is the worst dining experience I have ever had in NYC; which is especially pertinent because poor dining experiences in this city are a rare occurrence indeed. As decent Greek restaurants are somewhat difficult to find in New York, unless one travels to Queens, I was tempted to select this Manhattan venue by virtue of its decent rating and high volume of reviews by the some 1500 diners who seemed all to have had a positive experience. However, I was most displeased from the moment I opened the front door of this establishment. The venue itself is completely different in real life as to how it appears on the restaurant website. The pictures displayed on the website portray a quaint Mediterranean, traditional Greek whitewashed and blue vibe. The decor on the website is presented as understated, chic, traditional. It looks like the kind of place you would want to have a romantic meal and a bottle of wine over a candlelit table in the corner. There is even a ""The Kefi Story"" tab detailing an almost Telenovella style history of the restaurant and its owners and of how prestigious and well-received this restaurant seemingly is, of which the press section of the website bolsters these claims. In stark contrast to the website, the reality is a restaurant interior which is shabby and sad, displaying rubber lined floor mats, fraying edges, diner style accommodation and over-population by staff in tacky uniforms. The decor is not what was displayed on the website AT ALL. It looks like a completely different establishment. There are 3 TV screens broadcasting sports to patrons at a pub-style bar, where they hunch over mediocre-looking meatballs and pitta with dips. I honestly thought that perhaps we had gone to the wrong place, and again checked the address on my reservation app on my cellphone in case I had had a bout of early onset dementia and had inadvertently gone to some inferior Kefi restaurant, or its diner subsidiary. But it was affirmed that although I had been deceived by the website portrayal of what my evening at Kefi would entail, I had in fact arrived at the right place. As I looked around at the teeming crowds, and buzzing staff, I couldn't help but think that despite the restaurant's obvious grottiness, that all of these scores of diners couldn't have possibly erred in their judgment of this place. It must be the quality of the food that they have come for. Perhaps the initial new-restaurant gloss of the decor has worn off with so many bums on seats, and that this is now a neighborhood favorite, the frayed edges actually a symbol of how well-trodden the path to Kefi is.....so I ignored my gut instinct to run for the hills and decided to stay and give the place a chance. I tried to relax and be open minded and embrace the 'rustic' charm. We ordered. Lamb shank with orzo and I opted for Rabbit pappardelle. My guest's lamb shank was freezing cold and had to be returned to the kitchen for heating. But essentially it was bland, and the simple orzo accompaniment lacked creativity. The dish was so dull. My rabbit pasta looked like something that had come straight out of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. What should have been a delicate and delicious dish had been transformed into a lasagna style (served in an oven dish from hence it had just come), grilled cheese and crispy onion fries topped disaster. It was gross, and featured some miniature rabbit bones. Oh and my wine glass was grotty. The only salvageable aspect of the dining experience was our server, who was prompt, attentive, helpful and probably embarrassed by the lame fare that he is tasked with transporting to the tables. Guys at Kefi, I think it's time for some intervention. Someone please call Gordon Ramsay.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Nearby the area, two FANTASTIC spots with no wait, tourist hype or hassle. Try them out for sure if you want a top 5 Appiza in the world: -Bobby's in North Branford is very similar to Modern, even spicier with more pecorino on top; Sausage is full-on Italian fennel. At its best it's equal to Modern, sometimes better. You will be full. Get some! -Marco's in Branford is like a tiny Pepe's, their margherita, clam and romano are all pretty damn close to Pepe's. great spot. try it. Enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We happened upon The Wood Pit as part of a close friend's birthday celebration. With 12 people in our party, we took up a majority of the tables that this hole-in-the-wall type restaurant/take-out establishment offers. The twelve of us ordered a few sampler platters, thinking that it would be best to taste all cuts of meat offered by the establishment. We were not disappointed. Two types of sauces were given, including a spicy-but-not-too-spicy one that was my favorite of the two. However, I found that sauce was not even needed, and in fact, it works best without it in some cases in order to properly enjoy the natural smoked flavor. While one could argue that pricing is high compared to other establishments of this caliber, I felt that portions were certainly generous for the price of the combination meal. My personal favorite? The pork ribs. I would encourage the reader to try everything at some point in any case. As for the environment, we felt like we were treated with proper Southern family-style hospitality. An elderly gentleman, purportedly the owner, took the time to talk to us as well as his other clientèle; in particular, he noticed that we were into taking pictures and actually volunteered to take a few shots of our rather large party. We were also given plates of fried shrimp on the house. In comparison to fried shrimp at other places, I found it to be above average and worked well as an appetizer, but I would not order it, for instance, as a meal by itself for Lenten Fridays. My only complaints are that the brisket was a bit too fatty for my taste, and the chicken wings were a bit dry and did require sauce. (If it weren't for the chicken wings, this establishment would have earned the coveted five-star rating in my book.) Also, there are some who would find the fact that you will walk out of this place smelling like smoked meats extremely repulsive. However, I consider that fact a testament to the authenticity of the food, haha. You have been forewarned.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ate there last night. first time.  Overpriced and over crowded. Saturday night is a busy night for most restaurants, but they cram people in. Yes it's a business, but when you take away from the dining experience that will hurt your business. I went with my family of four and we were seated at the same size square table that were used for two. Ok if you like eating with your elbows tucked in. The waitor was trying to do a good job, but with that noise level we could not here the long list of specials he had to memorize. Just add a printed page to the main menu.   Food was adequate , but again pricey. With 2 deserts (apple something-not tasty at all) ,no salad and our own wine, we spent approx. $120. Place probably OK for a younger crowd not familiar with, or don't care about a pleasant dining experience, but in the Rutherford, Lyndhurst area there many other restaurants to choose from where you can walk out with a smile on your face even if the price is higher. Not recommended for a family","[0.0, 1.0]"

"To put it simply, -Order the ramen and pork buns, especially if it's your first time. -Although the wait is usually around an hour, there's a bar. You can order drinks and even order pork buns as you wait. -They don't take reservations and since they're always busy, they'll be rushing you out if you're just sitting and talking. -I had the special of the day (they change everyday) similar to the main miso soup ramen (sorry i don't recall the name). *i strongly encourage asking your waiter/waitress what their opinions are for the ramen! I gave Ippudo four stars because i thought the decor made up for any problems i had. (definitely picture-taking worthy!) They do have tables for larger groups (maybe fits around 7). Tip: Have someone from your party get there early and to give them your name. Make sure they're a pretty patient person, it's a long wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place may have been good a year ago, but it definitely isn't any longer.  First off, the owners, wait staff, and cooks are not Thai.  This is not a traditional Thai restaurant.  I stopped in here with my friend who is Thai and not one waiter or manager could speak Thai with her.  If you are looking for Asian fusion food than I guess this is a good place to eat.  But if you are looking for real Thai food, you won't find it here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I recently went to Le's for the third time, and it all came together: this restaurant is fantastic. The owners treat you like treasure, and seem to really be grateful for your business. They serve you a complimentary teapot of yummy leafy tea (not bitter at all) and a slice of pound cake. I got a combination of beef & chicken lemon grass over rice, and man was it tasty! There's some particular spice they add to it, which really enhances the flavor. For my appetizer I got some sort of vegetable/pork eggroll that has a fish oil dipping sauce on the side. It was okay, and I most likely won't get it again. The Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk (hot) is GREAT! However, it is over-priced as you only get about 3/4 of a teacup full with no refills for $3.00. The rest of the prices are hard to beat, as nearly all meals are under $10. They have Pho, noodle dishes, and rice dishes, with over 40 items in all. Lastly but certainly not least, the service is exceptional. Again, you're treated like royalty here in everything from seating you and taking your order to handing you your receipt. Definitely going here more often!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Our waitress overheard this fact, and encouraged her to leave Meatball Shop & try a few specific pepperoni dishes immediately. - I like being encouraged to draw & write extra things on my menu.

"I have been waiting for an opportunity to check out Barbuzzo for quite a while, and finally got the chance when my office went out to celebrate administrative assistants' day (so thankful for this Hallmark holiday this year!).  We arrived in time for our reservation and were quickly seated and provided with our water options.   Everything on the menu looked so delicious, I had a hard time deciding--I was between the chef's plate of vegetables, the turkey sandwich and pretty much all of the pizza options.  Eventually, I decided on the Zucca, a white pizza with zucchini and roasted corn with a bit of basil pesto.  It comes fresh out of the barbuzzo oven and is served with a size of chili oil (with generous amounts of ground-up chilis) and italian oregano, dried, but still on the stem.  I added everything to my pizza and started eating.  The chili oil provided nice flavor.  However, I did not find it even the least bit spicy.  Perhaps my tastebuds have been ravaged from years of spicy foods?  The crust was crisp and cooked to perfection, though the middle of the pizza was a bit soggy (though not terribly so).  The flavor was delicious.  The zucchini is served thinly sliced lengthwise on top of the pizza with dollops of the pesto.  The corn had a tendency to fall off the pie, while eating, but I just shoved it in my mouth with my hand! After eating my delicious pizza, I was totally stuffed, but could not resist the salted caramel budino (which seemed to bolster quite a few 5-star Yelp reviews).  Before trying this here, the budino at Osteria was my favorite dessert in the city, so I was psyched to try this variation.  It was absolutely amazing--a creamy, salty sweet goodness with crushed up oreo like chocolate on the bottom.  It was a tough battle for first, but the salted caramel pushed this dessert over the edge and barbuzzo has surpassed Osteria as my favorite dessert destination.   Overall, our service was okay, if a little slow on the drink refills and check payment collection.  The biggest takeaway from this review should be that you make sure you save room for the salted caramel budino when you visit barbuzzo!","[1.0, 0.0]"
We ate at the Spanish Pavilion on Saturday night.  The food was very good.  Their tapas menu is new and looks great but we were hungry so bypassed it for the entrees.  We ordered the monkfish which is a new dish introduced by Chef Ramsey.  It was unique and very well prepared.  Would order that again.  The onion/bean ragu over the mashed potatoes and monkfish was really excellent.  We also ordered arroz con pollo  which was typically prepared but enormous.  Needless to say a doggie bag was in order.   Their dessert menu was varied and had some nice looking selections but we were too stuffed to order. The staff was friendly and both owners were roaming the dining area.  The chef/owner (Michael) came out to speak with us because of a food allergy and was very nice and accommodating.  He even came out a second time after we started eating to make sure we liked the food.  Who does that these days?  That's crazy nice of him and a rarity in today's dining world. We are glad we discovered this place and will be back.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

That, or maybe I was distracted by the food (by the way, the bread is great, too), or we were just talking too loud ourselves (or, of course, distracted by my date!). Also, we took forever to choose our dishes, and the server was very friendly about it. Actually, everyone who worked there was very nice.

I only had drinks and one app here so that's what my review is based on. I popped in here with a friend to catch some football on a Sunday.  The bartender was very nice and let us sample the beers they had on tap before making a decision on a pint.  She even talked to me about the Six Point brewery and how she likes to stock their stuff because they make a nice product.  Apparently their tap handle is always the same so it requires the bartender to know what's on tap and be able to describe it. We ended up having the boneless wings which weren't memorable.  I remember them just being fried and crispy but the sauce wasn't anything to write home about.

"I'm not sure I understand why this place often has a long line outside when there are so many great places in the area.  I've eaten there 3 times. First time was actually ok. They were not too busy and the crepes are nice. Second time I went for coffee. Horrible coffee and even more horrible service. This male server slammed down around 20 packs of sugar in front of me when I asked politely for some more after I had my coffee.  3rd time I went to meet 5 friends there. a couple of us had mussels first to share and then main course. I told the waitress I would like the mussels first and then my risotto dish. EVERYTHING then came out - about 50 minutes later by the way - everything EXCEPT my risotto. So 20 minutes later when we all were done with our food - I was not the only one having more than one thing - I got my risotto, after asking for it 2 times. First time I asked a waitress who pointed to someone else and said 'Talk to her'. Then when I got her attention she simply said 'Well you wanted me to bring it out AFTER the other stuff'', clearly trying to blame whatever went wrong on me. Apparently it was perfectly normal for her, that an entire table had finished their food, starters and mains, before 1 person then gets his.

Given the attention to how everything looked on the plate and the presentation of the butter, a first year culinary student would have put some high end or homemade jam in a small serving dish to go with it to finish the setting.

"Best Indian Food in the Princeton area Flavor Of India   PrincetonFoodLover Princeton, NJSep 25, 2007 2/3 found this review helpful While the exterior of this restaurant - in a somewhat non-descript shopping center off Scudders Mill Road - may not appear to indicate fantastic food, if you let appeances lead you to a place on Nassau St. instead, you'll really be missing out. This is the kind of Indian restaurant where you bring your friends who grew up eating Indian food.... where ""spicy"" actually means *spicy*, and a wide variety of authentic choices abound. (Though they can make anything ""mild"" too.) I highly recommend the Lamb Pasanda (lamb in a slightly sweet, nutty, creamy sauce), Paneer Makahni (Indian cheese in a sweet and rich tomato based sauce), Paneer Korma (Indian cheese in a coconut and cashew sauce), and Lamb Kushta (lamb and peppers served in a puri - fried Indian bread). And of course, no meal would be complete without an order of naan (Indian flat bread, cooked in a tandoori oven). The prices are more reasonable than most Indian places in the area - between $9-$14 for an entree, and less than $2 for an order of naan - and you will leave full and content for that amount.

Desserts are more challenging than some other items to find quality gluten free versions.  The baklava was too earthy and too far from the light, sweet, traditional version I was hoping for. The Fig bar reminded me of a pumpkin pie gone wrong,  the center was overpoweringly spicy and the exterior a bit dry and bland.  The flavor and texture combination was off.   I would go back to try a meal but will probably stay away from dessert.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The prices of the meat aren't ridiculous and another bonus is that the place always looks clean. The veg and fruit also always looks great but is a little on the pricier side. They sell dessert like cakes and the ones we've tried always taste incredible. They also sell ice cream which they scoop for you, we only tried it once but I wasn't the biggest fan.

Came here after the fail at Hudson Terrace on a whim. I had the $5 Sangria (which was a little weak but tasty) and my friend had the $5 white wine. We then got dinner which I had the mini Cuban sandwiches and he got the hamburger w/ mashed potatoes. Everything was pretty good and our bill came to about $38 + tax so it was also a decent price. The server/bartender was friendly and it seemed like there were quite a few regulars which is always a good sign.

The waitress was courteous and probably a local high school student.  Throughout the duration of our meal we saw various locals driving up to pick up some takeout, leading me to believe it's pretty good for the area.

"It was my friend's last night in town so a few of us went out for food and drinks in the LES. I live off the L train in Brooklyn, and we were pretty tired from the alcohol and full stomachs so we decided to walk it off on the way up to 14th street instead of cabbing it up there or taking another train. I've noticed this place plenty of times when I was walking by because there's always a line out the door, which led me to looking them up here on Yelp. Well, last night around 11:30 there was no line so I figured it was as good a time as any to try it out. It was my friend, my girlfriend and me and we were pretty full so we just wanted to taste their artichoke pizza because that's what they're known for. The guy working was cool enough to cut one of the bigger slices into three. After a few minutes of reheating in their oven we were chomping on some really good pizza. The taste reminds me of cream of spinach soup, but its extra cheesy, has an artichoke kick and the crust is a bit crispy/crunchy, which I really liked. It was pretty rich so this is excellent drunk/hungover food, and if I was a stoner, I imagine I'd gain several pounds if I lived anywhere near this place. I'd probably like it sober during the day too, but this stuff is just perfect when imbibing or recovering from it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Met some friends in town from SF for dinner and ended up at Malatesta. Super reasonable prices, large portions, and amazing outdoor/open air indoor seating on a warm night. Service is best described as European, harried, and somewhat overwhelmed by the continual crush of people wanting to eat here. The men in our group were not complaining about the elfin hostess and her extremely short and lightweight slip dress. It was a blustery evening and we'll leave it at that. We put our name down and had drinks at some bar in the neighborhood while we waited. The hostess had gotten my number wrong but they were still able to give us a great window table and wine while they set it up. The caprese salad ($9) was a decent starter but the tomatoes had not hit their peak yet the way they had in CA. I went with the shrimp and asparagus linguine special, the manfriend had the tagliatelle with ragu, and I also tasted the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce as well as ravioli in pink sauce. We had a few bottles of a dry white that was $30 and perfect for the warm evening. A completely different type of Italian than Babbo, but a perfect fit on a warm night with friends who wanted something reasonably priced.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went here for restaurant week awhile back...  we started off with a tower of ""Salatim"" consisting of eight Israeli and Middle Eastern salads such as tabouli, cucumber, okra, carrot, and others that I can't think of; all really good, some better than others - the only one we didn't really care for was the wax bean salad which was really vinegary. Also some warm laffa flat bread w/hummus and olive oil that was really really delicious. We washed all this down with a refreshing glass of cava. Then each of us got to choose two mezze, or small plates (4 total), which we shared. First was fried haloumi cheese with a delicious date/pine nut spread (it looked like purple peanut butter). Next dish was deep fired cauliflower with a creamy dip of chive, dill, mint and garlic - this was incredible and probably the highlight for me. Next these things called ""Kibbee"" which are basically deep fried balls of spiced bulgar wheat stuffed with ground lamb. It kinda reminded me of a highly seasoned corn dog but with lamb inside - very good. Last were deep fried crispy sweetbreads which only I ate - also good. Then we each got to choose a dish of ""Al'Haesh"" or ""grilled over coals"", which we also shared. First was house made merguez sausage with cous cous and this spicy tomato sauce. Really good! Second was two think slices of grilled eggplant with some kind of green tahini sauce. Decent but not outstanding. Lastly was desert - cashew baklava which was out of this world and also some sort of layered tahini crème brulee pudding thing (recommended by our waiter) which was one of the most delicious and interesting deserts I've ever tasted. They also have a very interesting wine selection of Israeli and Moroccan wines that I knew absolutely nothing about. I selected one of the less expensive bottles of Cabernet-Syrah blend (also our waiters recommendation) which was light and fruity; kinda ho-hum but simple and versatile enough to pair with the many different dishes and flavors we sampled. Overall it was a very good and interesting meal. The servers were all really nice and the room is cozy with big windows looking out over dock st. The restaurant week menu was quite substantial (I was pretty much stuffed when we left) BUT the savory dishes all had a sort of generic quality to them. i.e. either cold salad type dishes or highly spiced deep fried items that were prepared ahead of time and just tossed in the deep fryer before serving. That cauliflower dish, however, was really, really good. I also have such a prejudice against restaurant wine lists that it kills me to order wine at a restaurant. The Cava, at $9 per glass, was pricey for an inexpensive Spanish sparkling wine that typically sells for around $15 a bottle. I'd say the bottle of red we had probably cost around $10 retail yet it was marked up to $48. Ugggg. This practice certainly isn't exclusive to zahav but annoys me nonetheless. I'd love to go back and order from the regular menu. I only wish it was BYO...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Updated! - I bumped it back to 4 stars. I've been back a bunch over the past few months (nothing unusual there) and the tacos have been much better than previous, much more more moist and flavorful, and the de mole salad is back into the land of the fresh. Try it with the shrimp, totally awesome. The Enchiladas are still fantastic too. The service can still be a bit slow - one waiter for two rooms usually? So that really keeps it from a 5 star review for me, but I'd still recommend it to anyone I know... old: I live just two blocks from De Mole, and I have to say it's a challenge not to eat there on a daily basis. Truth be told I've been a regular customer for a while now, and simply haven't gotten around to writing a review since there were two things which I didn't feel were up to par. 1. The tacos - They tended to be a bit dry, and despite everything else being absolutely top notch (split the De Mole salad for starters...so delicious and fresh!) the tacos bummed me out. I'm a taco fiend, and these just didn't deliver. However, they've improved greatly over the past little while and they are now as strong as almost anything else on the menu. Not quite as good as the taco truck on Queens Blvd and 41st, but they're way less greasy than those tend to be, so it's about even. 2. Service - Everyone is always very friendly, whether it's the waiter, delivery guy, whatever. They're great people. However, when the joint is really jumping they get stretched very thin and things can take a long time to arrive. The food is good enough that this doesn't bother me, and the feel is very nice and laid back so it's not an uncomfortable place for a nice long meal, it can just be a tad annoying from time to time. That said, the food is generally excellent. I've never had a bad dish at De Mole, and with the addition of the Seitan burrito and other veggie dishes it's only gotten better. I'll wade through occasionally sluggish service, as the positives far outweigh the negative.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Forget about the menu here, there's only one item to order. The Red Onion. It's the signature sandwich (obviously), and it's worth going out of your way to eat. The bread is homemade and delicious, the bacon is perfectly crisped, the apples crunchy and tart, and the turkey exceptionally tasty. Top it off with a homemade cookie (my opinion is that the Aloha is their best) and you've got a great lunch. Why doesn't it get more than three stars you ask? Easy. The service. It stinks. The staff make you feel as though you're putting them out by placing an order, and they move at a snails pace. When there's a line, don't bother waiting. You'll be there for 20 minutes. Also, it's dirty. The tables are rarely wiped down and are generally covered in grime. My advice? Come in the middle of the afternoon on a summer day and get your sandwich to go.

"There's a variety of types of banh mi to choose from, I went with #1 Bahn Mi Saigon (for $4.50!!!!!), which is BBQ Pork, figuring the one the place shares a name with will be good.  It comes out pretty quickly, within 5 minutes. The sandwich has two polar opposite components to each bite. The BBQ Pork itself is pretty good, the vegetables taste more or less fresh, and there was something that tasted reminiscent of cole slaw. Vegetables were somewhat cut so I wasn't pulling out an entire cilantro plant with my first bite. HOWEVER, the bread was hard, flaky, and dry. And the bread is literally half of each bite.  It was obvious the bread was made a while ago and had been sitting out.   SO, half of each bite is really dry and mediocre, while the other half (what's inside) is pretty good. Ingredients get 4 stars and bread 1-2. If you are lucky and happen to walk in as they make the bread, you'll have a better experience. It was just a $4.50 sandwich though - the cheap factor helps a lot here. All in all, not bad for $4.50.  I'd eat again only if I was nearby, but definitely wouldn't come here for this.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The farro salad should be called arugula salad with farro because well, farro isn't the main ingredient.  It's good though, for lunch.   I noticed one of the guys from Chinos works there now.  He's THE BEST.  I appreciated that his boss wasn't up his butt when he came out to say hi and chat for a lil :) Oh!  I left my phone there once and they took care of it for me until I picked it up.  Friendly neighborhoody staff.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"When we have company in town, this is a frequent stop. Full disclosure. I've never tried anything but their specialty pizzas (and a few appetizers). They only take cash. And if you eat in on a busy night, they might shoot you a free dessert as you're going out the door. They're just good like that. The specialty pizzas are well worth it. The Chicken Cordon Bleu and the Cheesestake pizza are some of the best dishes reincarnated as a pizza. I found the taco pizza a little strange, but my wife and brother loved it. A little on the pricey side if you're used to Little Caesars (15-20 bucks) but worth it, for the size of the pizza, the quality of the ingredients, and the amazing taste. You might drive right past it if you aren't careful--it is a small shop by Gauchos and the Fire Department. There's an ATM just up the street at Schuyler Bank (that talks to you and scares your pants off at 9 at night) if you forget cash. But if you hang around Kearny enough, I guarantee you'll see their delivery car everywhere. Check it out!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Food : Absolutely fantastic food.  Very interesting play with salt and mild sweetness in the dishes.  Had the mushroom mousse with truffle jelly and we were blown away.  Immediately ordered the other mousse on the menu - chicken & liver. That was great too.  Carrot and ginger soup is very tasty - definitely something to try when you go.  Tried a couple of oysters from the East Coast - very fresh and nice.  Had the ham tasting plate - that was ok.. the accompanying sauces were nice but the ham was fine.   Not bad but skippable if you want to try other dishes on the menu instead.  Tried the edamames because we had heard about the reviews - didn't like it as much.  I think we prefer our edamames simple.. and the feta cheese was a little too much.  Had the grilled pineapple and caramel desert - very good again. Drink : The celery with gin was very unique and refreshing - must try that. Decor :  Nothing very special - nice.  Not too loud so you can hear each other.  Had made a reservation adn didn't have to wait for the table. Service : Service was timely and good.   Overall : Must try for the carrot ginger soup, the mousses and the celery gimlet.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The outside of the place is misleading, it's so nice inside!  Food presentation on par with very high end establishments in NY and Vegas, yet, a friendly staff and cozy (if loud, they need something on the walls to absorb the sound) atmosphere.  Salad to dessert.....all wonderful.  One of us had the Chilean Sea Bass, I had the blue cheese and portobello crust on the fillet mignon.  Gabe was a wonderful server, we'll be asking for him again.  The fillet was $30, very reasonable.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"First time at wasabi today, it's pretty un noticeable off the post road and I've passed by many times, but bc of yelp i found out there might be awesome sushi here. Once inside the scenery was average, origami papers hanging off the wall and some other paper decorations. It's also pretty small inside. The waiter was not able to answer questions really maybe bc he wasn't very fluent in English. I went during lunch special and got miso soup, small salad, and 3 rolls for 11.95$. The miso soup was good, the salad was very small and the ginger dressing was not the best I've ever had. The rolls however were amazing!! I got avocado and sweet potato rolls. So yummy!!

"After a night of slight excess, my friends and I worked up quite the appetite. I had noticed this place earlier in the night because of the incredibly long queue right outside of it. So, I did as Mr. Bourdain says. and went for the place that had the long line. HOT DAMN! What...a....pie! First bite was a slight fail cause I slightly scorched the roof of my mouth. But as good as it was, you kind of don't care about the slight pain. It was fresh creamy rich deliciousness. I don't know what their secret is. Maybe they sprinkle a little bit of crack in there. I DON'T KNOW! But what's certain is that when I come back to NYC, I'll be making a pilgrimage to East Village for this miracle that is pizza. Oh, and how could I even forget. They were the first pizza place I'd ever seen offer garlic powder as a condiment. I put garlic powder on everything I eat at home, so you can only imagine the emotions that came over me at that moment. Definitely put some garlic powder on it; it really enhances it. *sigh* I can't wait to go again!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Excellent. Wandered in here on the 2nd night it was open  -- to avoid  a long wait at nearby eatery. The two of us ate at the bar, which is nicely done in polished wood, as are most other parts of the restaurant. Food was delicious and very moderately priced. Specifically, the chicken kabobs were soft, moist and nicely charred, and reflected a good marinade. Came with very fresh salad and hot pita bread. Portions were quite large. The appetizer we had was calimari, sauteed  with vegetables and spices rather than deep fried, which is the usual; and these were very tasty. Staff was extraordinarily friendly. In sum, we ate here better than, and at  about sixty percent of the price of, a well-known and very popular eatery the night before.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have never posted a review before on yelp, about any business, I wanted soup to-go and stopped in there to get the mushroom soup, but I cannot even believe I just paid $12 for a cup of broth and a tiny side of rice. There were no mushrooms in it, no tofu. Just broth. And these onions that tasted like chemicals that are fried that you put on top??  And a hunk of lime. I wish I had my $12 back so bad.

"I had the unexpected delight of eating here a few weeks ago. An upscale neighborhood joint, Tavern on Jane strikes the perfect balance of cozy neighborhood spot (I heard the waitstaff refer to many of the diners by name) yet has really good comfort food -- at a decent price. Hard to find in this neighborhood that is pretty trendy (and great for people watching!) -- the lunch specials are a steal at only $12 (including soup or salad). I was here for dinner, and I have to say that the fried oysters (with  crispy cornmeal battering) are amazing -- better than most I've had in the south. The burger was really, really good, with perfectly crispy fries and a side of coleslaw and pickles -without cheese it's $12 -- and is a full, delicious, meal. I'll definitly be back. Staff was really friendly, atmosphere was cozy and comfortable (they have a fireplace and brick walls, with candles on tables at night), and from there I spent the rest of the evening walking around the West Village -- a great way to walk off those yummy fries. :-)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Really, I loved this restaurant. The restaurant has the ""look"" of an ethnic restaurant and our waitress was Turkish herself. If you are trying to choose between saray and Istanbul for Turkish food, pick Istanbul for small parties and Saray for large parties, I would say. Istanbul has dark lighting and is more intimate. The food here is DELICIOUS. For appetizers I had a salad which was made of tomatoes, cucumbers, with other vegetables and grilled octopus. The light sauce it was served in is to die for, I could not stop dipping my bread in it. The lamb kebabs melted in my mouth, the best I have ever had. For a couple, I would recommend grabbing a couple appetizers and then sharing the combo kebab entree they serve. This is more than enough food for two and gets you a good variety of flavors.   Highly recommended!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Let's face it, though.  Lots of folks complain about the price.  I just tell those complainers, ""You get what you pay for.""  While a Pat's sandwich may be just a little more than the other guys... they deliver in quality.  Why settle for less if you're going to treat yourself to a cheesesteak? And those guys across the street with their flashy signs, their bright colors, and their PacMan video games (well.... i don't think they have pac man...) THEY DON'T COME CLOSE.   I haven't lived in Philadelphia since I was a kid.  Yet I will literally go back over the bridge JUST to have a Pat's steak.  If the line wraps around the building, FEAR NOT!  The service is quick and the wait is well worth it!

"Came here with Dan, Maria and 4 of Maria's friends from the PhD in Sociology department that I have become friends with. Maria had this awesome coupon for 50$ off the first $100 spent! We had a reservation but ran a bit late. They were very accommodating.  The place is BYOB with no additional charge for our drinks. We were seated and brought water and chips with 2 chutneys immediately. As our other friends arrived they were given just as good treatment. Once all  7 of us were there, me and Dan ordered every appetizer they had and they were all delicious. 2 different types of chaat, pakoras, somosas, the whole deal. No complaints but we all felt the food was lacking heat (spicy heat). This was soon to change. For main course, I got chicken makhani and ordered it extra hot. Everyone got either chicken korma, lamb korma, or chicken tikka, with one order of daal. We got puuri and garlic naan, with one order of the special Devil's Naan That naan really was evil. It is stuffed with habanero peppers (which Maria explained is from Havanna) and it burned our mouths out. 3 people were brave enough to try it and we all ended up chugging beer to fix our mistake. The food itself was good. Curries were thick and flavorful and spicy. After sampling everyone's food, I felt mine was the best. Their heat assessments for ordering assume that locals can't handle hot food I guess. Since we were so awesome, the waiter comped us a free large desert for the table and a mango lassi which were both delicious. Will return (hopefully this week)","[1.0, 0.0]"

I've had lamb in many places and this is up there with the best of them- tender and unadulterated. The Gouda Au gratin was nice and cut through the gamey lamb (is fat supposed to cut through fat?). The greens were SO buttery- in a good way. I had the apple pie for desert and while the pie was on par the ice cream was slap your momma good. The thing about Market Table that stood out was the service. I know the service has been knocked before, but maybe rent was coming up.

I wasn't warned about the pickles... gag!

I came on a Friday night, and it ended up being a 1h 45 minute wait for 4 people. But it wasn't all bad, because there was an open air bar area adjacent to a heated tent. A couple of drinks in, a waitress beckoned us over to a table and we were seated. I recommend the cocktail with bourbon in it. The $5 bread was good, and it was extra delicious drizzled with spicy oil that's available with every table. The cold cuts was unexpectedly fresh tasting too. I actually found the pizzas just okay, and maybe I should have just gone with a standard marinara but my speck pizza was not meaty enough.

"My girlfriend and I dined here on Saturday evening and shared three tapas plates: chocolate pig sliders, pretzel crusted fried chicken, and naan rays pizza.  Starting with the bbq sliders and working my way to the fried chicken and eventually the pizza I had a new favorite with each dish I tried.  While I didn't care for the coleslaw that came on the side with the sliders the mini-sandwiches themselves were interesting and delicious.  The mole sauce was spot on and the bread was fresh.  The fried chicken was immaculate with a nice crunchy texture provided by the fried pretzel batter and a juicy succulent chicken center with a tasty dipping sauce.  Last, but certainly not least, was the naan pizza.  I think it's worth listing the toppings just to show you what we're working with here: naan, goat cheese, red wine braised figs, bacon, and arugula with what tasted like a vinaigrette reduction.  The ingredients worked beautifully together.. truly a perfect taste/texture combination!  And as an added bonus they had a superb beer selection which seems to be hard to come by in NY.   My only criticism is it seemed like our server forgot about us after we received our food.  Then again, when the food is this good who needs to be checked up on?  Oh and they had a TV which seemed to be a bit out of place. Bonus points: dinner check was presented in a paperback ""The Outsiders"" novel, which seemed to match the eclectic decor of the place.  Also worth noting was that there were several empty tables while we were there.. a pretty huge shock given the quality of the meal.  Oops.. hope I didn't  ruin it for the locals on this seemingly 'best kept secret!'","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I'm from San Francisco so I think I've developed a sophisticated pallet when it comes to good food; its a city that is inundated by every kind of food you can imagine, and even the most obscure cuisines have 20 competators.  So there comes a point when I've grown so use to good food that when I come across poor cuisine its almost exotic. That is not the case here.  Our experience at Lui Lui's was absolutely fantastic.  I've grown use to North Beach style italian food and this place can stand toe to toe with those family owned businesses.  We ordered the cheese lasagna, the mixed seafood plate and a side of cesar salad, also ordered a manhatten.  The drink was perfect, had my friend set it down and say 'This is GOOD'.  Both dishes had a fantastic mix of flavors, the tomato sauce was absolutely amazing, tasting fresh and full -- not flat and bland as I've come to use to.  And the Cesar salad.

"Amy Ruth's has the best fried chicken around, hands down.  It's better than Spoonbread Too or whatever place you're thinking about right now.  Put simply, it's the only fried chicken I've had where I don't lost interest after eating the crispy skin. I usually get the Rev. Al Sharpton (Fried chicken over a belgian waffle).  Can't go wrong there.  The honey chicken is good too because they basically just throw some honey + red pepper flakes over the fried chicken, but some many consider it too sweet.  I personally don't mind sweet.  The smothered (delicious) and the BBQ (ok) chicken do not come fried for these dishes unless you request it (remember that!!).  Some other reviewer mentioned coming here and just getting a chicken salad.  If you're not here for the fried chicken don't bother. Sides:  Candied yams are my favorite (also on the sweet side), collard greens are awesome.  Everything else is fine, don't really care for them. Desserts:  I'm usually too full, but I think I remember enjoying their banana pudding once. I almost forgot, the CORNBREAD!!!!!!!!!  Served so warm that when you add butter it just melts into it.  DELICIOUS.   Lastly, they have a seating area in the back, so if the front looks crowded do not despair.  Worth the wait though.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Have been there twice and even though I desperately want this to be my favorite restaurant in the entire state because I love the location, patio, live music, look of the inside of the building, staff is friendly, and even the food is pretty darn good, I can't rate it more than 2 stars.  Both times (lunch on a Sunday and dinner on a Saturday) the kitchen service was the absolute SLOWEST I have ever experienced at any restaurant in my entire life.  I'm not even someone who notices things like that because I'm content to have an extra drink or two if I'm waiting for a meal, but when you combine the SLOWEST kitchen with a teeny-tiny bar that is trying to serve walk-up patrons, people sitting in the bar, and the servers who are trying to keep their diners happy, even the bar slows down so the drinks don't come as quickly as they could!  We had 730 reservations for 4 for dinner, and after having a drink in the bar while we waited for our table we were finally seated by about 745.  Not a big deal as the patio was awesome and live music was fun.  To make a long story short, our meal did not come out until 930!!!!!!!!  And during that time we only got I think 2 rounds of drinks (maybe 3) because even the drink service was slowed down.  We could see the owner yelling at the kitchen staff like it was an episode of Hell's Kitchen!  We were comped a round of drinks, which was nice, but when your guests don't order dessert or a last round of drinks because you're afraid you'll be there for another hour, that's not good news for a restaurant because you're just losing money.  I love love love what Lou's can and probably will be, but after experiencing the same slow service twice in a row for two different kinds of meals, I will either think twice about going there again or if I do I'd consider ordeing everything at once including apps, 2-3 rounds of drinks, and entrees!  I can't believe no one else has commented on the slowness of the kitchen, and I certainly don't want anyone to think that I jumped all over this after one bad meal there.  I'm sure I'll go back but if the service is that slow for a third time I'm going to offer constructive feedback to the staff.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The cool thing about this place is that when they run out of local stock they can't necessarily order a shipment of the same high-quality product, because the vast majority of their products come from local farms that aren't necessarily still harvesting what they were the week before. Because of this, the menu can change a few times per week (and for that reason it's pretty useless to check the menu online except to get an idea of price range). My husband and I both got the four-course prix fixe so that we could share and have a taste of more items from the menu. The highlights of the meal were an asparagus puree with morels (appetizer), diver scallops with beets and morels (seafood entree), venisen with brussels sprouts (land entree), and the pecan crunch with shortbread, rootbeer syrup and coffee custard (dessert - duh). Each item was close to perfect, my only complaint was that the scallops didn't come with enough morels (and, coincidentally I wasn't the only one who thought so - my husband overheard another customer telling the host the same thing). The other items we ordered included steamed mussels with croutons and broth (appetizer course), pike with steamed veggies (from the sea course), sirloin with brussels sprouts (from the land course), and apple rhubarb cake with butter pecan ice cream (dessert couse). They all tasted great, but weren't as exceptional as the choices mentioned previously. The atmosphere was classy, but comfortable, and the place is BYOB (holler!) - so come bearing wine, or settle for still or sparkling water... which brings me to my biggest complaint: the EIGHT DOLLAR ($8) per bottle still water. I've bought still water at other fine dining establishments and bottled water costs rarely more than $4 ($5 at the very most). Needless to say, after seeing the bill, we were glad we ordered tap water after our first bottle. I should also quickly mention, they served a delicious bread basket and what seemed to be a duck pate-like dish with preserves to begin the meal and cute little mini pastries to finish.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"E Mei God. This place is amazing! Upon arrival you are immediately brought a dish of tasty peanuts and another of life-changing spicy chopped salad. Yes, I just said salad changed my life. Next, I redeemed the Yelp offer to receive a free order of spicy boiled dumplings. A very generous 8 dumplings came in the serve, though I was only able to polish off three or four. They were not the best dumplings I've ever had, but they were tasty still and definitely packed enough heat to start me a  case of the Szechwan sweats. Next came my main, the spicy Szechwan chicken. The portion was massive and packed just about as many dried chillies as there are people in Szechwan province. This dry style chicken bursted with spicy flavor and literally had my face pouring in sweat. I had some napkins to stem the sweaty tide, but really what I needed was a towel. Not able to take in any more of the intense deliciousness, I called it quits and probably took 70 percent of my order home with me. The meal was concluded with much appreciated wedges of orange and a fortune cookie to dull the lingering spicy pain. It was a good pain though. E Mei God is right - this is some of the tastiest Southern Chinese cuisine I've ever sunken my teeth into. -SZ","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A chocolate lover's dream. I've been here for dinner, brunch, and dessert, and all three have been fantastic. I'd definitely say that the desserts here are what's worth it, so try to avoid the pizzas and the pasta! If you are into really, REALLY sweet brunches Max Brenner is the place to go. I went with 4 of my friends earlier in the year and we split sweet crepes, waffles, a sundae, and a s'mores pizza. It was one of the most incredible brunches I've had to date. I've also been here for a late night dessert event. I fell in love with the nutella-esque hazelnut chocolate milkshake and s'mores and definitely am craving these dishes again. The heart shaped chocolate lava cake was only OK in my books, simply because I prefer really dense and moist and decadent cakes and this one seemed to be a bit dry for me. However, you will not go wrong with just about anything on the dessert menu, especially the s'mores pizza-- a classic! Be prepared to pay slightly more than you would expect for desserts, but to be honest I think it's still worth it. Definitely one of my favorite sweet places to hit up in Philadelphia and in Boston and I'm excited to introduce more people to its wonders!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Can you hear that? That's the sound of me blissfully sighing as my arteries clog and I drift off into a food coma. This place probably has the best southern-style fried chicken smothered in gravy that I've ever had. It's so crispy, juicy, well-spiced, and the extra thick flavorful smoky gravy just kicks it over to a different level. I have to dock it a star though, for everything not fried chicken. I thought the limp waffle was kind of a throwaway (why do the waffles at soul-food places never taste like the ones at wafels and dinges?). The candied yams and mashed potatoes are pretty solid, but the collard greens and okra were way too salty. I probably just need to start skipping the waffles and sides, and use that extra stomach space to stuff myself with fried chicken and gravy.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"LOVE!  The food here is rich and delicious and so cheap.  One of the few places in the city you can have a truly amazing sit down meal on the cheap.  Not much for fancy decor, but it has a cozy feel.  I grew up in this hood and was brought up on it, and it's definitely delicious, and I imagined it was authentic, but not being Puerto Rican myself, I couldn't say so with authority.  I recently went there with two friends who grew up there (on separate occasions) and they both confirmed: authentic and FANTASTIC.  My friend also mentioned that it was hard to find good pasteles in the city and not only does La Taza have them, they are baller. I highly recommend the yellow rice, the black and red beans, the carne guisada (beef stew), pernil (roasted pork shoulder), mofongo (garlic-y fried mashed plantains), and, my all-time fav, the ropa vieja (shredded beef.)  They only serve the ropa vieja on two days a week, (Monday and either Friday or Saturday, I think)  and it goes fast, so be sure to get there early if you want some.  Also there's a drink that tastes like a creamsicle called Morir Soñado-SO GOOD!  Crazy delicious flan and coffee if you want dessert.  I always forget and then am disappointed: they're not open Sundays.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Been here a few times before for a sports bar feel, back before Princeton Sports Bar opened. All of my experiences here have been pretty average bordering on unsavory -- I've been harassed by their drunk patrons while with my boyfriend -- but tonight we've been subject to awful customer service and business model. We headed to Tap Room after dinner hoping to get drinks on their beautiful outdoor patio, but were turned away because apparently the patio is for dinner patrons only. Not even a ""if you come back later, we'll be open for drinks,"" never mind that the patio was largely desolate of clientele. They redirected us to some tiny 2-person ""bistro tables"" off to the side of the building, which had the feeling of being the sad corner table in the cafeteria where the school pariah sits by himself. We wavered for a while discussing alternative options, and finally the waiter who'd initially turned us away said that we could take a seat and just bring our own drinks from the bar. We were pleasantly surprised by his change in heart; we even confirmed twice that this would be okay and he said sure, it's been done before. So we were getting settled in our seats when another employee came over and told us we would have to leave if we weren't getting dinner. We explained that the other guy had said we could, but she just blanked us and repeated herself. You'd think she would have confirmed withe the other waiter and/or management, or be a teeny bit apologetic for the inconsistency in policy, but no... For the moment the only redeeming feature of the bar is the gallery of old-school alumni photos at the entrance.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"BYOB gem.  It seems like their entire menu is offered during restaurant week, so it's an amazing deal. The fried artichoke is a must.  The calamari salad is also cooked perfectly - very tender and tasty.   Just beware that they only take cash.  And that you will likely make friends with your neighbors, or at least over hear their conversations.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tried both after a Sox-Phillies game, and Pat's is better.

"If you ever want to find a place that seems to be stuck in a time warp, Big Wong is the place.  I first came to Big Wong about 15 years ago, and at that point I knew it has been around for a long time.  Last night I went for a quick dinner before I drove back to Virginia, and sure enough, the decor was the same, the menu was the same (minus the prices), and the employees were all the same.  Sometimes I think this restaurant is one that time forgot about, and is perpetually stuck in the early 1980s. On top of that, did I mention that Big Wong's is one of the ultimate tourist trap Chinese restaurants?  Service sucks compared to the American defacto standard.  Unless you come in a large group (i.e. 7-8+), be prepared to sit next to and share a table with random strangers, who will probably talk as loud as a 70s American hot rod engine.  Come in a big group, and be prepared to wait for more time that the food might be worth.  The waiters/waitresses will rush your order and not even look twice at you until they want you to pay the bill.  And ultimately, you'll get just some cheap chinese food. So why the 5 stars?  Well first off, it's a Chinese restaurant.  I always turn on my Chinese restaurant mode for expectations.  First I don't expect good service.  If I want something, I'll simply have to exert my demands (ranging from shouting to the waiter, to actually getting up and going to help myself to a refill of tea).  Second, it may be a tourist trap, but for the price, it's actually some of the better food in Chinatown.  Third, the fact that there are so many Cantonese people who still go to Big Wongs after over 20 years of operation, means that they must be doing something right. As a whole, I think I simply give Big Wong's 5 stars because I just like their food, and I check my expectations.  So hit up Big Wongs for a bowl of wonton noodle soup, or some congee if you have a chance, and enjoy a step back in time atmosphere with today's prices.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My wife and I ate here Friday evening. Arrived early and our table was available upon arrival. It was crowded and warm inside, slightly cooler than the 90 degree temp outside. This is a very small restaurant. The tables are literally within inches of each other which lends itself to a cafeteria setting. Shared the octopus salad. There was about four 1"" pieces of octopus. Pathetic considering the $16 price tag. Remaining ingredients were ordinarily average. I ordered the scallops. 3 scallops were properly prepared but lacked even basic seasonings. The Parmesan risotto was overcooked and just plain ""gummy"" and the cheese was overwhelming. My wife ordered the ""Spring Risotto"" and it was equally bad in it's preparation. Unlike my risotto, hers was flat and wholly under seasoned. We added salt but that did little to help. It tasted like green tea. Weird. When asked if we wanted it packaged to take home, we simply explained that we didn't care for it and when she presented us we our check, she advised she had taken the entree of our check which eased the pain. We were visiting and this was our last meal before returning home the next morning. Not a fitting finale to a week of amazing food...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"CHEESESTEAK WAR - Geno's vs Pat's We took a long road trip from Atlanta to Maine, making stops all along the way at places I've been wanting to try for years. Everything from authentic NY pizza and pastrami to authentic Maine lobster rolls were preset into my GPS navigation.  Well, I don't know how I could call myself a food lover and not have an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak from the two originals, so on this trip I rectified that! I've never been to any of the states north of the Carolina's on the East coast and decided last year we are going to curtail our preferred mode of vacationing (cruises), to spend more time touring all the great places we've been missing around our own country. After all, our boys are getting older and there is only so much time we have left before they might not think it's cool to hang out with us... LOL ~~~~~~~~~~ THE EXPERIENCE I was a total tourist during my visit to Pat's. Taking pictures, laughing with locals and hamming it up with the kitchen staff. It may just be my personality, but we don't generally have problems with people. I've read a lot of reviews about the staff both here and across the street @ Geno's being rude, even saw it on a Food Network show. However, they were fantastic with us. My excitement to be there must have been infectious because they even came out to take pics and cracked a few jokes. As usual with touristy places, you are bound to run into others who came a long distance just to try them. We ran into one couple also doing a steak comparison and had just finished their first steaks @ Geno's. They made for an enjoyable conversation as we shared our crazy food adventures. It always make me feel better to know that I'm not the only person in this world that travels for food ! ~~~~~~~~~~ THE CHEESESTEAK I HATE Cheese Whiz. It is a violation of basic food decency and have been repelled from any establishment that even suggests putting it on my food. So when I found out Philadelphians prefer it, I made it up in my mind I would give it a try so as to have the most authentic experience possible. Under protest of course, because the backup plan was to throw it away if I didn't like it and order another with provolone, the cheese of the food gods!!! I was stupefied at just how amazing whiz can taste on a Philly cheesesteak. Not in a million years would I have guessed I would love it as much as I did. But then again it could simply be the way Pat's blends it with the meat. It's not just poured on top as I expected. No, it's mixed into the blend of beef and onions during the cooking process, setting of an orgy of deliciousness. I'm a Chicago native. The meat in our cheesesteaks is much more finely diced, almost to the point of looking like ground beef, which is how I prefer my cheese steaks.  Pat's does not chop their beef up nearly as much, but it is certainly more finely chopped than its rival Geno's for sure. It make the sandwich easier to eat, more tender and in my opinion, creates a more balance flavor between all the ingredients. Most people mistake the finer chop for a lesser quality meat, but nothing could be further from the truth. I'd be willing to bet the meat each uses probably comes from the same vendor. They just slice and season it differently. ~~~~~~~~~~ FINAL THOUGHTS Food is a personal experience not always based on how good something actually is, but how good it is in comparison to other life experiences. It may be tied to memories with loved ones or a bad experience with a past relationship. Whatever subjective feeling you have, no one can really take away how the inner you reacts to it. As for me, Pat's was probably the singular most soul satisfying meal I had during my entire three week vacation up the East coast. Took me back, way back to simpler days. I love food (all food) but you should know by now I'm not fancy. If I were food, this sandwich is truly me on a plate. My eyes rolled back in my head as my taste buds screamed 'Don't stop, git it, git it!'   Winner - Pat's. SIDENOTE: See my review for Geno's to get the comparison between the two.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I ordered a coupon deal on grubhub, two 14"" pies with one topping each for $16. I called after an hour and 24 minutes had passed, the man I spoke with told me that my pizza was already on the way, which was reassuring, as the place is only a little under a mile from me. 26 minutes later it arrived. That timeline is exactly correct, I double checked my grubhub and phone call times as I wrote it.   The pizza was still close to oven hot when it arrived, so they must have not seen my order and then rushed it out when I called. That doesn't bother me, it happens, whatever, but it would have been nice to have been told that so that I wasn't wondering what happened again. As far as the quality goes, it isn't artisanal hipster masterpiece cuisine but it is $16 for two pies, I got what I expected and I was not disappointed. That and the very friendly delivery guy kept the place in three star range.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"First, let me start by saying that my coworkers and I were really looking forward to this place finally opening.  There aren't a ton of options in the Financial District beyond the usual Stone Street fare, and post-Sandy, there are even fewer places to go for an after-work drink.   Unfortunately, when we finally visited the Dead Rabbit, we were extremely disappointed. When we arrived, the downstairs pub (the Taproom) was extremely crowded.  We weren't terribly surprised, since the place is relatively new, so we tried to take a look upstairs (the Parlor).  We were stopped by a middle-aged man named ""Ted,"" who told us that we couldn't go upstairs at the moment, but that he would take our names and let us know when a table upstairs opened up (by his estimation, in the next half hour). We gave him our names and sidled up to the downstairs bar to get a drink.  In addition to being pretty crowded, the Taproom is extremely narrow, with very little seating.  Servers and patrons were constantly elbowing past us, forcing us to either cram up against the people waiting to order or hug the drink rail on the wall to avoid getting pushed.  We ordered a couple cocktails, which were pretty unremarkable, and waited for our table.   Over the next 45 minutes, we saw Ted wander past us maybe a dozen times (we were only 15 feet from his position by the stairway leading upstairs).  He never said a word but made eye contact with us several times.  Because he wasn't calling out anyone's name, we assumed that he had a pretty good handle on who was on the list to be seated.  Silly us. We finally walked up to Ted and asked how long our table would be.  He asked for our names (uh-oh) and said, ""Oh, yeah, I couldn't find you.  I gave your table away.""  We informed him that we were standing right in his line of sight for the past 45 minutes and that he had walked right by us numerous times.  He responded with, ""Oh, you must've been in the john when I looked for you."" A.) We weren't, (B) Seriously, all of us?, and (C) You still couldn't have at least called out a freakin' name before giving up and giving our table away? Anyway, we were finally seated about 15 minutes later.  Four of us were crammed at a tiny little table that was clearly only meant to seat two people comfortably.  We ordered another round of mediocre-yet-overpriced ""signature"" cocktails and ordered a couple small plates.  We were informed that if we all tried to order food, they wouldn't have room on the table to serve us (Seriously??). The food (veal meatballs and chips w/ dips) was really underwhelming and not at all worth the wait.  We didn't stick around after the snacks, but instead left in search of a better bar. Despite the Dead Rabbit being one of the closest bars to our office, my coworkers and I probably won't be returning, and I've told other people thinking about trying the bar to either skip it or, if curiosity gets the better of them, to at least set their expectations VERY low.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow, brisket here is always ridiculously juicy and tender.  Without a doubt, my favorite brisket in all of New York.  You'll also probably end up spending half of what you would spend at any other decent BBQ place in the city; the dishes are cheaper, and there's no table service, so you don't tip 15%-20%.  Mighty Quinn's has cafeteria style ordering, and once you get your food, you find your own seats.   The only problem is some of the other items on the menu are sub par.  Half of the spare ribs order was dry.  The ""brontosaurus rib"" was unmemorable.  Chicken wings were not bad, but not great.  However, the thing that boggles my mind the most is that their brisket is so good, but they ruin their burnt ends by drowning them with BBQ sauce in a tub so they get soggy...

"Went to Degustation on a recommendation from a friend (who knew the previous chef)  The restaurant is set so you are basically in the kitchen (like a sushi bar) and a few feet from the chefs as they prepare the meal.  IT could be a very intimate setting and one that lets you appreciate the food being created in front of you. Unfortunately it was anything but this.  The chefs never once made eye contact with us; they never explained the food or seemed pleased that there were customers. It was slow when we got there and they took every effort to avoid us.  That waitress was not pleasant and did not seem to want the patrons to have a good experience either, Upon our arrival,she said we were not on the reservation list (my wife had to show it to her), they openly rolled their eyes when we met friends and talk by our seats for 5 minutes and throughout the meal we had probably 5 different people bring us our meal. One of the servers (a Spanish guy) was actually good.   He took the time to explain during one of our meals (we had the 10 course tasting) that we could eat the entire shrimp that was being served, head and tails; it was delicious. I noticed that our other waitress then served the people next to us and didn't explain anything, they only ate the middle of the shrimp and sadly missed out on a tasty albeit very small offering. It they want to serve food and pretend the customers aren't there, that is fine.. just get a normal restaurant space and work behind closed doors.

While the place is noisy during dinner rush, the waitstaff a bit harried as a result, and the tables nestled a bit too close together, the food is undeniably top-notch.

I strongly suggest the sweetbreads appetizer, if you're not automatically put off by such fare--it's a delight. All in all, 5 stars for food & value, -1 star for service and noise level.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The prices are great and the location is wonderful for those of us that hate going downtown to eat. It is usually packed at any time of day, so don't go there if you are looking for a quick in and out. My only real complaint is that there is inconsistency amongst the chefs. If you get the best ones, your meal is perfect, but I have had a few random nights where all the meat was overcooked or sauces were broken. The food is not bad on those nights, it's just not what it could be. It's happened enough times to be worth mentioning.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"You know when you're at dinner, and not one of your party of six can come up with that name, that song, that character from that movie...and it's driving you all crazy? Your waitress at Palo Santo, she knows it. And it's Richard Dawson. And everyone will collectively shout, ""YES!!!!"" And then she'll bring you each a taste of a cloyingly sweet dessert wine that, although disgusting, you will drink because it was a nice gesture, and you're not rude. And you will overtip her, as a result. And it will be a nice end to a meal that consisted of highs and lows that average out to be just A-OK. The highest of the high was the simple mini-tortillas served with the perfectly seasoned, fresh avocado, with the juicy ribeye a close second. The lowest of the low was the anticuchos platter that I was actually quite excited for. I believe it was rabbit liver, kidney and heart. I have enjoyed liver in many forms, so I am not sure if this was a one-time issue, but I was honestly disgusted by these little offal skewers. The taste was offensive. And yes, I kept eating because I was futilely hoping the next bite would be better than the last. Falling somewhere in the middle were my decent, but inexplicably cold Mahi Mahi, the hearty and comforting turkey and dumplings, the refreshing jicama salad, and the intriguing mushroom mole, all washed down with Imperial, Brooklyn Winter, and a good selection of wines. We topped off the meal with some well-executed desserts including a nice key lime pie, a predictably wonderful apple crumble, and a creme brûlée fired close enough to the table that the blowtorch warmed the room. Palo Santo did not rock my world the way I hoped it would; but it's relaxed, sexy atmosphere, coupled with brief flashes of culinary excellence, ensures that I'll return to give it another shot.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A friend & I went back to Vida this past week, and I'm eagerly anticipating going back with hubby. The decor is inviting-- but the BEST is the combo of excellent food and excellent service. The waitress was friendly but not overbearing and remembered us--and our beverage of choice-- as we walked thru the door. By the time we were seated with menus, she had our sangria on the table & poured. The food has been consistent-- fresh, seasonal, and perfectly seasoned. The specials are clearly noted as you enter the restaurant and are the first thing the wait staff tells you-- and they know them by heart without having to look at the menu.  My first dining experience was with their vegetarian bean dish, flautas, and a hearty white bean and kale soup. The second time, we had all appetizers and a caesar salad-- the best caesar salad I've had in a LONG time. The calamari was fresh, made on premises and came with a delicate minette sauce. The flautas were perfect, as always, and the mussels with Vida sauce were incredible. Overall-- the food is simple seasonal and some of the best SI has to offer. And observing how the other diners were treated, my friend and I received no special treatment. At Vida, you are made to feel like you're at home.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been here on 3 separate occasions.   The first two visits were okay.  I went with one other person both times, both on busy nights, and we got served in a descent time frame.  Food was okay, nothing memorable.  The third time I went I brought 3 people with me.  It was a Sunday night so I thought we would be fine, considering it was fine on busier nights.  Boy was I WRONG.  We waited 45 minutes for salads and soups.  Then, we waited another 45 minutes for dinner, which never came.  After finally hunting down our waitress, she realized she never put our dinner orders in because it was too busy earlier and the kitchen said to hold up the orders... She didn't even have our order written down anymore!  She wanted to retake them!  At that point we were fed up and left.  I'm sorry.  But that is no way to run a restaurant.  You do NOT tell waitresses to hold up orders.  Hire more kitchen staff then.  Figure out how to run a business.","[0.0, 1.0]"

As far as appearance, Geno's looks much cleaner than Pat's. You could probably eat off the floor at Geno's!. Both Pat's and Geno's are touristy places.

"Definitely one of the best food trucks that I have had.  The main thing about food trucks is the price point, and then you are left thinking what kind of quality of food you could be getting for the price.   This is not your typical Chicken/Gyro Combo and rice truck/stand.  For $6 I got the Combo platter.  The chicken is not butchered like other street meat carts. The pieces of chicken were actually identifiable as chicken and not just scrap meat. You could taste the quality in the marinade as well. Next the judgement on the yogurt/cucumber sauce.  This is LEGIT sauce.  You can taste the freshness and quality of ingredients that went into making this sauce.  It's all about the tartness and the consistency that has me giving this place two thumbs up.  As with any sauce, it should not overpower or mask the flavor of the food, but provide and complimentary flavor enhancing profile to the main star of the show.  No complaints on the rice either.  This place is a must go.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My fist time at Ippudo and I had such a wonderful experience! I loved everything about it. We came in before the rush (before 7pm) and took advantage of the 2 for1 beer special. Nothing like two ice cold asian beers for $6. When the last person in my party arrived we were greeted by some enthusiastic Japanese chants as we entered the dining area. If that couldn't make you happy to be there then nothing can. We ordered some sake and I love how they pour it in the traditional Japanese custom- may your cup over flow. We skipped the appetizers because as I've heard from fellow yelpers that you can't take anything home with you. I ordered the Karaka Kogashi Miso Ramen which I think is my new favorite soup ever. Spicy, salty, tangy plus noodles and pork belly... HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG? My dates chose the specialty ramen of which I took a taste of and it was delicious as well. I repeat, I love this place.

Didn't feel a buzz until about halfway through my 4th lychee martini. Now that's a sign of a good drink. No hangover the next morning too, meaning they probably used decent vodka.

"Lan Zhou hand drawn noodle places (sometimes called Lan Zhou beef noodles, or Lan Zhou Lamian if you are trying to Google it) are all over China, run by ethnically-Hui people from Lan Zhou or near Lan Zhou, and the food is always halal. No Hui people is involved in the management of this ""Nan"" Zhou ((Their Chinese name still says ""Lan"" Zhou though) Hand Drawn Noodle House, of course. But this one's Beef Hand Drawn Noodle tastes rather authentic, just like it is in China! I recommend trying the Beef Hand Drawn Noodle at lease once, as it is their specialty. Any other type of hand drawn noodle dish, especially the pork or seafood ones, is sort of there to please those who are not used to the authentic Lan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle. For the noodle, you can actually tell the server how wide/thin you want your noodle to be be, and I recommend it wide, just because you can't get it in any other type of noodle restaurants.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Put a pic of the gross pizza they delivered me....If I could rate this place no stars I would! First and last time trying this sorry excuse for a pizza place.. I have NO idea how they're still in business. At 6:58pm, I placed my order for 2 crispy chicken sandwiches, an appetizer sampler and 2 slices of pizza.. I understood it's a Friday night, so I was willing to be patient. I called 8:04 to check on the status, they said the driver would be there any minute...The food came at 8:30, THEY ARE EXACTLY 7 MINS AWAY....Alright, maybe the food will redeem them! I opened the bag and was horrified...The pizza looked days old, the cheese on the chicken sandwiches weren't even melted... Ew. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. It looked like the pizza you get from a convenience store, but that's definitely an insult to 7-11's cooking prowess compared to this place.. When I called to let them know the food was unacceptable, the girl on the phone said I gave her the wrong address...IF that was true, why didn't they call me to find out? And how did they find the correct address? LOL...I only said to call about 4 times on my receipt, but no phone call when they got here. And the receipt had the correct address on it. 9:00PM the new food just got here. Pizza is lukewarm. They included free desserts to compensate. Still first and last time.

You see, the neat thing about Peruvian food, much like drugs or yelp, is that it's addicting.  Take a good simple dish of just heavily marinated, slow cooked, juicy chicken.  Already delicious, it's transformed into a oral fiesta (sorry) when I dip it in the green sauce for each bite.  Even though this place really serves too much food, you'll finish it....then drink what green sauce you have left like a shot.  You'll feel guilty too, because you already polished off two green sauce shots already with your chicken bites and fries.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My wife, a native of Sao Paulo, and I were not really impressed. Everything was overpriced, and really the food we had wasn't that good. I had shrimp moqueca and neither I nor her thought it was acceptable. The caipirinhas weren't right, and overpriced ($8). The music was American pop music instead of Brazilian mpb, funk, axe, samba, bossa nova... anything but Britney Spears. Another thing that struck me as strange was that working the grill were two Central American gentleman. Not problematic for any reason, but surprising. Wasn't a very Brazilian experience for us overall. I recommend Brazil grill in midtown. Caipirinhas are $4 usually, and mixed perfect, especially by Samuel. Food is outstanding, too. The service was fine, and nothing stood out as terribly negative, but it wasn't enjoyable overall.

"I've traveled to Turkey and had a lot of Turkish food in my life (comparing NY and DC areas) and this place is by far the best Turkish food I've had. The service is very friendly and down-to-earth (like the decor). The fresh bread and free olive oil/sun dried tomato dip is absolutely delicious. Yes the cold appetizers are really good too but I would only recommend if you are going in a big group because it's better to save your appetite for the main dishes. I've always found the servings to be big enough for 2 people to share, or for one person to take home. Sometimes it's hard to restrain yourself though... For those people who complain that the prices are too high for the New Haven, CT area, they are not appreciating the fine quality of the meats and that everything, down to the bread, is home-made. I'd highly recommend any of the lamb or veal kabobs. Last night we tried the pide (Bread with onions, bell peppers, melted cheese and lamb peices) and it was absolutely amazing.

"I first discovered the concept of Shabu-Shabu on a Yelp Team dinner in San Francisco not too long ago and fell immediately in love (cf this review for further effusive musings: yelp.com/biz/shabu-house…). I tend to be a big fan of anything that involves copious amounts of meat, but really I just like this whole concept. Heed to the tip that you should make a reservation if you've got more than 4 people, you don't want to have to wait in line - and this place is popular.  And why shouldn't it be?  For $24 you get a three course meal with tons of meat, veggies and rice that leaves you with a DELICIOUS broth for sipping when all your beef is cooked and gobbled.  Service is snappy and attentive. Decor is your typical East Village Asian place set-up. My only complaint is that they didn't seem to have any options for broth flavors other than plain old boiling water.  The spicy miso broth in SF was one of my favorite parts of the meal, and I was sad not to see it offered here.  But other than that, it's a great cheap way to get a lot of food, and a lot of fun.

The yogurt was in a teeny tiny container and could not have been more than 2 tablespoons.  It was condiment size.  I compare it to the Hot Grill charging for the ketchup fr your french fries.   RIDICULOUS!!!!  I was STUNNED AND INSULTED and told her I thought that was bad business.  I paid the $1.00, making my total purchase $143.02!!!!!! Although all the food was delicious, it left a BITTER TASTE with me.  So for that $1.00 the owner has lost my business and the business of all the people I can tell about this.  I am sure I can find another restaurant that can provide both good food and a respect and value for customers.  The King has been dethroned!!!!!!!! in my opinion......","[0.0, 1.0]"

It was more of a green salad with croutons than a panzanella salad.  We were all disappointed, and they charged us $9.00 for it.   Dessert was hit and miss.  The carrot cake was great, the chocolate moose was small, but decent (the peanut brittle served on the side was the best part), the cookies were a big mess, but the strawberry/rhubarb tart was a ten!   Will we go back, 100%.  The place is cute, and very affordable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've eaten all kinds of Asian food but never Malaysian cuisine. The BFF & I stopped in (at the recommendation of our NYC transplant friend) after getting foot massages near Canal St. I was a little intimidated by the menu-it's always so hard to know what to get at a new restaurant, so I ended up getting something I was familiar with-an oldie, but goodie: wonton mee (egg noodles in chicken broth with shrimp pork wonton) and the BFF ordered a beef plate (i believe it was the curried beef.) Both very aromatic & brimming with flavor. The roti they serve as an appetizer was buttery and the curry dipping sauce was spicy. The only complaint I have about the curry is that there is oil or fat floating on the surface. It wasn't too appetizing at first, but once I got over it & dug in, the actual flavor was pretty good. I would definitely try this place again if I was in the area because the service was fast, the food is dirt cheap and it looked like there were more locals rather than tourists eating here (a sign of consistently good food.)","[1.0, 0.0]"

It is a no frills decor, but not a hole in the wall, exactly. Home made food, nothing tasting out of a box. The bread is made there daily, and is worth buying a loaf to take home. The salad with their dressing is great, and I always have the minestrone.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been waiting for B4 to get their liquor license, as their menu looked really enticing. Finally we were able to go: husband, kids and grandparents in tow. The decor is really beautiful, the room is spacious, and the acoustics aren't bad at all (though it wasn't crowded when we were there, so hard to say). Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. We started with one of their signature flatbreads, which was really good, though we ordered the standard margherita version in order to please the kids. Next time I'll go for the mushroom or the eggplant. The kale salad was excellent. After we finished our first course it was quite a wait for our entrees--maybe because we got there just after they opened. But we were  almost the only patrons there, so it was a bit mysterious, and the waiter offered no explanation or apology. I had the pork chop which was a little tough, but nicely flavored with onions and apple cider (somewhat different than what's on the menu posted on yelp). Also at our table were the General Tso's duck (fabulous!), the burger (my 8-yr-old was already full from munching on bread while we waited, so we'll have to try that one again), the arugula salad with roasted pears (thumbs up), pulled pork sliders (very good), salmon (yes!). We didn't stay for dessert but were given some tiny brownies with our check--not sure if that's standard; they were nice and chewy and rich. Very good food, several kid-friendly options. We'll definitely be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I had one of the best croque monsieurs I've ever had here... rivaled the ones I have had when in Paris. Curry mussels were also delicious. Come early so you can get a seat for brunch.

We ordered a large pizza with 1/2 clam and 1/2 sausage and pepperonis.  Thin crust pizza, greasy and full of clammy sausage goodness.  Service was not the best and the size of their drink glasses are size of shot glasses which leads to infrequent refills and parched patrons.   Good pizza though... even when you take it out of the fridge the next day with cold congealed cheese all over.  I think I just had to change my underwear thinking about it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is how it went: I wanted indian food. I logged on to yelp and found some good reviews, a few raves, and a few scathing rants. It was hard to tell, so I went and ate at Shalimar of India.  Then I wondered how this restaurant got 17 positive reviews. I know it's northern vermont, but I've had better indian food in Pittsburgh, PA and east nowhere Minnesota. I'm tired of people using our location as an excuse. You can cook good food anywhere, I do it every night in my own kitchen. The food here is bad, and seemed old. There's just no nice way to put it. Maybe the food we ate on Saturday night was left over from the previous week's Sunday brunch that everybody compliments so highly. We were seated immediately (not a surprise as the restaurant was empty), and the service was prompt but that didn't make up for the bland tandoori, the greasy curry or the mushy lentils.

"My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary here. When I called to make the reservation ""Zach"" answered. He got us the best table for the occasion even though this place gets packed pretty much every night! When we got there we waited only 5 minutes for our table. Zach actually walked us to our table and I asked him what he recommended. He said the "" pork bellies "". Wow was he right. They where sweet and flavorful. They had very, very little fat but still packed plenty of savory goodness. Then he mentioned the ""Black Bass"". So we went with that! Another good decision. This was the best fish dish my wife has tasted-ever. I enjoyed the ""seafood enchiladas"". I have been exposed to TOP Mexican food since I lived in TX for years. These where top 3 ! Our server was ""Matthew"". He was very professional and polite. He did not reach over the table. His manner was very pleasant. Finally, you know when you have only 2 main desserts they have to be good. We went with the chocolate cake. Its too complex (in a good way) for me to describe. You'll just have to experience it yourself. We have visited the ""best"" Mexican places here in Philly in hopes in recreating our TX experience. Well we just surpassed it.

"If you're an artsy import from the Midwest who had to choose between Pizza Hut and Dominos growing up then Barboncino might seem like a dream come true. Lighting is a little over a touch too dark, making impossible to see the menu without holding a candle directly to it.  Music is a bit too loud. Not my scene, but I could deal if the food would redeem it.   Our margherita pizza arrived doughy and mushy, flavorless, simultaneously raw and burned to carcinogenic levels in some spots. The wait staff seems inexperienced and the service is poor. It took about 15 minutes to receive a soda I ordered---I was told during the wait that it would be coming out shortly---uh...is someone brewing it by hand? This is NOT real pizza. They don't know what they're doing. Go to John's on Bleecker St, Go to Patsy's, go to Joe's, don't go to Barboncino. Hipster club spot? Sure. Pizza place? I've had better $1 slices.

"Finally visited The Thirsty Koala last night!  Nothing but good things to say here.  We sat outside since we had a group of 6 and there was no space inside - a little bit of misty rain didn't hurt anyone.   Service was superb!  Our server Mark (an Aussie!) was very helpful with our dinner choices and explained everything we needed to know about the dishes we were curious about.  Christine was also super nice as well, coming by to ask us how we were doing and if we were enjoying our dinner. To start off, we got the fried calamari (gluten-free for those who care) - very decent-sized portion and plenty for a table to share.  The sauces were delicious (not your normal tartar/cocktail sauce combo) - there was an herby/yogurty dip as well as a sweet glazy dip.  My only comment on the calamari (it was delicious, don't get me wrong) was that it was not salty enough, or salty at all.  Nothing sauce can't fix though! After much debating, our table got burgers, lamb lollies, and kangaroo steak.  I split with a friend and we shared lamb lollies (medium rare) and the kangaroo steak (medium rare).  Kangaroo doesn't taste all that different to me - it was tender, not too gamey, and cooked just right.  I've heard from others that kangaroo meat tends to be tough because they are so lean, but I didn't have this problem.  It was well seasoned and the fig reduction was yum.  The lamb lollies - oh my goodness delicious.  Not too gamey, seasoned and spiced perfectly, and just delicious overall.  Would probably get this as a full dish the next time I come.  All of the side dishes were phenomenal as well (roasted veggies, caramelized pumpkin, salad, etc) - can't go wrong with anything here. As a treat, we were welcomed with two desserts.  The pavlova was light, creamy, crunchy, gooey, all at once - a little bit like a meringue pie.  The Triple T ( from the website: Australia's iconic chocolate and caramel cookie crumbled and soaked in our delicious espresso syrup, marscaponecrema topped with freshly whipped cream) was AMAZING.  Probably really bad for your but those Tim Tams and that caramel and cream and syrup all coming together was a really good end to our yummy dinner. Drinks are also on the cheaper side here, which is always a good thing. Prices and portions are just right here - would definitely visit again.  We were told though, that these are definitely way bigger than the actual portions in Austrailia :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yesterday, I had one of the most unreal experiences ever. I walked in, waited half an hour for Ippudo, ordered delicious food, and got everything comped. What? That said, I will try not to let that cloud my judgment of the food according to the prices because the prices were indeed there. ($56.62 total). I feel incredibly lucky to have heard about this opportunity, and I think that already speaks volumes about the service and the way that they're really seeking to maximize enjoyment. (And it's a good promo - I had disliked my first and last Ippudo experience SO MUCH that I had never wanted to go again. Well, it's been utterly redeemed). Disclaimer: They'll be tweaking these, so this might not be entirely accurate. Tako marined in wasabi sauce ($5) - totally worth it. The wasabi marinade is perfect the way it is; I'm so glad we tried it before mixing the small chunk of wasabi in. The texture of the fresh,  raw, bite-size pieces of octopus was dreamy - the perfect combination of chewy and firm. Pork buns ($9) - Coated with the secret Ippudo sauce with dabs of Japanese mayo, the generous hunks of pork belly were torched to perfection. $9 is a bit high, but assuming that you and a friend each get one, that's okay. However, it's pretty hard to eat this AND the ramen ... so I think I'd recommend having appetizers as tapas, without ramen, for a light meal. Ramen ($14) - At this price, they're both significantly more expensive than Totto's ramen. I wish they had a half-size portion for $7. (Then again, the receipt does say (L) - so maybe there's a small?) I really liked the aka modern, but I would say that the broth is comparable to Totto's, whereas the karaka's spiciness did not impart the same ""even though this is spicy I'm going to keep eating it"" that Totto's spicy ramen does. :/ The ramen itself is fantastic - excellently al dente to bring out the freshness of the noodles. The pork belly here is also not significantly torched, and although it's definitely well-cut meat and tender, I felt that it could've been better. HOWEVER, the kakuni (braised pork belly) utterly blew me away. Succulent and large, this was quite possibly the best version of pig meat that I've ever had. (Possible contenders: Maharlika's sizzling sisig, Landhaus' maple glazed bacon, my pork adobo ... okay never mind. Definitely better). At $4 an addition (2 very large pieces), it is a must. I loved the way that the marbled fat melded into the meat and the way they tasted together - mind-blowing. Service was fantastic; even though everything was complimentary, they were so nice about recommending extra additions, and someone even came by to ask if we wanted more noodles. :) A customer next to us told us that someone had tried to tip, but they gave the money back, so we didn't. In retrospect, we should've just tipped and run away. :( The ambiance was a lot better than the one in the East Village; directed towards young professionals, it's more modern and classy looking. I especially liked the bathroom with one red brick wall, a red door, and the red (red currant) method soap next to the sparkling white, modern sink. Overall, even though the ramen is significantly pricier (after all, I MUST get the kakuni - so that'd make it about $18 unless there is a small version), I do want to come back. One block away from Totto, Ippudo does have significantly more seating (which would hopefully mean less of a wait). It's kind of awkward that they're so close to each other, but I think this will make it easier on ramen cravings. I loved the appetizers (and I got to try someone's cucumber appetizer - yum! so good for summer), and I would definitely come back for those, if not for ramen.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"4 stars for the friendly service, but 3 for the food. But I preface this review with this statement. I am not a big fan of fried foods, so naturally this place was a little too rich for me. It is nice to have this place in Chinatown though. Refreshing twist from all the Chinese/Vietnamese food around. I came for lunch with a friend and the place isn't too big. Can seat about ten people max. The bar space is long and if you can nab some seats, great place to catch up with friends. Just don't bring your whole entourage lol. I got the fish taco and also a side of fries (under $10). Fish taco was made with breaded catfish and very tasty. I liked it. I ordered fries with cheese and jalapenos and shared it with my friend. Fries were crispy, but man oh man, it was heavy. The whole time I was eating this meal, I was thinking how many miles I would need to run to get rid of the fat... Complimentary water with lemon was refreshing and the staff very friendly and all tattooed up. I like that hipster vibe in the heart of Chinatown.

They offer a pretty good yelp deal ($30 for $50 worth of food) When calling in the hostess had no idea what my boyfriend and I were talking about. She made us feel like it was the craziest question to ask if we can use our yelp voucher on delivery orders.  We don't even think she knew what yelp was. She took it upon herself to say that they could not except the voucher because they needed to see the email. So we decided to order it as take out instead to show her the voucher in person. Taking are food order over the phone seemed annoying to her. It took 20 minutes for the manger to come assist my boyfriend. I'm sure it was because the place was packed. They are pretty popular in this area. The manger did take care of the problem tho & my boyfriend loved the food. A little spicy for me but still awesome.

The burgers are cooked in the restaurant's original oven and, to be clear, the burger patties themselves are medium-rare perfection.  They are extraordinarily juicy and very flavorful.  Everything else begins to fall flat from there.  Burgers are served on white bread for starters.  This doesn't really detract from the taste so much as bring nothing to the table... this is the kind of slacker move 20-year-old me would do when he didn't want to pick up buns from the grocery store... it doesn't make much sense in a restaurant and it is a huge disservice to these burgers.  Toppings are limited to lettuce, tomato, onion, and some sort of funky cheese spread?  I don't know it wasn't readily identifiable and it also was rather bland.  The short of it being is that the burger is the only thing providing an identifiable flavor to this party. Thankfully their potato salad is stellar.  I usually order one of these while I wait for my burger to be cooked (at peak times it can be quite a wait).  Apart from that they offer chips and I have yet to try any of the deserts. The ""ambiance"" of Louis Lunch is largely dependent upon the time of day you're there.  During the day and early evening it is usually pretty quiet.  You can enjoy your burger and chat with the staff who are pretty friendly.  This place is right across the street from BAR and adjacent to Geronimo's.  On weekends you're going to get the drunk crowd which is always a mixed bag on Crown Street.  The restaurant itself is very small which exacerbates this problem when you end up with some obnoxious folks.  To be fair this burger is the best drunk food you're going to get in this neck of the woods (better than Aladdin's Pizza and S'Wings). On the whole Louis Lunch isn't much to write home about.  It makes a stellar burger and then covers it in a mess of bland.  If you want to scratch ""ate a lunch at the birthplace of the hamburger"" off of your New Haven to-do list go for it!  There are better alternatives in town (Prime 16, Shake Shack [overpriced], and let's be honest Burger King) that will keep me from becoming a regular.  Louis Lunch just doesn't do much to stand out.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food was good, but this restaurant had about the worst service of any place I've visited in NYC.  At first things were fine, although the waiter politely refused to get us a round of drinks for dessert because they were closing soon (a disappointment as it was Friday night around 10pm, although not unreasonable).  Then things spiraled out of control when we got our check.  We gave a meager but not outrageously low tip (10%) because our waiter wasn't terribly attentive and we had to call over other wait-staff a few times.  He freaked out and loudly demanded to know why we were giving him such a poor tip.  The conversation didn't go so well, and he started yelling at us to call attention from the rest of the patrons in the still fairly-full bar.  ""Look at these people, who gave ME only a 10% tip! they obviously need the money more than I do!"" and when I told him off (still fairly politely) he shouted ""get out!  you're not welcome here anymore!  don't come back, mother f**kers!  so long mother f**kers!"".   Mind you, they were close to closing, but there were plenty of customers still in the restaurant, many of whom looked mortified.  We certainly won't be returning.  My advice: sit at the bar, and get the food to go.  Who knows, maybe you'll get a show while you wait.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm a little biased since I grew up here and remember it as THE place to get fresh fish(uncooked) as a kid.  But that being said, it's good.  It's better than good.  The prices are great, especially for seafood.  The classic Southern New England Lobster roll rocks.(that's a hot lobster roll to you non-natives)  The fried oysters are wonderful, The service is quick, the Foxon park sodas in the cooler are worth the trip alone, and the decor is outrageously fun. So if you're like me, hop on your bike and get some lobster and a strawberry soda and watch the beach.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of my new faves!!  My boyfriend and I live right down the street and had been in here only once before when they first opened.  It was a little chaotic and you had to order at the bar and seat yourself.  The whole experience turned us off so we didn't return until last week.  So happy we did!! They've reworked the seating and ordering (normal restaurant style) so our experience was so much better.  Our waiter was a guy named Tom and he was amazing!! I'm a very demanding customer so it takes a lot for me to be impressed.  He answered all our questions about the dishes and guided us to some great choices.  We decided on 3 small plates and a side plate to share. We probably would have been fine with the two small plates and a side.  We started with the herbs and greens.  They were easy and tasty and a great healthy start to the meal.  Then came the asparagus with a fried egg and coppa.  One of the best things I have ever had!!!! The coppa was slightly crispy and was amazing paired with the softness of the egg and the flavor of the asparagus.  The menu regularly rotates but we hope this one is on here constantly!!! Next came the Bobby Fries.  I still can't get over these.  I've been dreaming about them all week and counting down the seconds until we go back.  These are mysery's version of the Montreal dish pountine.  The Bobby Fries come topped with cheese curds and cured meet.  These were seasoned with rosemary.  The combo of the meat, cheese and rosemary was so good.  I couldn't stop eating these.  Our waiter assured us these were almost always on the menu.  Our final dish was a duck heart pappardelle. Very good but my boyfriend mentally couldn't get past that he was eating duck heart.  Lastly we ordered the strawberry shortcake. I don't usually want any dessert that isn't chocolate everything, but this was AMAZING.  The cake was like eating an amazing biscuit and nothing like the sponge like cake I grew up on.  The whipped cream was obviously home made and perfectly sweetened.  So good.  But, one of my favorite things that I haven't even mentioned yet was my drink.  It was a balsamic pepper concoction.  This was still slightly sweet which was nice and I loved getting small tastes of fresh cracked pepper from time to time.  There are two downfalls to this restaurant though.  One is the lack of a real bar.  It's kind of awkward ordering at the counter.  You are thinking to yourself  ""Do i pay here, do i order a drink here, or do i just stand here and watch people cook?"" It would be great if at some point they could build in a real place to order a drink.  It would probably entice more people to try some of their creative drink pairings.  The second is the lack of lighter options on the lunch menu.  I work out of my home office and order lunch everyday.  I've looked at the lunch menu a few times and even tried one but for an everyday option I can't have a fried chicken sand which or heavy pork/salami/smoke meat combo.  I love comfort food but I still need a healthy lunch option for most of my days!  Non the less-  You MUST check out this restaurant if you live in the area.  If you are just visiting Burlington this is definitely worth the 5 minute drive away from town.  We're definitely going to be regulars.  These guys get food.  I love creative cooking and these owners understand how to pair foods to really make every individual flavor stand out. I didn't just eat these dishes.  I devoured them and then still wanted more!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Zahav is amazing!  So amazing, in fact, that I ate there tonight and I'm online writing this review now. Some friends and I stopped in this evening for an early dinner.  Our reservation was for four people, but between booking the reservation and actually getting there we invited another friend.  We were a bit worried about them allowing the change, but the hostess assured us that it was not a problem.  We were seated at a corner table, and Michael, our super friendly and attentive waiter came over to introduce himself. Zahav serves family style tapas, so we all ordered different dishes and shared.  We started with the Salatim and Turkish hummus.  The Salatim was a cold salad sampler...very good.  But Honey, that hummus.  That hummus, I said!   It literally melts in your mouth. I need to find out where they sell that hummus, because I'd make it at home and try to pass it off as my own.    YUM!  Ok, Ok, I also ordered the Crispy Haloumi, which is this fried cheese - it's really good.  I also ordered the Fried Kibbe with Tahini, which is kind of like a lamb turnover - also good.  I'm not going to sit here and try to remember everything that everyone ordered - everything was DELICIOUS, but there were a few standouts. 1.  The Turkish Hummus (which was previously stated, but I just had to say it again) 2. The Fried Cauliflower, which is lightly fried and served with a yummy yogurt sauce. 3. The Sweetbread Schnitzel - which is made of melt-in-your-mouth veal. 4.  For dessert, I ordered the Cashew Baklava.  Honey, that baklava was everything that baklava should be.  It was sweet, with a flaky crust and served with a white chocolate mousse. Simply perfect! The service was also great.  Michael was ON IT.  He made entree suggestions, which were really useful.  The staff is great, our glasses were always promptly refilled, and dirty plates were taken in a timely manner. I cannot wait to go back to Zahav.  Seriously, I've only been once, and it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Philly. We all LOVED our food, and you know that's rare for a group.  Zahav is definitely a breath of fresh air!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Whatever happened to customer service!  First walking in the hostess was talking to another staff member and did not even acknowledge customers walking in...no hello, can I help you...so we decided to go to the bar.  Found 3 seats at the end of the bar which had a weird ""L"" shape at the end.  Drink menu too ""out"" there.  Ordered drinks to which the bartender seemed like he was doing us a favor!  No napkin under drink.. bartender actually pushed the drinks in front of us....very, very poor....felt like I was at Applebee's or TGI Fridays.  For the price of the drinks, at the very least we could have received a hello!  Two more of our friends came in the bar to meet us and had a hard time getting the bartender's attention so our friends could get some drinks. The bar was not that busy....and the bartender could not handle it.   The bartender totally made the experience bad....previous Lahiere's, which we have gone to many, many times, the bartender Chris Canavari was always cordial, courteous and knew how to make a drink!    Bring in Chris for great customer service!!!          The 5 of us walked out after our drinks and went to another ""grill"" down the street.  Why stay for dinner after that!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Yum...   We stopped here after a night of bachelorette madness. To our luck, this place was right by the hotel we were staying at. The line was super long but moved quickly enough. I think we spent $6 on the chicken/lamb combo and we put a ton of the white and red sauce. You get a lot of food! We brought it to our hotel, and we were stopped outside our room with a faulty key. We were trying to decide whether to eat it right in the hallway when one of our friends was awakened from her slumber by merely the smell of the food and then let us in. Hahaha. She then proceeded to help us inhale it. Yeah it was good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Me and my wife were trying out this restaurant with two of our friends this Saturday night.  We tried many different restaurants and cuisines, this was one of the very few restaurants that we finished every single dish (10 dishes).  Pricing was less than what we expected.  Food was better than what we had in the other higher price restaurants.  Service was A+++, our waitress Catherine was very nice with a little bit of British accent which we loved.  My favorite dished were the Grilled Atlantic Salmon (Entree) and AHI Tuna Tartar (Appetizer).  The Steam Mussels was pretty good too (the sauce little bit too sweet).  Overall, we will go back very soon to try out other dishes on the menu.","[0.0, 1.0]"

We felt that we couldn't finish our conversation or our glass of wine as they were clearing the table with us still sitting there. Our time at the table from appetizer to dessert was a little over an hour. If you want a good but rushed meal, it is a good place to go. If you want to sit a bit, enjoy a meal and talk to your friends, unfortunately, I cannot recommend it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a bar that sets the bar.  The staff is knowlegeable and traditional in their craft (yes, to them it is a craft.)  I think you would be hard pressed to find such a variety of classic drinks in the city for the affordable prices offered. The only issue I take with this particular establishment is the decor.  The attempt to recreate an art deco (think prohibition) style falls short somewhere between post-modernism and a lack of monetary investment. Should you go to the Narrows and buy a drink?  Absolutely.  Should you say there all night, probably not.  Partly because the drinks are so strong and you will be inebriated soon, and also because there are so many other places in Bushwick to go.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I wasn't dressed for fancy and I usually avoid anything French and pretentious looking, but I could see a gorgeous selection of wine through the window so I talked myself into it. I was pleasantly surprised. I was seated by the window, which was a great seat to people watch along Church Street. I ordered a delicious glass of Pinot Noir, the French onion soup and a cheese and fruit plate. The food and wine were outstanding, almost too beautiful to eat....I totally fell in love with this place. The waitress didn't make me feel out of place in jeans and a t-shirt, but was very nice. I wasn't rushed and I was treated respectfully. I left her a great tip. Definitely worth it! Love to find places that are doing their thing RIGHT. Especially their service.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I haven't been there for brunch for I fear the line but I am so tempted by the reviews. What I did go for was for dinner and it was a sweet experience. I love mussels - and once again, my age caught up with and thus I could not finish even with BF helping me. The broth is so heavenly - and that's the secret, the broth - I would have been happy with a bread and that broth! Oh yeah, which one? I had their white wine celery garlic both recommended by our waiter. He had a heavy accent makes the restaurant authentic and quite friendly. And what more can I say about the Belgian frites? I would like to move to Belgian just for their fries. And yes, what I mean is their fries were delicious - crispy outside, tender inside - oh yummy yummy. BF ordered the codfish and he still reminisce about it and has been hunting for a place like Petite Abeille but I don't think he's having any luck. I know there are many restaurants in NYC and so many new places to try but I would go back to this one...maybe I should go for this one instead of Clinton Bakery...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A tip to diners at a newish hot restaurant that a week earlier got a glowing review in New York magazine......if it's a hour after you've finished dessert, and you're sitting with empty water glasses in front of you....it's time to get up and leave. Take your after-dinner conversation to Clover Club or any of the many, many bars in this neighborhood. Was thrilled to hear it was a 1 hour wait for a table for three when I arrived to put the name in at 6.45. Gave mobile number - and host promised to text when they served dessert and text us to come when they gave the table the check. At 8.15 we came and stood on the sidewalk to convey our interest and intent to be seated. No less than 4 times the manager and host came and provided updates, they could not get the table to leave. Battersby people were incredibly gracious, so much so....they couldn't oust a table that had overstayed. We got seated at 9.30, at an adjacent table, and watched this clueless foursome sit at the table til after 10pm. The restaurant immediately seated 2 couples after they finally departed. Yes, food was delicious...tasting menu is superb.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My fiancé and I wanted to host an engagement party lunch here.  I came in and spoke to the event coordinator, Corina, about making the reservation.  The party was for 20 people and after discussing what food would be included I was given an estimate of the price, which I found satisfactory after another phone call and a confirmation the next day.  A week before the party, we came in to sign the contract.  While the total price of the contract was the same, we noticed that based on the number of appetizers and main courses the cost should have been at about 53% of what they quoted. When we inquired what was the other 47% of the cost ""sneaked"" into the food category, Corina explained that they charged 47 percent of the cost of food to reserve the table, to move the table and to clean up after we left - ""space fee"". This information was not even mentioned during the initial visit and the following phone conversation. On top of that they charged 25% Gratuity. We were puzzled about the ""sneaked"" in ""space fee"" because every restaurant moves tables if the large party comes in and they clean tables and they don't charge any fees for moving and cleaning. Furthermore, when we asked if they would charge such a fee if 20 people just showed up she said that they would not, but that there would be no guarantee that the tables would be available. Meanwhile, when we were there at about 7PM on a Saturday night - supposedly busiest time for such business- the restaurant barely had 10 customers while they claim on the sign by the bar that the max occupancy is 300 people! So the restaurant was not even 5 percent full! In a conclusion, they would not waive this crazy fee so we left. In 2 days I called them out of courtesy and explained why we did not want to use their establishment and they really didn't care, it was as if our business never mattered. The good news is that The Bahche is located in an area with a ton of other choices.  We walked down 5th Ave into Park Slope and within an hour we already had another venue booked where the food was heavenly and they didn't charge us a dime extra. In fact, we saved more than $300. During our search we asked in several establishments about a concept of the ""space fee"" and all of them said that they don't charge such ridiculous fees. So, I guess we should thank the Bahche for being greedy, sneaky and unprofessional so we could fully enjoy a once in a lifetime experience in another establishment that deserved our business just a few blocks away.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The food and service always deserve five stars, but one star is removed because the cake I ordered both times was dry, and on the smaller size. The server when asked said it was ok for sharing. That's really minor and if I could take off a half or quarter star it'd be more appropriate. But I can't; so four stars it is. But let's get real for a moment. The hummus and flatbread (laffa...) is life changing. All flavors are vibrant and will make your mouth dance. It's not as expensive as you would imagine for food that is simple yet elevated.

"I visited The Manor on two occasions: first,  for the ""famous"" lobster buffet and second, for my friend's wedding. The pros:   They generously offer whole lobsters for the buffet and the variety of food is pretty decent. The venue is great for photos: waterfall, bridge, fountains, arched walkway, gazebo, and plenty of flora. They offer water to the guests for outdoor weddings when the weather is hot. Conveniently has a Marriott Residence Inn next door for pre-wedding ceremony preparations and overnight stay. The bridal attendant lady was very attentive and made sure that the bridal suite had plenty of drinks and food. The bartenders were very accommodating and even went out of their way to cater to specific drink requests. The cons: The maitre d (an older bald gentleman) was just HORRIBLE! From his condescending tone to his lack of organization, he really made the experience at The Manor leave a negative impression. First of all, why ANYONE would want to stress out the bride on the dat of her wedding really doesn't make sense to me. Instead of trying to solve the little issues that arose before the ceremony with the appropriate people (e.g the wedding coordinator), he would directly come and speak to the bride and groom. When he was asked to address people other than the bride (and overwhelming her before her walk down the aisle), he was defiant and straight out disrespectful to the bridal party as well. As if making the bride cry before the ceremony wasn't enough, he approached the bride and groom a second time! During the cocktail hour, he proceed to suggest that the couple take out their first dance and the father/daughter & mother/son dance all because it would push back the serving of the entrees a whooping 20 minutes...seriously!? To top it all off, I ended up getting a mild case of food poisoning from the seafood ceviche. What a perfect way to end the night...","[1.0, 0.0]"

The washu Beef short rib sashimi is incredibly tasty as well.   Also highly recommended:  the Mac & Cheese, the Oysters and the Vegetable fondue.  You really cannot go wrong with anything you chose on the menu. Beautiful and very intimate space. The decor is artsy and perfectly suited for an evening out with friends or a romantic date.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Awful service, if there is any service as I never got to get in.  The host just refused to acknowledge there were a few customers who walked in and tried to get tables.  He kept walking away from is and two other parties.  I tried to talk to him a few times to get a number tag.  He simply just walked away from me, even he saw me holding a toddler.  The other party and I were so puzzled and we tried several times to talk to him.  He was right at our face as there were so many people waiting and not that much room.  Again, he walked away with the book he used to write down people's name and numbers of party.  I finally got a number tag and while he was waking away from me, he asked how many people I had.  I told him two adults and one kid.  He did not even write it down and walked away.  I could not find out how long the wait would be.  The other lady did not get a tag and I said to him, while he was waking away that the other lady needed a tag.  He could care less.   It's really upsetting how they treat people and it was day 3 if Chinese New Year on Super Bowl Sunday.  Come on, be nice to people.  His behavior is simply arrogant and rude and give us the impression that he could care less about getting more business because they are so darn busy.  This seems to be the attitude of certain business with the particular ethnic background.  Can't they learn and grow up?  Zero concept of customer service and courtesy.  What a shame to their people! Well I could not make comments about the food as I never got to try it.  We thought we did not need that attitude after driving an hour with a cranky baby for this crap on Chinese New Year.  So, I guess I will never try it and who cares!  I wish they have such good business that they could continue to piss off customers and turn them away.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is a pretty solid burger place.  I always get the L.A. burger because I love avocado on my burgers and the boyfriend always gets the Dallas burger because most of the others have something pork related.  I always get the sweet potato fries (and honestly this is why go to BBP on occasion instead of going to Five Guys every time I want a burger) and the boyfriend gets the regular fries.  The lemonade comes with free refills which is nice, and the table servers are more than happy to add to your order if you see something else you want.  I generally leave satisfied but deep down I question whether it was really worth it (the money and the calories haha).  If it weren't for the SP fries I probably would never go, but there really aren't many other options for SP fries in Philly.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food was good, but I wasn't THAT impressed. My jambalaya was pretty good, definitely New Orleans style. But, the regular ""soul food"" wasn't up to par. I eat better soul food at Thanksgiving.

It's in a great area though, so even if you have to wait for a table, you can wander over to verde or open house to browse around. And after dinner? Capo Giro gelato awaits!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ok, this is a REALLY great place. Once again, kudos to the UES for adding yet another legit spot in the last year. You could easily miss Bondurants walking down the street - it's nothing fancy - just your basic beer bar, and if you like beer like me, that's all you need (I actually think they might only serve beer and whiskey). My friend and I got here close to 7 on a Wednesday and every seat was taken at the bar and the few tables so we sipped our drinks until a couple seats opened at the tables which wasn't long. We each got the kale salad - not a huge portion so we also got the fried pickles to go along with them to share. The salad was really good - tasty dressing - but I've definitely had better fried pickles. Maybe because it was the whole pickle fried and not sliced that threw me off? Either way, great spot, solid crowd and I'll definitely be back to try more beer and food!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Mind you, this would have been fine considering the profuse apologies that came once they realized they had lost our order in the queue. But to add insult to injury, once I finally got my meal, it was majorly dry and overcooked :( I really liked that the chef came around to each table to check on us, but it was sooooo disappointing to find that when I took the chance to note my sad pieces of lamb, I had people on my side. It turns out that the couple next to us also found their meals to be overcooked and very dry and they didn't have the courage to complain until they heard about our issues. While I appreciate their efforts to keep us happy (they ended up comping our meal) and the great waitstaff, it was an overall disappointing dinner - especially considering they've been open for a number of months now.

Well.  I am here to tell you that brussels sprouts ROCK.  (But maybe only at Alta.)  I have no idea what they do to them.  But we eat them there like candy.  Other faves:  those little goat cheese balls with lavendar, fried cauliflower, grilled eggplant.  Oh--and the desserts.  Save room.   Great.  Now I'm hungry.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Dropped by the Minetta Tavern on Saturday to sample the much ballyhooed Black Label Burger.  I like Minetta's bar and have popped in on occasion for a drink, but never tried the food.  On this particular night I arrived with a friend of mine and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes, which wasn't really a problem because the bartenders were nice and we weren't really hungry.   She had the Murray Sour, a combination of 12-year old Japanese Whiskey, cardamom infused Agave and citrus; while I had the Dodd Cocktail, which despite our bartenders statements to the contrary, I would consider in the Flip family because of the addition of egg white.   We were then seated upfront and our attentive waitress was kind enough to drop off the bar menu informing us we could order dishes from that menu that would ""come out immediately if [we were] really hungry.""   We skipped the bar options and decided to split the stuffed calamari, which I usually like.  Minetta's is stuffed with salted cod, potatoes and piquillo pepper; however there was nary a pepper in sight and the combination of potatoes and salt cod was rather bland.   Fortunately, I wasn't there to eat middling appetizers.  I ordered the Black Label Burger medium-rare, while my friend ordered the Filet, medium.  The Black Label is one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Perfectly seasoned with a healthy dusting of salt before hitting the grill and finished with caramelized onions (ketchup need not apply...our bottle sat neglected on the table and lived to sauce another meal).   Her Filet was tasty and cooked properly; but I hate Filet because I don't think it has any taste; which is probably why Minetta tops theirs with Roquefort.  Hell, the waitress recommended (to the pompous couple next to us with the guy asking to see...and then attempting to correct the sommelier) ordering the New York Strip.   We discussed dessert, but decided against it; although next time I think I'm going to have to order the soufflé.  Even though I find it odd they have a soufflé on their menu in the Summer and that we weren't informed they had a soufflé, so we could order towards the end of the meal so we wouldn't have to wait 20 minutes while they fired said soufflé.   n.b. Five Stars for the burger.  Four overall.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"People are obviously enthusiastic about this establishment, and rightly so. They've really been around for an ungodly amount of years. What other restaurant in the area can you say is 30 years old? We talk about the Philadelphia dining scene in single digits, for the most part. The place is literally a block from my apartment, and I honestly didn't know it was there until I walked a different way home one day. Its tiny and unassuming, on the corner of Rittenhouse Sq (the actual road) and 21st. It blends in with all of the other old row homes. We walked in on a Friday night around 7:30 expecting to able to sit right away-it was one of those nights, go somewhere semi casual where we won't have to wait. I have to say I am fairly sure we got lucky because when we walked in with out request for a table for 2 upstairs the response was, ""well, if you have a reservation."" The host was gracious enough to check for us and then give us a detailed outline of a potential wait-which wouldn't have been too bad, but then told us there was a bar table available. That was out bad, I should've been more clear-the more causal the better-and so we sat at a perfect little corner table upstairs near the bar. The bar with the huge fish tank. The first thing my boyfriend said was that the place reminded him of a European cafe, maybe something you'd find in Amsterdam. Really tight, low ceilings, no fancy or designer decor. I have to say that resonated with me-I feel like I was transported back to my trip the the Netherlands. The tiny corner table was just what we wanted. If you sit at the bar, you order from the bartender. Though he was busy, he was very friendly and accommodating to us. We ordered our food and couple glasses of house wine to start. Being beer drinkers (snobs), I would say that we skipped the 3 taps for lack of excitement. I guess this isn't a place that fits in with the typical Philly craft beer scene-though, they were here first so I'll let them have it. The food came out and we were blown away by the mussels, probably the best I've every had. Yes actually, ever. I am pretty sure because they were cooked in mostly butter. But duh, butter. We also shared grilled veggies and the fish special of the day which was a cod with ""Mediterranean sauce."" The veggies were up my alley-not all the typical grilled veggies you'd assume but included fennel and sweet potato. The fish-not so exciting. It tasted ""healthy,"" and what I mean by that is a little bland. We enjoyed our food, a perfect amount of food for two people, and chatted with some locals. The couple next to use raved that this was their favorite restaurant that they'd been frequenting for 12 years-and they lived across town. Try the mushroom soup! They said. Next time... next time. Honestly, I would come back here, but probably only under the same circumstances of relaxed/casual bar table in the cozy little corner near the fish tank. I don't see this place as being somewhere I'd take someone I'd want to ""impress"" with the Philly food scene, but someone I actually want to talk to an enjoy a casual meal out with.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I wish I had come across this restaurant sooner. Having always been a fan of malatesta and not realizing there was a sister restaurant, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon malaparte and decided to give it a try. Not only was the food off the chart, the service was impeccable. I have to say that the service as malatesta has gone seriously down hill which is why we were on the look out for a new italian favorite. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful meal and kept it mind for the next time we wanted a low key evening with great food and wine. Fast forward 2 weeks. My family came to visit, which included my parents, 2 brothers in their early twenties and one of their girlfriends. May I also mention that my father is extremely impatient and we had a diverse group of tastes. After the wonderful service, reasonable prices and great food we had the last time we were there, we decided to take the group to malaparte. The wait staff made the night our most enjoyable meal of the visit. The staff was attentive, made sure the group always had drinks and the wide range of food, came out quickly, done to perfection and no one was waiting for their dish. Additionally, when paying the bill we did not notice that gratuity had been included (due to the extremely reasonable prices) and tipped on top of it. The staff immediately pointed it out to us and returned the extra money. I can not say enough I impressed I was by the staff.

The staff is friendly and willing to answer any questions as the menu does not have descriptions for certain things that you have no idea what it is.

We ordered the grilled beef tacos, mahi mahi tacos, and shrimp tacos. We also got sides of the creamy poblano corn rice, recommended by our waitress, and the rice & beans.

"We went here on our trip to New York in February 2012 and came here on the friend's recommendation and this place is legit! We got there right before the dinner rush and grabbed a drink at the bar (2 for $6 Sapporo special) before being led to our communal benihana style table. Even though it was a shared table it didn't feel too crowded. They also had cool booths if you can snag one for your group but there were only two of us. We started with the pork buns and the raw octopus with wasabi. The pork buns were delicious and the bun so fluffy. The raw octopus was different but not my cup of tea, the boyfriend sure liked it though. We ordered two of the dark hot ramen's and the boyfriend added braised pork belly to his and that was worth the extra $4 alone. They give you a ridiculouly big spoon but the ramen was sooo good. For dessert we have green tea creme brulee which was okay. Bill came out to about $75 with tip.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"AWFUL DRINKS! Overloaded with ice and watered down beyond belief. Average food. AH-MAZING corn and fish tacos. Décor: Pretty standard, nothing outstanding. The spot is pretty long and narrow. Two seat tables. If you have an odd number in your party, it may be problematic and may result in a longer wait for the taller tables. Parking: There is street parking and metered parking. I've always had to drive around several times before finding parking. Service: Solid. The one person that gave me outstanding service was someone that wasn't even my assigned charger. She noticed that I needed a charger and offered me her charger out of her own purse.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Well let me start with what i ordered which is the first time i had ever ordered here. 1 Large Pie Extra Sauce, 1 Meatball Parm and a 1 garden salad... Ok as far as the Pizza their sauce is honestly not bad, the cheese is ok but maybe it would of been better if it wasn't burnt. So if you order pizza maybe you should suggest to them, not to over cook it or cook it medium. Meatball Parm sandwich the cheese makes you gag and the meatball don't taste fresh strange taste really, maybe it was from yesterday or older. Salad was good but not enough dressing. However this is the first time i ordered at Ferrulli Pizza maybe next time will be better.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was in town for a convention and this place was at the top of my ""to-go"" list. Not because of the hype, but because I love all things gastropub. We had a 1.5 hr wait on a Fri night and it was well worth it. We ordered the pork belly with white beans and side of kale which was the best pork belly I've ever had, cooked crispy to perfection. The kale was so flavorful. A friend ordered the Prosciutto and ricotta tart which was amazing. The flourless chocolate cake with sour cream was the perfect consistency and not too rich, a great combination with the tartness of the sour cream. The cocktails were extremely strong and flavorful, perhaps a little on the sweet side. The restaurant itself has a intimate, old class atmosphere. It's dark and cozy and the bar area was very lively. Young and older people mixed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here for brunch on a lovely sunny Saturday. The decor and space is very impressive. Lots of dark wood and velvety couches. The open rooftop in the back gives their space versatility and suggests one could throw an impressive private event here. The menu for brunch was limited so it is unfair to judge but that this is a tapas restaurant and there weren't many tapas on the menu for brunch was disappointing. What I ordered... eggs I think, was fine. Unremarkable. The brussel sprouts, cauliflower appetizer was more memorable though not complicated. Service was good. Attentive and good humored. It was a sunny day and everyone was happy for it. Overall it's a good restaurant with a great decor.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I  was here this evening to order take out. I was thoroughly appalled to see the manager's attitude towards customers. A lady came in to order food. She took less than a minute to think about what she might want to order. Mind you, there was not  a single person in line at the moment, and the manager tells her ""You better hurry up lady and make up your mind and decide,  we have a lot of other customers and can't keep waiting for you."" The lady walked out. I immediately said to him in an very polite way, that it was rude and drove the lady/customer away. He says to me, ""I been doing business for several years and look how many customers we have. Do not teach me how to run a business! Wow! this is incredibly disgusting customer service to say the least, especially from a manager of a restaurant. Least expect this attitude from a person who runs a business!","[0.0, 1.0]"

They also have specials from time to time featuring smoked brisket and fish tacos. They announce them on their facebook page. The service is always good, everyone there is friendly and it is a great neighborhood place They also do breakfast tacos and burritos which are just as delicious.

I also recommend the super-cheap lunch deal- 8$ for an appetizer and main. My favorite main is the pad Thai of course, and for appetizer I recommend the Taro Fritters- really tasty and fun. Just a small note- the restaurant is pretty tiny, so don't come with a group larger than four or else you will have to wait forever for a table. All in all, pinto never lets me down.

"I used to go to Hot Tomato's all the time, but have not been in many years.  Not for any specific reason, there are just too many restaurants out there and it kind of fell by the wayside.  We had an event we were attending at Artspace and we arrived in Hartford early, so we decided to pop into Hot Tomato's for a drink. As soon as I walked in, I smelled all the delicious smells that reminded me of what I loved about Hot Tomato's.  Their food is just so good.  I generally hate fried calamari, but I like it at Hot Tomato's.  My other favorites include their cheesy garlic bread and tort rose.  If you're trying to keep it on the lighter side, the spasta pesto is a surprisingly tasty vegetarian option. But this time we were not there for food and headed to the bar.  They had a short martini menu but there were several drinks on it that appealed to me.  I went with a Sexy Lexi, which had strawberry vodka and many other liquors and juices that I cannot remember - and it came out tasting like a strawberry smoothie.  And it was strong enough that I did not need a second drink!  Yum!  My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea...not exciting to me but chock full of liquor which is what he loved about it. I am definitely putting dinner at Hot Tomato's on my to do list for the summer.  I need to try some of the other martinis and explore some of the newer items on the food menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came for a birthday dinner with my family before heading out to see a show. As we were being seated, it was explained that Print is a farm to table restaurant, with ingredients being sourced daily and locally. Very cool in my opinion. SERVICE: I usually do food first, but the service we had was top notch. Our server gave us wine recommendations, and when we still hesitated, he gave us tastes of several to help our selection. His recommendations for food were also delicious. And the entire staff is very unobtrusive while still being very attentive. They removed the plants on the table when they noticed we kept reaching around them. Our server quietly confirmed cooking preferences that he forgot to ask about for the rabbit dish - not disrupting our table's conversation. Last, they waited to clear dishes until everyone was done - and never interrupted to ask if they could clear. Really just perfect. FOOD: Now the food was also really great. I got the gnocchi and my sister got the octopus. The gnocchi was really delicious and the octopus was tender and not chewy at all. Highly recommend both. Also portion sizes were pretty large. For my main, I got sea bass. It was a nice dish that felt filling but at the same time light. For dessert we split a chocolate s'more cake. It was good but comparatively to the rest of the meal, I could have done without. ENVIRONMENT: We had a really early dinner to catch our show - so the restaurant was almost empty when we started. By the end though, it was packed. However, acoustics didn't make it overly loud. Lighting was pretty dark. The restaurant was a bit hard to find - but there's not too much else on the block so you can't really miss it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This has been one of the most refreshing dining experiences I have had in a great while.  I went on a Friday night with no reservation, and though it seemed packed we  only waited about 20 minutes for a table. While we waited we got a drink from the bartender, who was clearly slammed but still managed to take the time to find me a wine I would love.  I am not a vegetarian but I found the all vegetarian menu to be interesting and enticing. I had the sweet potato enchilada and my fiancé had one of the specials, a Moroccan chick pea stew served in a squash bowl with mashed potatoes. Both were incredible!!!! The food was a great combination of unique, distinct, flavorful, comforting, and delicious. I would have ordered either of the dishes over a meat based dish at any other restaurant.  Ambiance is simple and soothing, nice lighting and I love the exposed brick walls.  Also the owner baked all of the deserts options and they sounded phenomenal. I wanted to taste so much of the menu that I was left without room for a desert tasting... Revolution kitchen is clearly an owner operated establishment (something we sometimes lack in the  Burlington area), with friendly staff, wonderful customer service (even under stress) and fabulous food. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I love hotdogs-anywhere in the world will try them (skip the ones in Cuzco, Peru) and got a chance to put my first visit to Underdogs one flight down in a cheerful (ah the smell of dogs) little place on 17th.  Packed with other fans of the classic dog - all whoofing down beef dogs but with lots of other choices (even though they did not have Rippers, a boardwalk or a ballgame) .  Today went with the classic Coney Island - mustard and sauerkraut - and it was great - top 10% of the 1000's i have eaten - maybe even a higher ranking if the bun was a bit smaller and the doggies had a bit more crunch- but smack down the fries as they are great - for $7 had a top end lunch -- will be back to try some of there other dogs - recommend unconditionally.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been a customer of this restaurant for years - at their old location and this new one.  Years ago it was amazing, and now it's only gotten better :)  Everything is great - the pizza, sandwiches, and full Italian meals.  I've honestly never had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious.  And, the atmosphere in this new restaurant is top-notch, beautiful and is just a great place to be.  Also, recently my family had a large event in their dining room and the service and food were AMAZING.  The staff was kind and courteous to everyone and always on top of everything - no one had to wait for drinks or food, etc...  And finished meals/plates were removed promptly.  Everything from the atmosphere, to the food to the service was literally perfect and my family and I appreciated everything they did for us that day.  Also, both the owners (it's a nice family-owned business) and the staff are all great people and I've never had a bad encounter in all of my time being a customer with this restaurant.  I would recommend Giulietta & Romeo to anyone who loves good quality, authentic Italian food.  PS - for our family gathering, nearly everyone in the party of 50 had told me I picked an amazing place and everyone was impressed with the atmosphere, food and service.  Again, it's just a great overall place.  :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

But we walked in and were very warmly received and seated.  The dining room is large, well appointed and comfortable. The staff was quite friendly and very eager to please. The menu is full spectrum northern Italian, and there were several specials that night as well.   We started with the calamari - fresh, tender, lightly floured and delicious. We had the fish special, and the vegetable lasagna - both very good. The price is more than fair, and the service superb. Tonight we went back for a second time, purposefully.  Started with the goat cheese and walnut salad, followed by a steak, although I was really tempted by the ravioli special.

"Since the last time I came here, which was 4 years ago, Grimaldi's has gotten a lot bigger and popular.  Four years ago, it was a little shop in the middle of the block.  Now, Grimaldi's moved to this white castle at the corner of Front Street.  The place expanded to two floors. With two friends of mine, we waited in line for hours just for a couple of slices of pizza.  When you finally get a table, you might as well order three whole pies, one for each person, because the slices are so thin and you are starving from waiting so long.  Once you place your order, be prepare to wait another hour or so for your pizza, because they make each pie from scratch.  You are so hungry that you might start eating the peppers from the table.  Finally the pizza come and you take the first bite, and it is not that amazing.  It's just regular pizza with fresh mozzarella and fresh basil.  Grimaldi's famous tomato sauce does not taste that different from a regular sauce.  Although, the slices were very crunchy due to the fact that the pie has a thin crust and bottom.  The whole pie cost $16 for the large pie (18 in.).  It is $2 extra for extra mozzarella or sauce, or basil.   Service was decent.  The waiters were really busy trying to serve all the tables that we were forgotten at times.  The check took a while to get to us as well. Personally, the pizza was not that special for me to wait in line and pay more than double of what I would pay at Two Bros.","[1.0, 0.0]"

As for the food, it's bland, Italian food has flair, the Ceasar Salad is bland, limp and soggy, the main courses are OK, but I can cook better at home and the $25 bottles of wine are barely $10 down my off-license. Each time the (so called busy) staff walked by their was so little room that they kicked my chair every time! The owners should wake up!

"Odd that Mario Batali is a partner of this Spanish establishment.  The tables are small, interior is dimly lit, and there's a bar with court-side views of the chefs in action.  Okay fine, the small plates can be traced back to Otto's antipasti selection, but similarities disperse from there. The charcuterie and terrine board is a must get.  Pates, head cheese, mustard and pickles -- easily some of my favorites foods on one plate.  The foie gras, rich and caramelized as it should be. Oh and the fideos with clams!  A touch on a salty side, but ever so perfectly executed.   All too often at small restaurants that serve sweetbreads, the membrane isn't completely removed resulting in unpleasant flavors and textures.  Not here, sweetbreads were perfectly cleaned and had a great char on them.   It's a tight fit and reservations are somewhat difficult, but plan your visit in advance and you'll surprisingly be rewarded.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Cafe Matisse was one of the best food experiences I've ever had.  The grazing menu is very interesting and different - I suggest checking out the menu and concept before you go.  You can choose to have three or four courses - either two savories and one dessert, or three savories and one dessert.  Even if your companions are ordering a different number of plates than you, they time it well.  There is a wine shop at the front of the restaurant, which is a nice shop as Rutherford is a dry town. Everything was delicious and extraordinary.  The service was impeccable and kind.  My only issue is that they offer a 10% discount if you pay in cash, but they told us this when we were given the check, and were very pushy about it.  Yes, it would have been nice to save 10% off of the bill, but for a six person meal, it was obvious that we did not have that kind of cash on us at the moment, and it was quite late - we didn't really want to go out and find an ATM.

"I have always loved Pietro's until my last visit, when the manager did something that has caused me to swear to never return! When we were getting ready to pay our bill, my friend asked a passing busboy to get us change, handing him a $20 bill. He never returned and when we asked the waitress to check on this, she came back and reported that the busboy said we had never given him any money! We most certainly did, so she called the manager over. The manager was very rude, and proceeded to basically accuse of trying to rip off the restaurant, saying that he busboy was very honest, etc. He offered us NOTHING for this loss of $20. I think maybe the busboy got so busy he legitimately forgot, but I still think the manager should have reimbursed us. Why he would think two business people would make something like this up to get $20 back is beyond me. VERY poor customer service - I won't go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

But the real problem I had was I am almost positive that my food was partially microwaved! I heard the bartender refer to my order being done being ""nuked"" in 2 minutes and when my small plate of steak tips, Im pretty sure he meant microwaved when he said nuked.

"OK. YES, the pizza is good and YES, they are very popular on Yelp with a line out the door but, NO, this does not warrant their employees being so rude throughout our dining experience. Grimaldi's serves up some seriously good pizza. The crust is thin and the mozarella cheese...oh my, it was so creamy and stringy..just as it should be. The pie definitely held up to all the ingredients without getting too soggy and the price isn't bad either ($20 for a large that served 3 people!) and I can see why the establishment competes with Lombardi's! I would say both restaurants are different but, both great. HOWEVER, I would chose Lombardi's over Grimaldis soley on customer service. Throughout our service these are some of the comments we've received from the employers: 1. We told them that the bathrooms were really dirty with trash piled up and on the floor..just an FYI from a customer The response: ""Well what do you want me to do? there are 100s of customers, I can't clean it. I have better things to do!"" 2. We were seated at a table of 4 (party of 3) and so, we put our bags in the empty chair. The response: ""Move your bags, I need this chair."" UMM HAVE YOU HEARD OF ASKING NICELY!? 3. We just finished our meal, our drinks were still full and their was a table next to us that finished way before us just chit chatting. The response: ""Hey I have a line out the door, can you girls hurry it up."" OK.. REALLY!? I get it. Grimaldis is so popular and no matter what anyone says, one 3-star review can't really bring down the beast but, just cause you have this type of popularity doesn't mean you can talk to you customers like trash. We're still paying customers, there is no need for rudeness. All of the things above we would have been HAPPY to overlook and accomodate if it was said with just a twinge of politeness or mannerisms in mind. Going beyond, customer service, would you talk to anyone like this!? FOOD: 4.5-5 stars SERVICE: SHIT. GO TO LOMBARDIS.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had no expectations walking into Khyber Pass Pub so to say it exceeded my expectations would be silly. However, I did have an enjoyable experience and left with a nourished tummy and quenched thirst. Completely starving after a long day of traveling, I ordered their Khyber Burger and it was delicious! The meat was cooked to my exact liking. Being from KC and being not a fan of BBQ-flavored burgers, I was apprehensive about the bbq onions but alas, Philly's definition of bbq is a bit different than in the midwest and I was pleased with my choices. Everything was savory and the service was top-notch. I do have to make mention that one of my friends ordered the wings trio variety and they were SPICY. Like...to the point where you couldn't enjoy it. You've been warned! They have a variety of beers as well.

"Loving both seafood & craft beers, this place called out to me. It's very small (plan for this when wanting a table on the weekends - we waited over an hour & 1/2 for one!). We sat at the bar and enjoyed an immense plate of oysters that were shucked right in front of us, ranging from East, West & Northern Coasts and offered a vast array of flavors. The main courses are small, which can be quite nice but take heed to this and order sides if you are starving to death! Though the dishes are small, they are well executed seafood plates that offer the freshest of locally caught fish & shellfish typically paired with a grain of pasta. The waitstaff is delightful, especially the people working the bar. If you strike up a conversation with them, you quickly realize how quirky and generous they are, which is handy when wanting to know more about a beer or to taste their freshest tapped keg.

"Pass on The Spot, even if you only set mediocre standards for your lunch/breakfast dining experience. Here's why: 1) The staff is extremely UN-helpful and unfriendly; one employee's attitude reflected utter disdain for me and my ""stupid"" question about whether we order at the counter and seat ourselves. She said, ""We're a full-service restaurant and we seat you. There are signs all over the place telling you that."" For the record, as of my writing this review, there are TWO signs in the outdoor seating area--and neither of them faced the direction from which I entered. Also, there is no host stand inside to imply they will seat you, there was no host standing anywhere, and another server who was behind the counter could not even bother to raise his head from what he was doing to say ""hello"" or tell me I'd be helped momentarily. 2) They proselytize the charms and advantages of buying local, stating on their menu that ""a large percentage"" of their items are from Vermont. Sure, they don't say ""all"" their items are locally/regionally procured, but I would have expected a better quality of cheese than Kraft Singles on my $13 cheesesteak sandwich with potato chips, especially considering that Cabot is a nationally recognized Vermont-local item.... Oh yeah, and the straw thing--you're in the HOSPITALITY industry--just because it's your standard practice not to put straws in your drinks, you don't have to cop an attitude with customers if they politely request one. In conclusion, well, if you are willing to put up with rudeness, slow service and overpriced food to enjoy their outdoor seating or indoor ambience, then by all means, patronize The Spot, but otherwise, you're better off moving along.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Pat's over Geno's by a small crapy margin!!!! FML for having to taste Geno's then to Pat's!!! The meat had more falvor than Geno's but really by not much.  Same cardboard texture with a bit more spices..  If I were to be deserted in Philly and Pat's and Geno's were then only two places open (what a nightmare), I would have to eat at Pat's... Btw, if you ever need a plastic knife to cut your sandwich into smaller pieces for whatever reason, make sure to take your own from home because the idiot cashier will not help you out..   The point:  avoid this place just like you avoided Geno's; they both suck big time and their fake so called rivalry has added to their good for nothing fame.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went here for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We arrived at 7:30 and the place was not packed which is nice. The decor is cozy and the low lighting is relaxing.  We start with a glass of wine and we start with the Brooklyn greens salad and I ordered the lasagna and my boyfriend order the fresh pasta with ricotta. I like that the menu is small because that means that the dishes are delicious. I LOVED the lasagna, it was tasty and had a bit of spice.

"I've been coming to this diner for a while now and the food is always on point and the service is usually good. At first we had this one waitress who was awesome. She made me love to come to the diner. She was quick and nice and always had good conversation. But recently me and my friends have been going to this diner and the waitress we always get now sucks soo much. I don't mean to be rude but she is slow and forgetful, never checks up on us for more water ect. She took forever to bring us out our side orders after we got our meals. My one friend ate his whole meal before his side order came out. Even when we tried to sit somewhere we think isn't her section it always seems like she's our waitress. I love this diner but I am seriously considering never coming here again because the service it just so shitty. This waitress has yet to get a single dollar for tip out of me and she will never get it. Sorry for being rube but she needs to be fired or else you'll risk good paying customers to never return. She is short with short brown hair.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I have been going to this place for many years and I refer clients there as my business is in the neighborhood. I have probably sent hundreds of people there over the years. (I have been in SoHo for over 2 decades.) Yesterday as we were going in for the umpteenth time, I heard a lady outside refusing to go in because she felt they were rude and arrogant. I was quite surprised to hear this. We sat down and ordered but was told by an icy waiter that the salad I wanted couldn't have the asparagus it normally came with as they were out of asparagus. I said it wasn't a problem and asked for some extra avocado instead. Well...you would have thought I had asked for the world. He told me to find something else on the menu, pretty much refusing to take my order. I said I preferred the avo but he got snootier and snootier. We're talking about a $9 salad here folks...and so I asked for the manager. He sneered at me and told me it would take a long time to see the manager as he ""was too busy"" and so I got up to go to him myself but he ""got to him"" before I did and again was told there were no substitutions and if I didn't like it, I could eat somewhere else. Well we did...across the street at the ever fabulous Peep -- and let me say this, I will never eat at Il Corallo ever again, and nor will I refer the dozens of hungry tourists that seek our advice for an eatery in SoHo. Horrible, unfriendly service that doesn't deserve the loyalty of an old timer and all of his referrals.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went with a reservation for two at 2pm on a Tuesday. We could have easily gotten a table if we just walked in. We both got the two plates and dessert meal. We were expecting quality, but somewhat meager portions. Fortunately, we were wrong on the latter and not the former. Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna - Perfectly cooked with an interesting and flavorful spicy mayo. Fried Chicken - Seemed like a deboned thigh then rolled up. A tiny bit dry near the end piece, but overall moist and crisp on the outside. Accompanying mushroom spaetzle was great. Cod with Miso Yuzu Glaze - A great light fish dish with lots of flavor and simply dressed baby bok choy. Char-grilled Cheeseburger - My friend had this and said it was definitely one of the better burgers he's ever had. And I know he's had a lot. It came with very good fries. Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake - Served with vanilla ice cream. Very rich, very good. I went with high expectations and was definitely impressed overall. It was a fine dining experience without the rigmarole and price usually associated with fine dining. Looking forward to going there again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Went here last weekend for brunch. Got here right when they opened and was seated immediately. We were only a party of 2 but if you're going to be a large group I recommend reservations or going around 2:00pm. That's when things seemed to slow down. Also a recommendation by our waitress. The food was delicious. I ordered the Apple Cakes with eggs, bacon, and a hash brown. My favorite was the hash brown. It had the perfect crispiness that can be hard to achieve. The bf and I both wanted mimosas so we decided on a pitcher. For two people it was rather large and after brunch we found ourselves drunk shopping at a near by hardware store. Painting a barrel in his apartment seemed like a good idea at the time. 3 days later it's still sitting in the middle and only half done. Blame it on the alcohol..","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Dude, I don't want to eat gizzard.  I don't even know what the hella gizzard is.  I look it up on Wikipedia on my iPhone.  It says gizzards are a kind of second stomach. Some even have teeth. Annie gives me the evil eye, ""Tony, JUST EAT IT."" ""Ok,"" I mumble. Whether you're here for a few bites and a beer, a few shots of sake, or yes, the gizzard, you've come to the right place.  Hagi is open late without the late night crowd, the service is fast and friendly with earnest menu item recommendations, and it's by Times Square which makes it an oasis in a dessert filled with tourist traps. And it's very clean, has a warm and inviting atmosphere.  I think at the time I was there, I was thinking it was lacking some of the charm you'd find at St. Marks place.  And looking back, sometimes less is more. And ironically, last night at a Japanese tapas restaurant in San Francisco, I found myself asking, ""I wonder if they have gizzard on the menu...""","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I kept hearing about Buttermilk Channel. The New York Times ran an article, some women were gushing about it on the subway, and then I passed by it not long ago while going down Court Street. My nose sniffed a fad-laden, perhaps pretentious and maybe not so enjoyable experience, but boy, was I wrong. Buttermilk Channel truly pleased in every sense of the term. I kept searching the menu looking for something to criticize or scoff at, but it was not possible. Truly New American offerings are presented in a thoughtful and coherent manner that keeps with the uniqueness of a place like this. I went with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening and we were in for a real treat. I'll start first by saying that they don't accept reservations for parties under five. I guess it's popular enough, and totally excused based on the quality of the experience I had thereafter. We cleverly arrived around 4:45pm to wait for them to open at 5:00pm, thereby successfully avoiding a wait of any kind. We were promptly seated at 5:00pm and it was all excellent from there. Impressively so, by about 5:15pm, the place was packed and it already appeared that a wait list had materialized. The menu offers a truly impressive variety of simple, but elegant dishes that are sure to please. We started with the sweet potato & goat cheese croquettes and an organic green salad to start, both of which were lovely. I went off on a mini-tangent about how nice it is to see sweet potato used in a more savory approach - Fantastic. We were served a few Yorkshire Puddings instead of bread on the table, which was great - I had the duck meatloaf as my entree, which was presented beautifully on a layer of creamed spinach & celery root, and in a pretty generous portion. Another person in my party had the lamb romaine salad which looked delicious and everyone was really pleased. The wine and beer list is extensive and made to make any native New Yorker proud - All their beers are New York State, and a handful of their wines are too - Mostly Long Island and Finger Lakes. We ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of North Fork wine which was exquisite and I couldn't get over how lovely the presentation of everything was. The restaurant itself is a bright, buttery yellow space that is sun-splashed in the early evening and warmed by dark wood floors, exposed brick and tasteful lighting and candles. The prices are very reasonable for the caliber of a place like this and I was really satisfied above and beyond with everything. Overall, Buttermilk Channel is truly superb and I can give it my highest recommendation.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been going to Sushi You since this place opened, but after tonight I won't be going there again. It took us over 2 hours to sit, dine and eat. We had no place mats, our table was not wiped and we sat with dirty dishes on our table for over thirty minutes. Our order was taken about 35 minutes after that. After waiting forever just to get water, the waitress gave us a bowl of edamame ""on the house"", but it was like pulling teeth just to pay after we ate. It literally took us all of 10 minutes to complete our meals. All three tables after us had turned over. We waited about 20 minutes for the waitress to get the bill, and after I had enough I walked to the counter to pay and waited just for her to ring me up. It was really really ridiculous. I almost comtemplated not even paying at all. The food was ok, but it sure was not even close the the time I waited. I was aware that it was very busy, but being thrown in a corner and forgotten about for 2 hours? With a dirty table? Forget about it. I would drive the additional 2 miles to go to Aki Sushi instead.

"Amazing authentic mexican food. I've been to Taqueria once in downtown jersey city, and shortly  after visited El Aguila Dorada, because one of my friends was complaining how overpriced the food was and how the quality of food wasn't as good as El Aguila's food. Turns out, my friend was absolutely right. Taqueria gives you about 3 tacos for 9 bucks, but El Aguila gives you something like 5 for the same price.  Also the quality of the salsa is much more thicker and richer instead of something watered down like Taqueria. The service and waiters were nice and the pricing isn't bad at all. It has a nice homely environment so if you want to have a quiet dinner with a date this is your spot! If you live in or around the Bayonne area definitely check out El Aguila, you won't be disappointed!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I walked inside Cuban Pete's with high expectations tonight being the fact that the food did smell good and my family and I were celebrating three birthdays. But high expectations turned into a nightmare We came in at 7:40 to reserve our our table of 12 and they told us the wait would be 2 1/2 hours. The more we waited the more people who came with us began to leave because of the wait. We ended up waiting for 4 hours and on top of that half of our party left because they had work in the morning. The manager, Dominick, had a repulsive attitude and was very rude. He showed no interest in what my family had to say about the long wait or that people who came after us were being called before us. We ended up being the last party being called. A shameful restaurant to be served in. I, myself ended up leaving cause I couldn't stand to eat in a restaurant where the employees work ethic was horrible towards their customers and the manager and employees could care less on their customers thoughts. Whenever we spoke about how long we waited, Big Headed Dominick would act like he didn't hear a word you said, which made me wanna slap the fat off his neck.

"The chicken pho definitely lives up to its hype. Juicy tender chicken in perfectly made broth, with their specialty dipping sauce, all for a very low price. So why do I give it 3 stars?

We ordered 7 chicken phos to-go, and asked him to also pack the salt that normally comes with the pho. With 7 orders, he only gave us TWO, and when we asked for a few more (because, you know... we ordered SEVEN), he looked at us like we were crazy, and said that if we want more we have to pay.

One of the best Indian restaurants in New York City. Their take on Indian street food is spot on so definitely order the pani puri and  crispy okra. The mutton curry and biryani are authentic in taste and my favorite dishes in the restaurant. The best way to wrap up the meal is to order some saviyan which are covered in chocolate. I have made multiple visits to the place in order to try everything on the menu and have been delighted with the flavors and presentation each time. Their cocktails are great as well although they make them quite strong which may be good for some folks.

"Wayne location. I had heard good things about this place - fresh locally grown food, vegan options, gluten free etc. I was disappointed and hungry when I left. I ordered the swordfish special for $29. It was a small boring piece of fish with a portion of fat. It was a pretty display but nothing for the palate. 2 cooked grape tomatoes, several raw mini squash, 2 cut halves of some orange root vegetable (can't imagine what; too hard to eat), one tiny cut roasted potato, about 1 Tsp carrot/parsnip puree (tasty), some green stringy garnish (like limp spinach or broccoli rabe). On the good side, nice atmosphere, adequate though not friendly service, good parking, ""main line"" clientele.  Maybe a good place for drinks. Expensive.

Enjoyed a very large, fresh, and well-dressed house salad for our group of 4.  We were fighting over it! We all went with the special turkey sandwich, and it was incredible.  We had it on pumpernickle and rye.  Each bread was incredibly fresh.  The turkey was moist  and hearty.  The special cranberry mayo was a hit at out table. Sides were very good as well.  The potato salad was AMAZING!  Best I have had in the area.  It tasted like it had some spicy mustard in it, which I love.  The basil pasta salad was very good as well.  Portions are faily large.

"This place is unique, swanky, phenomenal food, great atmosphere -- it has a LOT going for it. The only downside is you will wait a substantial amount of time if you are dining later in the evening on a weekend. The cool part, they have multiple bars you can hang out at while you wait. Another plus (or tip) -- on saturdays especially, if you dine a bit later, and stay until 10, the back room turns into a club which gets packed and is an absolute blast. A lot of people from the area come to this club. If you want to have the best experience: order their salad, mashed potato pizza, and a cheese pizza. All three are out of the world and the mashed potato pizza is so unique. You will LOVE this place. I recommend it constantly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yuk. Every roll we ordered had the consistency of red bean paste (sweet, gooey, and discolored), combined ingredients more to shock than meld, and served at room temperature as if they had been sitting out all day.  The service was slow and maintained an air of skepticism, which was hard not to return by the end of the evening.  In fact, at the end of the night, we couldn't finish the fried ice cream because our stomachs were upset and the ice cream was worse than Blue Bunny.  Upon seeing this, the table next to us intercepted the waitress as she was clearing our ice cream and, together, they ridiculed us for not finishing.  Last time I checked, such a practice would not be well received by a food inspector.  Out of principle, I still left a 20% tip, but the server didn't deserve it after that. Rewinding, we should have left after we learned that they take reservations but don't honor them.  We showed up on time for our reservation, and when we arrived there were three groups ahead of us (none of whom had a reservation).  All of them were seated before us.  Meanwhile, a group of 6 came in after us and were seated before us despite that they didn't have a reservation. It should advertise as a vegetarian restaurant, because that's their drive.  It's not sushi and it's certainly not Japanese.  It would still be disgusting, but at least one wouldn't have felt deceived.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"FISH! Best deal in the city. $8 = 6 oysters and a glass of wine/beer... doesn't get any better than that. I came here for the first time two years ago on a weekend trip when I was craving some east coast oysters and have been coming back religiously ever since.

"I waited to come here three times before I wrote my review, just to make sure the food/service/everything was consistent. What can I say? I love korean food, and there is a lot of good Korean food where I come from (Atlanta). I'm used to $8 fantastic tofu soup combos and loads of side dishes. And nyeungmyun. This place is almost twice the price and with a much more limited array of side dishes. Service can also be slow sometime. Oh. And no nyeun myun. However, I must say that the bibimbap here is the best I've ever had. In fact, I used to dislike bibimbap until I came here. Something about the perfect combination of crunchy rice, seaweed, bean sprouts, flavored meat, eggs, squash, etc, really hits the spot for me. I've also ordered their soon du bu jigae (both beef and seafood). It doesn't compare to the tofu soup I'm used to, and most of the time I find myself picking around the beef (it's like shredded sloppy joe beef...not even real beef) or avoiding the seafood. Then again, I'm not a huge fan of seafood. (They really should make a pork and mushroom combo. I would love this place so much more.) Still, I will probably keep ordering it because I love tofu soup that much. Their seafood pancake was okay, but not something I would crave. Oh yea, just a warning, they never have sushi for lunch. And their bulogogi is SO expensive. Haven't tried it yet but it's prob not worth it. If you're willing to dish $15 for a meal, or if you're craving korean food that much, give it a try. In all, I'm pretty glad I found the place. 4 stars for the excellent bibimbap!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Recommended by a friend, so we came here after work to give it a shot. For a corner, hole-in-the-wall type restaurant this place was crowded and it was only 6:30pm.   My friend is right, one thing is for sure, this place is guaranteed to be safe as the law enforcement customers were packing more heat than the charcoal grill. 1/2 Chicken with Rice and beans, $5.00.  The chicken was juicy and delicious.   1/2 Ribs with Rice and beans, $5.00, not as good as the chicken, a bit tough, but my buddy tells me that it is usually tender. Good place to eat if you are in the area, but not really a place I would go out of my way to get to.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Two years later, they've moved locations and the ""pour it yourself"" sangria section no longer exists. A bit disappointing, but the food and drinks were still nonetheless! I feel like the new location is smaller because it's inside a hotel, and the decor isn't the same Miami-esque wallpaper... but it's still a great place for brunch. I might have ordered the same meal as last time; the Cuban steak with Mexican fried rice, avocados and eggs. Hard to resist a meal with all my favorite ingredients. The starter bread that had the cheese baked through was delicious and hard to put down. I only had one glass of sangria and it was really strong... but most people like that. Others seemed to enjoy their food as well and service was kind and friendly though they were a bit slow. But who am I kidding? It's hard to rate an all you can drink sangria brunch place any lower than four stars so I still recommend this spot, but be sure to make reservations!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This has got to be, hands down, the best pizza place ever! I am a huge pizza buff, but I have no idea what Grimaldi's trick is because I have never had better pizza. It must be the cheese, but when I asked the person that speedily lines the cheese up on the dough, he told me it was just mozzarella. I swore he was lying, so next I asked the person manning the brick over. He said it was mozzarella too. Jeez... this mozzarella is super gourmet and magically delicious. I have no idea how to describe it, but they have got this recipe perfected beyond imagination. Try the standard margarita and the white pizza without the toppings and you'll see that this is the real deal. That is how I usually measure the difference between pizza-serving restaurants, because I know that toppings will certainly make it better. You got to judge by the staple ingredients. I've been to Grimaldi's many times, each time with a huge wait because it's just that worth it. I've even forced my parents to wait in line with me in the freezing winter because I wanted to show them a whole new world. The good thing is that within the past year, this place has moved down to the end of the block and occupied a larger space so that more people can fit. Please... do yourself a favor and eat at Grimaldi's.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I avoid this risk by ordering the roasted tofu sandwich just about every single time I go there. I would love to try other things, but I just cannot tear myself away from this amazing sandwich.

"Good ingredients and a comfort food menu heavily influenced by central Italian cuisine (yelpers, Umbria is *not* the North!!)  If you're American, odds are you'll be charmed by the folksiness of the atmosphere...unless you don't like eating pressed up against strangers as they do in some great fiaschetterie in Tuscany.  The difference?  These informal places in Italy have prices that correspond, and when you're eating exquisite salamis, sitting on a barrel wedged under an unknown man's armpit suddenly doesn't bother you like it would normally.  Skappo's food is not that transcendent, and yet their prices belong to a different scale of restaurant.  If you're more familiar with authentic Italian cuisine, you might find some of the pairings strange (salsa tartufata...yipee...fantastic ..but..with mozzerella fresca??  You would never find that on a menu in Italy, and for just reason.  It's an odd combination that just tries to use trendy/expensive ingredients, but without doing either any real justice.)  I wanted to like this place, and I see that they make an effort to use some good product, yet there is a lack of skill (and authenticity) to their preparation, combined with a real disconnect between the prices they charge and the restaurant's rustic feel (and frankly its cultivation of annoying stereotypes that the public perhaps comes to expect from Italian restaurants in CT).  I don't know...stay at home, buy an outrageously good bottle of wine, some great cheeses and cured meats and I think that's money better spent.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I believe it was the opening night of Qfest, so it was jumpin.  There was karaoke happening inside, and when I walked in I thought there would be many divas belting it out.  Instead, it was a more subdued, older crowd crooning out some songs that I'm sure are considered beautiful, but I thought it was really boring. I was gonna jump on the mic and sing some GAGA, but they didn't even have that on the karaoke menu! BOOOORING.

"When ppl in our group suggested meeting up here after our respective Broadway shows, I decided to make an appearance (basically to get a consensus of everyone's theatre picks-not for the food). We had eaten at Juniors during our 2007 trip. Our table of 5 got separated from the rest of our group, so I don't know about their svc. Ours was very slow (painfully so) even though we ordered burgers & corned beef sandwiches. I split the burger w/a friend & am glad cuz it wasn't tasty enough to eat the whole thing. Our food was barely warm & the waiter left us completely alone & on the verge of walking out. Very difficult getting water & sodas refilled. One of my friends had contemplated ordering dessert, but gave up because she didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for someone to simply slice a piece of cake. Ridiculous... In 2008 when my group ate there again, I decided to forgo any edibles & just chat w/my travelmates. I got a $2.50 Coke-that's all (it took 20 minutes to arrive). I did observe my companions' frustration w/the excruciatingly slow service & average (probably too glowing a term) food. One person tried the cheesecake & was offering tastes to everyone simply because she didn't want it & it wasn't feasible to take back to the hotel. Note: this person Never leaves behind food. Atmosphere-isn't! Really, it's loud, bright, crowded, overstuffed. I think I'd rather eat at Grand Central for atmosphere...what does THAT say?? It reminded me of Shoney's: ppl charging too much for frozen or prepackaged food. It is convenient to the theatre district & times square, so if you want to sacrifice one meal of your life that you can never get back in the name of convenience then have at it. IMO, Life is too short to eat crappy food. Add to that subpar svc & you're just heading down a slippery slope. There are too many delicious places to eat in NYC to sacrifice time to Juniors. I really hate to give a bad rating & it does sound harsh, but I'd prefer someone to warn me from the outset. If anyone in my group mentions this as an after theatre destination next year, I'm just gonna go my own way for the evening. A solo offering from the deli next door to the hotel would appeal to me more.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"what an experience! this is the sister restaurant of Decibel (in East Village)- another hidden treasure in a non-obvious location. you will not even notice the entrance unless you look closely. i like that about Japanese & Korean places. so secretive, exclusive and a delight. Maria M. recommended this place. so we gathered some of our favorite friends and on a SUNDAY night (yes, we all had work the next day!) we met up after i got off work and hopped on the train 4, 5, 6  (any of those) Uptown. this is what i was thinking before the arrival, ""i hope it's not a typical sushi-packed-up-the-arse restaurant."" we wait for our straggling late friend (hehe) and enter the hidden passageway to our Japanese underworld..... Oh..... my...... God....zilla! (yes, i'm cheesy). it was like i was back in Japan all over again. i experienced the same feeling over at Decibel, too. it was so perfect. as i've mentioned in other reviews... i have somewhat of a bathroom fetish. the decor, the ambiance, GOOD smell, cleanliness, accommodations, etc. (wow, sounds like a 5 star hotel suite) their bathrooms- for one person at-a-time, are like pods. you open the bamboo pod's huge door and what's there? a heated/water splashing toilet? oh my, my, my! the candles were lit, the pod didn't reek of horrible possibilities, and it's an enjoyable experience when you'd down a few shots of sake. the boys of our group were purely jealous of our amenities. lol. the fare, presentation, varieties, and service are quintessentially outstanding. this is definitely a place to take a special date, try something new with foodies, dine for a birthday/special occasion or impress some out of towner buddies of yours. the dishes are smaller portioned, but it's meant to be shared/snacked on/etc. LUNCH TIME is a great affair- and definitely a wonderful opportunity to get acquainted with the food before bringing your favorite people over to this hidden oasis. i love that it's not packed or too noisy. however, hanging out with my friends... it tends to be pretty live and loud. lol. the black sesame creme brulee and green tea truffles are a MUST. after 3 bottles of delectable sake, phenomenal service, crazy laughter, and Julie K. fighting with me over her secretly pouring my sake into her glass... it was truly one of the best experiences i've had in NYC. thank you my ""favorite friends of Yelp"", and ULTRA thanks to Sean, thank you Julie K. for stealing my drinks (muahaha)- but making me laugh and sing ""Horang Nabi"" like an old Korean drunk, and of course.... thank you to the one and only fabulous Maria M. to finally introducing me to this place i've been dying to search for. ;]","[1.0, 0.0]"

"First a clarification based on other reviews that I've now read: this ""restaurant"" does not feature local food.  It serves what appeared to be Sysco foodservice fresh from the freezer bag. #1 Right off the bat, I'll let you know that this is the first time I've walked away from a meal. #2 I'm embarrassed to admit that I had the poor judgement to set foot in this place and waste my Friday night Restaurant Week reservation. #3 If you're going to charge $32 for a widely advertised Restaurant Week Prix Fixe dinner to attract new diners to your restaurant, you should serve your best, not entrees that you would expect to have on your tray as you exit the cafeteria line at Ikea. The food: A basket of three small balls of what tasted like stale bagel/pizza dough were brought to the table.  The first item you serve of a meal should not be terrible, especially if it's a roll.  This does not bode well for the rest of the meal. ""Fried Risotto Balls stuffed with Smoked Gouda:"" Balls of white rice with an imperceptible amount of gouda that tasted like...well balls of mushy white rice. ""Sautéed Fiddleheads with wild mushrooms, onions and truffle oil:"" The mushrooms, onions and truffle oil were good--how can you go wrong when you splash truffle oil into a dish?  The fiddleheads, which I've had before and enjoyed in Maine and California, had a strange bitter flavor; like propane. When the entrees were set down, I got up. ""Grilled Free Range Chicken over wilted spinach with lemons and pine nuts and rosemary roasted potato:"" This was what appeared to be a large, bone-in, cutlet that was pre-sliced; not a half or quarter of what used to be chicken.  The potatoes were freezer bag wedges. ""Grilled Short Ribs Braised with a Port Demiglaze with vegetable and rosemary roasted potatoes:"" These were not short ribs on the bone, but slightly charred lumps of deboned spare rib meat drenched in sauce and served in a bowl.  Again the potatoes could have been purchased in the freezer aisle of a supermarket. The atmosphere: The server/hostess greeted us with a cloud of her cigarette smoke at the door.  The cushioned bench at the entrance smelled like it had been in the basement of a crack house (mildew mixed with smoke).  The music was a 90's club mix, including bad West Coast Gangsta' Rap--not exactly fine dining music.  The bathroom featured a bucket of cleaning products; fake, dusty ivy; and was inline with the general chintzy decay of the place.  It was clear that no one cared about or was responsible for the appearance of the establishment.  If you do go, make sure not to make the mistake that we did of removing the scented candle from your table; you'll be able to taste your food. The service: There were no bread plates on our table, even though other tables had them.  When the entrees were served we made the mistake of not immediately leaving.  Having never done this before, I politely requested a check for our appetizers so that we could be on our way.  Our server and the chef/owner managed to draw this out into a 10 minute process of waiting to speak with him.  When he finally appeared, he did not apologize, was rude, and haggled over the price of the appetizers, finally removing the glass of wine we had not drunk from the check. The resolution: We went to Kitchen Zinc, a delicious standby that does serve seasonal and local ingredients, when possible.  With luscious wine and and the complex flavors of our pizzas, we enjoyed the rest of our evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I highly recommend this place (as a date spot or dinner with friends) I came here this weekend with a group of 6. We called ahead and made a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday night. It was packed, but we were seated immediately. (and they didn't make us wait for our whole party to arrive (ie, me), which is great, because I run chronically late).   We got the chips and guac to start, (guac was fresh and spicy).  We got a pitcher of the margarita (good) and we all ordered a variety of Mexican themed food.  I can personally speak on the shrimp tacos and say they were some of the better shrimp tacos I have had. The atmosphere is cool. It is decorated very trendily and kitschy (oxymoron?). Service was fast, food was enjoyed, drinks were strong. We were asked to wrap it up after we paid our tab (even with a few drinks still on the table) because the next reservation had arrived. So this is not a good place to linger after dinner.

"We're visiting NYC from SF area, and I've been strictly GF for three years now. A friend brought us to this neighborhood, on the premise of looking for good, not specifically GF. Walking up to the window to look at the menu, my husband points excitedly to ""pioneers of GF"" on the menu. Thrilled. Elated. We put our name down and proceed to wait outside. About 10 minutes into the wait the host brings us complimentary GF breadsticks. Delicious! Warn, fresh, buttery flavor with a hint of salt. They reminded me of my memories of sourdough. He already made my night. I ordered my favorite GF beer ""Greene's Dubble Dark"" and a pesto pizzette with goat cheese and arugala. Fell in love on the spot. My husband, who is not GF, agreed that it was the best pizza crust I've made him try. To finish the night I had an incredibly delightful, and large portioned, red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting. Dropped dead from pleasure. The other two members of the party, not GF, we're equally please with their risotto dishes. The waitstaff was super sweet and thoughtful. I'm giving it a four star because the topping options are on the limited side and need some pizzaz. Seems to be vegetarian-oriented, which I can appreciate but I like my meat toppings!

"I'm not impressed. I went here this past Saturday for brunch with my boyfriend. When we went there they told us it was about a 30 minute wait and asked for my phone number. We left the place for about 15 minutes to get a pastry down the street and when we came back it looked like all the line s has dissipated. We went inside, asked about our placement, and they pretty much gave us some weird bullshit answer about the rain and they brought people in early because of it and never bothered to call etc.  We stood around the front for about 5 minutes before they called us in to be seated. Let me tell you this, service is slow. Waiters need to be flagged down and it is about 10-15 minutes before they will approach your area for an order or service. Ordering, I was torn between the hangers fry (tempura oysters with bacon eggs and cheese) and the burger. I opted with the burger since we heard a waiter recommend it over the hanger fry to another table. I ordered the burger medium rare and it came to me medium to well done and very dry. The fries were okay (like McDonald's fries) and the portion was hefty. Nothing to write home about or try again. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict. The portion was small and his side of home fries was like 5 mini chunks of potato. Very sad in comparison with my large burger and fries which was only like 2 dollars more. I regretted ordering the burger instead of the hanger fry since I saw a man at a table in front of us enjoying it. I regretted it until I saw him begin to bull things out of his mouth from the oyster. We then heard him comment that one of them was a pearl, at which point he pulled a small ball out of his mouth.... The table next to us was served an omelet which was completed undercooked and runny inside and by the time a replacement came out her partner had already finished his meal. Their attitude towards the whole thing was quite sad. There wasn't even an apology. When the woman complained about it, the waitress just sort of looked at her with this ""so what do you want me to do look"" until the woman told her she wanted it replaced. How sad. $32 dollars + tip wasted on this sad meal. I prefer Rose Water cafe a lot more to this place (even if this service is slow, it is attentive, and delicious). Not worth my time to go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"2.5.  A good place if you're around, but I don't think anything here is really special.  Went here for lunch on a Saturday, the waitstaff seemed a little listless and forgot some parts of our orders. The poached eggs were poached alright, over some bread with either smoked salmon, spinach or ham and some hollandaise sauce.  ..regular breakfast, I'd say.  Nothing spectacular.  The only part of it that might have been worth anything was the hollandaise sauce but that tasted pre-made.   Anyway, a convenient spot with okay food.  Sometimes that's good enough.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Growing up in an Italian household, knowing a good, authentic list of Italian restos in the city is THE key.   1. I can't beat my gramma's cooking no matter how hard I try 2.

"C'est si bon!   There was one douche-y Frenchman running the place. He sat us by the door, which we weren't happy about. But we were so weak from hunger we could not fight. I had coffee and my alcoholic date had the sangria(his reasoning- why not?). We ordered the French toast(what else would you order in a French place?) and the mushroom/asiago omelet. My date nearly had an orgasm at the the mere smell of the French toast with apple compote. It was that good. The omelet was fluffy with a perfect balance of fungus and mold. The douche-y Frenchman turned out to be a bit of a comedian.  A patron approached him looking for the bathroom. Francois told him the bathroom was on the tree to the left of the door, the customer believed him, and headed out the front door! HA! He actually went for the door. Of course Francois stopped him and pointed him to the real bathroom, but it was hilarious.

"Just went to Uva last night - meeting three friends for dinner.  I have mixed reviews.  We were seated relatively quickly, which I was happy about since I called and was told that they don't take reservations for 4.  We had a nice table in the heated covered garden, but it was a relatively crowded space.  I had my chair bumped into more times during the night than I can remember - it got pretty disconcerting after a while.  Service was prompt, although a bit too insistent on taking our orders.  We were trying to enjoy our drinks (which we got at the bar while waiting), and catch up on some old times - and the waitress came by to take our order.  One of my friends told her that we hadn't even looked at the menus yet - it hadn't even been five minutes.  She said OK - but then I caught her rolling her eyes....what was that all about?  (Well, I know what that was about, but come on - it's not like we were sitting there for an hour.) Anyway - about the food - a fairly large and complex menu.  We all had appetizers and entrees - I went with two of the specials - butternut squash soup (it was freezing before we came in and I needed to warm up!) and a homemade ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce.  The pasta was nice - a bit al dente - but so were the mushrooms.  They could have been cooked a bit longer - but it was flavorful. We didn't do the meats and cheeses during this meal - but they had some nice selections to go with a pretty good wine menu.   Overall a nice time - visually a nice spot - but I don't know how anyone could have a conversation in the indoor dining space - music was blasting.  Definitely don't go if you want a quiet romantic dinner.  But, if you don't mind yelling at your date and missing half of what they say, I guess it would be a good ""date"" spot. Now, despite my '3 star' review - it's not that this was the first time I've been there.  In fact, this was the third - so they get a star for each visit.  If they turned down the music a notch, figured out a way to blow out the walls to make the place bigger, and prevented waitress eye-rolls - I'd move it up a star.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Our food arrived cold, and not prepared the way we requested it; which could be excused given how busy they were.

Apparently the new thing is to bring people ""fresh"" plates of food with ketchup on them. I don't know if the Reo is under new management or if the people normally there just took some time off...but we won't be back for a long while to find out. Very disappointing!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Brought my friend in yesterday for brunch. We are brunch-loving divas. A good décor/atmosphere, delish cocktails and food, and anything above mediocre service is what we're looking for. First, this place has outdoor seating and nice big windows that they'll open, weather permitting, so we chose this spot because the weather was really nice. Since there weren't any seats available outside, we opted for a table inside near the windows which was perfect. Service: ehhhh. It was very mediocre. Every time we asked for something we felt like we were annoying our server. My friend and I have both worked in restaurants so we're pretty good about how to behave as patrons but any time we asked him something it made me cringe a little. That was whatever, but what bothered me more was our food took FOREVER. In real life, it was more like a 45 minute wait. For eggs. And the place was hopping but not overwhelmingly packed so something was off in the kitchen. Maybe not enough staff? Anyway, our server did occasionally check on us and kept our drinks coming (even though his attitude was blasé). So all in all: mediocre. The food was okay too; nothing glamorous. I had a personalized veggie omelet, my friend had the eggs benedict. The portions were nice but I just think that after that long wait, our expectations were inflated. Like, if it takes 45 minutes for our food then I hope you're giving it some serious TLC. On the other hand, I LOVED the mimosas. I don't like dinky little mimosas that are served in champagne glasses (aka the traditional way) but these were deliciously served in nice big wine glasses. THANK YOU, Barrel House :) Overall, its a nice option if you're in the neighborhood and the weather is great and you have a good chunk of time to spare. Prices are very reasonable too.

"Vegetarians, stop reading now. Carnivores, continue on. Fogo de Chao is a unique and enjoyable dining experience for meat-eaters everywhere. You will receive a feeling of utmost ecstasy as friendly waiters bring glistening skewers of perfectly cooked cuts of meat to your table after only a few moments of waiting. The décor will make you feel like you're back in the twenties at a party catered by the great Gatsby himself. With its high ceilings, dark wood, crystal chandeliers, and a few modern twists, Fogo de Chao has a special kind of charm. This Brazilian steak house offers not only a fantastic salad bar, but many different types of meats, such as bacon wrapped filet mignon, seared sirloin, leg of lamb and more, delivered immediately to your table via a flipped card; green side for ""more meat"", red side for ""good for now."" Fogo de Chao gives a sophisticated makeover to the traditional all you can eat buffet. All things said, this restaurant can get very pricey and is not ideal for a casual evening, but is phenomenal for any dressier occasion. The skinny: Fogo de Chao is a carnivore's paradise, and a classy spin on the conventional all you can eat buffet, but can get pricey.

The ingredients are incredibly fresh, and Didier's recipes are clearly crafted with intuition, care and great taste. But what makes the experience is Didier's passion and his care for his guests. And his staff adopt the same approach to taking care of their customers. Upon entering, you feel like you're in a friend's dining room, over for a dinner party.

"Here is the short version:  My wife and I were staying in Manhattan over the Christmas holiday in order to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  We had planned on eating at the ""original"" Grimaldi's in Brooklyn because we enjoy frequenting our Grimaldi's in our hometown of San Antonio, Texas.  While waiting on line at Grimaldi's a  ""local"" lady walked by and started a conversation with my wife.  After telling us the story of Juliana's we decided to check it out.  Man, are we happy we did.  From the moment we were greeted at the door by Mrs. Grimaldi we knew we had made the right decision.  The pizza was in a word, ""fantastic.""  The dough was cooked perfectly.  The cheeses blended magnificently with the sauce and the flavor of the fresh basil was out of this world.  Eating at Juliana's was memorable in itself.  However, having the Juliana's staff and owners treat us like family made it (as Nat King Cole would say) ""Unforgettable""!    We cannot wait to go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Having a husband from Austria, we decided to try Steinhof for our anniversary. The consommé soup was pretty tasteless (needed salt and chives, but only had floating parsley bits instead) and the schnitzels, just so-so...Veal would have been better..Everything needed salt. They put the weiner schnitzel on top of a pile of pickles (cucumber salad?) so it got a bit soggy on the bottom.  Bigger plates would have helped in that case. They have those little oval diner plates. The potatoes were dried out. The rice bland. The farmer's cheese appetizer was good, but not very authentic. Tasted more like veg cream cheese and the salad had ranch dressing:( I think the cook was Mexican? The waitress was nice, and the space cozy. But yea, there is bad rock/pop music a bit too loud as someone else mentioned. I can see it being appealing on a winter evening, esp on the $6 goulash nights. I'll stick to Blaue Ganz for more authentic Austrian fare.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Fuji used to be a favorite treat but after the glacier waitress experience had  tonight (directed at college age guests referenced by other yelpers) I won't be returning. After ordering banana tempera ($4) I saw on the check it was listed as $8. When I looked over the menu, our waitress explained the ice cream was extra. I enjoyed it, so was willing to pay for it. However, I remarked to my boyfriend  that an 8 dollar dessert wasn't really in my budget, and I didn't understand it was an extra charge since she said 'what kind of ice cream do you want?' rather than 'do you want ice cream?' Our waitress returned, after overhearing me, and offered to remove the 4 dollars, but said so in a condescending and slightly confrontational tone (complete with eye roll) that made me feel uncomfortable. I declined, but leaving having made felt unwelcome, I asked for a manager on the 1st floor to let them know. When no manager was available, another waitress heard my story, while the first waitress stepped in and (while her tone appeared softer) continued to quite blatantly,  argue with me. In the middle of this, she took a phone call, and after a few minutes of ignoring me, we left. The added ice cream wasn't the problem. The problem was the experience afterward. 1. Being offered to take the charge off in a belittling manner. 2. Not being able to express my displeasure at 1. then adding insult to injury by taking a phone call. It's too bad one waitress' ego is costing Fuji a 2+ year customer.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The staff was astute and polite. The prices were quite reasonable, also. However, I had been hoping for a noticeable smokey flavor as they advertise, ""Coal Oven Pizza"". That was nonexistent. The other thing is to stay away from the flavorless sausage and that pretty much goes for any pizza place in NYC. Why does New York consider a rubbery paper thin piece of eraser to be sausage? Overall, it still tasted good and the crust had a nice crunch to it. It is, after all, a historic Icon and is definitely worth going to.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here on a Sunday evening after coming across this place on Yelp and having a hankering for a burger. Walked in and there were about 3 tables full. The bartender sat us and told us we had 10 minutes left of happy hour- which was a pleasant surprise. We ordered a couple $5 margaritas, which were definitely $5 worth. When the bartender came to take our order, everything we wanted to order (the jalapeno burger, pulled pork sandwich and the rib tips) were not available. It was more than a little disappointing since that is what we came for and it was also half of their menu. The bartender said they only made two burgers that day because it takes them 40 minutes to cook it?! That sounds a bit ridiculous. We ended up ordering the ribs (fantastic), catfish po boy (pretty decent, but over spiced/blackened), with a side of the Cajun corn and jalapeño mac n' cheese (both good). The wait for food was about 40 minutes, and we were the only people in there by the time we actually ordered. My biggest complaint is the service - the one waitress on staff did absolutely nothing the entire time we were there but text on her phone, and I actually had to get up and go to the bar to order another round of drinks. Pretty ridiculous considering we were the only customers. Overall, good BBQ for Crown Heights but terrible service. And I'll have to come back to try the things that I actually wanted to order.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Out of all the places- this was my favorite. 1st- we arrived on a Saturday night without reservations and were seated in the lounge area immediately. ( there was a 10 minute wait for the dinner area) 2nd- we were immediately greeted by Mel who is wonderful and all of the staff is very nice and understanding. 3rd- my boyfriend and I both got the churrasco. My bf got it with congri and I got the yuca Frita. I have to say I have not had better Cuban food and it was soooooo much food. Holy moly were we full. Other places have a huge wait and the food is average. 4th- after -10 pm there was Di who played music ( hip hop and Latin) we stayed for a bit but had to leave soon after.

Their range could be more challenged and it is surprising if they have such limited kinds regarding their tea in a place as this. I don't fathom eating given others' reviews.

"Buyer beware. Our disappointing and confusing experience at this place in a nutshell: First, the hostess looked lost and irritated that she actually had to speak to customers. Then, our server did not know the menu, told us that half the things we ordered ""weren't available,"" and took half an hour to bring us our appetizers. If we weren't entertained with our own conversation, we would have left. Then, the food. It was bland to put it nicely. Diner food is better. Last, to top it off, while we were still waiting for our credit card to be returned from having paid the bill, a stocky bouncer approached our table and demanded menacingly, ""Ya'll leaving or what?"" My 45 year old conservative aunt and uncle were made to feel uncomfortable by the belligerence of this place and complete lack of customer service. I think this place caters to a very young crowd who just wants a place to go for the night to hook up and drink. This is not a real restaurant, and do not bother coming here if you are anywhere north of 25. You will be treated poorly by lazy bubbleheads who text as they work, and angry bouncers who push you to give up your seat for younger customers. We spoke to the manager of this place, who was sweating bullets and looked nervous before we even explained the problems we had with our service. He would not address our concerns, but seemed intimidated by his own staff. This place is a bad Twilight Zone episode. As of this date, there is no option on the Shannon Rose website for customer comments, by the way. I wonder why.","[0.0, 1.0]"
This place is creepy!  But in a good way...  It has a European ghost bar feel to it.  I love the ambiance and the food is fantastic.  This place is definitely on the expensive side but the atmosphere and the great service is worth the price.  They even have live musicians once in a while it seems.  I've tried a few different dishes there now and I must say my favorite is the mac n cheese which comes with apple sauce.  But save room as the Date Cake for dessert is what tops the experience here.  I don't know how some people feel about the train tracks above the restaurant but I think it just adds to the spooky atmosphere.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Quick seating for two on a Friday night. It was quite busy but we got pretty good service. I got the hot buttered lobster roll and it was unfortunately only mediocre. The lobster pieces were a bit overcooked and not so plump and moist. There also wasn't that much. The french fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil. Plan B's lobster sliders appetizer is the same price but much tastier. My husband got a burger and it was good. Their side salads come with huge slices of raw mushrooms and a lot of them. I wouldn't mind a few but it was a bit much. I had their balsamic vinaigrette but it was more like a rose wine vinaigrette, slightly pink and pretty sweet and sour. We had a coupon for $5 off so our meals were pretty decently priced in the end. Just not sure I'd hit this chain up given better options in the area.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here with a group of 5 last night and had a great time. I've recently gone gluten-free and couldn't find any info online showing what I'd be able to eat . While they didn't have a GF menu, the staff was wonderful with answering questions and suggesting substitutions. Since the tortilla chips for the spinach/artichoke dip are not GF, they provided cucumber slices instead. Though a bit atypical it was a DELICIOUS combination. I ordered the Sloppy Max sans bread and replaced the waffle fries with a small salad. They provided a GF citrus dressing that was wonderful and even without the bun, the BBQ pork/slaw combo was perfectly sweet and tangy. The birthday girl ordered the same meal without substitutions and loved it as well, so it's a great option even if you can enjoy your gluten. :) Of course the chocolate was delicious, I honestly don't think there was a thing any of us tried and didn't like! Can't say how busy it would be on a weekend, but the weeknight experience was great. Our only negative experiences (that keep me from giving a perfect 5 stars) were that the bathrooms seemed to be a bit unkept and toward the end of the night the service drug a bit (though our server was doing her best, other staff who could have stepped in seemed to leave her on her own with a handful of busy tables). All in all, though, a great experience, I wouldn't hesitate to go back again!","[0.0, 1.0]"

We ordered the lamb meat balls, gnocchi, scallops noodles, a cheese plate and tune chocolate chip dough desert. The only thing that tasted weird was the cheese, the cheese couldn't be eaten I by itself it had a very overpowering flavor, once mixed with the lemon smear it tasted fine, the smear did an awesome job at balancing out the cheese.

"There are not a lot new business springing up in the Claremont area, so when a new place to eat pops up... you have to try it. In the case of Hench Dogs, 10,000 taste buds, WAY up! First, let's start with the dogs. Nathan hot dogs! With a foundation like that it's tough to go wrong. Steamed or grilled it just doesn't get any better. Add to that a full 25 toppings to choose from and I can honestly say I've never left this place without a mouth full of happiness. If you're not in the mood for a dog, I recommend the Chili/Cheese baked potatoes...goes great with one of their Italian Sausages. The meatball subs are also superb. Messy with just the right amount of tang for the buck. I was most impressed with the owner/operator. Personable and funny. You can tell he loves what he does and it shows not only in the food but the individual service I've received.

"My sister took me here so we could catch up. It's in the heart of the West Village, so it's a good location if you want to get drinks or go shopping before or after. The decor is just the right amount of classy, a little dim, but not pretentious or stuffy at all. Our server was great- attentive when it came to choosing/ordering our food but did not hover over us the whole time. Also, all the waitstaff generally seemed pleasant and happy- nothing ruins a meal more than bitchy waitstaff. We started with the Spicy Duck Meatballs, which were tender and tasty, placed in a light broth. They were nice enough to split them for us in separate bowls without us asking. I had the Duck Breast medium rare with sweet potatoes, Chinese broccoli rabe and cashew sauce. It was amazing- so tender and not chewy at all. I was worried that the Chinese broccoli and cashew sauce would make it taste like Chinese food, but it didn't at all. My sister got the Scottish Salmon with crispy potatoes and it was also cooked really well, and the flavors of the components complimented each other well. The chocolate tart dessert with creme fraiche was also surprisingly good- I always write off chocolate desserts because they are rarely done uniquely, but Perilla hit the target.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We ate downstairs - we had a large party because we were there for a friend's birthday and were fairly satisfied with the experience. That was fine - thought the decor was a bit sparse, but ok, we were in the basement. I have friends who've eaten upstairs, and they said it gets quite loud up there. Slightly pricey for what it is (and we didn't even pay for our apps - the birthday girl's boyfriend ""knew someone"") but good food nonetheless. The Smith is one of those places that tries to ""fancify"" American comfort food - and that concept seemed a bit cliche to me. Get the warm potato chips though - so good, probably could have just had those for dinner and walked out happy. I got the cod - it was good, not great and wouldn't be rushing back to have it again. My friend who sat next to me ordered the trout milanese, which I tried - it was much tastier/interesting/flavorful than the cod.

The flavors achieved here are innovative without losing it's authentic identity. Avocado lovers should try the avocado fries and the trip of guacamole featuring mild, sweet, and spicy varieties. For the more adventerous, try their earthy and crunchy grasshopper tacos","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So delicious! And original too. I got the special with included zucchini, parmesan ricotta, and a red pepper spread in place of marinara sauce. It was great, I loved it. The friend I was there got the margherita and though he wanted to add a few things here and there, he said it was good as well. For dessert, I got gelato because that's what you do when gelato is an option. Choosing 3 of their 8 or so flavors was a different story but once I finally did make my decision, I did not regret it in the least. Dulco de leche (sweet caramel-esque goodness), amaretto crunch (new, as interestingly good tasting as it sounds), and strawberry (because classics are necessary). He in turn got tiramisu and said it passed his taste test. All in all our bill was about $50 which isn't terrible for dinner and dessert for two. The little venue was so cute too, very family-oriented atmosphere. The music did throw me off every so often but you learn to get over it. Portion sizes were fitting for me. The service was great as well. Overall very pleasant. I will definitely be visiting this little pizza spot again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Sorry everyone, I'm going to pour a whole bunch of poo on Freemans in this review. Honestly, two stars is generous. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SERVICE HERE. I mean, literally, it would've been so much faster and efficient if I just sat/cooked/served everyone myself. You hear that Freemans? Hire me and I will guarantee that brunch will not take four hours. Yes that's right: four miserable hours. They told us the wait would be an hour. An hour turned to two, two to three, you get the point. We should've left hours ago, but at this point, I think we were all trying to stick it out just to see how long it would take before we could eat ""brunch"". Sorry, but brunch just ain't brunch when it is 3 PM. Repeat after me: com-mun-ni-ca-tion. This is clearly what Freemans lacks. Waiters only bringing one appetizer out at a time, when clearly our table ordered two orders. Hipster waitstaff wandering in and out clearly confused on how to pour coffee or refill water. Nasty silverware with food particles all over them!   The food here is not good. It's mediocre at best! I got the poached eggs with roasted tomato and cheddar cheese grits. The eggs were over poached. Blasphemy! Where is my runny yolk?! The grits were bland and frankly not appetizing. The only saving grace of my meal here were the Devils on Horseback. The ambience is kind of neat I suppose, what with all the hunting game on the walls. Oh wait, that's already been done at every other bar in Manhattan.

"We went Saturday night for dinner. We were sat quickly and despite there only being 2 other parties there, it took a few moments to be greeted and get water. We wanted a light dinner, so we ordered the pork & shrimp dumplings and our entrees. The dumplings were cooked nicely and the dipping sauce was outstanding. The filling was tasty, but indescribable. I couldn't tell you if there was pork and it shrimp in there. My entree was the wild boar basil. It was simply pork slices. It had great flavor, but way too salty. My husband got the beef stir get.

"Meh.  That's the best way to describe my experience here over the weekend.  Went here and decided to split an appetizer and two entrees with my date so we could check out a couple of dishes.  Ended up getting the pork belly in the buns (because, after all, they're famous for it) as our appetizer ($10 for 2 pieces).  Which started off our meal with a nice high point-the pork was of course quite excellent.  If you've never had this before it's basically the same type of bun you get peking duck in-in fact, it's essentially a peking duck bun but instead of peking duck in the middle you get a perfectly cooked and perfectly fatty piece of soy sauce braised pork.  Well worth it.  To balance out the utter unhealthiness of this dish we decided to get the stir fried greens of the day, which turned out to be rhubarb, which was topped with fried garlic and seasonings. This was also pretty good though not particularly stunning (stir fried veggies can only be so stunning). For our main courses we decided to try the poached chicken with sticky rice as well as the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes.  The poached chicken was easily the most disappointing thing of all.  Yes, the chicken was extremely tender but apparently poached meant brined and cooked sous vide (not that there's anything wrong with that) but totally flavorless.  Ditto with the sticky rice wrapped around it the chicken breast-where was the flavor?  I thought perhaps the flavor would be in the sauce the chicken and rice roll (think california roll-chicken on the inside, rolled inside of sticky rice) was sitting in, but the sauce was probably the most disappointing thing I've ever had at a restaurant.  Someone else here complained of there being coconut milk in theirs-well, there was no coconut milk in mine that I could taste but I wish there was, perhaps that would have imparted a Malay or Thai vibe to it but instead I got a very thin and flavorless butter/lemon based sauce.  My date was equally disappointed in this dish. Next came the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes, and being momofuku spicy meant a sriracha type spiciness.  I'll say that it was pretty decent and enjoyable to eat-nothing mindblowing, but delicious.  The sausage more or less tasted like sweet italian sausage, the rice cakes were of the extra soft, somewhat thinner, variety (soft and easy to chew), and then there was basically a crapload of sriracha and something added to make the sauce somewhat creamier and perhaps to cut the heat a little.  Perhaps a dairy product?  Nonetheless, it was still very spicy and in addition to the sriracha there were hot peppers tossed in.  Overall, a much nicer dish than the chicken dish but it wasn't amazing. Next to us sat a couple of regulars who asked what we thought-we admitted that we were disappointed in the dish and they agreed that the food just didn't seem to be ""as good as it used to be"" and though they loved the spicy sausage and rice cakes dish they thought it was just a little bit too hot to order.  I don't mind eating spicy dishes so the heat didn't bother me quite that much but I will say that if you're not an actual fan of spicy dishes avoid it because it is quite hot.  Suggestion for even fans spicy food?  Get them to bring out the spicy sausage and rice cakes *before* the blander dishes.  I think that we wouldn't have minded the ultra bland chicken if they had simply brought it after our mouths were on fire from the sausage since it'd have helped to cool off the palate, but then again that may have simply made the contrast too great between the relatively flavorful sauce and rice cakes and the depressingly bland chicken dish. Overall I'd rate the dishes as follows: Pork buns-5/5 Chicken with sticky rice 1/5 (seriously disappointing) Sausage with rice cakes-4/5 Rhubarb side dish-4/5 So why is the overall rating going to be a 3/5 and not a 4/5?  Momofuku Ssam scored about a 2/5 on value, with our tab for 2 coming out to $115.  This included two glasses of wine for my date and a $8 beer for myself, but we couldn't quite escape the feeling that we'd had better food for a lot cheaper before.  It's not that I mind high prices if it's really something special (we've had $200 a person at dinners before) but this just didn't seem worth it. Honestly, if we were somehow forced to come here and pay for ourselves again we'd just order 4 orders of pork buns and pig out.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Probably the best bar scene in Burlington. Interesting mix of locals looking for a change of pace and tourists. The food for dinner is ok. Service can be spotty especially on the weekends. Brunch is pretty good. Nice selection of items and tends to be quiet. I notice they serve Klinger's pastries (local) for breakfast. Those aren't as good of quality as you'd think they would serve here. There are certainly better options. This is Burlington trying to offer a big city vibe and hotel.

"I'm a big fan.  This place does really live up to the yelp reviews. They were so great in waiting for the whole party to arrive for brunch.  I have no idea how long we would have waited if the whole party was present, but they let us get seated after 30 mins while we waited for half the group.   The Smith Ale really hit the spot while waiting and it being a hot summer day. Bread basket comes with a strawberry cream cheese which I'm convinced is Philadelphia's brand.   I got the Jane burger which was really delicious - nice and juicy with the medium rare meat juices squeezing out everytime you take a big bite.  Loved it.   Friends got a variety of dishes - the steak and eggs was really good.  Meat was so tender.  The benedict Jane (crab cake one) wasn't good.  If you are picky with crab cakes, do yourself a favor and don't order it here.  The other benedict, I think the maple sausage one is better.   The mac n cheese croquette is so crunchy I enjoyed it.  But it's a pretty big piece so one is enough for a table to share.   All in all, I would definitely go again with a group of friends.  Reservations AND good food are sometimes tough to find for NYC brunch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Management ""managed"" to spend their time at one particular table and never came by to see how our meal was until the end..when they noticed we hadn't eaten everything. Food-We had the soup first. It was lukewarm but somewhat tasty. More broth than anything. We then had the wild mushroom bruscetta. Good but not memorable. The bread basket was great. All made in house fresh and warm. Best part of the whole meal. We then chose 3 pastas. The gnocchi with lobster bolongase. Awful. The pasta was not fresh and not properly cooked. Flavor was odd.   Gnocchi was crab. Even worse. Then the ""pillow"" ravoli with hazelnut oil. Are you kidding me?  Tiny portion and neither light nor airy. Dessert we had the espresso and orange sorbet. Also the chocolate gelato. Nothing was memorable. Way overpriced. I would not return. We have so many other amazing choices of Italian food in the city. This is a very weak example of Northern Italian food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I have placed orders here for a few years and am very familiar with what is, and isn't included in their fical BRUNCH menu - yet, she insisted (pretending to put me on hold and speak with the manager, which of course, did not happen), and then she overcharged me for a substiution, charging me for a full separate side!!

"Ok...I'm updating my previous review based on a dinnertime visit. It was raining, I'd just had a looong day at work and was just so hungry that I caved in and walked into Alices Arbor on my way home from the train. I was planning on just having a cheese plate and wine but the super nice, new bar tender and guy with the long curly-ish hair described the meatloaf so well to my growling stomach I caved and ordered it. The evening experience at this place is a complete 180. I chatted for some time with the staff who shared some insight on the restaurant's history and building efforts. It definitely gave me a new perspective. I very slowly enjoyed the cheese and then devoured the meatloaf. Sooooo good.

"Cute brunch place in the West Village.  We had an 11:30 reservation and the restaurant was empty.  However, it filled up pretty quickly and was packed with a line by 12:30.  It has a more modern feel and spacing between tables is good.  We started with their amazing bread basket, which came with a dried cherry scone, honeycrisp apple muffin, and spiced pumpkin bread.  The scone was amazing and tasted of butter and cherries.  The muffin was ok and the pumpkin bread was a little too dry.  The weird thing was that we ordered the bread basket first but it came out with our entrees, which was less than ideal. It was a blistery winter day so I had the smoked game hen soup.  It is massive and very hearty!  It comes out in a large bowl full of hen, cabbage, radish, kale, croutons, and a poached egg.  The soup was on the oily side, so I could finish only about half of the massive portion.  But I enjoyed each spoonful.  I only wish I were sipping it in front of a fireplace and with a soft furry throw.  Overall, a terrific brunch experience that I will happily repeat.","[1.0, 0.0]"

My family enjoyed their food tremendously. I have been trying to remain GF and its hard. Everyone goes out ot eat, but that isn't really a safe option for people who need to remain GF. This restaurant is a safe haven for us. I think its wonderful that we have an option to eat out and stay safe. I had seafood salad appetizer. It was excellent. The dressing was lite, lemony and tasty. The fish was fresh and firm, Shrimps were crisp. My husband had scallops, shrimp clams mussels and calamari in a lite tomato broth, over cappelini. It was flavorful and delicate, the fish also very fresh. While dining, Maria approached me to invite me to a Special GF dinner party she was hosting the following Monday. I was intrigued and asked a friend to attend with me. We could not have been more pleased.The price of the 6 course dinner was all inclusive. We tried so many wonderful selections!

"I have to say... Hagi is one of my all time favorite izakaya spots. My first time was with a friend who posted a review a while ago. Between three people, our meal was dirt cheap (note: this IS in the city and it is definitely a bargain). This secluded establishment is tough as nails to find in the middle of the city. Just look for an inconspicuous doorway leading down to a magical room of wonders that is only about the size of my condo. Decor however, made me feel like I walked through a portal somewhere along the the steps which has sent me to an izakaya... in Tokyo. Now considering this place does not take reservations, they were very willing to accommodate to a large crowd... provided u get there a few minutes before 5:30 (which is their supposed opening time... showed up at 5:28 and there were people eating already). We had a party of 14 (with two more coming later). They put us on a row of tables against the wall because the little room on the side already had several parties.   Our waiter was very VERY patient with us (thanks buddy) because half of these jackasses had no idea what they wanted. So I took the liberty of ordering for everyone just to make things easier for the poor guy. Considering every three minutes we had to get another pitcher of beer. By the time we realized that we should order 3-5 pitchers at a time, the poor guy already made about 7 beer runs. We also had to order our food in waves because apparently we are all fatties and like to gorge ourselves silly. My personal favorite there is the Yakisoba... has a nice hint of kimchee, Yakiudon, and their seafood okonomiyaki. I would personally stay away from the Curry Yakiudon. It smells like curry, looks like curry, but definitely did not taste like curry. As far as their takoyaki, you can find better on St. Marks. Closing statement: After indulging ourselves on great food and an absurd amount of beer, I just have one more thing to say: I'm going back next week.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with my gf to celebrate a special night out. Very small place, feels like others are sitting on top of you. I'm not really about that life. Menu is limited and meant for anorexic girls. We thought we ordered enough food as our bill topped nearly $50 dollars excluding wine. Everything was bite size and honestly not that good. I love to eat good food but this stuff was just boring. Truffle this truffle that, doesn't hide the fact the dishes aren't good. Had this weird piece of toast with yolk and truffle oil on top. Strange, didn't work and didn't feel it. Had truffled mushroom bruchetta, it was literally one bite and very weak. Duck salad was disappointing, go to Monk's Cafe for theirs, as its much better. Didn't want to hate this place, but nothing was good. The waiter couldn't even give us real insight into the extensive wine list, its a wine bar, shouldn't they be on top of that sort of stuff? My gf and I went around the block after and downed apps and beers at another bar before returning home satisfied. I don't mind super pretentious spots but the food has to make up for the stuffiness. Unfortunately Tria didn't and I don't understand the rave reviews for this place. Monk's is 100x better and much better value.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place was truly terrible. I know it opened pretty recently, so for that reason I can sort of excuse the bad/ slow service but the over cooked bland pasta...that I can not. A few things regarding our evening- 1) after ordering our food we sat for 45 mins with zero service and zero food while we watched the people next to us eat apps and entrees. 2) once the food was brought to us our waitress never came over to ask how things were so when I realized my pasta was so bland that not even the salt shaker could help it I grabbed a manager and asked him if I could please order something else (something I never do) 3) while waiting for my new meal while my friends ate the waitress appeared again after being Mia for an hour and asked me if I had gotten my food yet. 4) once the new food arrived no one came to check back in to see how things were...second meal wasn't very good but at least it didn't take like bland nothingness 5) later saw the waitress as we waited 15 mid for them to take our credit cards sitting at the table behind us hanging out with friends? 6) the only good thing that happened...as we departed a manager asked us how things were and I couldn't help but to let him know just how not ok they were...he then proceeded to treat us to a cocktail. I'd be shocked if this place survives. Literally the worst pasta and service I have had...maybe ever.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"i know it's such a cliche to be a young 20-something biddie living in New York who is enamored with the romance and charm of Paris, but i must admit that I LOVE Cafe Cluny. It's possibly one of the loveliest restaurants I've been to, and you do get the sense that you've been displaced in a romantic, cozy Parisian cafe filled with mirrors and country home touches. It's the epitome of The Perfect Date Spot, not to mention a great place to catch up with a friend or two over brunch. We had gone for a late brunch at 3:15 so luckily, we missed the chaotic brunch rush, and were seated immediately. The food was your standard fare, but cooked right. The burger topped with roquefort was obscenely good, and the egg sandwich was also highly tasty. Can't wait to go back for dinner!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Today I stopped by the N.Y. Dosa. The man known as the Dosa Bouncer was there, but he doesn't work for the cart. He's a grad student that comes out of the library each day, to stand with the cart owner, enjoy the food, and acts as a liaison/evangelist. Considering the food came out of the cart, it was great. I would give the place 4.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I'll lean it over to 5 because of the owners excellent customer service. I must admit though, the Dosa/Crepe thing was a little too crispy. I feel like a Crepe should be soft. I'll be back to try other things on the menu. The guy recommend coming before 12:30 or after 2:30 to avoid ridiculous lines when school is in session.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This restaurant was highly recommended by a Portuguese friend and our experience was the opposite.  First, we were served portuguese rolls covered with a cloth napkin thinking the bread was at least warm.  When I touched the bread it was cold and did not seem fresh at  all.  Next we ordered the Lulas Fritas a Sevilhana-Fried Calamari Sevilha Style appetizer  which was pretty good  and we were looking forward for our entrees.  The sangria was great and then our entrees were served and we were disappointed just by how the food was presented.  We ordered the Salmão Grelhado, Bacalhau Cozido C/ Todos and Espetada de Marisco.  The food was very bland with no flavor and did not seem that they put any effort into preparing  the food and cold.  If it wasn't for the appetizer or the sangria the whole evening would be ruined.  I would only recommend the place for the sangria and appetizers only.  Don't waste your money on the expensive bland and cold main dishes.  This is definitely the first and last time I would eat at this place.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We were visiting New York from San Francisco to celebrate my husbands birthday. We came here on our first day, Friday March 21st at around mid-afternoon. This was the BEST pizza I've ever had! We were greeted by a man (whom I assumed was the manager or owner or whatever) and were told to ""wait here""(lol, total NY directness without being rude. Loved it! :P ) We waited by the door for about 7 minutes until we got a table. He just told us ""sit at the table by the window"" :D Still loving the NY attitude. LOL. Anyways, we got our pizza, and even though we were stuffed, we couldn't stop eating because it was so good! Hahaha! Fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil with garlic.

"Good crepes, not the best, not the worst. It seems to depend on the day of the week because sometimes, the crepes are really soggy. Who likes soggy crepes? And no, I did not order the ice cream or savory crepes. At least their ingredients are fresh. While the staff is generally nice, tonight must have been an off night. The guy at the register was confused by actual cash, especially coins. I had to give him a math lesson. First pen and paper, then the calculator function on the iPhone. Confusion still persists. I should have used the calculator first. But seriously, any guy working the register should know basic math. If you want possibly soggy crepes with fresh ingredients, go here. But bring a credit card unless you, too, want to give a math lesson and walk out frustrated.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Outstanding Greek menu. The vibe on entering is a modern Mediterranean bistro, both romantic and impressive. Our waiter made great suggestions and helped with picking a Greek red.

"I came here with a friend who has all sorts of allergies, which leaves vegan cuisine one of the fail-safes. We were pleasantly surprised. This is a incredibly creative little place with good service. Given that it's vegan, I and my friend were impressed by the flavor and options they were able to offer. The combo deals are also quite reasonably priced, though I didn't glance at much else after seeing them so I can't comment on their wraps or salads. I got La Fiesta and Spicy Mang with two individual pieces, one mango and the other seaweed. They were delicious! My only wish was that the rolls were spicier, as they were described on the menu. Be warned, this is not really a sit down restaurant. There is very limited space and if you are only two, you will most likely have to sit at a table with two others, thereby potentially limiting your conversation (especially if the couple next to you are loud). Also, this restaurant does get quite busy, especially during meal rushes, so be prepared to wait on line for a while if you decide to visit then. But let me tell you, it's worth it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Shake Shack is now in Philly. PHILLAAAAAY! I showed up on opening night around 10:55pm. Their closing time was 11pm. Just made it. We were the last ones to order for that day. They applauded my friend - I assume cause it was their last order of their grand opening day, not because of the vast amounts of food he ordered. Just like the NY joints, the burgers are awesome. The meat is juicy and not overdone. The buns are fatty. The milkshakes are amazing. But still pricey for a fast-food place. I dont know if Shake Shack is still considered fast food, the way it used to be before it became a global sensation... but I still consider it fast food. There wasn't really any wait when I got there. The staff was super friendly and chatted with everyone there. And they gave us some free cheese fries - which I assume were some of their leftovers. I have a double burger and black & white shake. Get the shake. Seriously. Do it. I've been to Shake Shacks in NY (albeit not all of them), DC, Dubai, and now Philly. Still making my way to CT, FL, and Kuwait.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I live in New Haven, and have for several years. And must admit I am firmly in the Pepe's camp or Modern at times. So after hearing people voraciously defend Sally's honor and swear they had the ""best pizza"", we finally strolled down to the other end of Wooster to give old Sally's a whirl. Preface I love quirk and charm but this is just another world. Dirty, dirty tables, bad lighting, the one lonely server literally threw our menus at us, and everyone else that came in. And trust me, I am used to getting abused at Pepe's but this was bad. The server in shorts could give a rat's ass. And truthfully this could be overlooked if the pizza was killer, and sadly it is not. I gave 1 star for the sauce, which is good and 1 star for the lady that was dressed in furs and came out of nowhere from the back and limped around the dining room.

"Sunshine Co. is simply delightful. The staff was friendly, the ambiance is refreshing, and the food was tasty. I've recently returned to Brooklyn from an internship in Europe and was impressed to find this place had opened- the portions are perfect- only in America do restaurants pile on way more food than necessary! I was able to clean my plate and not feel over-stuffed- I appreciate being satiated without having to pack up half my food or see it go to waste. This echoes their attention to detail and mindful presentation. I went in for brunch and had the mouth-watering short rib sandwich. I waited a little longer than expected for it, but understand this is not ""fast food"" and everything is made to order- to me that is well worth the wait. The menu is small, streamlined, and specific but has something for everyone. And the coffee is WONDERFUL. I was curious as to why there were no free coffee refills so I asked my server who politely explained that all their coffee is directly traded with the farmers, so it probably makes sense it costs the restaurant a bit more to purchase. Knowing that, I applaud Sunshine Co. in their conscious efforts to support sustainable practices and will gladly pay a mere $1.75 more if it means doing the right thing.... and it tastes so good. Worth it. I can't wait to bring friends here for dinner and drinks! Bravo.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Cost per slice depends on what type you get (for me, always pepperoni), so expect ~$2.50 to $3.00.  It usually comes out very quick and the gentlemen working the counter take your order as quickly as they can.  There is minimal seating inside, or you can take it to go.

"My gosh this stuff is good! I have ordered food from here a few times and every time it does not disappoint! I typically have the Grilled Chicken Breast on a salad with hot sauce and the Italian dressing. Very flavorful and has a great price. It's nice to go to a place in Midtown where the price is very decent. One thing to note (and this is a good thing): do not be surprised that around lunch time, there is a line that goes down the block. But that is the hallmark of a successful food cart business, especially in an area where you would see the lines in your nearby delis rather than outside food carts! So get here a little bit before the lunch rush (perhaps at about 11:30) and you should be good to order with little wait time. One more thing to note - this place is cash-only. Once I finally get over the Grilled Chicken Breast Salad, I will try the Gyro and check back with an update.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Wife and I have been customers for almost four years beginning with a graduation party for a son. The food back them was very good, now it is excellent. We eat here at least twice each month, often more frequently and have NEVER gotten a bad dish. I was telling a friend in the food industry about it and how we always have enough to eat; I get full but never bloated. He said it was due to the food being fresh and cooked correctly. Not being a 'drinker' per se, we will order a small pitcher of sangria at a decent price and never have to raise the pitcher to refill our glasses, the wait-staff is always so attentive that it is taken care of for us. They do not wear name tags because ...they don't need them, they are that personable. Nothing is forced on the customer..if you don't want it- you don't get it! DIshes are modified to your liking if needed. I couldn't decide on anything and so they accomodated me with something I made up and was surpised at how well it was done. This past July I had a party for my wife with 40 guests attending in the lower dinning room. Afterward EVERYONE raved about the food and service. The atmosphere is what we like, calm, music playing low in the background (usuall Italiam Cosmopolitan tunes or light opera), dimmed lights, and best of all a GOOD price for a GREAT dinner. Yes, it has a TV at either end of the bar but the sound is always off! Does NOT bother us in the least. We're not talking a sports bar here...we're dining at a classy restaurant. For out of towners it is easy to get to from Exit 15W on the Turnpike or Rt. 280. Both exits empty on to Harrison Avenue where the restuarant is located about half of the length of the roadway.

When I opened my food the sandwich was poorly done. The meat was not in the sandwich, parts of the bread was burned, there were ingredients missing and it was not made the way I requested and the way I had ordered the first time.

"The smallest sandwich ever! I think I will need to eat 2 to be satisfied. They ran out of pork belly sandwich at the evening so i had to settle for less. I tried the coconut shrimp sandwich for about $8.70. I think it only contained 3 pieces of shrimp, with some mayo like sauce, cilantro, pickled carrots, and a slice of cucumber. I think the sandwich was barely even 6 inches. Seriously I can get not one, but TWO delicious Vietnamese sandwiches down in chinatown. The sad thing was that their burnt corn was the best part of the meal. It was drenched in mayo and chlli powder...Yum...(not so if your on a diet). After all this, a young lady asked for the staff not to put carrots in her sandwich because she was allergic to it?

"So, let me start by saying that if I was rating this strictly on my meal, five stars is not enough. If you want a hearty breakfast, specifically for a drive home the morning after sampling some of Vermont's finest craft beers, you can do no better than a breakfast sandwich on a Vermont Country Bagel. I got a sausage patty and paired with the fennel and salt on the bagel, it was heavenly. The lack of a five star review is thanks to the odd encounter we had with the girl who made my bagel. She seemed pleasant enough, or at least as much as one could working in the pit of despair that is a bagel shop on a Sunday morning, but she asked to see my receipt after handing me my bagel. I told her my girlfriend paid it, which she did, and that I would send her up with the receipt right away. When she got there, she was met with a look of confusion and rudely brushed her off to get back to the queue. It was...really odd. Enough that I am dusting off my Yelp account to tell you about it. I don't take it personally, as I have been in her shoes before, but I cannot begin to tell you how odd that was. I can understand wanting to make sure I wasn't trying to walk off without paying, but to ask to see a reciept and then decide to trust me after all? I don't know. Have some coffee.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Amazing food, wonderful service, and a refreshingly simple ambiance... I ordered the Sopes de Chorizo and it was the best chorizo I've ever had on a thick corn tortilla. The guacamole was fresh and spicy and served with yummy tortilla chips. For our entree, my friend and I shared the Chamorro de Borrego, a lamb shank braised in chili pulla, which was perfectly tender and very flavorful. Overall, Casa Enrique is one of the best things to happen to Long Island City. I can't wait to come back!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"To be honest, when HipCityVeg first opened, I thought I would never go there. As a meat-lover, I didn't think I would enjoy eating vegetarian food. And I especially thought that the idea of fake meat was strange. But I actually really like HipCityVeg. Generally, I go to HipCityVeg when I need a quick meal that won't put me in a food coma. The Udon Noodle Salad is my favorite menu item, though most of the food is pretty good. The desserts and drinks are also really good. The banana whip is delicious. And surprisingly, I found that I like the fake chicken here. The main problem I have with HipCityVeg is that it is pretty pricy. I can see how they get away with it because they serve a niche group of customers and make it seem like the ingredients are higher quality than at other places. But $9 for a tiny salad is a bit much.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My overall feeling about this place was that it was just okay. The beer was tasty, the flatbreads were alright, and the large crowds made it not worth it. I know everyone has their own opinion on what pizza should be, but I definitely prefer pizza with sauce. I didn't really notice any of it on the Revolution pizza, which was supposed to have tomato sauce, caramelized onions, mushrooms, cheese, and fresh herbs. It was edible, but not memorable. We also got the Roasted Tomato Salsa pizza, which had salsa, corn, black beans, cheese, and lots of cilantro. I didn't love that particular combination on pizza, but perhaps that's our fault for ordering it. We managed to get a seat to eat at the bar while we were waiting for our table. The bartenders were nice, but it was hard to get their attention. They definitely didn't have enough people working. Again, the food here isn't bad, but I don't understand why it's as popular as it is.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you're looking at Malagueta as ""just a restaurant,"" it's pretty great.  The caipirinhas are excellent, and on the strong side (some places go heavier on the lime and sugar; Malagueta puts just enough lime and sugar in to let you choke down the cachaca).  The Saturday feijoada (black bean stew with sausage, served with rice, farofa, and collards) is delicious, and arguably among the best you can get in NYC.  The atmosphere is nice, the music is great, and the service is incredibly attentive. All of that is great.  Want a nice, mellow, romanic-ish dinner spot in Astoria?  Malagueta works. But something is missing for me.  Part of it is that Malagueta is one of a small handful of NYC Brazilian places that tries to serve acaraje and other dishes from Bahia... and it doesn't really work.  In Bahia, the acaraje will burn a hole through an tourist's unsuspecting gullet; at Malagueta, the acaraje was an oddly refined, bland appetizer.   If you're gonna serve acaraje, bring it on.  Make white American boys (and yes, I am one) cry like little girls.  Yeah, the side of malagueta hot sauce was pretty great, but acaraje should have that crazy mix of spice, dried shrimp, and dende that burns for days if you're not used to it.  And it should be a big, juicy, sandwich-type thing.   Little refined acaraje?  I don't get it. Still, Malagueta is an excellent restaurant.  But if you expect a taste of Bahia... go to Bahia.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"one of my first food ventures since moving to Philly recently, and not a bad choice. Friday nights - they have people flowing in and out but it wasn't packed. We had the chicken dumplings with sweet chili sauce, vegetable spring rolls (not the fried kind) to share. The dumplings were really good, as were the spring rolls - very fresh, definitely the healthier of the two. I had the Pad see ew. On accident. I meant to order the pad woon sen... totally my fault, not theirs. I'm not a fan of the thin wide noodles, but I sucked it up and kept my dish, and I liked each bite better than the first few. They also customize the spice level in your dishes, as most other places do. I was in need of a water refill several times, which they didn't really bring, but otherwise, the servers were friendly and checked on us. Bathroom floor was also noticeably sticky.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've shopped, eaten in the restaurants, and visited the beer garden here and it's all a fun, entertaining, and a unique experience. The place is consistently crowded with locals and tourists alike, but if you you can just walk around the slow moving masses, it's a really great spot. Because I love Italian food products, friends and I have purchased food here for picnics and I've purchased things to bring home. The veggies are expensive and not much nicer than those at the farmer's market, but the cheese, meats, and pasta sections are incredible. Things are little pricey, but  I figure that I am willing to pay more for a high-quality product because it very obviously tastes better. Plus, when you're paying $7 for a 1/4 of imported cheese, you eat it less quickly. I also like that there are a million types of pastas to purchase-fresh and dried-and they have a lot more than the standard ones that are sold at other places. I've also eaten from  the Gelatto place, the restaurant in the back corner by the pastas, and from the pizza counter. All good and all fairly priced. The beer garden is fun, too. I was hoping it'd have a sweet view since it's on the roof, but alas, there is not.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've always considered this a good place to eat until today.  Everyone makes mistakes and today they gave me the wrong sandwich.  I work an hour north so I didn't find out about it until I got to work.  I called and they were outright rude.  No appology, just bring it back.  When I explained I couldn't now and had paid for a more expensive sandwich then I received, they just said well bring it back. I wasn't offered the difference back until I asked and the owner made me feel like I was bothering him.  So if you get something to go, open everything up and check.  Its going to be a while before I go back because of the rudeness.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After starving for about 8 days for a photo shoot in Philly I decided that the only way to end my psycho diet of arugula and water was to do it right with a cheesesteak.  Boy was I wrong. First of all I've never had a cheesesteak so its not as if I had any expectations.  And I'm not ever supposed to eat bread, so this was a huge leap for me!  Tuesday, and I take the dog, check out of the hotel rather early to beat the luncheon crowd, and take a drive. We immediately find parking less than half a block away and decide on Pat's due to the yelp rating over Geno's.  (got to trust my yelpers!)  We cowardly stand back, and whisper the directions to order to each other. (CASH ONLY SUCKS)  Tuesday takes my arm and leans in to say 'you have to order, i dont wanna'.  We decide on WIT and American cheese lol.  Neither of us are fans of cheezwiz or whatever it is.   So I take a deep breath, walk up and say ""1 WITH American"".  Hand over my money, and before my change was ready my sandwich appeared!  Like magic... We sat down, split it half, and dug in.   WTH. This is IT?  The cheese isnt melted.  Its very cold.  The meat tastes like nothing, and if this place gets more love than Geno's how can Geno's be any better? Here's the best part-  I take a big chunk of what's left, and *attempt*, let me repeat A T T E M P T to give it to pups.  She sniffed, licked, then sat down.  Finally she looked at me like 'What are you trying to feed me?  NO WAY.""   My dog wouldnt eat it.

"If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would. Casa Mono is a very small and cramped restaurant. When the weather is nice, they open up part of their resturant to give the space a more airy feel. There are a number of two tops and a bar area that looks into the open kitchen. It's definitely a date spot, though it can get quite loud when the restaurant is full. As we perused the menu, we were presented with some room temperature bread and olives. The bread was fine and Adam enjoyed the olives (too salty for me). After looking over the wine list, we opted for a bottle of the 2012 Torres Moscato Catalunya Viña Esmeralda ($38). It was fruit forward and refreshing. If you check in on Foursquare, you will be able to get a free glass of cava. Don't mind if I do! The cava was their house cava and cutely named Cava Mono. It was light and refreshing. Casa Mono has a changing, daily special and, with our luck, it happened to be Corn Three Ways ($14). The moment we heard the description, we definitely wanted to try it. This was fantastic. The dish consisted of a spicy corn salad, covered with a cold, creamy corn soup and topped with a spicy croquette bursting with corn. I loved all of the different temperatures, textures and tastes that each type of corn gave to the dish. Additionally, the dish came with two toasted pieces of baguette that had some spicy topping. Summer is my favorite because corn is in season and this dish definitely let the corn shine. The sweetness of the corn was balanced by the spicy elements. It was a wonderful way to start our meal. During our trip to Spain, we fell in love with razor clams. Thus, we definitely wanted to try the razor clams a la plancha ($16). The dish came out beautiful, with the razor clams stacked in a jenga-type configuration with the garlic sauce all over. We both really enjoyed the sauce (we love garlic!) though we found the razor clams slightly overcooked, which led to them being a bit rubbery and chewy. While many people swear by the pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, once we saw the paella croquetas with uni and baby tomatoes ($16), we had to get it (we didn't want to get too many different types of croquetas... there's so much we wanted from the menu!). The dish came with three croquetas, each one had a piece of uni on it. The croquetas were placed in a tomato soup. We really enjoyed this dish. I love paella and the croquetas were freshly fried. The uni added some creaminess to the dish. A quick swipe through the intensely-tomatoey soup was a perfect small bite. Adam really wanted the Duck Egg with Mojama and Black Truffles ($18). The egg was perfectly over easy. The mojama (salt-cured tuna) added some great salinity to the dish. The mojama had a meat-like consistency and taste that reminded me of eating a Spanish cured meat (Serrano jamon?) instead of tuna. Underneath the egg, there was a pile of potatoes that were an awesome vehicle for the runny yolk. The truffles just added even more umami to the dish. This was a fantastic dish! The Skirt Steak with Romesco and Onion Mermelada ($17) also caught Adam's eye. I enjoyed this dish. The skirt steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The romesco sauce was good but was chunkier than a traditional romesco sauce. I enjoyed the crunch that the nuts in the romesco sauce added to the dish. The onion mermelada was sweet and helped to cut the savoriness of the dish. After all of those heavier dishes, we ordered the Heirloom Tomatoes with Boquerone Pesto and Black Olive Tapenade ($17). The tomatoes were fresh and sweet and went well with the pesto. We're both suckers for soft shell crab; thus, we ordered the Soft Shell Crab with Bacon Alioli and Green Tomatoes ($17). This dish was definitely too heavy. The bacon aioli was incredibly heavy and along with the deep-fried soft shell crab (albeit perfectly cooked), it was a bit difficult to eat. Additionally, the tomatoes were pickled; thus, while they added crunch, they were also incredibly salty. Therefore, the heavy aioli and the saltiness from all the components made this dish a complete miss. For our final dish, we ordered the Duck Breast with Sweet Corn, Strawberries and Shaved Foie Gras ($25). The sweet corn and strawberries went well with the salty foie gras and duck. Unfortunately, the duck was incredibly fatty (yes, I know duck is fatty) and I would have preferred the fat rendered off a bit more. The strawberries and spinach were tossed in a vinagrette that did help to cut the fattiness of the duck but it was too little, too late. This dish was also a miss. Casa Mono had some highs (corn three ways) and some lows (soft shell crab); all in all, we found the food good but not great. We really wanted to love it, like we did a couple years ago, but it just didn't meet our expectations. The inconsistency among dishes will probably not make us run back anytime soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My boyfriend and I have been here twice for brunch -- the first time was great, and the second time was awful. The food is pretty good, but it's nothing exceptional. You do get quite a lot of quantity for the price -- I had an omelette both times and was stuffed thanks to the sides it came with (salad, home fries, two pieces of toast). However the service was absolutely awful the second time -- it was very late for brunch, around 3pm, and there just weren't enough people in the place to justify why it took so long for our food to come out/our waitress to come around. The crowd is a mix of families, couples and really annoying sorority-type girls, e.g. the two girls at the table next to us the first time we were there who had an extremely loud conversation about some sort of detox camp where they only allow you 1500 calories a day (""OMG that would be like so cool to lose weight"") and ordered egg-white omelettes (""I don't want any of the sides, just the omelette"") but drank several glasses of wine each(which was definitely 50000 calories more than the salad and home fries put together). We won't be going back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place was HOPPING on a Tuesday night, so definitely make a reservation.  We dined here before seeing ""On The Town"" which was horrendous.  Dining at Becco ended up being the highlight of our evening.  The $25 wine list was extensive like other reviewers indicated.  The bottle we ordered was smooth & delicious.  3 of us got the three pasta special along with our entrees.  We highly recommend doing so.  The pastas were hot, fresh, perfectly prepared and endless.  Win-win!  I gave this a 4-star review because the salmon I ordered was a little dry.  Everyone else raved about their entrees.  We ended with the dessert platter with a little from each selection for the table.  The italian cheesecake was OUTRAGEOUS!!  It was light, not too sweet & melted in your mouth.  Worth every calorie.  All in all, I would highly recommend! The only real negative for the business to look into was the restroom situation.  One tiny stall in a high-traffic area behind a computer/wait station was not enough for a huge, bustling restaurant!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Instantly my new favorite local place after dinner last night. Been driving right by for months on way to work, but you can't see it behind other shops. Hasn't stopped them from drawing a lot of interest. Was hopping on a Friday night, with a wait after we arrived. But it felt lively and not rushed. Had a bunch of the dim sum. Spicy chicken dumplings were my favorite. Beef sandwich was a standout too. Soup dumplings were a little too fatty for me even though I liked the concept. Also tasted the pad thai and it was excellent with a nice spice. Pretty different from any I ever had in a Thai restaurant, but the different twist was part of the appeal. Will definitely be back -- hopefully often. Price was great and our waitress was really friendly. What's not to love?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I just ate here a week ago.. My friend and I were supposed to go to Yaffa's Cafe (which I've never been to) but then my friend got confused and we ended up at Orlins. It is a very cute place, with pretty outdoor-dining and good, fast service. My friend was complaining about her allergies, and we ended up meeting this lovely Kiwi lady who turned out to specialize remedies and gave my friend a cure for her allergies, so the crowd is not too bad either. I ordered the falafel sandwich and I was very disappointed that I shelled out $11 for that- it tasted like it had been marinated in fresh grass, which is not really my taste. They give you an option of fries or a house salad, so I chose the salad and the dressing was pretty good. However, the Kiwi lady was sitting next to me and got what looked like a lovely steak, which also smelled good, so I will definitely be heading back to try that! Overall, it was a very good place, but needless to say, do not order the falafel (I know what good falafel tastes like- half of my family is Mediterranean). You're much better off going down the street to Mamoun's and paying for their much cheaper and tastier, authentic falafel sandwhich.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Here's my story: I'd been on the road for 2 days, trying to get by with boring strip-mall caesar salads in places that had nothing but all-american fare, caught a cold, and needed a place to get a bowl of hot broth made from scratch to cure my viral/road food blues.  And it was date night, so I needed a place for my hungry sweetheart.  We started with the cobia - kaffir lime/pomelo/jackfruit sashimi and then a green papaya salad.  Both were well executed, but I would have gone lighter on the fish sauce.  Crispy shallots topped the salad off nicely.   When I walked in I could tell  the broth would be interesting, curiously (maybe because of my cold) the overwhelming impression was of cassia cinnamon.  I was a little nervous, not sure what it would be like, but was delighted when I tasted it. We both got the beef pho - I got a small, which for my 120lb midsize appetite (I'd skipped lunch) was perfect.  My date ate/drank every last drop of his regular size portion and was stuffed. The broth may not have cured my cold, but it made me feel a whole lot better: rich in flavor but not fatty; bright with herbs, and balanced. Do I think it's as authentic as south Philly vietnamese pho?  Hard to tell, I've never been to Vietnam.  My hunch is probably not.  Did I miss the beef tendons, when what I got was delicious meatball and and abundance of tender beef cuts?  Not a bit.   When I mentioned I found the green papaya a bit too salty, the chef kindly offered us the pineapple dessert on the house. I'm won over - we'll definitely be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"hmmmm how can i start this review for Tops Diner.......EXCELLENT!!! I have been going to Tops for many years and it wasn't as good back then as has been the last couple of years.  They renovated the entire diner years ago and also made their mark as one of the best, and maybe The Best diner in the east coast!     Aside from having an extensive menu, they also have a bakery on site where they make fresh cakes, pastries and the best cheesecake every single day!  I must say....more people travel miles to go to the Cheesecake Factory for their cheesecake, I tell these folks ""you have not tried a real cheesecake until you head to Tops""  They have a variety of flavors and as always, it's a big portion (cheap too for the size ) But I do have to warn those who are reading and have never been to Tops....make sure you wear comfortable pants becuase you are going to need to extra room around the stomach after eating.  Tops is know for given very generous portions of food.  The first time I order the cheese fries for an appetizer, I was thrown back by the mountain of fries and cheese served on the dinner plate.  It is easily an appetizer for 6 people. (Their fries are great too, freshly made for every order). As another reviewer wrote, the waiters are extremely nice.  I have yet to have someone who was rude or inattentive.   Tops used to be 24 hours...but recently did change their hours.  Such a drag not being able to go and having a huge portion of quesadillas at 4am :(   :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The first time I walked into Molly's, I was charmed by its authentic Old World ambience, with the sawdust on the floor, the darkness, the wood paneling, the booths, the bar with the quiet TV. I was already happy when we sat down in a cozy booth and ordered some beers (a slightly boring selection--I had a Smithwick's). Then I got my hamburger--OMG it was so good. The beef was so tender, it almost melted in my mouth (I ordered it medium rare.)  I put a bit of salt on it to make it even tastier. It was too big for me but I couldn't stop eating it! God it was good! The fries were dark and irregular and delicious. The salad was very fresh, with a simple and tasty vinaigrette, although the tomatoes were hard and flavorless. The service was efficient and friendly; as far as I could tell, everyone working there had an Irish accent. I've been there on Saturdays and Sundays. It is crowded but not annoyingly so. We have always gotten a booth with no problem. I love this place and will come back over and over.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Visited the restaurant in warm August weather and sat outside to enjoy the ambience. The restaurant is located near a river but has it's own private parking lot as well as fresh greenery that keeps the scene fresh! Food was tasty and it is mostly an American burger place. My California cheesesteak was quite delicious and the fries were homemade but tasty. Would definitely go back but only if weather permits for outdoor seating.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"While I have not yet dined here, I came for early evening drinks on Monday.  The space is gorgeous, airy and huge, and the menu sounds incredible.  My friend and I sat at the bar where I drank a fantastic glass of Sancerre (great wine list) and munched on the rosemary spiced potato chips they have sitting in bowls.  Further food review hopefully to come soon! I also spied the owners of Landmarc (one of my favorite restaurants) dining there - definitely a good sign!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Overall, this is a good restaurant. The service is prompt, wait for New York is reasonable and the variety is great. We had several yakitori and other dishes. I've had yakitori before but at other restaurants. Here it's noticeably smaller so it would be nice if they could provide an additional one on the plate for sharing.

I recently stumbled across this restaurant while walking on Bloomfied Avenue. I was so surprised on how cute the atmosphere was and their food was soooo good. I highly recommend the skirt steak.

Very fast service for take out. The food tastes very bland. I ordered chicken lo mein and I had to add loads of duck sauce to make it taste better. The chicken was also very dry. Disappointing when you have a craving for Chinese food and get a boring dry meal. Hopefully other items on their menu are more flavorful.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have walked by this place for years and thought, ""what a cute little place, I need to try this at some point.""  Well, I finally did. Let me first start by saying the food was not hit or miss. It was plain and simple miss.  I tried two appetizers and had an entree. All were very bland and didn't remotely taste like Mexican. The menu is very, very descriptive. I wasn't quite sure if I was reading a trashy romance novel or a food menu. Each food item had a paragraph long description talking about the orgasmic (literally) qualities of each menu item.   Quotes such as ""...will seduce even the most demanding palate"" and ""this dish brings out a cry for joy when tasted..."" were abundant.  I didn't cry out for joy but I did cry out for more flavor because everything was so bland. The building is quite amazing but the lighting from the chandelier in the front room is a little weird which makes everything really shadowy. Not warm and comforting at all. I will say, one redeeming factor was the drink menu which had very strange names such as Wild Passion and Future Traditions but were excellent.   All this to say, maybe I was there on an off night. I am willing to give this another shot at some point but I wasn't overly impressed with the dinner menu but plan on being back for drinks.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Kinda feel bad about giving this place a 3.  The food is always great (Only, the hush puppies suck.)!  However the last two times I've been, I've been stuck with bad service.   Heavily tatted, short dark hair, curvy girl... Last night was the second time my group had her.  The first time, she was just really slow and aloof.  This time, she was a BIATCH.  It took her over 10 minutes to get to our table, and when she did, she acted as if we were putting her out.  The thing that made me angry enough to write this review was when I asked very nicely for napkins b/c the busser spilled my drink when he brought it to the table (which I didn't say - I just asked for napkins).  She put a big smile on her face and said, extremely condescendingly ""Of COURSE I was going to bring you napkins."".  Typed out, it sounds like she was being congenial, only that she wasn't. I'm sure that she didn't see the huge sticky puddle on the table... but that's not acceptable behavior for any reason. As soon as she left, my two friends said ""Whoa! What did you do?"".   I don't know if she was having a bad night or what, but being nasty to perfectly nice customers is not okay.  Having to deal with a bitchy hipster with an attitude is something I expect in a clothing store, not a restaurant.  And, if I get this girl as my waitress again, I'm requesting another server. Other than that, the Khyber is great.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"New goal: work my way through all their pastas multiple times. I know it's not the hardest goal to attain, but a law student budget doesn't really allow for frequenting restaurants for $17 bowls of freshly made, al-dente, and all around excellently prepared pasta all the way downtown. It only gets better with some after-lunch shopping with the gals, and maybe throwing in a second helping of everything, including the great bread served to start. Favorite plate at the table award that day goes to the garganelli, and I don't even like radicchio all that much. Next up: most probs the vongole and going all out for dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Ordered a bunch of tapas, yes it's Spanish for small plates, and yes they were multicultural dishes and good for Nini's! We had chicken satay,Italian potato frittata, cured meats platter(prosciutto and capicola was awesome) and coconut shrimp. Mushroom ravioli and truffle fries were a big hit too. For dessert the cannoli 'nachos' (Mexican masking as Italian or vice-versa...we'll never know) and apple dumpling with ice cream, both were excellent. Room was 3/4 full, jazz playing, had a nice NYC vibe. We've been before and will definitely go again. My compliments to the entire Nini's staff.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"We stumbled upon Market Table after our original brunch plans were thwarted by large crowds and a lack of tables at our first destination. Overall, the experience was definitely well above average, though not perfect. Market Table was busy for a weekend mid-day, but not too noisy or overwhelming. The ambiance was quaint and rustic, but tables were fairly close together and caused some inconvenience when being seated with large jackets and bags (I guess that's NYC in the winter time, though). I went for the Poached Eggs (buttermilk biscuit, grilled ham, & hollandaise.... errr perhaps they should call it Eggs Benedict?). The dish was, by far, the best eggs Benedict I have had in NYC, or anywhere for that matter! The biscuit rivaled the buttermilk biscuits at Cookshop (though Cookshop still has a better biscuit), the ham was great, the eggs were perfectly done, and the hollandaise was delectable! It came with a side salad, which was also very good. However, I was craving some OJ with my brunch and when it arrived I was surprised to see that it was literally only about the size of a shot. I know it was probably fresh squeezed, but that was a let down. As for the service, our waitress was efficient but not intrusive and we definitely enjoyed our brunch!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really want to show this charming little Italian café some love and you should too! It's exactly what the neighborhood was missing: an authentic café that carters to each and every one of your cravings! * For breakfast have a cappuccino and chocolate croissant. This combo is out of this world. The coffee is bold and flavorful and their pastries are delicious. It is made on the premises and if you are lucky enough when you take a bite it will be warm and crunchy. The absolute best chocolate croissant in the city! * For lunch order #14 (Chicken Schnitzel) or #9 (Prosciutto Cotto and add some fresh Mozzarella to top it off!) I promise that both of these gourmet sandwiches will hit the spot! * For dinner choose the Fettuccine alla Bolognese or the Pasta with Pesto both are genuine Italian recipes that will satisfy your craving for homemade pasta.

I eat at this place on average twice a week, the staff is extremely friendly and surprisingly the Italian owner/chef cooks each and every dish. I think I am in love...","[0.0, 1.0]"

Once the food is left on the table no one will even care to check if everything is alright or if we need anything else. Not even to fill the glass of water.

We ordered the black sesame creme brulee and the chef's choice with green tea.   The chef's choice started with sake ice cream, then followed by flan and some chocolate cookie sandwiched by creamy center, and raspberry macaroon and green tea biscotti.  I must say my favorite was the black sesame creme brulee.  It was good but not mindblowing good.  The others were fine but nothing I would order again.  My second favorite being the macaroon.  All in all, a nice way to have a relaxing afternoon with tea and desserts.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The tofu salad appetizer did not have enough peanut sauce and just felt dry for the most part. My pad see iew was okay but it wasn't something that made an impression. My drink was full on alcohol over alcohol over alcohol. The description of one thousand and one nights cocktail sounded splendid with blueberries, vodka and a few different juices.

"I've been a foodie since before food got popular, and am now just starting to Yelp.  Instead of just being a passive participant I've decided to get active and log my nights out in order to remember when and where i went.  ;-) To keep things simple, i judge all restaurants on the following criterion:  FOOD, DRINK, SPACE/SCENE, SERVICE, PRICE.  So here goes! Food - The cuisine of this venue is Indian Fusion.  There is something for everyone, food can even be tailored to vegans and those who are allergic.  We had the following: - WATERMELON FETA SALAD / MINT SORBET - CHILI PORK DUMPLINGS / GRAPEFRUIT CONFIT - GINGER SCALLOPS - GRAFFITI BURGER / GARLIC FINGERLING POTATOES / CHIPOTLE MAYO - BRAISED PORK BUNS / APRICOT CHUTNEY - CHICKPEA CRUSTED SKATE / MINT YOGURT SAUCE - DUCK PORTOBELLO GRATINEE / MUSTARD ONION CONFIT Everything was typical for the progressive chefs of today-  delectable and well plated.  This is not a place that overplates and turns the food into art.  My only complaint was that the staff/head chef said everything was tapas/family style and the portions were a bit short for a party of four. Drink - The drink menu only had 1 cocktail- the Lychee Martini which was VERRRY generous, not served in martini glasses, but rather in giant wide topped glasses which meant more liquor and less spill.  The wine menu was brief and simple - not nearly as extensive as most foodie hangouts.  This is liked as it made choosing less trivial. Space/Scene - Do not go here for special occasions.  The restaurant is very tiny, like having dinner in your typical NYC shoebox apartment.  It is smaller than Barrio Chino if you have ever been there.  All 3-4 tables are on the right side while the waiters and guests have to squeeze through the left just to get to the tables.  And once you get to your table you'll probably have to share a larger table.  I knew this in advance and did not mind.  I enjoy this type of experience from time to time.  But I can't stand people who give good places bad reviews mainly because of the space situation.  You showed up, saw the place, you didn't have to eat there!  Finally, for those that crave trendy/popular spots...  The headchef competed against Morimoto on Iron Chef, and also was a contestant of last years Top Chef. Service - Wasn't over-the-top and pretentious, which i like.  But wasn't bad either.  If the waiter who was waiting our table was busy, we just asked any other waiter for a dish and it came out in a timely manner.   Also, Chef Mehta is very likely to be waiting your table too! Price - There are $12 or $15 dollar tapas.  The price is relatively reasonable as if the venue were larger, they could have charged $3 more for the same portions.  Dinner for (4) came out to $149 before tip.  We had a bottle of the Hanging Vine - Cab Sauv, Lychee Martini, and the plates mentioned above.  No dessert as we were adequately appetized and i wanted to take my parents to Pinkberry for their first experience. All in all, I enjoyed the food.  It was good, relatively unique, and flavorful.  Somewhat spicy (not by Asian standards) and because the portions were smaller, left you wanting a little more.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Then to top of the whole night, Tonight I was about to eat my left overs and IT WAS NOT MY MEAL!  I specifically left half of my meal to take home, so I could enjoy it a day later. So with that I am Not happy at all with the restaurant. I really wanted to leave a good review. But to avoid me and then mess up my doggie bag, doesn't deserve an all-around great experience score.  I did leave the waitress a nice tip, 20%. But that's because I am a nice person. And waitstaff make their living off of tips. Will I go back, who knows. Right now I am a little bit angry that either they threw out my meal, even after telling the waitress to please kindly wrap it up OR this restaurant just needs a better system in their kitchen or training their waitstaff.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"DON'T BOOK A PRIVATE PARTY HERE!!! I had my rehearsal dinner at LaScala's a few weeks ago.  It was a nightmare.  We invited 60 guests and booked their private room.  A week before the dinner, I came in to check out the room and describe how I wanted the tables set up.  I wanted tables of 8 or 10 and instead we had these extremely long tables which made it difficult for people to get around.  Issue number 1.  Both bathrooms were broken the night of our rehearsal.  Issue number 2 (Big issue!).  Our guests had to use the bathroom in the building's basement or the Dairy Queen next door.  So tacky!  Lastly, we were required to give them the entree counts prior to the dinner.  Most restaurants allow their guests to chose their entrees when they get there and they just make sure to have enough food on hand.  Some of our guest switched their meals and the restaurant said they wouldn't be able to cover them.  The manager came to me (as the bride) and asked me how I wanted to handle it.  I was dumbfounded!!  Haven't they dealt with this before??  Isn't it there job to handle these sort of issues?!  I had a list of what everyone ordered but I didn't want to go name by name through 60 starving people.  Issue number 3. In the end, i think they stretched the fish dishes.  Meaning instead of getting two pieces of fish, those that ordered fish only got one small piece since they didn't have enough to go around.  On top of all that, they overcharged us for five meals and said that's how many came out of the kitchen.  Issue number 4.  This caused me so much stress.  The issues were circling around in my head the entire night before my wedding.  The only saving grace was that two of the dishes tasted okay.  The fish dish had no taste.  I've eaten at LaScala's with my husband in the past but I will never go there again.  I'm furious!  Thank goodness my wedding day went smoothly!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"There's a few Cafe Zaiyas around Manhattan, and this one is an express, mini version of them all. It's literally the size of a mini mart/convenient stand. If you're looking for a grab-and-go kind of meal and/or a quick snack, then this is a great option, especially for lunch. Otherwise, it's not meant for a sit-down experience and one cannot judge based on that. Still very much keeping to the same menu items as other Zaiyas, but maybe with less options, they offer a variety of authentic Japanese fast-food type dishes -- beef, chicken, or tofu donburi (rice bowls), packaged sushi/sashimi, croquettes, sandwiches, mini burgers, etc. plus a variety of sweet desserts such as red bean buns, cream pan, and melon pan, etc. The food still tastes good, and I like the concept of this new Zaiya, but it does lack many features that the full cafe offers and has less food options. If you come too late in the day, they have less inventory, so it would be best to come earlier. If you come during the lunch rush hour, there will indefinitely be a line, but they move fast at the cash register. If you are new to Cafe Zaiya and are new to their dishes, it might be hard to decide at first. If you are in a line, you need to decide on the spot because it's literally grab and go, and no one likes someone who holds up the line. If you enjoy Japanese food/snacks, it's a worthwhile locale for when you are in a rush. Pricing is also very fair. I particular like their rice bowls and daily specials, which all run about $7-$9 for a sufficient amount of food. I frequent Cafe Zaiya a lot, and if this particular location were any closer to my office, I'd probably go to this one more often due to its overall convenience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Amazing and affordable food, great service, long waits. Open for dinner only, Tues-Sun 6-11 PM HIGHLY RECOMMENDED RESTAURANT. ---- Came with a party of 5 on a Saturday night, expecting a wait. The hostess was horrible at giving the correct estimates. We were told 50 minutes originally then told another 20 minutes after that 50 minutes passed...our actual wait time: over 1.5 hours before being seated...To avoid waits, come right when it opens or after 9 PM. Despite the wait, the food and service were absolutely AMAZING! My party of 5 ordered the ENTIRE MENU, minus 5 items. Food: - free bacon fat popcorn as a starter - highly recommend the oxtail terrine, won the vote from everyone for the best dish of the night. - other notiable dishes: yellowtail tartare, chicken duck pork dish, fried chicken, korean bbq wraps - everything on the menu, aside from the last 4 items, are small plates - last 4 items on the menu are entree portions - free mini asian yogurt drinks come with the bill Service: - extremely friendly - attentive - was able to take multiple credit cards and cash for one check I would recommend coming here with 6 (hungry) people and ordering the entire menu. I know it sounds crazy but everything can be shared in some way or another. It's a great way to sample everything, since everything is delicious. It's also VERY filling and EXTREMELY affordable. 6 is the perfect number to roll in with because some small plates come in 3s, sharing is easier. $55/person including 18% tip and tax...this is when we ordered almost the entire menu, sodas, and a bottle of wine!!!!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My wife and I have had six (maybe more) great meals at Pho 68.  The service is prompt and everything we have tried has been very good except the pho.  We prefer Pho 501 in East Hartford but they don't make anything but Pho there.  Pho 68 is a lot closer for us and offers a real menu.  Their pho wasn't bad (3 stars) but once you've had 501's, you have a pretty high standard to meet (at least we think so.) The ingredients have always been fresh and soups tasty at Pho 68.  They serve all the meals with a side plate of fresh lettuces, basil, mint and assorted greens so you can't help but feel you are having a healthy meal.  They do not serve alcohol but they're cool with BYB. We had a dinner party of six once and told the chef a day in advance.  He served three dishes that were not on the menu and they were all excellent.  He is very thoughtful and considerate; his wife is the chef. If they improved the pho, they would get a fifth star from us.  I hope more people go and eat here because it would be a shame if they closed for lack of business.The service is attentive and very reasonably priced. BTW, this restaurant is far superior (even the pho) to the other two I know of in West Hartford.  Do not get confused because the others are on the same or soundalikes street (Park and New Park streets).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"WOW - was referred by several friends to eat here and finally made the move this evening.   We showed up around 7pm and the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the dining room, the bar or the bar in the kitchen - or course we choose door number 3.  We had the most excellent service from everyone there.  We felt very special. We had the roasted summer corn toast and the crab toast - wow, what a great idea.  The summer roasted corn toast was the best with a roasted tomato spread.  It was sweet and salty together.  Then the Hamachi...the chef sent tuna to us as a surprise, also delicious.  John had the uni with baked egg - not my favorite but he absolutely loved it. Then we split the whole wheat noodles with asparagus (holy cow, so delicious) and the shrimp salad.  We finished with some beautiful dessert wine (dauphine) and a beautiful coffee with the blueberry pie.  Warm and delicious with a beautiful soft crust and vanilla gelato on the side. We are a finicky couple when it comes to dining experience and we were so pleased.  We had an excellent time interacting with the staff and learning more about the chef and the food.  Highly recommend this place and we will be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The menu offers many creative variations to the meatball.  For such a simple dish, it was an incredibly good meal!  The spicy beef meatballs (4) had a nice kick and really perked me up, as did the chicken variety.  A bit pricey for what you get though, but I can't wait for a repeat visit!  The word is out, so prepare for a wait....and a long one on most nights.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Barcelona is a great place to go, but not too frequently. The menu selection is great, but being a tapas bar it doesn't change frequently enough.

Good thing I planned to order take out and bring it to Washington Square park to eat.  There was only one guy working during dinner time on a Thursday night.  I felt bad since we had so many orders!   Food was awesome.  I'm really grateful to have a place where it's cheap and delicious.  I was a little bit thrown off though because I wanted to share a double, but they don't give you more meat just more rice.  I wasn't aware that you can buy a pork cutlet as a topping as opposed to buying another meal for that 2nd piece of meat!  Just a FYI for others who wants to share one of those dishes!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've only been here for their brunch but have never been disappointed. Living in the neighborhood it's a good spot that's within walking distance on a nice street.  During the warmer months, it's nice to be able to eat in their back garden area to enjoy some fresh air while eating Eggs Benedict.   The prices here are very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food that they serve.  I haven't had a bad brunch here and I hope that continues.  Brunch will usually run me close and around $10 which is not bad at all, and I leave full and content. Service here is also very good - I've found the staff to be very attentive, professional and nice.   I'll probably update my review of this restaurant once I try their lunch and/or dinner.  Great little spot in Sunnyside and I'll keep coming back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So I'm not a sushi connoisseur, until this I've done my best to avoid fish in my diet (yeah weird but get over it) so thats something to keep in mind when reading this review.  Disclaimer out of the way I gotta say I was very pleasantly surprised, the place is almost a little out of the way and almost easy to miss but inside it was pretty nice and the staff was great. The chef even threw in some special sushi on the house when they realized it was my first time trying sushi! To start out I dipped my toes in with the spicy dragon shrimp rolls that were excellent then took the big plunge with the September rolls that had Eel in them along with some chicken teriyaki just in case I couldn't handle the raw fish but everything was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed everything that I tried and has really opened me up to the whole fish thing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had ordered form Sanford's many times before going into the actual place today. They were closed for a while and now have reopened with a new fancier look - first warning: this is not a diner. I went to brunch with my wife and the first impression was positive: the place was full (we waited 5 min for a table) and they have a nice $12 ""prix fix"" brunch menu. We both went with eggs benedict + juice (she with coffee and me with hot chocolate) and that was when things started going bad. First, they brought two coffees. After I told them I had asked for hot chocolate (without whipped cream), they bought me a hot chocolate. With whipped cream. When they brought the OJ, mine had a small hair in it. So far, a few mistakes, but justifiable ones given that it was the rush hour for brunch. Then the food came and quickly the disappointment followed. The eggs benedict were just bad: the English muffin was burned and the eggs were completely overcooked (the yolks were solid!). The hollandaise sauce and the potato hashes were good, but not great. We decided to give it another shot with the banana chocolate chips pancakes. After waiting for around 10 minutes for our plates to be removed and for someone to take our order (this in a time were there was a line outside), they finally arrived. You could tell from the get-go that they were pre-made pancakes. There was no maple syrup with them, just a few small boxes of some generic (terrible) corn syrup. They tasted bland and, although the banana was there, there was very little sign of the chocolate chips. I will eat again at Sanford's because it's pretty near where I live and they deliver. I had their burgers and wraps before and they were decent, nowhere near the debacle of today's brunch. I'll try them again in the near future and, if necessary, update my rating and comments. Final thought: don't go here for brunch! It's crowded, the service is terrible, it's loud and the food is just plain bad.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Im giving 5-star because my frds really enjoyed the dinner. The place is a little dark. The food portion is huge! One plate of pasta is more than enough for two. We ordered way too much but everyone enjoyed it. Its a busy place even though they have lots of seats. I made a reservation and still waited for at least 30min. The only thing that upsetted me was that the host was not friendly and helpful at all while we were waiting for the table and didnt give a crap about anything. But our server was amazing.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I hate to be a Debbie-downer, but.... 1. 2 hour wait for soup and noodles? Ok, this is NY. 2. $12 Ramen Mango Salad the size of a small side salad? Yes it was delicious, but was expecting a little bigger portion. 3. $8 Chicken with a secret hot sauce? HOT! Absolutely amazing, but again, something more than like 6 nugget sized pieces makes it almost an appetizer 4. Not vegetarian or Rob-allergy friendly.  Leave your vegan friends out of this dining dash Is it really worth the hype? I didn't think so.  Sure we all survived on Ramen at least in one point of our lives.  But I survived just nicely making my own concoctions. The decor was a worthy attribute.  I so wanted to start climbing the pressure treated wood facade in front while waiting the 1-hour, then 15-minutes, then 30-minutes, then another 15-minutes, then another hour....be realistic with your seating times for godsakes!

Platters and salads are both well-priced and filling. The ba'al flatbread is also incredibly tasty and vaguely addictive, as much as flatbread can be I suppose. Be sure to arrive before the lunch crush at 12pm and you should be able to snag a seat.  The last time I was there they also had a lot of fun lunch reads, e.g. the NY Post and Us Weekly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I worked at the Philly Navy Yard for 20 years.  The first year I worked there, 1987, a coworker brought me down to John's.  I used to go there once or twice a week for years.  Of course, I've tried them all...Pat's, Geno's, DiNic's (on the base), Tony Lukes, Steakout, and even some of the REAL neighborhood spots, like 10th and Oregon Steaks, which is open 24/7.  By far, John's is the absolute best for both Roast Pork and second only  to Chink's of the Northeast for the Cheesesteak.   The Roast pork is seasoned perfectly, with hints of rosemary and garlic infused into the meat.  The sharp provolone is the BEST there is.  And the roll...well, when you watch them prepare the sandwich, they scoop out the bread inside properly before adding the cheese, then adding the wet Pork and Spinach (also garlic-y) before wrapping it LOOSELY in the double-wrapped foil.  This is important, as the loose wrapping maintains the juiciness of the sandwich.   When you go outside to eat it, make sure you allow the juice to drip into the foil.  Sop it up with the roll at the end.  You should have a perfectly dry piece of foil at the end.  If you don't, you ate it wrong. So, I left the Navy Yard in 2006.  Because of John's hours, I haven't been back since, until today.  Everything is as I remember.  The atmosphere (kind of like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld...which is typical Souf Philly!) , the food and the clientele.  It's all good.  And the best part.....the food is consistently prepared.  All these years, I've NEVER had a bad experience at John's. A side-note, I think John may have passed away.  I kind of remember reading that a while ago.  I remember when he was ill.  His son is now running the place.  It's a family business and the sons, daughters, aunts and uncles all run the place and all know what they are doing.  You cannot go anywhere better for Roast Pork.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It was a rainy weekend in January and the last thing I wanted to do was go out to eat. I had guests visiting, so staying in wasn't really an option since they wanted to go out and explore the city. After having Cafe Gitane recommended to us, we decided to check it out. We showed up and I was quickly surprised with how intimate the atmosphere was. The atmosphere is perfect for almost any occasion- a date, with the parents or with a group of friends. Beware though...the server we had was extremely socially awkward (kind of how I was in middle school when I used to rock frizzy hair and huge eye glasses), so if you get awkward around other awkward people...this may not be the place for you. I don't remember exactly what I had for the entree, but the hummus we had as an appetizer was amazing!

"Wow. Wow. Wow. Diamond in the rough. I went to El Rey Monday with a some work buddies and caught the end of happy hour.  $1 tacos, empanadas for $2, and great drink specials. We were able to sneak in an order before happy hour ended and it served as a great appetizer.  Tacos are authentic and unique. Each one has loads of flavor. We all happily ate those empanadas as well. For dinner we were recommended to try nachos (which our server, Elan, alleged were the best he'd ever had) and to split a short rib fundido as a first course.  Elan was not lying. These nachos were legendary. Layers of flavors and toppings!  Our server also claimed that the fundido was like a Mexican cheesesteak in a pan.  A great and accurate description. The onions played really well off the meat. For dinner we each happily had our own entrees. My choice: the ribs. I loved the combination of tropical fruity flavors with fall off the bone ribs.  I also tried a special that my friend got the surf and turf tacos on truffle corn tortillas. I stole one and was one happy dude. I love this place! Can't wait to go back!","[0.0, 1.0]"

Hadn't the chance to get back as this place is closed at midnight in week days. But i was sooooo damn good that i decided to get back yesterday, on a date. You *need* to try this place without any doubt (and to make a reservation for it). Their dishes are orgasm for mouths, their cocktails are tasty and well balanced, its staff is kind, quick, and friendly. If you go on a date, ask for the patio, that is more quiet and romantic than the crowded and noisy main room (the *only* bad side). You may think twice looking at prices, because, let's be honest, this place is a bit expensive, BUT that's totally worth it: this is the price of great cuisine.

The all time famous CHICKEN and RICE is so cheap in price and so fulfilling! only $6 for a big plate!  There are two different sauce the White sauce and a Spicy red sauce.  Be careful with the HOT sauce because it is HOT. The chicken is cooked to perfection (sorry i am not a lamb person so never tried their lamb! but i heard is equally good).   The chicken is put over the rice, not typical rice but rice cooked with saffron. Other than the chicken and the flavorful rice, it also comes with a little bit of shredded cabbages.  All these are sealed in a silver container and serve to you hot and fresh!!!!  I normally take the food back to the hotel since there's no place to sit outside and is normally chilly.  I would recommend you share the plate with another person because it is a LARGE plate! ~ and you don't want to eat THAT much food before you sleep right?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Irasshaimase! I'm about 5 weeks back in the US from two years in Japan, and I was positively shocked by the authenticity of Sakagura.

And just like Japan, it'd be almost impossible to find without the help of a Japanese person. And this is New York! Their resident sake connoisseur is from the town I lived in while in Japan, and she knows her stuff.  She offered all sorts of different flavors of sake for us to try in our experience there. The food is the exact same stuff you'd find on a menu in Japan, and just as delicious. If you take a look around the place, you'll find lots of great decorations from festivals all over Japan.

"It's so great when a random search for nearby restaurants on Yelp turns up an unexpected goldmine. Everyone who loves pho knows how difficult it is to find it in Manhattan. I'm happy to report for $8 a bowl, Saigon Shack does it pretty well. We really enjoyed our pho and also tried the Grilled Pork Chops with Vermicelli and loved it. We stopped by on a rainy Saturday evening around 9 pm and waited just a few minutes for a table for three. The overwhelming reviews regarding negative service necessitates a comment on our experience but luckily I can report that the service was prompt and efficient. Our water was refilled constantly, my sister requested extra sauce for her dish and it was immediately provided. Our waiter also boxed up her food and brought the check quickly.

"This is definatly one of the best Thai restaurants in town... and we have been to many.It's a small, cozy, BYOB place.  I love Thai food but this place makes me want to come back for more.

Same thing goes for her desserts. Everything on the menu is made with love and is delicious from her appetizers, entree, desserts and even specialty drinks. If you don't like spicy let them know... if you like your food hot, let them know... they will cater to your needs. The service is okay depending on your waiter. The is a family owned business.

"Nothing special or exciting about this place, it seems a little tired. The space is extremely cramped (some hipsters find this cute and quirky, I presume), the service is expectedly pretentious, and the menu/style of food is fairly basic.

"Go figure that the one place the wife and I decide to pop into on a whim in Philly was the place that we enjoyed the least. That being said, I think Mix Brick Oven is a solid 3.5 stars. The wife and I decided to walk from our hotel to the Mütter Museum, and make a stop halfway for an early lunch. While we did consult our handy dandy Yelp app, we were on the go and it was sweltering hot and thus didn't take too much time to be fussy. Mix Brick Oven Pizza was open, it looked decent and got 3.5 stars, we were hungry and needed some water, so in we went. The establishment is broken up into two sections - a more standard ""pizza by the slice"" joint in the front, and a bar in the rear. We were the first customers of the day, and were offered to sit in the back because the front of the house was rather hot. We sat at the bar, not for any particular reason, and we had no plans to drink at 11:15AM. Our server was REALLY sweet, but it seemed the young Asian girl had been a blonde in her past life. She did good with my order - my Chilanga pizza came out as ordered and expected. But she had a lot of trouble with my wife's order. She ordered a tuna hoagie, no onions, and a side of fries. She received an Italian hoagie instead, and no fries. My wife was so hungry that she ate the Italian hoagie and much to her surprise, she really liked it. I tried a bite and, for what it was, it wasn't bad. The Chilanga pizza I ordered was basically a pizza-fied nacho, which is exactly what I suspected it to be. It was topped with refried beans as the ""sauce"" and loaded with chorizo, cheddar cheese, onions, and jalapenos. I echo the other complaints that the pizza crust was VERY soft. That wasn't a big issue for me as my pizza essentially became something of a quesadilla, and all of the grease from the chorizo and cheese makes the crust even softer. If I was expecting a crunchy crust for my ""nacho pizza"" then I would have been disappointed. But the pizza itself - especially the chorizo, was yummy. I ate the whole 12 inches myself. (Insert inappropriate joke here) We asked about the fries and our server apologized profusely, saying she was trying to not forget the ""no onions"" and forgot the fries altogether. We didn't even mention that the wife wanted a tuna hoagie rather than an Italian hoagie. She was having a rough day. A bit earlier the second customer of the day came into the bar. He ordered a bottle of Coors Light. The waitress went behind the bar to find the Coors Light, admitting that she didn't work behind the bar much. She found the bottle of Coors Light, but then kept searching for a bottle opener. For a Coors Light. After some frantic searching, I could tell she was getting a bit frustrated and I decided to help her out. ""Umm, I believe those are twist-off"" I said. After a quick twist of the wrist and miraculous opening of the Coors Light she looked at me and said ""Ohmigod thank you!"" Poor thing. We gave her a nice tip, but we really wanted to give her a pat on the head too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here with two friends and it was fantastic. We started with gaucamole and it was outstanding. Also, it was a HUGE portion - they don't stint on guac here!

It was almost like a taco in shape - they stuffed a crispy cornmeal tortilla with cheesy mushrooms and folded it up like a taco. The margaritas were perfect, the staff were exceptionally friendly, and decor was fantastic. The only thing I didn't like was the volume of the music - turn it down so I can talk to the person who's sitting 6 inches from me without screaming! But I guess that's just trendy NYC for you.

"Honestly I wasn't expecting much from a place whose sign is written in papyrus font. This place wasn't my first choice for dinner, but we ended up going there anyways due to proximity. The inside is sterile, way too white, and full of yuppie-seeming people. (I know, I was feeling judgmental!) However, the food started coming and it was delicious!! We got the guacamole (with taro chips and pomegranate seeds in it!), the rellanas, and then split the fish tacos. Everything was presented well and was really fresh and tasty. I think our server was having an off night- he was a little awkward, dropped some dishes, and switched our check with another table (who spent 7 times as much as us!), but it really wasn't anything to ruin the night. I wish the decor was better, but the food was surprisingly good. I also wish we would have brought a bottle of wine like everyone else did!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Carmela's pizza is the real deal. If you want true Italian pizza, hand crafted, by a true Italian, look no further. Rick and his wife came direct from Italy and opened this family operated establishment. The love good food, and they love making good food. When good people, with a passion for food open a restaurant, there is nothing but gourmet bliss. I live in Texas, where Chuckie Cheese is essentially the pizza standard, but I grew up in CT so I know a good pizza. Hands down, this is without a doubt, the BEST pizza in CT, and quite possibly New England. Don't let the location, or the modest decor fool you; these guys know what they are doing.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Chicken cutlet sandwich please! So delicious. When I ordered over the phone they told me what usually comes on it (sauce and cheese - I got mozzarella), which I appreciated since it was my first time. I asked for a few extra things to be added on (lettuce, tomato, and hot peppers) and they were very accommodating. You also get the option of having it cold or toasted in the oven. I got the ""whole"" sandwich, knowing that I needed something for lunch and for dinner. I was pre-warned by my co-worker that it was huge, but I didn't expect it to be so large! It was basically like having two sandwiches. A half of a ""whole"" was the size of a Subway sandwich, but obviously much more delicious. The hot peppers on it was great. My only complaint was that between the breading on the chicken and the bread, it was a little dry. There was no sauce on it like the person on the phone stated. It could have used mayo, hot sauce, oil and vinegar or something to help add some moisture. It was just under $16 for a ""whole"" chicken cutlet grinder, but it is totally worth it for the size and quality. The guys there were really nice too! May not be in the best area, but in the day time I felt perfectly safe. There is seating inside but I got take out. They take credit card, $5 minimum. Small parking lot available too.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Biked here on the first really hot spring day in 2011 and was slightly disappointed with the service, but still had generally tasty food. My roommate and I came after we randomly tried Los Caballitos in South Philly (Dos Segundos' sister restaurant) and had a great dining experience there.  We expected Dos Segundos to be better due to the higher yelp ratings, but our personal experience didn't reflect that.   It took a long time for anyone to come over and acknowledge us after we had already been seated by a waiter, and when the chips arrived, they were oddly stale.  Still, love that green salsa and would probably have an IV of that hooked up to me if I could.  They also did not refill our chips, and we had to ask for more (at Los Caballitos our waiter brought us new ones without us saying anything). The rest of the food itself was pretty good.  My roommate ordered a bean & fried plantains torta (~$9) and was very pleased at its size (HUGE-- good leftovers).  I ordered the shrimp ceviche ($10), which is always a smaller serving, but still filled me up (thanks to the ongoing chips and salsa as well) and tasty, except that it was a bit overwhelmed with too many red onions.  I got a mojito ($6) that was perfect for the super hot day and for dining outside.   My overall experience was positive, and it was great for a hot day, but the docked stars are due to the lesser service we received and the stale chips.  My roomie also pointed out that they charge extra for things that usually come standard on Mexican food (salsa, cheese, sour cream).  I would still try it again since it's much closer to me than Los Caballitos and the food is still generally very good.  The music they have playing is also usually good and I like their atmosphere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Food: 4.5 Stars Service: 4 Stars Superb. I came here for brunch with my girlfriend before catching a flight out of La Guardia. They were very helpful with helping me store my luggage and accomodating us pretty quickly. There was a line which you want to be aware of during peak hours. Unlike a different reviewer, I thought it was really unique and cool that they essentially used their door frame and chalk for the waiting list. I seriously doubt people would purposely smudge the names ahead of them just to get ahead in wait time. When we were seated, I will say the tables are pretty close to each other so you'll be packed quite closely. We ordered the: 1. The Croque Madame - which was very tasty, thick and heavy. Although portions looked kinda small at first glance. They're actually quite thick and heavy so you'll be fulfilled after the meal. There was cheese on either side of the bread which was melted in and still hot from the kitchen, which brought out so much flavor from the filling of the sandwich. 2. Waffle Sandwich - my favorite. It came with butter and maple syrup on top, a lot of cheese in the middle, bacon, and I believe an egg as well. Everything just blended together in a beautiful melted mess of sweet, savory, cheesy, crunchy and lightness. I've never had anything like it and would come back again! The menus and decor are also beautiful. Makes you actually feel like you're in a small parisian cafe, but you're in the middle of Manhattan. Highly recommended!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Couldn't figure out what i wanted to eat so i went on Groupon and found this place. The location was a little weird because its in an apartment complex with private parking.. you have to get buzzard in.. but once they lifted the gate we parked and no one was in there. An employee came and greeted us and was so nice and helpful with seating us. He handed us a menu and informed us on some of the items on there. My friend asked him about some spinach that was not located on the menu and he said they didn't have it but would look into it. I ordered the Chicken Masala with Cheese Naan Bread. She ordered Veggies and Garlic naan. The naan bread had little pieces of cheese.. i could have just ordered the plain naan and been OK. The Chicken Masala was amazingggggggg so flavorful.. the Naan bread was fresh and hot! He ended up surprising her with spinach and she loved it! I also had some Mango Juice.. which was so fresh thick and sweet!!  Like he peeled a fresh mango in the back..I couldn't finish it all! This place is located inside of an apartment complex.. great for lunch!! Cheap Cheap Cheap!!! It was super clean and organized!!

"I visited Olea in mid-October, back when the air was still warm enough in the late morning to sit outside for brunch. Sunday morning brunch, if pushed more toward noon, can involve some waiting for a table. My friend and I were early risers, so we were seated (a little before 11) at one of four outside tables, where we could people watch from the corner of Lafayette and Adelphi Streets. I started with hot apple cider ($4), which wasn't overly sweet (hot cider does not require mounds of sugar!). We split the almond-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates ($5) for an appetizer. My sister has been making these for years, so when I saw them on the menu, I knew it would be a delicious way to start our meal. It was! For my meal I had the brioche french toast with fruit ($8.50). French toast was perfect: slightly crispy on the outside, airy on the inside, and was served with maple syrup. The fruit was not so perfect: it wasn't fresh and consisted of pineapple, two pieces of melon, and one grape. Bad fruit day? The service was great and our food came extremely fast. Tapas is served later in the day. Owners also have three other restaurants in Brooklyn (Pequena, Moe's Bar, and Maggie Brown). I look forward to visiting when I return to New York!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Pies that go straight to your thighs!!! Actually everything I ate here pretty much went to my hips and thighs!

Don't come here looking for dishes that are fat free but every once in awhile, an artery clogging meal like this, is so good for the soul.

Two people in my party had the pulled pork (I think it was called the ""Porky""). It was supposed to be a pannini but was actually a sub sandwhich. When I tasted it, it was just TOUGH. I had the perogies & asked for onions. No onions...The perogies were dry & tough. Deep fried when I think they're supposed to be sauteed. I just ate the filling & cut around the outside so maybe I had a TEASPOON per!!!!!I also didn't like the fact you had to order from the bar & then pick up not just your order, but utensils, condiments, napkins, drinks, etc. The table we occupied (and NO...it was not busy so we had free rein to pick a table) was dirty to the point that my sister-in-law's white sweat shirt sleeve ended up in ketchup left on the table previously. Again,  the place not not packed. They couldn't have cleaned the tables? Twice I asked for club soda & a RAG for the sweat shirt. We were given paper napkins. Need I explain a paper napkin shredding? I, like other reviewers have stated, I will NOT return to this place again. The pulled pork is so tender & just drops off the bone????? HARDLY. The prices????

Gotta agree with Susan L.'s review below - not really sure about the 4-star rating here.  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was ok but nothing special. Kind of bland actually.

"Yes, my friend and I had THE burger. No, we were not impressed. Mind you, we are not food snobs and we were actually quite excited to come here for dinner but kept a very open mind. It was an okay burger, but quite frankly I don't care what the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ingredients are; if a burger is $28 and served at such a highly raved about, fussy reservation system restaurant, it better knock my socks AND shoes off. It didn't. On to the other dishes: -Huîtres Et Crépinettes: Meaty saucy meatball-like sausages which were quite good although we haven't a clue why they were served with oysters. The oysters were thin and briny (which is my preference) but not chilled enough. -Oxtail And Foie Gras Terrine with poached leek: I am not a huge fan of terrine in general so maybe I'm just bias here. It wasn't bad though, especially on bread and the poached leek was very enjoyable as it was perfectly pickled and savory at the same time. -Roasted Bone Marrow: very rich and one of my better marrow experiences. The crispy bread was delicious but I wish they toned it down with the butter as it kind of upstaged the natural buttery texture of the marrow. The shallot confit had me taken aback at first; way too grape-y, but I learned to appreciate it toward the completion of this dish; it balanced out the butter and oils very well. The service is one of Minetta's best features, and their  old world charm is definitely inviting (cramped, though). This place will obviously keep going strong with or without my stamp of approval, and I can't hate them for that. Though my friend and I will not be making a return trip, I am happy that I at least tried it and can cross it off my never-ending list.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Clinton St. Bake Co has great food, don't get me wrong. But they sell brunch, not magical lamps with genies inside. Why there is a line that long every single day of the week is a mystery to me.

"Totto Ramen was delicious, though not sure it was worth the 1.5-hour wait. Broth: Both the miso and the extra-spicy were good, though the latter was not that spicy. Meat: Thick-cut, quality pork. Toppings: The scallions were fresh, and I liked that they were sliced length-wise instead of chopped finely--provided more texture and flavor. I've preferred other ramen shops' marinated eggs over Totto's and I missed the addition of bamboo shoots. Service: Fast and friendly (kudos to them for getting so many people in and out so quickly!).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came to Ippudo with Ben and Momo.  Lucky for me, I remembered where it was incorrectly so I got there late. :P  Because I was there a little late, the wait was less time for me since Ben and Momo got there early! When I got there we were seated within 10 or 15 minutes. I liked the ramen at Ippudo, and what I really liked about the ramen here is that the noodles were thin.  I'm already a big fan of angel hair pasta, so thin ramen was a bonus.  I took awhile trying to decide what I wanted from their menu.  They had a ton of choices of ramen for you to choose from.  I went with the Akamaru Modern with Nitamago (boiled egg for $2 extra).  When I saw the prices on the menu, I was thinking DAMN, $15 for Ramen?!?  WTH?!  I'm used to ramen being around $8 or so.  I guess it could be because there isn't a lot of ramen spots in New York?  Not sure. Anyway, the noodles were great, I liked the broth, and the scallions were nice in the ramen to cut through all that fat.  The dish also came with garlic oil, but I didn't really taste it.   I also got to try the Shiromaru Hakata Classic which came with red pickled ginger and memma vs. garlic oil in the first bowl.  I liked both! We also got a side of the Hirata Chicken Wings which was fried chicken.  It was pretty good, and the chicken was pretty moist inside.  The sauce it came with was kind of similar to the Thai sweet and sour sauce but with more stuff added. It's a great place to eat at when you're in New York.  The wait is not as ridiculous as Daikokuya.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"A group of 7 friends and I went last Friday night b/c I was really craving Mediterranean food in Midtown.  We had a reservation and they had our table ready and waiting for us.   Ambiance-good place for a date, warm and inviting, but modern.   Food-very good.  Hummus was great, as were all the mezze we had.  I don't remember all of them but the tabbouleh salad, the duck shwarma, brussel sprouts, and veal bacon were very tasty!   Service-this is the one issue I had.  our waiter was a little strange.   I think it was his personality-but he got too up close and personal.  He was very nice and attentive, just not my style.  there was also some kind of ""other"" waiter who kept watching our table and was very eager to talk to us as he took away our plates.  I guess he was a bus boy but he acted like he wanted to be our waiter.  It was all very strange.  Also, there's an attendant in the restroom so make sure you take a buck or two when you go back there.

"I went here last Friday with a friend. He got out of work a bit early, so we met in front of Bianca at about 5:15pm, they just opened for dinner and we were the first diners to arrive. We had our choice of tables, and the waitress pointed us over to their best table in the house! We were off to a great start, I was concerned about being comfortable after reading Yelp reviews. Of course people started trickling in after us, however, by the time we left, 6:45pm the place had not filled up, so 5:15-6:45pm could be a good time range to get there. Now on to the food. We shared our two appetizers, Carciofi Fritti (fried baby artichoke with parsley, $8), this was delicious! I don't like parsley, and usually push it off to the side, but it was seasoned very nicely, and lightly fried (?), making it crispy. The second one we shared was from the night's specials, zucchini and shrimp ($12), this was delicious too, the shrimp tasted like shrimp and moist! I'm a fish lover, and it's my first choice from a menu, however, getting fresh tasting, moist seafood from restaurants other than a decent sushi place is very challenging. I don't know what most restaurants do in the handling of seafood in either preparation, or cooking of it, but they don't know how to work with it. Both appetizers were decent portions, again I wasn't sure what to expect after reading reviews, and I have a healthy appetite. For the entree I had the Tagliolini ai Frutti di Mare (clams, mussels, calamari, & shrimp, $12), this was another winner! Fresh home made pasta, with a nice amount of quality tasting seafood, again a decent sized portion. The cost of this entree is unbelievable, I've paid $24 for an entree comparable in size with less seafood of lesser quality. My friend had the Pollo al Balsamico (chicken poached in balsamic vinegar $14.50), which he liked very much. We had three Pinot Grigios at $6 per glass. The service was good, and the atmosphere is charming. Do they have the best Italian food in the city, I can't say because I haven't been to all the Italian restaurants here, but I can say, they certainly beat out a lot of the competition covering many price ranges. The only reason I didn't give Bianca a 5 Star rating, is because I reserve that for an excellent upscale dining experience. Bianca is a fabulous gem, and I will definitely go back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love the fact that you can get three different soups in one pot. For $22 it is a deal.

I like how you can make tour own sauces and they keep bringing out the food to you as long as you are still hungry. We came here in Christmas day and there was a two hour wait. Insane! The popularity of the place is legit. Beef, lamb, chicken, pork, Pork blood, pork brain, liver, crab, shrimp, tofu, etc, it's all there. Plenty of choices.

"Friendly service, delicious food, fun atmosphere. An unexpected find in a strip-mall just down from Sam's Club, but has quickly become a go-to place for lunch and dinner with friends.  As many have mentioned, you can either order from the menu or (as we always do) get the all-you-can-eat menu.  It should be noted that lunch is quite a bit cheaper, with only a few options removed, so if you are on the fence, consider trying it out at lunch!  ($18/person vs. $25/person) PROS: All-you-can-eat sushi.  And not just the cheap stuff either!  They have a whole host of delicious speciality rolls (the Crazy Tuna is my favorite), along with great options from the kitchen.  If you enjoy sweet potato, try the tempura fried sweet potato appetizer - delicious and crispy. Beautiful presentation.  They take care in how your food looks, but it doesn't feel over the top either. Friendly service.  Your water glass rarely gets empty, and the staff is always very attentive. BYOB.  There are plenty of drink options, but if you want to bring your own wine, go for it! CONS: It can sometimes be a bit loud, and the center section can feel overly cosy with neighboring tables. OVERALL: I don't know if it is the best sushi ever, but it is darn good!  We will continue to have Masa on our frequent rotation of places to enjoy around Princeton.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Rating: 3.5 stars - Has the potential to be better! This looks like a great place to come with friends to drink after work. It has a good selection of beers and wine. The lighting is pretty dim though. If you need something, the waiter is never around. They don't come around to often. Takes a long time to get drinks or a refill on water. I read a bunch of reviews regarding the bacon jam. I just had to stop by and try it out. So I ordered the Bash Style burger. It took quite a while to prepare even on a slow weeknight. The burger came with fries and two onion rings on top. The onion rings were very crispy but a little to oily. As I bit into it, the oil leaks out. Not very appetizing to me. The fries were crispy and delicious. It's the typical cut for fries at an average thickness (thicker than fast food places but thinner than steak fries). As I bit into the burger, the juices were leaking out. WOW! The bacon jam was delicious and had a sweetness to it that I loved. The burger was very well done. It's your typical basic burger. Nothing stood out except for the bacon jam. The bun was very plain and didn't hold up very well. I would like to see them put a cup of the jam on the side of the burger. That way I can taste the jam and apply it myself accordingly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Finally made it down to Jane this morning to try the famous brunch.  I figured the weekend before Christmas was a good time to take a chance on a Sunday at 1:30pm, and lo and behold, I was right.  10 min and we were sat in the celebrity table in the corner - clearly someone must have tipped them off that The Mayor was in the house (hey, I can dream, can't I?).  Decor is warm and brown, but with chic touches like square lamps and sleek banquettes - makes you feel at home.  I like it. The menu is kind of overwhelming, but only in the sense that everything looks amazing.  I went with the Johnny Cakes Benedict (eating light, as always) which was savory and delicious.  Pair that with a side of rosemary fries, and you've got yourself one damn good brunch.  Minus a star for some server mishaps and cramped seating, but it's a safe bet.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let me paint the scene for you...envision dining by the window, street-side, on a sun-filled day complimented with a warm breeze. You are seated across from your favorite companion. You are spending the weekend in a new city, dining at a new place that was reached by crossing many streets to experience. You are enjoying a delicious brunch served by a warm and relaxed staff. Yes...a staff. Your needs are not only satisfied by one server but every server in this quaint, off-the-beaten path establishment. The owner even stops by to check up on you. At some point before my generous portion of Eggs Benedict has completely disappeared, an item in the bakery cooler catches my eye. Seconds later my companion also takes note of the very same delight...it beckons further investigation. We order a slice to share. It's a carrot cake and plenty to share for two. The dark cake is appealing with its thin slivers of fresh carrot generously spread throughout and blending well with the succulent chunks of walnut. The icing is delicate and strikes the perfect balance with the moistness it wraps. Moments after her first bite, my companion declares it's the best carrot cake she has tasted. We didn't even visit this eatery for its dessert. The brunch exceeded our expectations and the carrot cake...well, simply put...it was the icing on the cake. A very impressionable experience. Thank you to the owner and staff at Cafe de Maude.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Great spot for groups with admirable crowd management and deep selection. Look: kind of a toned down Joe's Crab shack.  i'll give points for them not stapling crap everywhere and creating to much visual noise.  Kind of reminds me of a nice blend of Water Taxi Beach and Seacrets in Ocean city visually. Food: This was a liquid lunch and i'll give compliments to a very wide and diverse selection of beers and cocktails.  my group was here for the better part of 4 hours and the depth of the menu allowed us to keep things interesting.  I was pleased with their pricing as well with yellow beer running around $4 a can to regional specialties about 6. They sling a fine Michelada here as well. Experience: Staff was very accommodating on my groups dithering as to when or if we were going to eat and move our reservation around accordingly.  This is a very comfortable spot and they bar staff showed some hustle and worked to get folks taken care of quickly at the up and downstairs walk up bars.   I'd ask they put some kind of sign up alerting folks to the relative steepness of the center stairs and i get the impression anyone without full use of their facilities might be stuck in the bathroomless downstairs.  Great spot for large groups and and kids.  The bags/cornhole sets are a nice touch as well.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is my new favorite place in the area. We waited an hour, which I would normally dread but there is an outdoor heated bar area witth a full bar! Theres also an indoor bar to wait at. I had a terrific michelada (sp?) with just the right amount of salt and hot sauce. It also acts as a palette cleanser. and there were a couple good craft beers on draft. The bartender was very friendly. After waiting we were seated inside along a long picnic style table. I was annoyed that two people were taking up space that would probably hold 4-6 people.. moving on The pizza here is delicious. I suggest building your own on a margarita pizza base with sopressata and roasted red peppers. And roasted garlic. The meats they have are excellent there's a lot to choose from and it's like no other pizza in bushwick. Oh and theres some kind of spicy olive oil on the table that I absolutely love. I also had pear ice cream for desert. Very very good. My only complaint is the price. There are plenty of other great pizza places in Brooklyn and the city with the same style and great pizza but not as expensive, and I think its overpriced here especially for the area.

"(^_^) Funky Japanese hot pot shop. [Thus, requiring a funky Asian emoticon..] Eat in this down-to-earth, Japanese filled restaurant in the W.village and you'll discover a menu-full of Not So Average Japanese dishes. So original.. You probably have only seen a traditional take on these funkified cousins. The Hot pot dishes were yummy,  and even though the soups were noticeably red, the my-tongue-is-on-FIRE-level was low. ""You can do it!"", a wise man once said. Also, try the chicken wings, carpaccio, and gyoza. If you're adventurous, try the pork tongue and foie gras sushi. If you're not Japanese, you'll probably be wondering what Tonsoku is, bc it's all over the menu. The definition: Pig's feet. Have no fear though, because it's cooked to such a tender consistency, it's similar to attacking ribs. Just use your hands and enjoy. (Plus, collagen will make you look younger.) And, why are you at Hakata Ton Ton, if you aren't in Adventure mode~ The place is tiny (30-40) and packed, so make a reservation. Bring 5 others, so you can eat family-style and share more dishes.

"Did a little window-shopping upstairs, but ultimately just wanted some dinner, so went downstairs to The Cellar. Based on nothing but a bowl of tomato soup, I'm giving this place 4 stars. Dang, that was some good soup. Bright, sweet, tangy tomato flavor enhanced with just enough of their flagship cheese to make it interesting and give it a sharp little bite. Plus the super-garlicky croutons? That was a near perfect bowl of soup. I may have heard angels singing in the background. Then again, maybe someone just forgot to turn their iPod off nearby. Service was pretty great - friendly, relaxed, and accomodating. I asked if the soup came with bread or crackers, and regardless of whether it did or not (I'm still not clear) the waitress made sure to bring me some crackers to go with. Because, hello, can you really have tomato soup without crackers? My inner 8 year-old says, no. The space was dark-ish, but interesting, with fun, quirky art. The two guys sitting at the next table remarked that my soup smelled amazing, but expressed surprise that I hadn't ordered the 'amazing' mac & cheese. Maybe next time. I would not have missed having that soup. I know. I'm waxing rhapsodic over soup. All I can say is, if you're surprised, it's because you haven't had a bowl of it yourself. Here's hoping other items on the menu make me just as happy on future visits.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I lived in the south for 3 years and ate in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia and personally I would call this a good Yankee take on southern cooking - the brunch is good and the portions are HUGE if that is important to you. The cornbread is OK for Yankee cornbread - nothing special. however I was served a giant pork chop which was bloody near the bone (and we are talking deep red, not just pink or pinkish)  from the dinner menu and I sent it back. I love very rare beef  but pork has to get to 145 degrees internally to be safe and at that temp it will be pink but not bloody. I don't see why you would serve a pork chop that big anyway - it is , in my opinion, excessive and vulgar and besides it is difficult cook properly - if you are going to serve 'stunt' dishes  you really need to know what you are doing or you just end up looking stupid. They agreed that it was undercooked but by the time they corrected it my friend was finished eating so I asked them to just pack it up. My companion's trout was OK - just standard. They put some onion rings in the takeout bag but  didn't offer us anything on the house while I waited for attempt #2 at cooking pork - or a discount or voucher seeing as they made a mess of our meal. We left the waiter a standard tip because it wasn't his fault the management is clueless but it was really kind of shocking to put up with this kind of crap in such a well known place that charges $26 for a pork chop. The staff seemed nice and I felt badly drawing attention to the poorly prepared meat but our dinner there was not a pleasant experience.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There aren't any restaurants like this from where I'm from, so it was a great dining experience. It was busy for brunch so we had to wait at the bar. We had coffee and mimosas at the bar and then proceeded to a lounge in the back where there were complimentary pastries! The bartenders were really nice and helpful too.

"The food was fantastic!  The onion soup is unlike the gooey French style you're used to, but it was incredible.  The ""chopped salad"" wasn't chopped at all, but contained chunks of heirloom tomatoes, avocado, cukes, and beans in a light vinaigrette - delicious! The atmosphere is noisy and busy - don't go if you hope to have an intimate conversation, especially if there's a large party seated nearby, as the noise reverberates, and it's nearly impossible to be heard without shouting above the loud voices nearby.  Also, on the night we were there the air conditioning was making the place frigid, and even with sweaters we were miserably cold.  An hour later, after requesting that they turn up the temperature a bit, it did start to become more comfortable. Service at our table was clearly inexperienced - no milk or cream was offered for either tea or coffee, but our waitress was otherwise friendly and competent - just a little shaky on the details.  More attentive management could have solved this problem. I know it sounds like I didn't like this place, but I actually do.  Great food is a perfect place to start, and with a few adjustments it will be a good place to have an evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Amazing food in a rustic looking tribeca restaurant.  Maybe not the most romantic of restaurants, but you'll fall in love with the food if not the person sitting in front of you.

"We have been to both Tony D's many times however, this time we brought friends that have never been.  We made early reservations on line for 4:30 pm. at 43rd St.. We arrived at 4:15 and the hostess checked our reservation and seated us immediately.  We ordered two orders of the mussels FraDiavlo and they were huge and better than I remembered!  Plenty of tangy sauce with just the right amount of heat to dip the crusty italian bread into!  The bread is excellent and the mussels were even better.  We ordered two veal dishes and one pasta dish.  Veal Parmesean and Veal Marsala then Vodka Rigatoni.  All were excellent and prepared perfectly.  The veal was tender the sauces great and the pasta cooked perfectly!  If I had to make a suggestion it would be to go early!  By 5:15 pm the place was full and there was a line on Saturday night.  As we have been to both locations we like them equally as well.  The food quality is exactly the same.  I don't know where these other reviewers have been going in ""Little Italy"" but I have been to many places there as well and for the price, you can't beat Tony D's!!

"A great idea but poorly executed. I love bacon, but the strips you get with the flight are a bit sad. They come on a slate and there's two slices of each type, but it just looked so flimsy and inconsistent in cooking time. Also, the beers they have are not ""craft"" but more of just common, mainstream ones (Brooklyn lager is probably the best beer they have on tap). Don't come expecting anything awesome, you're just getting flavored, thin-sliced bacon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Eggs Benedict (and every egg dish) come with thin crispy fries that taste great, and are awesome when dipped in the yolk/hollandaise sauce.

"I'm glad I read through these reviews before I went because otherwise, I'd be lost! I'd recommend going at an uncommon meal time...like 4:30 pm on a Saturday...if you'd like to sit at one of the restaurants.  It's broken down into a seafood only restaurant (literally only seafood), vegetable only, and pizza/pasta.  Then they have their steakhouse type restaurant which I believe has a little of everything.  We went on 4:30 pm on a Saturday and were seated in a second and enjoyed some amazing food!  Luckily, my boyfriend and I both really enjoy seafood and had some delicious sashimi pieces, mussels and whole fish bass.  The seasonings were flavorful and it was all cooked perfectly.  The atmosphere was also sort of a fun maze once you figured out how it all worked. If you can't choose between the restaurants, there's a standing-only bar area where you can order tapas-style dishes and wine.  It's a bit of a mish-mash, but if you're not in a rush and can stand the discovery part of it all, it's a great experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"It's all about context. If you're looking for fresh, simply prepared seafood at a reasonable price this is one of the best places I've been to in the COUNTRY, yea I said it... I love the mix of people here and the market style vibe. I like to eat-in. After ordering from the young lady up front you bring your drinks back to a table. (Tip: If it's busy take a look at the menu before you go and have one person order and one person keep an eye on tables opening up.) In a few minutes you'll have fresh seafood at your table. If you are interested in eating in courses I reccomend ordering them seperatly; they tend to bring everything out as it's ready which could be all at once. Favorite thing here: Scallops (Fried), Rice, anf fish (Broiled or Fried) and Steamers (Long Neck/Ipswich Clams) The soups are fresh and the best I've had in the area but not the greatest...

"Been here a few times and was never too impressed. I have my opinions on who has the best roast pork, but my coworkers would never agree. They always insisted DiNics was the best even after we went to some of my favorite places. I finally figured out why this was happening... If you go here you have to get the pulled pork, not the plain roast pork. The cheaper roast pork is sliced and while decent it is not mind blowing. The pulled pork is shredded right in front of you and thrown on the roll. Pulled pork had a way better taste and you get some nice little skin bits and stuff as well (I got an end piece mmm). With the sharp prov and rabe this sandwich may be a contender for #1 in Philly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I had to return here so I can give a proper review. My first time here months ago, I just had drinks and the french fries...this after eating and chatting at Chifa's. So I didn't want to review it then because I didn't really have enough of an experience (tho what I had was good) to write a review. I returned here for drinks with the gf because I already scooped out the happy hour menu during my first visit. We sat by the bar downstairs. the funny thing abut this place is that it always has that ""empty look"", like no one is there but don't be deceived...because inside it's actually a nice place to meet with a group of people without having to worry about yelling your conversations to each other. Our waitress by the bar was very nice and non-imposing at all. I had the mango drink which was delicious as I love sweet things. I then had the rum punch (which was the special cocktail of the day) that was very good also. We also ordered the dry wings (had the sauce on the side) and the cheesesteak spring rolls...we ordered 2sets actually. Then someone else across the bar ordered the bread budding and was gracious enough to let us taste it....it was delicious ofcourse we ordered our own. Down side was that they didn't have ice cream and I wanted ice cream. Instead we settled for whipped cream. It was really nice and i can def see myself coming back just to chill, have drinks or have a quick dinner bite(try other items on the menu). I def am a fan of the wings, not the best wings in the world but def better than a lot of places.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We dine here frequently. The restaurant uses fresh, local ingredients in French-inspired recipes that change with the seasons. The ambiance and service are superb. We particularly enjoy eating on the deck in the non-winter months. (It is also the perfect place to sit during the Quechee Balloon Festival--Father's Day Weekend.) The service is always first-rate. Adam, mentioned in other reviews, is always gracious and welcoming. His wife, Alex, is the chef who designs the delectable menu. During the winter, I love the Osso Buco, but my husband always gets the salmon, which is terrific as well. We both adore the olive tapenade that they serve with the bread. The only drawback to the Parker House is the cost. It is not easy on the wallet. However, the price is in keeping with the food quality and service, particularly in this tourist area.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Empanada Mama is another good place in Hells Kitchen to help absorb all that late-night alcohol. There's almost always a line late at night with people grabbing take out orders or waiting to sit at the few tables. Last weekend after midnight my friend Nathan and I stopped by because we couldn't find a decent pizza place. Empanada Mama is much better than scarfing a pizza! We sat at a table next to the door but it was too cold, so the nice waiter separated some tables for us further inside. Let me just say, Yuca Frita with guacamole sauce is an awesome combo! Fresh cassava and hot out of the fryer! It was so hot that I scalded the roof of my mouth. But it was worth the burn, and soothed by the cool guac sauce! It tasted like upscale french fries. I was hungry and ordered three empanadas. My memory is vague for some reason, possibly from too many vodkas, but I know I ate a Brasil which had ground beef, olives and onions. Delicious! I think I also had a Mushroom and a Pernil, but don't hold me to it LOL. Anyway, they have a big selection and you can't really go wrong since they're less than $3.00 each.

"Grimaldi's and Juliana's Pizza Prepare for Pizza Face-off in Dumbo? Please...what a joke these two places are. I've tried both joints more than once and conclude they are almost clones of each other. To be fair Juliana's has a different taste but is it worth it? Answer : NO!  The sauce does not taste like they use San Marzano tomatos. Even the dough is not from stone ground wheat and the yeast is not from a wild variety. They use commercial ingredients to make their pizza and charge you a high price for it. If you really know what goes on behind making a pie. Then you should know the process is a long and complicated one. As a local I can say that if you really want Pizza made by real Artisans then look at WILD RISE, EMILY and Mario Batali for a start.

We got both to share. The pad Thai was sweet and aside from that no flavor. The other noodle dish had pretty much no flavor.   We also had the ""Crispy tofu"". It had zero flavor. My husband liked the sauce, but again sweet. Not my taste. I ended up piling chili sauce on my food for SOME  flavor. Maybe the other items are better but I'll never know since I can't eat them.

When I came back at around 3:15 there were about 15 people in line so I stayed in line as well. From far away, I could see people getting their hot plates and taking their pictures with the cook. The line was going really fast and these guys know what they are doing, after all it's the Halal Guys. It was my first time so I got the half chicken half lamb over rice. My God, what a plate. I couldnt even walk back to the hotel which it was only one block. My knees started to buckle, I found a bakery with an outside patio, I managed to sit but it was not comfortable. This plate of food needed relaxation. I put the plate back in the bag along with the forks and spoons and headed straight for the hotel.

"Another spot in Old Wethersfield (I think I am knocking out a review for every establishment in this area)...Been here 3-4 times since moving to Wethersfield. Will start with the positives:  Location is right in the heart of Old Wethersfield which is a plus.  They do outdoor seating which is a prime reason to come here on a beautiful summer day in Wethersfield.  Service has always been decent to good and pace has always been good with pizzas coming out when you would expect.  No looking at watches (or cell phones) wondering what the heck is going on. Actually, there really isn't any negatives.  I'm not a huge fan of their pizza, but that is due to my preference for a thin chewy crust.  Wouldn't quite call it Sicilian style, but the crust is much more doughy than what I like.  Cheese, sauce and toppings are middle of the road.  Combine the two and you have a pizza I certainly wouldn't turn away, but not a pizza I am ordering on my own. Tip:  If you're eating inside, I would recommend coming on a cold day where the warmth from the pizza oven will be a positive or dress light on a warm day.  It's somewhat of a small room inside and the heat from the ovens and other patrons always makes for a warm environment.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The pulled pork was great. Perhaps it was me, but I thought the chicken and mac n cheese could use less salt, so did the family, glad I don't have high blood pressure. Overall I'll be going there again or ordering in. *Update* I went there yesterday April 30th with a friend, ordered the pulled pork and a side of mac n cheese: Now is this some kind of cruel joke? Because I didn't notice the last time I ordered that sandwich, that it contained Cole slaw in the sandwich, talk about a crappy tasting sandwich & the mac n cheese was ""just ok"" my friend said vinegary,  I've tasted much better from kraft. By the way ewww, By far the worst cole slaw I've ever had. Considering it's suppose to leave you wanting more, I would run and not look back. Was it because I am spanish, or that my friend and I were a little drunk but respectable? or was it that we didn't care for any pie? Don't think your attitude wasn't noticeable when I declined it the 1st time. Forgive me for not wanting to spend 30+ some odd dollars on a quick dinner, for my friend and I. Regardless of what it was, I'm seeing a pattern of blatant disregard. Perhaps I'll try your chicken again in the future, but I wouldn't hold my breath on it, there are just too many, great places to eat at, in williamsburg, let alone new york city.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Had all the makings of a good spot, but wasn't. Strawberry rhubarb juice was like watery guava and as brunch went on I noticed most tables around us left 3/4 full glasses of it on the table. We ordered the starter breakfast bread which was just all right, and the most interesting piece (the strawberry ginger) was so strongly ginger flavored that it tasted medicinal. My dining companion had the frittata which had too much garlic, and I had the fried feta panini which was waaaaay too salty (feta is salty to begin with -- and then they served it on rock salted bread). The fries that came with it had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a long, long time... and they were too salty too. Felt like I'd eaten a rock. The one bright spot was that the hostess and the server were both cheery and pleasant, although service was extremely slow.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Friends & I just left the restaurant  - at home, called to say I lost a sterling silver cuff, probably there at my seat - ""Can you please go our table and look on the floor - it's bright and could be seen easily - PLEASE, it was a gift"" The hostess, on the phone, was short, & abrupt  - said she was way too busy, but would look later. I was so put off and felt so badly, I called back to ask to speak to the manager. Being put on hold, a man returned back  on the phone. He was crash and rude as can be. He said ""You lost a . . .silver bracelet? It' raining, why don't you come back and look for it - get a LIFE! Can you imagine being treated so poorly?What horrendous customer service - I was aghast.

"I have now had the opportunity to return to Village Whiskey for the burger.  ""Burger"" is such a pedestrian term to use in describing a thing of pure beauty such as this.   I ordered it medium, with a fried egg.  Some people may complain that the burger does not have any accompaniments but this is not true: after my first bite, when I unleashed what was inside, I noticed I would also be receiving a bowl of burger juice & egg yolk soup.   Delicious.  I am normally not the type to cut my burger in half, preferring to man up and eat it whole as nature intended, but I was given no choice.  Even this failed to prevent a massive mess about my person and I was soon forced to resort to eating it with a knife and fork.  My God, this burger.  Go get one immediately. If you can, that is.  Even with my predilection for extreme punctuality, which friends and girlfriends have wearily tolerated for years, I was still lucky to receive a seat.  I arrived at 11:40 am, a mere ten minutes after they opened, and sat on one of only two or three empty stools at the bar.  All the tables were full.  Small groups of people showed up before noon and were required to wait.  Wait they did, because people would start with one dish, realize how delicious it was, and just keep ordering more, extending their mealtime indefinitely.  Such is life in a newly-minted Iron Chef's restaurant, I suppose.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here last week and my friend made a reservation for a party of 4 on Savored for 7pm. We all arrive at 7pm and told the hostess that our party was all here but she said the reservation was actually for 7:30pm, which you would think they would just seat us first since we were the only party there waiting and there was a table of 4 available. However, another party (same size party) came in without a reservation and got seated before us. We were so confused and wondering how and why they would be seated first when we had a reservation. To make matters worse, we didn't get seated until 8pm. We were very frustrated with the whole situation especially since the hostess never even apologized for her mess-up. The food here was good though and the waiters were very friendly and nice. Unfortunately, we had that experience in the beginning, which might cause us to never come back here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Kefi really deserves 3.5 stars.  My major probably with Kefi is that although the service is fast, it is hasty and not attentive.  The last time I went the waitress forgot we ordered drinks, and they brought our food before we were done with appetizers.  These are just little things that wouldn't make me stop going to Kefi, but things I still notice.  Basically, this is a good place to go if you are looking to have a very efficient meal in a casual environment.  It's very loud, so don't expect to have a very peaceful, calm meal experience. The dish I like best at Kefi is the lamb shank.  The meat is very tender and falls right off the bone.  The flavors are also very nice, and it's not too salty.  I've also had the hangar steak.  This dish is great if you like variety because there are sausages, broccoli rabe, manouri, and sun-dried tomatoes.  But most of all it's a good dish if you REALLY like garlic, because the garlic flavor can be a little overpowering.  They seem to always have some lamb chop special and though I've never had it people tell me it's good, and the spinach rice with which it comes is exceptional.  The meat balls appetizer is a solid dish as well.  None of the dishes I've had are incredibly exciting, but all are prepared well, and I look forward to going back and trying more.  The portions are decently sized.  The only dessert I've had from kefi was the rice pudding, which wasn't memorable.  They have an extensive wine list as well as a selection of cocktails.  Prices are relatively reasonable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am totally a fan.  When I arrived, it was for the earlier part of dinner, around 6 on a Saturday.  The place hadn't yet filled up, and because I was on the other side of the street, I completely overshot.  It has a small entrance a few steps down, but once you're inside, you feel all warm and cozy.  In any case, a friend who knows the hood picked the spot, and I was very pleased.  We had white asparagus for a starter, wish they gave us more.  The portions were just right, but on the smaller side for someone with a large appetite.  I had the spaghetti with octopus, which was quite flavorful, but had a bit too much oil for me.  My friend had the hake, which was delicious and perfectly fork tender, and the broth was really great... I wanted to steal his dish.  As a side, we had brussels srouts, which you must try.  There were figs mixed in, it blew my mind a little.  The decor is really country-kitchen-like, with wreaths and little birds and a fun treatment with spackle on the walls.  Yes, I was admiring the walls as well.  Service was excellent and friendly.  Definitely will visit again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

During our 20 minute wait in line, we got a chance to stare at the day old rack and we ended up snagging a bag of carrot cake muffins. Our food was great and no comaints here. I had the Vermonter and my wife had the Cabot cheddar and spinach bagel with bacon and scallion cream cheese. I did receive my bagel 15 minutes after hers. Remember those day old muffins? Six hours later we split one and had to force ourselves to walk away and not eat the entire bag. They were that good.

"This restaurant seems to be catering towards non-Koreans who might not know how a real Korean restaurant is supposed to work. Charging for banchan (side dish) basics like kimchi? Ridiculous. The impression I got was that they were trying too hard to make regular, everyday, homely Korean food into some fancy dining experience. Way too much pretentiousness. The cheapest dish was $11 for some basic curry and rice, and a medium-sized dish of bulgogi cost upwards of $13. The service is poor and waiters are brisk and impersonal. Overall, overpriced and stingy - this is soulless Korean food. I DO NOT recommend.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So this seemed like it should've been a nice place. I went there today with a group of friends for brunch, based on the good reviews on Yelp. It was...... not enjoyable. The service wasn't great. We waited for a table and ended up with 7 crowded around a table that would've been a squeeze with 6. I asked for water when we sat down, and it didn't come for at least a solid 5 minutes; they brought coffee before they brought water. However, the waiter was very nice and had an Aussie accent. As for the food, I didn't really enjoy it. The avocado toast is decent, but it's really not amazing. You can easily make it at home. It's a piece of toast with avocados and red pepper flakes. I also thought it was overpriced for the portion size. I ordered the baked eggs with salmon. I ordered it medium, at the suggestion of the waiter. When the eggs came, they were definitely cooked to 'hard'; all the yolks were completely cooked. I was going to let it slide, but then after about three bites, I found a short black curly hair in my eggs. So I sent them back. The next batch I actually ate. They were decent. They came back soft, instead of medium, which was probably better. There wasn't that much salmon for the eggs, and I wish there had been bread. The flavor was nice, though. However, about 3/4 of the way through I found yet another hair! I was trying to enjoy my eggs, and it was extremely disappointing. Everyone else in my group enjoyed their food mostly, but no one raved about anything. If I hadn't had such a bad experience with the preparation, it probably still would've only been two stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I just got back from having a nice, quiet lunch here. Such a great experience! The service and food are both amazing. The entire staff is very attentive, poised, professional and warm. I had one of today's specials - the rabbit pot pie. (I would have had a glass a wine, but it was a lunch break, so I didn't get the chance to sample the vino just yet). Very happy with the pot pie. The rabbit was cooked perfect and it was very flavorful. Yes, the portion sizes are small much like the utensils and glasses, but I find it very charming and personally, I don't particularly like oversized portions. I like a petite size meal with alot of flavor that will fill me up enough without making me feel like I am going to explode. And that's what you get here. High quality without the pretension you might expect. The atmopshere is as warm as the cooking. A tad pricey, but that's the West Village for you. And honestly it's well worth it. Will definately be going back again!

"I was lucky enough to lunch at Ssam with five other greedy gluttons, so I ate my way through a solid portion of the menu. We tried buns of all kinds, more meat than I can comprehend, and everything from octopus to duck, potatoes to bacon. I could go on and on about the highs and lows of each and every dish, but let's face it: 1. I'm lazy and I don't want to type all of that out. 2. Like most clowns these days, I took photos of everything for you to see. 3. You're sick of my blathering, and just want to hear about what you should order. So here it is. Get the lamb ssam. It is explosively flavorful, perfectly tender, and everything I wanted all the other dishes to be. Not to say there weren't other highlights, but they all paled in comparison. (There were certainly a few lowlights that needed some of the hoisin-esque BBQ sauce to save them.) So get the lamb ssam. It's like the tastiest of burritos in its flatbread, and you can thank me later. Preferably with whiskey.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place was awesome!  Went there Saturday night with my family, party of 20. Usually this makes me nervous, especially since the place is so new, because usually parties this size can throw off the servers.  I have to admit these guys held their own nicely. Now to the food...delectable!  I had the catch of the day which was a Halibut served over a mushroom risotto, OMG - delish! The halibut was cooked to perfection and the risotto was a perfect compliment--tasty but didn't overpower the fish.  I tasted my wife's chicken which was brined and I must say it's probably the best I've had anywhere.  Also tasted my brothers wagyu steak and man was it good,really flavorful. The drinks were awesome and owners Dan and his brother, chef Sean couldn't be any more delightful--Thanks guys for bringing this to my old hood.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I really like coming here.  On my last visit, the staff was friendly, attentive, and made knowledgeable recommendations for food and wine.  I thought my entree and glass of wine were very fairly priced.  I could nitpick about their bread (fresh and warm, but not necessarily exciting), but this was offset by a wonderful olive plate.

"I've been here twice now. Both times I sat outside which I loved because the street is quiet unlike 7 Ave. The first time I went, I came with my bf. We ordered the prosciutto on brushcetta with fig jam and gorgonzola cheese to start. It was good. Not sure if I would pair these all together normally but it was good. For entrees, my bf ordered the short rib beef pappardelle and I ordered the clams and linguine in white wine. He thought his was okay. I really enjoyed my dish though. We also ordered the chocolate cake with chocolate sauce center with whipped cream and that was delicious! Then again you can't go wrong with chocolate. A few days later I came back for dinner with friends and ordered the beef pappardelle and loved that dish. Guess it depends on your preferences. My friends enjoyed their entrees as well (they both ordered the ravioli). Also the bread the 2nd visit was so much better. Might have been because we came early during dinner service and not later at night. Overall a great dining experience and good prices, food and service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here twice. The first time, the food was great and the service was awesome. The second time, the food was great and the service was poor. Common denominator = great food. The salsas have depth, but I wish they were a little chunkier. The vegetarian veggie tacos are fresh and good but will leave you hungry- even if you add the cheese and some pricey chunks of avocado. The tempeh bacon is smoky and sweet, but it's tempehness still can't be masked- so no trying to trick your carnivore bf into thinking it's real. The vegetarian bean tacos I had at dinner were really delicious and filling. They were stuffed with tasty Mexican rice, flavorful whole beans, and salty cotija cheese and topped with some fresh lettuce and tomato that gave them some crispness. Their corn tortillas don't seem homemade, but they get away with it when the filling is that good. When we went, they had a special mahi-mahi fish taco. I was skeptical seeing that it was rolled in a flour tortilla and I'm partial to corn tortillas, but they were delicious- just a little spicy, a little creamy, a little crispy, and a lot fresh tasting. Not your standard fish taco but one worth trying. If the service were more consistent, I would give it one more star.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So I live in Mass, but my fiancé brought me here (multiple times now) claiming it was the best pizza in the world. Now I don't know about the best pizza in the world, but I have to admit it is some of the best pizza I have ever had. We love the margarita and the simple, yet delicious, original tomato. The pizza is extra crispy and is always served up fast. We also love getting the liters of soda here because its made at a local beverage co nearby! It is also in a great location in downtown New Haven which makes it great for a night out or to get dessert at Libby's right next door! Cons: It is ALWAYS mobbed here, unless you go right at open (11) or randomly during the week. This may seem picky, but the napkins here are horrible lol They basically have no purpose.

"I was torn between giving Ippudo 1 star or 2 stars. I wish I could give it a 5 like everyone else, but that'd just be a dishonor to the true Ippudo in Japan. (hint hint*if you've had Ippudo in Japan, DO NOT COME HERE) I went with my parents and my sister, the 4 of us went in around 1:15 pm, put our names down, and the hostess said the wait will be around 20 minutes. So we went walked around the corner and came back at 1:30. The hostess said we'd be next. But we ended up eating at 2:30 pm. How did this happen Ippudo?? The hostess said there's 3 tables that are done eating, done paying, so they're just waiting for them to leave. Meanwhile, parties of 2-3 were being seated constantly. At one point we almost thought about just eating separately. When we finally went in, we were surprised to see so many parties of 2 occupying tables that could fit 6-8 people easily. So then we knew, the hostesses were idiots. They just don't know how to seat people properly. We ordered as soon as we sat down, because we've had an hour and a half to stare at the menu. 1. The ramens were expensive. Close to $20 if you get a side of rice with it too. In Japan, you can get that for $7. 2. They tasted awful. AWFUL. We got the shiromaru and the akamaru to test if they're up to standards, and they weren't. We started out thinking that's it's good, and realizing in the next second that we were just hungry as hell. The noodles were mealy and bland. The broth was too salty and dense. Tonkotsu broth is supposed to be rich and kinda dense, but not so dense that you feel sick in your stomach feeling like you just drank cement. The chashu in the pork was so unpleasant. It smelled/tasted like it's been in the freezer forever and thawed incorrectly. It's got that meat smell, old meat that's been there for too long and they try to cover it up with spices but didn't work so it's worse. All of our bowls were more than half full when we sat there disappointed, not moving our chopsticks. The waiter asked what's wrong, we told them what's wrong, and they said ""no that's just the way we make our ramen"". Now excuse me for the language, but that's SUCH SHIT. My family's been to Ippudo in Japan a million times (so much that we've eaten at Ippudo 7 times a week before we discovered Ichiran), and the service/food/atmosphere between Ippudo NY and Ippudo JP is just heaven to hell. The only decent tasting thing we ordered (and we ordered a LOT because we were starving), was the hirata buns. The pork in the hirata buns were better than the chashu. That's the effort they should've put into making the chashu for the ramen. The bowls were on the small end as well. If it was good, I wouldn't pay close to $20 for it either. Ippudo NY, you are such a let-down. You're embarrassing to the ramen world.  I trust that there's better ramen in NY, it's a shame I didn't get to try any. I hated this place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I digress...in my opinion the burgers are pretty decent and I personally am a pretty big fan of the shakes especially the racially harmonious black and white.  The fries are a skip for me.. I personally think SS should send one of their fifty minions they have scurrying around the kitchen down to 5 guys and get some proper fries.

"Went here on a sunday afternoon when other restaurant are closed between lunch and dinner. Appreciated them being open. We were able to get a table for 6 and 2 dogs pretty quickly even with it being the weekend before classes start. Service was a little stuttery, but overall alright. We were able to sit outside and it was pretty hot and we were provided with some water pans for the dogs. The section in the shade was closed. Another table complained that they had that section closed and would not seat anyone there. Food was good, but took a very long time for some wraps, a salad, and a burger. I got a ceasar salad with teriyaki chicken with cheese fries on the side. All of it was pretty good. The cheese fries def sat out for a little while but I enjoyed them. Everyone like the food, but we were there entirely too long. They did accomodate a rushed order for one of us who had to leave early. All in all, not bad, service and wait time was the only real detriment. I have been here a couple of times when I went to college in the area. I had a glass fo their own root beer which was pretty good but not as good as what I got at the farmers market the prior day.

"I have had the pleasure of eating Indian food in different cities all over the country, but I can honestly say that most pale in comparison to my experiences at Karma.  I've been coming here for years since I was introduced to this little hidden treasure by my college roommate, and although the restaurant has undergone many changes over the years in ownership, decor and service (for the better!), one thing has remained the same - the food is exceptional! If you're looking for authentic Indian cuisine served by warm, friendly staff in a great location, then look no further.   I have so many favorite dishes here, so I have to recommend that you try as many as you can! The lamb vindaloo, the saagwala, the chicken tikka masala (a staple!) are all amazing - and the naan is simply the best. I just went back for dinner this past weekend with my brother who was in town from Chicago, and despite being a pretty tough critic when it comes to food, my brother was absolutely impressed with Karma as well.  The waiters were so friendly and attentive, and one of the owners actually came over to our table to introduce himself and make sure we were enjoying everything and having a good time - we honestly had no complaints!  Like I said, the amazing food has been what always kept me coming back for more, but it seems like they are turning over a new leaf with the new ownership and even better service.  I am excited to see what is to come, and happy to say I'll be a loyal patron for years!","[0.0, 1.0]"

We (seven of us) checked out La Piazza, where you grab a spot as it become available and stand at the bar height tables to be served (the wine helped the experience).

The bartender was an absolute sweetheart and my waiter was kind and attentive.  The decor isn't anything to write home about, but you're not there for that, are you? You know you're in for something good when you want about 12 things on the menu and really have to agonize over what you want.  Add to that the fact that there were at least 4-5 specials that sounded equally delicious and it was a tough choice. I had the sausage and figs appetizer and one of the specials, a garlic crusted salmon with tomatoes and crab meat.  The sausage and figs was a really interesting introduction.  I found it just a tad too sweet for me, but the figs were absolutely fantastic and the sausage flavorful.  I think what pushed it over the line was the balsamic sauce.  Even so, I ate the whole thing.  Let me say again that the figs were incredible.  The salmon was pretty darn incredible as well.  Everything was fresh, perfectly seasoned, balanced, and the crab meat was present in huge chunks.  So nice, since a lot of places tend to skimp on the crab. Prices are reasonable and the portions won't leave you feeling like a beached whale for the rest of the night.  Definitely felt like great, traditional family food.  I will go again to try the other 11 things I wanted!","[1.0, 0.0]"

My main advice: don't eat lunch before if you visit and wear stretchy pants. Pace yourself with eating the dishes. Everything is so good you want to finish it all, but if you do you won't have room for the next course, or the one after it. We ended up having to take home the fruit course and the pastries.

"I have to give it 5 stars because it deserves 5 stars. It's an outstanding restaurant. I've never had a bad experience with the food, drinks, service or ambiance. I must have eaten here 20 times or so, which considering that I only live a few blocks away, is a real shame. The reason is that it's usually just too crowded and I'm not one to wait long for a table. I can't hold that against 5 Leaves though. They're hot and they always do their best to accommodate my girlfriend and I. The menu is incredible. They really put a lot of thought into and have brought something new to the neighborhood and presented it in a unique and inspiring fashion that only makes you want to return soon. I love the ricotta with honey comb appetizer and the chicken entree. It's just chicken but it's done so well that you feel as if you're eating some exotic delicacy. I had the whole fish once too which came out great. My girlfriend simply loves the burger and truffle fires. It's pretty much the only time she'll ever eat a burger. They have great cocktails and great service. The servers are not the type to kiss ass, which I appreciate, but rather just be themselves and infuse their own personality into their job. Again, I can't say enough good things about them. It just goes to show that when a restaurant really tries they can be so successful. I'm happy for them even if it means that I can't always get a seat.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pho @ Xe Lua is great! I'd recommend it highly. The portions are very large, the prices cheap, and the quantity of meat is very generous. I believe it was $6 for a large bowl and $7 for an extra large. The brisket here tastes amazing and it is cut into large pieces. And lastly, if you end up ordering the shrimp spring roll appetizer, here's a tip. Mix in a fair amount of sriracha into the peanut sauce before eating! It can be a little packed there, but service is so quick, they always find room to accommodate you (there is extra seating upstairs). The only real downside would be parking. It can be hard to find street parking, but the place gives a discount if you park @ one of the garages. Just show your ticket to the owner of the restaurant and he'll stamp or mark it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And that texture really adds a whole lot to the sandwich, so I was bummed out. Then I had the corn next and I can't even believe how over cooked the corn was. Also, it was in the middle of summer, how could the corn be tasteless, not even creamy or sweet, it was just disappointing. I hope they are not going downhill. I'm trying to open up my own business in Boston and I would hate to see a good business go down from consistency. They were awesome before, what happened to you now? I'm not sure we would be back though. With all the places we could try in nyc in a short time, I think I'd rather spend my money on something else from now on.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here for a Tuesday night dinner at 6:30 pm and I surprised that there was no line.  It's been a while, so I didn't know they moved buildings.   We ordered a plain pie and a pie with sausage and pepperoni.  Plain pie was delicious but toppings on other pie were just okay.  The service and interior decor were okay.  Don't expect much, its a pizzeria.   I would recommend coming here and then spending some time enjoying the views at the pier at Brooklyn bridge which is right down the street.  The two pies were $40 which included tax and tip.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I love ramen and I really like this restaurant! We came in on a Thursday around 1PM. The atmosphere and decor of the place was really nice, and the food comes out pipping hot in the bowl. It stays hot even to your very last bite of noodles or your very last sip of soup. I got the miso ramen ($15) with a side of egg ($2). It's actually pretty pricey for ramen. I've had just as good ramen in Los Angeles (and they give you more pork meat with a side of egg) for $10, but this isn't Los Angeles it's New York City. Tea is given after your meal. Every time a group gets seated or ramen is being served to someone, the whole staff just starts shouting something in Japanese- or so you think it's Japanese. My friend speaks Japanese and it's just funny when she tells me that some of them are actually saying something in Japanese while others are just shouting something in gibberish. Haha... My friend had a bad experience with the service here when she came with a group of people on a Saturday. I'm glad she decided to give this place a 2nd try when I came to town.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I came here with my wonderful friend Mimi, and did not expect to love my food. I followed Mimi's lead, and ordered rice and black beans and platanos. I was surprised to find that the food was so flavorful, rich, and delicious. I basically inhaled it. I wish they would open a location in San Diego! But maybe not, because I'd gain 80 pounds.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was skeptical about eating in an urban outfitters and the fact that the sign is barely visible almost had me miss this place all together. Im glad i didn't. After we were promptly seated and poured our water, we were told the chef recommended sharing. We complied. Our server was extremely knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer all the questions we fired at him. The first item we had was the fermented celery broth. sounds strange, but the flavors totally work. Although i thought the dish was missing something (couldn't put my finger on it), i would recommend it. Next was the bacon wrapped matzoh balls. A must order. They were better than my grandmothers, but then again, she wouldn't wrap hers in bacon. After that we had the beef tongue. This blew my mind. The tongue was melt in your mouth tender, the tomato romesco sauce tangy, and the croutons crunchy and citrus-y. I debated to my self if i would come back alone the next day to have it again. For our final course, we had the lamb neck with risotto oats. Although the portion size was huge, we could not finish it, and it was quite a heavy dish, it was impeccably cooked. The oats were super creamy, and the finish of mint added the slight lightness it need to not be too heavy. We liked everything so much, we decided to truck through one dessert. We opted for the chocolate brownie with onions. Although strange (my two companions enjoyed it more then i did), it was good. The stand out being the charred scallion ice cream. In short: Great service, great cocktails, great food. Highly recommended. Im glad this was my first Yelp review","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Everything about Perry St is amazing from start to finish.  Perry Street represents the JGV brand well with outstanding food and incredible service at a much lower price point than you would expect from a Jean Georges establishment.  The attentive wait staff provided excellent recommendations and input about the menu.  I was impressed that our waitress actually listened while we decided on our options and was proactive in the conversation rather than sitting back with the nonchalance of many waiters or even walking away like we were wasting her time.  The restaurant has a great uber clean modern look and reminds me of a West Elm or CB2 catalog. Now for food...The Crispy Poached eggs were delicious and the crispy breading on the eggs was so unique.  The dish had me at ""runny yolk"" but I don't know if I think the dish warrants the $29 price tag.  Obviously you are paying for the caviar but I don't think it necessarily was the crucial component. I also have the crispy calamari, the chili crab dumplings and the rice-cracker crusted tuna. All of the starters were excellent as Perry Street's ingredients are unmatched.  Of those three, the tuna was my favorite and my personal recommendation if you are looking for one starter for your meal. As entrees I split the fried chicken and the short ribs.  The fried chicken comes as two boneless pieces (breast and thigh) of incredibly succulent and juicy fried chicken.  The skin is extremely light yet amazingly crispy while the actual meat is wonderfully flavorful with a refreshing lemon burst.  It was served some ramps that added a nice spicy kick.  For me the short ribs were the star of the meal. The meat was incredibly tender and chewy with a ridiculously good glazed and crusty outside char.  It was served over a parsnip puree and with pears that were an excellent contrast to the meat with their crunchy texture and sweetness. Perry Street is a class act and I will definitely be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What is there to dislike here? Great value, convenience and selection. There were so many tasty looking dishes to choose from.   No, it's not a real 'restaurant' but a self serve lunch spot. I am not a connoisseur of Korean food but what I had was delicious...and the place was packed with Koreans. I loved the kimchi and veggie pancakes and the bulgogi. It was clean, efficient and the staff was tending to the food carefully. I would DEFINITELY return to this spot for lunch when I am in the neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is totally magical inside. You could totally miss it when you walk by on the street, the exterior is subtle and the sign is tiny. Advice: look carefully, so that you actually do go inside and enjoy the delightful interior. There is a literal tree growing in the middle of the restaurant. Like a large tree that they built the restaurant around. So that's awesome. You feel like you're in some garden-sanctuary-greenhouse turned cafe, with the tree in the middle and all the lush plants around. The service is friendly but a bit confusing. Our waiter didn't speak much English and he pointed us towards the sandwich-soup-salad combo on the menu, instead of us each getting our own sandwiches. Because this combo comes with two sandwiches. I asked him if the combo sandwiches and salad were the same size as the regular order ones and he said yes, but when our order came they were half-sandwiches and the salad was tiny. With tax and tip we only paid $16 for lunch for two of us, but we left hungry. People's other plates looked incredible, and I think if we'd ordered right this would have been a 5-star experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love the short rib ragu here. The panna cotta and the marscopone cheesecake. YUMMY! The artichokes are fun. The octopus is very good (I think it was better a Babbo though). The cod is also very good. I've never had a problem with the service and they do take reservations, at least for graduation weekend.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place reminds me of all those family vacations of mine to places like Disney World where we'd pack and sneak in Kati rolls instead of eating at the overpriced food courts. Ahh, nostalgia. First off, the portions aren't that big, so don't share your roll unless you really only want a snack. The lamb & chicken kati rolls are what my friends and I got, but the lamb is far superior. It wasn't spicy at all, so I was a little disappointed by that. The ambience is great & you can really feel like you're on the streets of India without having to see any cattle sh*tting in front of you. Definitely hit this place up if you're a fan of affordable Desi food.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"*WEDDING CAKE SHOPPERS BEWARE* It's hard for me to believe that I'm about to write a negative review for Mozzicato's Bakery, but I'm so deeply upset and offended by what has happened to my wedding cake that I feel that I have to forewarn other people. Mozzicato's was my family's favorite bakery for over a decade (ever since we moved to central CT) and not a party went by without my family getting a fruit cake from Mozzicato's. So when I was planning my wedding there was no question as to which cake and from where I will be having for my wedding. Even though I had my special day in RI my parents drove the cake all the way from CT. Just as we were about to cut the cake I remember being super excited about the fruit cake my guests and I were about to share. I even made a little speech about the fact that we're about to have my favorite cake. As we cut the cake I realized that it wasn't what we ordered. In fact, it was a blah-type of cake with plain white filling. A type of cake one can buy in any supermarket if one doesn't care about dessert... Some of my guests tried it out of politeness, but not a single person had more than a few bites. I ended up having to order desserts from the venue we had our wedding at. A few days later I wrote a very nice email to Mozzicato's explaining what have happened and asking for my parents to be reimbursed, which I thought was more than reasonable considering that if I were a Bridezilla I would probably sue the place for ruining the best day of my life. To make long story short: I got a reply a week later asking for my phone number to resolve the issue. I gave them my phone number. Two weeks passed... No phone call. I wrote another email to the attention of the manager stating that this is no way to treat their long time costumers. It's been two more weeks. No response. I have since found another Italian bakery in the area that has a fruit cake that is just as nice (if not better). I would never be back to Mozzicato's and I want to make sure that something like this never happens to another bride. So if you're ordering a wedding cake make sure you order yours elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Like brunch at authentic brunch places? Penelope is for you. Good food, not too over priced and good service. Also great if you like to wait for 30 minutes to be seated! Hey, it's a popular place and it's in Manhattan...what do you expect? Enjoy a complimentary cup of coffee or tea while you wait. Don't like waiting, come early. I recommend the Spinach Pie (more like an egg Spanakopita). Poached eggs with smoked salmon is also a winner. Add fresh squeezed OJ, a coffee and some good friends and you've got the ingredients for a great morning.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I had a pretty good experience here the first time and it turned out 2nd time was not a charm. We waited 20 minutes for a table but that was not a problem. Then, after we got seated, it took another 10 minutes to order and another 35 minutes to finally get our food. I mean it is not a big restaurant so it was a little shocking how long it took to make pancakes and fried chicken? Fine, we patiently waited as much as we could. Finally, our food arrived and they were delicious. But there was one problem. There was a poultry metal tag on my wing! I immediately brought to our waitress' attention and she casually took my wing away without any apology or explanation. She did come back 2 minutes later to tell me that was nothing but a poultry wholesaler's tag and there was nothing wrong with it. And she would give me a new wing - without the tag. I mean, where is the apology? And even if it was simply a wholesaler's ID Tag or whatever tag that is, that surely should not be on my plate! I mean does that mean they did not wash the chicken wings thoroughly before they dipped them in batter and deep fried it? I mean the more I think about it, the more annoyed I got. I asked for the manager. Then, she said the same thing to me. I said that is fine but I think I deserve an apology. And finally she apologized a couple times. I mean shouldn't the manager be notified the situation and apologize first without us asking for her attention? I know this is not a 5 Start restaurant but this is no hall in the wall or some NYS Health Department Rating C joint either. They took the dish off the menu when we paid. But as you could see, the mood was ruined and the service was lacking the whole night. They need to improve their service, especially when you put a metal tag in one of your most famous dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Went here for the first time last night and loved it!  Had the tacos al pastor, which were really good and loaded with meat.  I could only finish two of them because I had munched on the free chips and salsa too much.  My boyfriend's al pastor burrito was huge and also great.  Excellent service.  We tried a few of the different margaritas (all of the them were tasty) and decided to try a pumpkin mojito, which wasn't terrible, but neither of us were really feeling it either.  The boyfriend finished it, but switched back to the margaritas after that and when we got the bill, we noticed the waiter had taken the drink off.  Which was really nice, considering we didnt even complain, just made the comment that we preferred the margaritas to the mojito.  I'll definitely be back here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"
