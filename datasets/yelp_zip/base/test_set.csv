"Read a review about The Marshal & was impressed by their farm-to-table concept. The small and quaint interior was welcoming & inviting. Upon sitting at the bar I was immediately greeted & offered a drink. The wine by the glass selection was decent for the small sized bar. I decided on two ""starters"" for dinner, the raw butternut squash salad & the scallops. Both came out quickly & were amazing! Shaved raw butternut squash with goat cheese, walnuts & cherries was the perfect flavor combo! The scallops were cooked perfectly & wrapped in duck bacon served with fig jelly, again, awesome flavor combinations! I was too full to enjoy dessert but no doubt it would be just as good if I decided on it. Would highly reccomend for someone looking for a unuiqe dining experience with amazing personal service! Can't wait to return on my next trip!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food here is great.  Best chinese I have found in Essex county.  The only drawback is the service, which can be lackluster at times.  Still the service has never been bad enough to prevent us from going back.  If you like spicy food, try the Volcano Chicken, very spicy and very delicious.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"First sign of good BBQ is the smell of BBQ down the block.  After parking the car I could smell the smoke.  I went for lunch.  Get there before 12 noon to miss the line out the door. Meal:  Brisket sandwich, side of mac & cheese and beans.  Also two slices of turkey. Brisket was terrific.   Mac & Cheese very good.   Beans were good but a little too sweet.   Turkey was moist and tender.  Turkey can easily be over smoked and dry and it was done just right. The sweet BBQ sauce was good and I added it at the table.   Corn bread was OK.   The sweet tea was also good. I've been to Bear's in Windsor and it was good but lacked atmosphere.  The new Hartford location has great BBQ and atmosphere.   Two negatives: 1.  The parking situation-- you have to find a metered spot or park in the garage. 2.  Price.  It was a bit pricey for lunch. This is a GREAT addition to the Hartford dining scene.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"WOW! what a surprise!. I never knew this place existed until one of my friends recommended it and I am so glad she did. This place servers excellent north indian (punjabi) food. I love their Malai Kofta, Chicken Tikka Masala and my kids cannot get enough of their chicken kebabs. Entrees do not come with rice but for the price - I am not complaining!. A great addition to Indian food in the area. Keep up the good work folks!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is decent.Not the best curry I have ever had, but it's not bad. Personally I ike my pastrami cut thin and the pastrami was too thick here. The dip itself didn't taste flavorful to me. It didn't really help with the bland sandwich. The food,price,and selection were to my distaste. This place is overpriced,small, and my coworkers and I donot recommend. Pricing is okay.I think it is a little bit overpriced.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Arancini (aka risotto balls) were so delicious. OMG, I could eat these little fried balls of goodness everyday. But really, you come here for the pizza and the pizza here is very good. We had sausage, basil, tomato, cheese. Simple ingredients. Just the way I like my pizza. The crust was SOOOOOO GOOD. AGHHHHH! I loved it. Overall the food here is great but the wait can be annoying. My paragraph rant: The wait was pretty long ~ 1hr at 830pm on a Friday. Now, I'm used to waiting and it's okay with me, but one of my pet peeves is when the host grossly underestimates the wait time. He told us 20 minutes and we ended up waiting at least 1 hr. Is it so much to ask that the host SET EXPECTATIONS properly? It's always better to undersell and over deliver. Nevertheless, I would come back to Luzzo's because the pizza is some of the best in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"
El Rey was a really fun place for happy hour. My friend and I shared a pitcher of the white sangria and it was light and tasty. We shared some guacamole which was pretty good too though their chips are a little on the thick side. Then of course we got a ton of their $1 tacos. The beef and fish were really good. The staff was nice and the ambiance was really lively. It's a popular place so make sure to go early to get a seat.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have come here to eat ever since I was a baby. I am proud to say that I have introduced both my sons and 3 of my friends (2 from out of tow, and 1 from another part of Brooklyn) to L&B, and they all loved it! First of all, the square pies are just as good as they were 20-30 years ago. Those slices are messy to eat, but that's part of the fun. The sauce on top / cheese on bottom combo is delicious, and so is the spumoni (I always get rainbow -- combo of vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio -- if I get spumoni that day). Veal parm, chicken parm, and pasta are great too, and so are their dessert options if you have a large number of people dining. If God Himself wanted pizza, He would go to L&B for their squares.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Extremely disappointing. They advertise all you can eat blue crabs from 12-4PM. We showed up at 12:20pm on a Saturday and the place was empty.

I have been to both Locations and they offer the same things at both. Good burger and fries with an amazing selection of beers on tap. I had Blue Moon ale for the first time here.

"The gnocchi was good but the service was really disappointing. Perhaps it was because our table was squeezed tightly between two others, but our server barely spoke with us. We didn't hear about any specials--the first contact with our server was, ""Ready to order?"" It was frustrating when a couple were seated next to us to watch them hear about the specials--they sounded good! I had been excited about eating here, but we won't be back--there are so many little neighborhood BYOs that there's no need to repeat this experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It was a Friday evening and raining cats & dogs. I told myself if I hadn't gone through so much trouble to make these reservations a month in advance, I would've taken a ""rain"" check. Needless to say, the food and company whet my appetite. With a group of 5, we decided to forego the tasting menu and do a family style format instead so that we could try a bit of everything -- which was a great idea. Food was delicious! The standouts for me were the foie gras soba, Washu beef short rib sashimi, miso black cod, and mac n' cheese. The staff was also very attentive. They even gave us a mini kitchen ""tour.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The pizza is absolutely fantastic.  The dough has this great nutty flavor, set off with the smoky char, simultaneously crispy and supple crust.  The fresh basil is the tits, perfect with the salty, tangy cheese. But, 2 hours for a pizza pie?!! Its just ridiculous. Never, ever, have I seen a bigger cluster**** If I were to do it again, I'd just get a slice.  Seems slice customers get served much, much faster. Just push your way up to the counter, don't worry there's no line anyway, and get your order in.","[1.0, 0.0]"

When I come in I'm always greeted by everyone standing there, my food is usually ready in the time given at the end of the call.  The only time I feel rushed is on Fridays, but you can't blame the girls because they're trying to get everyone in and out while they're food is still hot.

"Serving fishy unfresh seafood is completely unacceptable. I should have walked out when the appetizers came out.  I ordered the curry puff and calamari, and there were only two puffs on the plate and the calamari was fishy! Entrees:  Duck Pad Thai and Yellow Curry with Shrimp.  I should've realized that the seafood isn't fresh at this place from the calamari but I gave the shrimp a try.  Surprise -- old and fishy to the point where it was inedible, and the duck was also dry.   They charge extra for rice in teeny tiny little bowls -- like an unauthentic Chinese restaurant charging for tea.  The horror! I cannnot come back to this place -- I'm going to go throw up now. Do yourself a favor -- order the Thai Iced tea...then leave.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It was quite crowded for Friday evening, but still we got table for 2 immediately. I only noticed later there is upstairs also. We were not very hungry after the free tasting food at the Festival.

"3 stars but wouldn't necessarily come back here. Great date spot/nice ambiance but food is hit or miss and pricey. Sausage appetizer: OK, served with a weird ground-beef (?) sauce. Fried squid appetizer: sounded delectable but was too fried and oily. Artichoke dip appetizer: best one of the three. Artichoke and cheese dip served with toast. I only ate my own entree, which was filet mignon with caramelized onions and mashed potatoes and I have to say it was pretty good. Filet mignon was very tender and the onions added a nice punch. The Freeman's cocktail was interesting but a little on the tart side. The Northeaster was OK. Nice presentation but didn't taste that great. Overall more misses than hits.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After a week in NYC with all this mediocre no identity  fusion food going on, FINALLY a proper traditional Italian restaurant. NYC taste 10/10 (back in Italy would be 8.5/10), service 10/10, and people there were polite too with a smile and happy to attend. When we paid, they brought back the change without asking us whether we wanted the change or not (like they did in Lombardi's the night before - rude). We got the meatballs to start with, a salad with pear, a carbonara and a spaghetti al vongole. Pasta cooked to perfection as I asked for al dente. Tiramisu was nice, I prefer mine at home as I cook a lot. Montelpuciano d'abruzzo served in crystal clear glases in perfect temperature and tasted like the one I usually have in Italy and London. Atmosphere was lively meditteranean and our waiter (he had a moustache) was a typical european Italian tempered guy, asset to the restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Big portions are never a bad thing. Highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese. It comes out different every time, but that's just a sign that it's fresh and original. I've never seen or met a person who's finished the Red Velvet Pancakes, myself included. And I don't usually leave much on the plate. But stop the presses for the STEAK AND EGGS. Best I've every had. Hangar steak with scrambled eggs, they give you potatoes and toast with it. It's the perfect amount of food. The biggest trouble with this place is the wait and the waiting space.

"Review w/ pics in Blog Arriving just before 8:45PM the place was (as expected) packed, but there was an open seat for one at the bar just calling my name.  Coat and bag checked with the ridiculously cute coat-check girl I took my seat and once I declined alcohol my water glass was filled immediately and kept full throughout the meal. A few notes about sitting at the bar in January - it is absolutely fantastic to watch the cooks, especially the head chef, do their craft at such a rapid place without missing a beat. That noted, you will get elbowed by passers-by (not the staff) and every time the door opens you can fully expect a blast of cold air.  While the elbows were a tad frustrating, the air was never really a bother as I was in a sweater and the grill was damned hot, anyhow.  Service, both at the bar and at the seats, was very professional and my only ""gripe"" is that they require one to order everything at once instead of adding courses depending on hunger. Watching the chefs work I must note the music - this is a Batali restaurant and the music followed suit - a little too loud, but excellent featuring the Doors, Hendrix, The Who, and The Stones.  Arriving approximately 5 minutes after my order was placed I received a basket of bread - a crusty Italian served with a bowl of bay leaf and rosemary olive oil with about 6 whole olives.  Excellent flavor, good balance, smooth and glassy - I ate two mini-loafs of the bread and asked for some extra olives which were presented without question or charge.   Arriving shortly after I'd started working on the bread was my first dish - Duck Egg with Mojama, dried potatos, and winter truffles.  Probably the most famous dish at Casa Mono there is good reason - the egg was flawless and creamy, the Mojama salty and not at all fishy, the dried potatoes ""dry cooked"" like a baked potato but certainly not ""DRY"" and the smooth truffles lending an earthy component and their complex aroma - wowing.  Clearly an in interpretation of breakfast with the combination of eggs, potatoes, and a meat I'd eat this for breakfast anytime - and although it is still early it is the best savory I've eaten in 2010 - better than anything at Ko, A Voce, or Daniel. Telling my server that my socks were indeed knocked off my plate was collected and I went back to watching the cooks as they prepared what must have been 10 orders of Brussels Sprouts for various tables - it is apparently their #1 seller.  Arriving after approximately 15 minutes (longer than Baba O'Reily, at least) was Sweetbreads with Fennel al Mono.  Perfectly fried and piled three high, the sweetbreads were wonderful - creamy interior, crunchy exterior, no gaminess at all and melt-in-the mouth.  Set atop pan seared fennel - cooked just past perfect with a little bit of char - and topped with a reduction of golden raisins and I believe some sort of sweet alcohol - this is a beautiful dish that I'd heard mixed reviews of in the past but found to be on par with the excellent deep-fried sweetbread preparations of Chang and Symon. My final dish - and another winner - was Foie Gras with Cinco Cebollas.  Drizzled with truffle oil just prior to service and again piled high (clearly Casa Mono has an interest in vertical food) this dish was astounding.  Featuring creamy leeks, a ""flower"" of red onion, long sliced green onions, pickled cipollinis, and I believe also scallions as a base, topped with toasted bread, and then with the large portion of seared foie (smelling this cooked in front of me was fantastic) I found this dish fascinating in the same way as Savoy's preparation in Vegas - using something pungent and heavily nuanced to temper the unctuous liver instead of something sweet - and I think I may have actually liked this version better.   Prepared at the station closest to back I didn't get to see this one made aside from the torch used to caramelize the bread, Bread Pudding with Port Poached Pear and Caramel Ice Cream was the first horizontal plate of the night featuring a ""scoop"" of the pudding, a half of a warm and punchy pear, and thick-rich caramel ice cream.  While the pudding itself was excellent with hints of cinnamon, custard, and pumpkin I found the pairing with the port pear to be a tad strange until I tasted it with the bitter-sweet ice cream that sort of smoothed everything out creating an overall flavor of an alcoholic pumpkin pie - unique and good, but not as good as the savories - again, better than the desserts at Ko, though. When it was all said and done I was full but not stuffed and happily paid the bill.  Overall I must say I really enjoyed the experience and if I lived local I could see this being the kind of place to go with friends for food and drinks at night - but I also agree with Casa Mono's Michelin Star because the food, service, and experience is on par with most of Batali's other restaurants - perhaps even better.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"BEST PIZZA HANDS DOWN in the Orange and Milford area.  Anyone on here that does not like Reno's Apizza is clueless about good pie and New Haven Style pizza.  There is a reason that Reno's is the best and BUSIEST Pizza place in Orange! I know the owners and they are good people that employ students and young people from the Town.  Is the wait staff trained like a 5 star restaurant staff?  No.  But they are friendly, courteous and care about their customer base.  They put sausage on my pie once instead of meatball.  And within thirty minutes I had another pie at my door with meatball. Everyone in the area knows that one of the best pies is made at Reno's.  The restaurant is casual, friendly and a true pizza joint.  I would take some of my ""knock-around guys"" to eat in a place like Reno's.   They use fresh ingredients and they bake their pies to perfection.  BIG D knows Italian food and take it from me, you can never go wrong at Reno's.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"If you want the Steven Starr experience without needing reservations, this is the spot.  Although he tends to overdo the mood lighting in back--I could barely read the menu--the atmosphere is slick and the booths are comfy.  Their martinis are some of the best I've had...got better as I moved onto my second & third.  Everything is served family style and the waitstaff tends to bombard you with everything at once, but maybe that caters to your glutenous side.  The seared ahi plate is excellent, but difficult to share.  Continental salad is great for a big group of people, as is the crab pad thai.  The only disappointments in three trips have been the chicken satay (bland), and the desserts.  Drink enough and none of that will matter.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went to Pacifico the other night for dinner. I felt the prices were reasonable, the portion sizes were decent and the overall atmosphere was delightful. I loved the bright earth toned decorations and center pieces. I ordered the drink special and my date had the classic mojito. Both were delicious as were out calamari appetizer and dinners. I ordered a steak covered in pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic/butter sauce. It was full of flavor and cooked to my taste. My date had the seafood medley plate- both were creatively presented. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to other people who would like a laid back, but delightful time.

"As an East Coaster transplanted to the Midwest, I crave real seafood.  You know, REAL paper thin scallop sashimi still twitching, REAL actual crab still crawling until the moment of its untimely steaming and urchin so briny & sweet it will you make you shed a wee little tear. Never gonna happen in Chicago. Oh, the locals think it does and for some reason chefs keep opening ""seafood"" restaurants to much fanfare (ie GT Oyster), but guess what - they're straight up wrong.  If one were only to take a look at a map, one would notice a funny thing about the Midwest & Chicago in particular: it's about, oh, 600-700 MILES FROM THE NEAREST SALT WATER. That overpriced tiny oyster being sucked down is most likely a week old & already rackin up stupid frequent flier miles. Kinda sad in sustainability crazy 2012. All that being said, I personally have a funny habit - I try my darndest to only eat sea creatures when I am near the sea.  So on any trip back to the East Coast, I make a point to gorge myself on as much seafood as possible.  This trip was barely 24 hrs and I hit four spots, one of which was this Disneyland of Italian food, Eataly. Overall not a bad experience. A dizzying array of food choices in a supermarket on steroids can actually yield some true gems in the rough.  The urchin and raw, surprisingly nutty rock shrimp I slurped down at the seafood counter were both elegantly simple and simply spectacular. However the ""fresh"" pasta I watched being made while I did so left me disturbed.  The giant shiny Willie Wonk-ish ravioli machine resplendant with two large rolls of pasta resembling paper towel rolls seemed to be cartoonishly stamping a single raviolo out of each large sheet of dough. When I inquired with the starched white & oversized Oomp-Loompa manning the contraption, he said that because of the size & shape of this particular pasta shape (4"" square with squiggle edges), the machine could only make one at a time out of each 7"" sheet of dough.  The trimmings could not be used again because the dough would be too tough. WOW. I wonder how the little grandmas all over Italy manage without such a wondrous invention.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It's great that they have a parking lot, which was basically the deciding factor in my last minute decision to stop in. It was pretty late in the day, so I only had the 3 hot and fresh flavors to choose from. I went with the vanilla spice and cinnamon brown sugar. They were made to order, so it took a few minutes. The donuts I got were cakey, warm and surprisingly, not super greasy or overly sweet. They were delicious! I didn't get to try the chicken this time but a couple tables dining in had it and it looked so good! If I want Federal Donuts in the future, I would definitely come to this location.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mr. Dino's has been in Watchung Plaza since I was a kid, quite awhile ago. There pizza is always great. They use huge slices of peperoni. Their Sicilian is great too. They used to be across the street and had a rocking juke box (David Bowie, The Cars, even some disco). Pat and his bro have been there all along. Whenever I go back they stare hard and then bust into a smile. They have awesome sandwiches, I like the sausage parm. I would also order any of the cold subs and have them toasted, there were doing this way back in the 80s. (quiznos?). It's a Montclair tradition. If your in the plaza stop by for a slice and check out the awesome crust with the bubbles of dough.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"First off- this place is fantastic. We had a flawless meal which is more than I can say about some other some other Food Channel stars (I'm looking at you Craft). We started out with the Hiramasa Tartare and a deconstructed eggplant parm. I loved these dishes and especially the hiramasa- nice acidic cut through a creamy/ oily sauce with some cilantro. The deconstructed egg-plant was really cool with all the ingredients (bread crumbs, cheese, tomatoes standing on their own where you combine them yourself)- A+ for originality and recommend it if only for the cleverness. Main- Pork Tenderloin Parmesan and Blue Moon Sea Scallops. The pork was smoked with a side of canellini beans covered with a fried egg in a garlic broth. Fantastic. The Sea scallops were perrfectly cooked  and covered in a fantastic garlic sauce. There was some fennel sausage sprinked in over the scallops and made a perfect combo. Both dishes were very hearty: comfort food comes to mind. Desert- apple pie souffle- lets just say it was tasty. Perfect texture, freshly prepared. If you order this you'll have to wait like 20 minutes but it's worth it if you are of the souffle persuasion. Bottom Line: I really recommend this place. The iron chef was actually there preparing meals!!! How often do you see that??? It's a little dark in the dining room. The cocktails are STRONG. The only thing keeping it from being five stars is that it's in NYC where Le Berardin and Gramercy Tavern are. That's stiff competition and I think Forgione will eventually get to that level.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And trust me, you'll need it because you won't want to stop the flow of delicious cocktails. I recommend the baked herbed crouton, pork sandwich or grilled cheese with truffle oil. If you're not such a drinker, step upstairs for a light brunch, benedict salad or french toast on a stick. Enjoy the large selection of wines, also reasonably priced.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Normally my palate is a bit overwhelmed by Brooklyn's Jamaican/Caribbean  food offerings. Normally the heavy use of seasonings leaves me choking for air or a careening into my kitchen for more water if I come across an especially bad cook who (all to often) tend to rely on pepper  to mask a horror show of a meal - but not today. Having made my commute in one piece I decided I was a bit too lazy to cook . I had passed The Islands on many a hot night , shamefully ducking my thrifty ass in the neighboring Chinese food store, but today with my twenty in hand I nervously entered and ordered some Curry Chicken with Plantains. The woman who ran the shop was friendly in that particularly Caribbean way ; that is, she is very kind but ultimately disinterested with strangers until they become regular faces I'm guessing . Used to Caribbean portions, I noticed my meal had a little bit of extra poundage on it; a definite sign of quality rice. My arm almost got tired carrying it and I got a small!The rice was nicely balanced by the meat, and everything was lush and frag rent. I was skeptical but after I put the first bite into my mouth all I could do was dance..dance and moan in delight!! The heat in the curry was just right, the rice was lighter then I expected and the chicken fell off the bone fresh! Anyone can make chicken fall off the bone, but a place that can do that FRESH at $8 while keeping that level of spice and quality they have is rare!

"I have read great things about Maialino and was really looking forward to trying it out.  But overall, the restaurant was just ok.   This is what had: BREAD: The bread basket had a good variety of breads, with the pizza bianca being my favorite, but the others (breadsticks and another) were not memorable.   PRIMI: The two of us split the spaghetti alla carbonara.  The texture of the spaghetti was good, but the dish was SO salty that I could taste nothing else.   ENTREE: For our entree, we had the maialino al forno, which was supposed to be the highlight of our meal.  It was ok, but definitely not the best that I have tried.  The skin was chewy, not crispy.  And while I understand that great ingredients don't need to be overwhelmed with seasoning, the meat could have benefited from some seasoning (aside from salt).   DESSERT:  For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake dessert (forgot the real name) with buttermilk ice cream.  This, I liked.  And I don't even like flourless chocolate cake.   Service-wise, our waitress was professional.  Not too friendly, but then again, that's not her job.","[0.0, 1.0]"

There is something unappetizing about eating a meal plated that quickly, especially when you realize that it's because everything is precooked- ever eaten stale thick-cut bacon? Don't. For the first time in my life, I left bacon on my plate.  The mushrooms were rubbery (understood- this happens when mushrooms are stale).   Fyi, an egg dish should not be served on tough to cut sourdough.

"We came here for Valentine's Day after making reservations two weeks prior. The restaurant has a very lovely rustic feel to it. It was a bit dark for me the night we came but still warm and romantic.   The man escorting everyone to their tables, who I assume was the manager was very good to us. He was attentive, alert and friendly.  He immidiately took our coats and had us seated.  Once we were there I think he noticed that my husband and I were seated in a bit of a tight spot between two other couples, (I am 8 months pregnant and my husband is 6/2 with a football player's build) and he kindly offered us a table for four since that table wasn't reserved till 9:30. The seats & tables are very close to eachother.  We greatly appreciated that. Our server was great.  He was a tall blonde gentlemen with an accent.  He checked in on us often. He took our order and we recieved it as ordered (our churasco skirt steaks were cooked to our asking.  He was very friendly and attentive.  Our water was always filled and my husbands drinks came when he asked them to arrive during the meal. As far as the food goes, we were both disappointed.  Not because the food was bad but because it wasn't anything too extraordinary or wowing.  We had expected from  the popularity of the restaurant and the pricing that the food would be mouth watering, and it was just good.  I had the octopus appetizer and was disappointed in how charred it was, and how much the sauce tasted like just plain mayonaise. My husband's lobster bisque  was delicious.  The warm bread they give in the beginning was nice.  We had the churasco skirt steaks for an entree and the flan for dessert. My appetizer and the two entrees were pretty small portions.  The steaks were a bit small compared to photos we had seen but were pretty tasty. The flan was delicious.   Overall, I like Tabare.  I think its a beautiful restaraunt, the service is excellent and the food is well done and tasty.  However, for a $135 night I don't know that the food is worth that high of a price.  Perhaps, the crowded restaurant made consistency difficult to keep up.  We don't mind paying that I just don't think the food was worth the money.  I wouldn't mind returning and trying the food again because the place is beautiful and the service is fantastic.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Okay if you are going to go to a creperie in NYC this place is hands down the best for savory crepes. Not only do they have interesting options but the way they make them is absolutely delicious. I just have never tasted a savory crepe this good. Plus, you get authentic French/Northern African wait-staff. -La Bergère (goat cheese, rosemary, figs, caramelized onions): very creamy, fresh and surprisingly very savory. The caramelized onions and figs give a nice sweet contrast but not overly sweet at all. In fact this is less sweet than the shrimp with curry. The rosemary really gives it a fantastic kick. LOVE IT!! -Shrimp Curry (small shrimp, curry, spinach, onions): It's quite sweet and not too heavy but creamy. The shrimp and spinach are fresh and plentiful.  I liked it a lot and certainly waaay more than I thought I would. FINAL VERDICT: if you are looking for a lazy afternoon lunch (service isn't fast), amazing crepes and adorable atmosphere, head on over to this gem in Williamsburg.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Awesome restaurant find! Very lively atmosphere, even when we sat down at 10:30pm on a Saturday. All of the food was amazing, and the service was top notch. The waitress brought us a free plate of steak, and she didn't even charge me for a drink I ordered and didn't like. They really want you to have a great experience.

"Erm. BLERGH. Ahh. I swear, the noises that will escape you during your experience here will surprise you. My friends fiancee was having his Bachelor party (that my guy was at), so we decided to have a little messy fun of our own. We actually walked 2 miles here (we needed to work up an appetite) and got here 15 mins after it opened: already was almost full in the back and only 2-3 tables were open. If you can, come before normal dinner rush hours... this place gets packed after 7/8pm. We kicked things off with a bottle of Sauv Blanc - tip: its New Zealand, which is my personal favorite. All their bottles of wine are $28 - not bad! Tip: Get a full glass down the hatch before you begin crackin' as your hands get juicy and youre so obsessed with your meal that you don't touch your wine for an hour. We ordered the 6 oyster appetizer: the mignonette sauce was vinegar and full of chopped shallots.. the red cocktail sauce had a nice little horseradish kick. Our oysters were plump and fresh. We kicked things off with a C combo (crawfish and a dungenous crab), as well as a full pound of king crab legs. All combos come with a teeny piece of corn and a few halved baby potatoes. We got it medium spicy: it you like spice, start here (anything hotter and you probably wont be able to taste the seafood). Because we are 5'3"" and full of spunk, we challenged each other to split one more effing dungenous.. that baby was tough to fit in whatever stomach space we had left, but oh-so-worth-it.  I was licking my fingers, my palms, and my elbows (JK!) by the end of the meal. This place is CASH only, so come prepared (pricing for meals is listed on their website so you can plan accordingly. My advice: bring twice as much cash as you think youll spend here). And - when you walk there, make sure you Have your UBER driver waiting for you our front as you finish... trust me, youre walk back home will be painfully blissful.

"While this place has a great atmosphere and great beer, it has the worst service and the food is appalling. The service is painfully slow and disorganized. It always takes 30-40 minutes (even when slow) for even appetizers to come out of the kitchen. And then they serve one of our party of 5 first, like 10 minutes before anyone else. Just awkward. I could chalk that up to the kitchen's fault, but the waitstaff is nonapologetic and sometimes rude. Maybe that has to do with dealing with drunk rednecks all the time, but if a customer is nice, please be nice. I have a hard time justifying much of a tip at this place. And the food is really not very good. They have some things that sound good, but they really don't execute, nor do they use good quality food. This makes for everything to be dissatisfying and over priced. Come here for the beer. Forget the food. Even the fries are typically overdone and gross.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Without a doubt Ippudo creates ramen the way it's meant to be. Food: 5 Stars There are few ways to describe the food at Ippudo and I can't think of any other than delicious. The chicken and/or pork buns are a must have for starters. The amount of spice and flavor that blends with the chicken/pork the lettuce and even the bun itself is amazing. To the people who have phobias of spicy food, it is time to convert and eat this splendid dish. Even if you come here only to try the buns the trip is worth it. I have only tried about 1/4 of the starters in the many times I have been to Ippudo and you can't go wrong with any of them from the buns to the Shishito. Of course what would a ramen place be without the ramen itself? After trying all, but one of the ramen dishes (except the Shoyo Ramen [BLARG TO VEGETABLES!!! BLARG I SAY]), the classic is my favorite. All the ramen at Ippudo lack that sodium (salt) enriched flavors that you find at cheap ramen places or instant ramen. Instead you taste the silky smooth broth blended together with all the fresh ingredients. I know I sound like an advertisement for Ippudo, but it is just incredible. It makes it worth waiting an hour to get a table. Drinks: 4.25 Stars Overall Ippudo has a standard lineup of beers, wine and sake found in most Japanese restaurants, but my favorite drink has to be the Shochu w/ Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit Juice. It's shochu with grapefruit juice, so what? The only reason it is my favorite, isn't because of the flavor, it's because you have to do the work yourself. They provide you with the shochu is a glass as well as a half grapefruit and a juicer. In other words you squeeze the grapefruit yourself. You can't get any fresher than that. I haven't tried all their mixed drinks yet, but being the alcohol lover that I am, it's only a matter of time. Service & Ambiance: 4.5 Stars As you are being seated/leaving the restaurant, it is a very homely feeling, but the overwhelming crowds and wait time makes you want to find another place to eat. DON'T DO IT! Ippudo is NEVER empty. There is always a crowd no matter what time you arrive. The servers are always there to help you if you have any questions especially since there are many new faces that arrive there daily hearing about how excellent  Ippudo is. Overall: 5 Stars No matter how good/bad the service is, or how crowded/quiet it is, the food is the star of the show here. There is no doubt that Ippudo is one of my favorite restaurants and I will be going there many more times in the near future. No matter what your tastes are, Ippudo is a restaurant you go to have your mind blown each and every time you return.","[1.0, 0.0]"

No, we didn't run afoul of unfriendly doormen or snotty waiters and our  party of six got seated immediately at 10:15 on a Sunday night, and, yes, the mac and cheese was great, but can someone please tell me why it's a good idea to pipe really loud music into a jam-packed restaurant that's already loud because it's small, full of people, and finished with sound-reflective hard surfaces?

Each is pretty sweet, but you can tell that the owners were going for something totally different when they built this place.

(my favorite. yes i am a princess. no i don't think it's a problem). there was a recipe embossed in the wood table (i thought about writing it down but then didn't have a pen) and pretty much everyone in the joint was attractive.

We started off with the dumplings, which were tough and chewy and rather tasteless. Then, we tried the meatballs, which were grisly. The pad thai, usually a big fave of all of ours, was sickeningly sweet. But, the biggest annoyance was that they never brought one of us their entree. Totally FORGOT IT!

Last week we got a coupon in the mail from Parsippany's Best Pizza. It was for a one topping pie, mozzarella sticks and garlic knotts. I got there exactly 12 minutes after I placed the order. They got my order from the back room - usually when you have hot things they are sitting on top of the oven. We were beyond dissaponted. The pie looked and tasted old - I am not sure how long it was sitting there - maybe left over from somebody else - it certainly explains being in the back room and not kept warm... the garlic knotts were cold and extremelly greasy. The marinara sauce was extremelly sour. We ended up tossing the food away  - it was literally uneatable. so, please do not be fooled by thier name.

"This temple to pork tonsoku, aka pig trotters, is tiny, a cubical wood-paneled dining room overlooking West Village.  Like the Spotted Pig, you'll often run into paraphernalia of the oft featured beast, sophisticated red stamp on napkins and paper lanterns, a pig-shaped box perched on a sedate sake and glassware shelf, unapologetically pink and cute, with ears. Hakata Ton Ton features the cuisine of the southernmost island of Japan, Kyushu, and Hakata (officially known as Fukuoka) is the largest city, both illustrated on a huge map on one wall.  I am not familiar with it and very eager to try.  Pork is the focus, and their most famous tonsoku is ubiquitous on the menu.  Other regional specialty ingredients that show up frequently are collagen and mentaiko (spicy cod roe).  There's a special menu collecting together offal offerings, called motsu.  There's even a tasting menu, very reasonably priced.  Overall, the menu reminds me of Japanese izakayas, rambling and expansive, with plenty of small plates and several shabu (hot pots), which seemed like requisite ordering. Their beverage menu is also long, casual, and varied. On a whim, we inquired about same day reservations while in the area and got prime time seats at the L-shaped bar, which doesn't offer any advantage over tables except if you're dining solo; nothing much happens there.  Comfortable enough, casual and low-key atmosphere.  Service was courteous and efficient, and warm as well. Choosing from the menu was fun (because of all the interesting choices) and challenging (so much to choose from!).  There were many plates that were good and well-made but straightforward and not otherwise exciting, like crispy skinned gyoza on a hot plate and classically steamed monk fish liver.  Others inspired wide-eyed looks of delight, like a luscious, cool salad of tonsoku chunks and cucumbers, touched with heat, and the veal liver sashimi, smooth, earthy, and well dressed with citrus, sesame, and scallions. Their sauce-heavy okonomiyaki was served in the shape of a loaf or layered cake, a rich version of melded ingredients and big flavors.  Soft shell crab arrived in unrecognizable fried chunks, but were lightly crispy, with an interesting, slightly tart and savory flavor, and good crab underneath. The shabu takes the longest to prepare.  As we worked on our small plate parade, the staff brought out a portable gas stovetop, set the large stone pot of broth and ingredients on top, and started the cooking.  After everything wilted into the bubbling broth, we spooned out portions into serving bowls and dug in.  Portions are sized by the number partaking, minimally for two.  We chose the Hakata TonTon Hot Pot with tonsoku, Berkshire pork belly, dumplings, tofu, and a garden of vegetables in their collagen broth.  Delicious, rich and porky in flavor, this hearty shabu makes a great meal by itself; perfect for a cold night. I loved the trio of condiments set out for each party.  Yuzu kosho and yuzu hot sauce were both addictively tasty, refreshingly tart, and dispensed a nice heat, with the relish-like kosho edging out as my favorite.  I think they could go with nearly everything.  Both can be purchased from Hakata Ton Ton, and in fact, I may have to go back to get that yuzu kosho. To end, a special strawberry ice cream confidently labeled ""delicious,"" which I found hard to dispute, accompanied by imported pre-packed mochi, the classic sticky and sweet version; I'm undecided about being served pre-packaged products (would I have felt better to have them put it on a plate for me?  I suppose it doesn't matter much), but either way, I don't personally like traditional mochi. Hakata Ton Ton is a casual Japanese restaurant serving hearty, satisfying food from a region not well represented in NYC.  I think they nailed the best description for their own cuisine when they call it ""Japanese Soul Food.""  It's justifiably popular but under the radar with the profusion of newer, hotter Japanese restaurants.  Not to be overlooked, it's excellent and well worth a visit.  Also, a fun note that our waitress followed us out and offered candy from a pig-shaped PEZ dispenser.  Simply quirky and charming.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Having read most of the Yelp reviews and finally gone, I've satisfied my curiosity and probably won't go back.  Yes, the food is flavorful and the atmosphere beautiful.  Service was courteous.  BUT, most things seem $5 too much.   Friends had the weisswurst with sauerkraut, horseradish mustard.  They said it was good.  I had the goulash - which turned out to be a tomato-based soup with small chunks of beef and potatoes.  Tasty but not $14 tasty.  I at least expected some sort of cool presentation but it came in a bowl; soup had been sloshed onto the rim of the bowl by the time it reached me.  The $9 sacher torte was good too but I think at most $7 would have been appropriate.  Not too sweet with just a touch of apricot jam to complement the chocolate cake.  All in all, for this kind of cash, I'd rather go somewhere else.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Let me first start off with the fact that I am not a fan of Steven Starr.  Overpriced, over hyped restaurants are not my thing.  I am totally in love with food and would not mind paying a lot for an out of this world dinner.  However, Starr restaurants have always left me disappointed, cold, and hungry.  I booked a table for a large group as it was a birthday event and we were all going to the restaurant for the first time.  As we entered everything was illuminated in a red tint.  I liked the simple but yet mysterious decor of black and red working together.  We were led up 3 flights of stairs to a cozy table in the corner.  The pre fix menu was pretty delightful.  The appetizers, the fish, lamb, steaks and especially the soft cheese bread was tasty.  I had the scallops with crab and corn quinoa, merquen vinaigrette which were spicy and delicious.  Royal Palm Dates were also very flavorful.  All the food had good flavor and was presented nicely. The desserts were delicious too, The chocolate peanut butter bombe was very good and had tons of chocolate bursting flavor.  The only dessert that was not a hit was Tapioca pudding.  The waitress moved at a good pace and was able to accommodate everyone's requests.  Overall it was a successful evening.  Everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  I would consider going here for another dinner, and that is saying a lot for a Steven Starr restaurant in my opinion.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My friends and I rolled up to Lucali on a Saturday night a couple weeks ago for dinner. I specifically say 'roll' because we drove and were fortunate enough to find an open parking space in front of the restaurant, where my friend made a hilariously awful parallel park. It was so bad that the hostess asked him if he was from New Jersey (ouch!). This really hurt his pride, but I think it's partly what got us a table. Lucali is a busy place and when we arrived people were crowding underneath the awning, but someone cancelled right when we got there, so a combination of that and a little sympathy for parking-gate nabbed us a table in fairly short order. On our way in I overheard the hostess remark that the wait was an hour and a half. Yikes! I first heard about Lucali from Paulie Giannone at Paulie Gee's, which is the first pizza joint I've been to that I would ever consider a date spot. Paulie said that he modeled his restaurant on Lucali, and I can see why. Low candle lighting, exposed brick, molded tin ceiling and wood furnishings? Yep. Kitchen(?) and pizza oven in the totally exposed and hardly separated back half of the restaurant? You bet. BYOB? Hell yeah! Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong playing? Ain't misbehavin'. Lucali has a very sparse menu - pizza and calzones, nothing more. Choose what you want, add toppings and go! We got sausage and onions in our calzone and garlic and basil on our pie. The calzone wasn't what we were expecting - instead of a short speed bump-shaped lump of dough and cheese, what came out was something that looked like a big slice of pizza that had been folded over on itself in thirds from tip to crust. Inside is nestled an impressive array of cheeses that I can't entirely remember, but I think there was ricotta, mozzarella, bufula mozzarella, parmigiano and a secret cheese that our server couldn't disclose (we think it was a mild blue). The calzone was pretty good, but a little light on the toppings. Out next came the pizza. If you are a devotee of thin crust pizza, you need to drop everything and get to Lucali now. The crust was so paper thin and brittle that it felt as though it shattered like a very finely caramelized sheet of sugar. It also had a decent bit of char on it. The cheese was great and the sauce was good, but the entire experience was overshadowed by the basil. Instead of dropping a couple leaves here and there, our pie had a generous helping of sprigs, such that I had a tough time tasting anything but the basil. Service was a little distracted - we had to flag down the servers multiple times to refill our water glasses - but overall the experience was really great.","[1.0, 0.0]"

To date, there are only three restaurants that I would consider this a favorite, Bistro Mediterranean, The 21 Club in New York and Sardi's in New York. The seasoning is outstanding, the presentation is beautiful and it is the best of the three. My wife loves the empinadas. What we also love is the attentive nature of the owners and the staff. They really understand that fine dining should be enjoyed. There is no rush and there is always some little surprise at the end of the meal that will always leave a smile on your face.

went to this mexican place last week and was def disappointed!! over priced menu and the food did not make up for it! service was terrible as well. We sat near the bar and watched while four different servers were dipping their straws in and out of our pitcher of mango mint margaritas multiple times and tasting it. not only is that unsanitary but when we said we saw the other servers doing this to our own server he had no reaction and walked away. Never going here again! wonder what happens in the kitchen if this is happening next to the bar?!,"[0.0, 1.0]"

"Love the Tejas!! If I'm in the greater Woodbridge area one of my first thoughts is to stop on in to Jose Tejas for great mexican/tex-mex cajun style cuisine. I can't go here without having their margarita's - they have plenty of very good variations and offer all of them in regular or frozen. Every meal I have ever had here has always been very good and very flavorful. From their chips and salsa, chicken quesadillas, tacos, and fajitas are to die for. For our last visit tonight we had the El Pueblo which has grilled gulfport shrimp skewers and grilled chicken fajitas, the flavors on everything was amazing as was the very flavorful Jambalaya. Jose Tejas is great for families, kids, couples on a date and friends looking to get together, with a full bar and a really great atmosphere.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is legit. The bar is the kitchen! Kudos to the chefs for they are working in the tiniest space imaginable, this is NYC but still! Everything is fresh and they cook right in front of you. There is definitely an authenticity about it that makes me love it more. It is a very tight space, if you sit at the tables you may be sitting next to people who are not a part of your party. Its communal for some tables but you're just lucky you get a seat. The broth itself is delicious, I always finish the silky ramen noodles, but I've noticed that the chicken chashu tastes best in the morning. Service is very accommodating. I came after last call (running from work to get a bowl or ramen) but they still served me with smiles and were welcoming which surprised me. I'm a loyal customer now and I'm glad this place is so close to home.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Great Customer Service and Food This weekend I went to Nolita's for lunch and I chose to get the Rigatoni Carbonara because my waitress told me it was her favorite. She was right!! The food was delicious!!!  My waitress, Milly, was so sweet and pleasant. She helped me make the best choice! I strongly recommend this restaurant! The bar area looks like fun too. I will be going back to Nolita's with my friends. If you are looking for great food, a place with a great atmosphere and very helpful wait staff, then head to Nolita's  You won't be disappointed.

"Its really hard to find a good place to eat around the midtown/murray hill, so this to me is a great find. Its a cute, humble lil' bistro, so groups of more than 4 will find it difficult to find seating, however they do take reservations.  I had the french onion soup, and grilled chicken sandwich, while my friend had the croque monsieur (pretty big portion). The grilled sandwich was ok, but i was very pleased with the soup, came out very hot, and it turned out to be very hearty- highly recommended. The only negative thing i have to say is that the staffing is basically one waitress who is also the hostess.  They could use some help.  I'll be back though!","[1.0, 0.0]"
This place looks cool and the food is delicious. The waits are usually pretty long.  I remember getting a cheeseboard which was out of this world as appetizer.  I got sugar chicken wings which was so delicious. Was talking about it for weeks. The next time I went they didn't have it anymore but I hope they bring it back.   Another visit I got a turkey burger which was also delicious. Overall awesome place five stars.  You can't go wrong by going here.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"First meal around my campus, and it was amazing! Luckily when I got there, there were only a handful of people waiting for their orders. Having been the first time, silly me just stood behind them thinking they were also waiting to order, but obviously it looked like I didn't know what the hell I was doing, and the owner called me out. How embarrassing, but he was really nice about it. I got the masala dosa, medium spicy, and to my surprise, I was SO full after my meal. I totally underestimated how a 'crepe' can be so filling. I don't know so much about the chutney, but the veggie soup (sorry, I don't know the technical name) was full of flavor. I'm a total carnivore, but didn't mind that my lunch didn't have any meat in it. It was THAT good. This place is definitely my go-to place for lunch once school starts in the fall.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mulberry Street,a tree-lined stretch lined with avant garde boutiques and charming red brick facades, just may be one of NYC's most charming.  Situated in trendy Soho, the neighborhood is hardly lacking in the restaurant department but, while there are a few gems, I find it safe to say that quantity prevails over quality.  To put it more gently, there are not too many eateries that I would consider ""destination worthy."" ...That was, until I dined at Balaboosta.  Middle Eastern and Israeli small plates (though there are full-sized entrees, too) line the menu at Einat Admony's second successful restaurant venture (she also has Taim which, arguably, is home to the city's best falafel). Balaboosta's space could best be described as cozy, rustic, and lively. Exposed-brick walls, a tiny open-kitchen, book shelves lined with wine bottles and chotchkies, and dim lighting anoint the interior.Upon seating, Moira and I were handed food and drink menus as our server simultaneously listed that particular evening's specials - which were also hand-written on a chalkboard, conveniently hung above our table. A gratis bowl of addictive seasoned-crisps (god knows what they were made of and shame on me for being too distracted to ask!) arrived with our beverages.  Along with my red sangria, I ordered a glass of homemade mint-lemonade.  Double-fisting never tasted this delicious. Instead of ordering separate entrees, Moira and I chose to share an array of small plates. Balaboosta's Smoked Eggplant Bruschetta: Hugging the top of a crunchy, super-buttery slice of toasted bread was a thick schmear of garlicky, creamy, smoked eggplant dip.  A lawn of emerald-green parsley shreds crowned the Bruschetta. While I typically take my salads with extra dried cherries, candied pecans, blue cheese, and some sort of creamy dressing - I have to give Balaboosta credit for creating a colorful plate of lightly-dressed greens.  Citrus segments, thinly-sliced radish, and roasted squash were dressed in a tangy blood-orange vinaigrette. Falafel-wrapped meatballs: This dish was the turning point - the moment, during the meal, when I fell in love.  What appears to be falafel-on-a-stick is actually a falafel-wrapped meatball on-a-stick.  And this isn't just any falafel, it's the famous product that put Taim and Balaboosta on the culinary map!  A crunchy, flavor roller coaster of exterior falafel gives way to a meatball that is so perfectly cooked and juicy, that you can't help but wonder, How in the hell did they pull this off?  A parsley-oil topped tahini sauce proves to be the ultimate accompaniment. Fried Olives & Organic Labne, Harissa Oil: A small bowl is filled with organic Labne (a Middle Eastern yogurt/cheese), a thin drizzle of harissa oil, and topped with the most perfect, golden, fried-green olives.  Long tooth picks/sticks join the dish as olive-dipping utensils. The presentation of the hummus and pita was more pleasing that its actual taste.  While there was nothing fundamentally wrong, I found the pita bread to be on the dry side and could not figure out why the hummus was served in a guacamole-esque mortar bowl. While Balaboosta's falafel-wrapped meatballs had me falling in love, it was the ""Crispy Cauliflower"" dish that changed my life.  Literally. I was so taken aback when our server informed us that the cauliflower was the most ordered - and raved-about - item on the menu.  I mean, wasn't this the crap that our mothers forced us to eat by threatening ""no dessert until you finish your veggies?""  I couldn't figure out why this tasteless, texturally awkward and, frankly, gnarly vegetable was so popular. That was...until I hesitatingly tasted it for myself.  Florets of cauliflower were dredged in crack a delicate batter, fried, and then tossed with sweet currant berries and earthy pine nuts.  Sure, this may sound like an odd combo, but take it from a former 'hater: this is one of NYC's most delicious and unique dishes.  I would return to Balaboosta for the cauliflower, alone.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Last night, I went to Tashan with a fellow foodie friend of mine (and lover of Indian cuisine).  I've read great reviews of this place, so I was super excited to get Friday night reservations.  The decor was beautiful: very modern and cozy, with an open kitchen...it looks like a great place to be on a chilly Friday or Saturday night.   Overall, the experience was fine, but just a few issues that need to be ironed out: 1. Our waiter, who had been there since the opening, was not as familiar with the menu as he should've been.  The kicker was when he mispronounced (twice) ""gulab jamun"", a popular Indian dessert. 2. We sat very close to the kitchen, which gave us a front-row seat to the chaos and confusion with numerous orders and which table they belonged to.  There was a lamb shank that was sent to a table near us twice, and twice the couple sent it back saying that they didn't order it. 3. Our order of ""Butter Chicken"" (which was a somewhat tasteless tomato-y chicken tikka masala) was a late arrival to the table.   4. It seemed like our water glasses were being filled after taking one sip!!  It was way too much. To be fair, the staff are very friendly and customer-oriented.  The chef, Sylva Senat, came over to our table to inquire about our dining experience.  Also, one of the managers offered us complimentary Tashan martinis to compensate for the late Butter Chicken. I'm hoping that these are just growing pains that will be resolved over the next few months.  Tashan is only a few blocks from my house...it would be great to have an upscale Indian restaurant that I can walk to.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Date/Time:  Friday - 10:30pm Occasion:  Snacking Party of:  Two Location:  A typical food cart amassed with a long line Ordered:  Chicken and rice halal platter Total incl gratuity: $6 Even though we had eaten several meals already that day, we happened to be strolling around midtown and found ourselves at the ever so famous 56th and 9th Halal Street Cart after dinner.  After so much acclaim and seeing such a ridiculously long line, we had to see for ourselves what all the hype was about so we got in line.  The line moves fairly quick.  We waited about 10 minutes.  You can choose lamb, chicken, or combo.  Since I don't eat lamb, we opted for chicken.  They top yellow rice with hashed chicken and a few slices of pita.  Like they say in Fried Green Tomatoes - ""Secret's in the sauce"".  This platter would not be what it is without the white sauce you smother your rice platter in.  It's like a creamy white lardy sweet mayo.  It goes well with the white sauce and of course some dabs of the hot sauce as well.  The hot sauce is not that hot - It adds a nice kick.   My verdict?  It is definitely worth trying.  Very good!  However, beware...it is EXTREMELY high in calories so those watching the waistline - stay far far away from this cart.  It won't be good for you!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Queens Comfort was a great and enjoyable experience for myself and everyone I was with. The food, service, and atmosphere was all excellent. We showed up on a Saturday night and sat right down with no wait. We ordered three appetizers that were all very good, my favorite being the cheesy tater tots. For my meal I had a Space Jam Burger which consisted of blueberry jam and bacon and was excellent, my only complaint was that there was too much jam on the burger. My favorite part about Queens Comfort was the service and atmosphere, our server took all of our orders without writing anything down and got everything correct and was very polite in the process. The atmosphere is really cool, as everything was very laid back and interesting, as they served water in mason jars. I would recommend to anybody visiting New York City to make their way over to Queens and try out Queens Comfort.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Amazing and creative vegan sushi! FINALLY! I am super sick of cucumber avocado rolls. This chef here really cares about innovating and making sushi fun, tasty, and unique! Every roll is absolutely delicious and fresh. They use Black Rice and Multi-Grain Rice. The presentation is always amazing as well. You can see in the picture I posted. The flavor combos really work well regardless of which roll you choose. The rice paper wrap I tried was also great! It's called Spicy Shroom. Sweet and refreshing. Talking about sweet and refreshing, the watermelon mint lemonade... awesome. They have been 100% vegan since early August and used to be vegetarian (using egg and mayo). They haven't yet updated their menu or website but I can confirm they are totally vegan. Unlike Soy & Sake, the vegan sushi here is not made of mock meats to imitate fish. Instead, they are made from delicious fresh veggies! The man making the sushi is a really nice guy who was actually on Hell's Kitchen. He's always there making his unique brand of artfully prepared sushi. You can tell he's really got his heart in the place and really loves making sushi. It shows in the rolls. My favorites (though all are great): Spicy Mango and Mighty Mushroom. It's got three tables and it's more of a take out place but if you have the chance to sit down, do it. Hands down my favorite sushi spot, can't wait to bring all my friends.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Came here with some friends from out of town and had a perfect meal. A selection of cheeses to start - ricotta with a rhubarb compote and butter crackers, pecorino with roasted hazelnuts in honey, and a creamy goat's cheese with a flaky topping that reminded me cornflakes but sweeter. So amazing. Then we had the Tagliatelle Bolognese Bianco, the carbonara pasta special, the branzino and a lovely pumpkin/squash ravioli sent courtesy of the kitchen. The branzino was probably the best i've ever had. The ravioli was so decadent and creamy. The white bolognese was buttery yet had all the familiar taste of a tomato-based bolognese that we are all so used to. And just when I didn't think it could get any better, the rhubarb tiramisu blew me away. Wow, I haven't been this satisfied without the help of a man in AGES.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Chatni was a great experience from start to finish, but with one big caveat: the wait time. I came here with my wife last weekend, and while the ambiance and vibe of Chatni is great, you know within a few minutes if you're in for a LONG NIGHT. We'd brought our own bottle of Riesling and the waiter didn't even open it until asked. Usually, at good places, your waiter will seat you and then ask to open your bottle simultaneously. At Chatni, it seemed only two people were working, and they were WORKING. The food was fantastic, however. My wife and I split an appetizer, and then we hit the entree. I got the Lamb Vindaloo, which was done at medium spice (as per your request), and brought out pretty quickly. The lamb was cooked beautifully, and covered in a nice spice. It came with rice on the side, to which you pair with the Vindaloo and have a nice little concoction. It was delicious, and I finished it pretty quickly. Chatni, although the wait times were excessive, has an excellent menu and quality about itself. I'm also someone who values the service/wait A LOT -- almost comparably to food quality - when I go to eat. If the service is poor, and wait time is long, my food tasting good doesn't matter as much as it should.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The very same night that I tried my first cheesesteak ever, I also tried Pat's.  A Philly-born friend told me about both rivals, across the street from each other, and it was perfect that the meaty corner was walking distance from the restaurant that served us our first dinner of the night. We didn't know whether to choose Pat's or Geno's when we walked up, and both places were almost equally busy.  Maybe it was just my aversion to the way too bright lights of Geno's that made me want Pat's, but I was happy with the choice! We ordered a Mushroom Cheesesteak wit, with both whiz and provolone.   Now, my first cheesesteak ever - and just before this, that night - would have looked so sadly impotent next to this fat baby that they handed us.  It was HUGE.  And LOADED.  And HOT. We were too full to eat it while it was hot, so next time I'm back, that's what I'll do.  But even eating it later, I realized this was much better than the previous one I'd had.  The portions were obviously crazy generous, the meat was way more flavorful, and though the mushrooms & onions blended in with the whiz & meat & provolone so you couldn't really taste them, it was good.  The bread was all gooey cheesy meat juicy, in a very good way! Not that this should have surprised me, but it was also greasy, very very greasy.  But, I guess it should be that way! So yes, I'm a fan, and I'll be back for a hot one next time I'm around!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"High expectations not met. Went with another couple. Nicely decorated, candle lit vibe. BYOB. Ordered mussels app special, causas w/crab and a ceviche. All were pretty good. The mussels in red sauce had an nice kick to them, a nice change from the average red sauce for mussels. Downhill from there; entrees were not impressive. Chaufa de Mariscos was sent back for being so salty as to be inedible. Arroz con Mariscos was fine, but very disappointing as good Peruvian food always has a nice unexpected flavor and this was pretty much what you would get at any average restaurant serving this dish, Mexican, Spanish, etc. No seasonings (guess they were all used up on the other dish). Waitress was unexpectedly concerned and responsive about the salty dish however - unexpected because until then it was as if she had been carved in stone and was squarely between being unpleasant and pleasant. They redid the dish quickly and it was reportedly better, but still not good. Two had the Lomo Saltado, and neither finished - and these are men not finishing steak. For one, it was the first time a dish has gone unfinished! Waitress remarked on that and the unfinished less salty dish with some concern. Flan and ""organic ice cream"" were good desserts. The ice cream had interesting flavors - one scoop of each; almost tasted non-dairy in a way but it was good.  Sadly, will not return because I love Peruvian food too much and this was just average.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I originally posted this by error for Ippudo NY, where it should have been for Ippudo West. (I apologize to Ippudo NY) Very rude hostess and manager. We waited hours to be seated for 4. Another friend came all the way from NJ just to have dinner with us and she sat with us at the booth. We were comfortable sitting 3 people on one side of the booth. Then all of a sudden this hostess came and spoke in a very unaccommodating rude way that they don't allow 5 people in the booth and our friend needed to leave. Her tone and words were very disrespectful for a group of people that waited for hours. I spoke with the manager and voiced out my concern. I said understand policy and I was not asking them to change their policy. All I wanted was for them to approach their customers more respectfully. The manager was even worse and all he said was policy is policy. I guess they take customers for granted given the customer volume they have. What a shame for a place that is supposedly one of NY's best ramen places. To make it worse.. The ramen was nothing over-the-top. Very skimpy on the pork loin and broth was nothing special as well. The beef buns were ok. The dish that I liked was the squid wrapped-shitake mushroom. If i just ordered this and had it to-go i would have been a happy camper. Instead went out the door frustrated and disappointed. Treat your customers better.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I didn't know what to expect when I got to DiNics after trudging through a late summer shower... its not very often I feel in the mood for a cheesesteak or hoagie. I was so pleasantly surprised to find another gem of a stall at the Reading Terminal Market! The roast pork with provolone and greens was fabulous. I had some trouble finishing the whole thing, but I got about 8 or 9 inches deep. I loved the juices that dribbled out of the back and bottom of the sandwich, it leaves a great taste in your mouth. As I am writing this 20 minutes post sandwich, I can still taste it (not in a bad way at all, those spices and wine in the pork stick with you on your palate, taunting your stomach to take more roast pork in). I have passed this place by so many times on my aimless trips for lunch and I am sad to think that no one mentioned this sandwich to me when I moved here. Pats and Genos and all the other cheesesteaks have a reason to make Philly proud, but lets not forget about DiNics Roast Pork sandwiches! It hit the sandwich spot so hard that as I was eating this sandwich, I was photo messaging my brother and best friend on the west coast and taunting them!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Like everyone else here says, this place is like a Mediterranean Chipotle.  (That is a compliment!).  Everything on the line is always very fresh looking.  They have a variety of protein options, plate options, and side options.  Here is what i usually get: Chicken shwarma platter with babaganoosh, tabloueh, spanish eggplant....with a bunch of pickled veggies.  Comes with a whole pita and fresh hummus.   The hummus here is really good, and tastes like the real Israeli kind.  Not the trader joes, whole foods, American kind.  I usually take the pita and dip it into all the side dishes.   What can I say?  It's more expensive than street meat, but do yourself a favor a try it and you'll be going here at least once a month.  I also enjoy the cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms.  A bunch of these take out Mediterranean places are gross looking inside and have B ratings.  Not here!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Came in the other night for the first time. First impressions are everything and our first impression was amazing. They really did an amazing job renovating and preserving Montclairs history. Hostesses were attentive and extremely accommodating. For dinner we had the Elote which is this smoky creamy corn dip- Amazing!!!! Dinner was roasted venison and rabbit fricasse!! Both were out of this world! And dessert we had the chocolate soufflé which took 15 minutes- very quick for soufflé!! Overall the service was spectacular and our waitress was extremely accomidating and was able to properly answer every question about the meal and suggested awesome wine pairings! I love that they use iPods at the tables to take orders. I've read some morons reviews about the servers using their cell phones at the table. Get with the 21st century!!!

You'd be better off licking a port authority door knob than eating at this place - it may actually taste better than the junk they pass off as food at this place. Zero stars. Avoid like the plague.

In most Manhattan restaurants, especially in this part of town, the tables are together in a long line against the wall. At Jane, you can go with a group and not be wedged in between other people. I went here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of friends (we had made a reservation earlier in the evening). Their spicy blood orange margarita is delicious. And the gnocchi definitely lives up to the hype. It's cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the white truffle crema gives the dish an extra bit of flavor and richness. The goat cheese flatbread was cooked perfectly too and was a great combination of flavors. I had a grilled pork chop for an entree, and it was cooked just right, and I loved the cheddar grits on the side.  I also tried some of my friends' brussels sprouts, and they  were seasoned and cooked just right.

Went there dinner for two.  The wait was about an hour around 8pm.  They had lots of empty seats and seemed to be bringing ppl over from the bar next door?  The food was a low point.  Ordered tagli... Seafood pasta it didn't have all that seafood in it as I've read on yelp.  The noodles were strange tasting. Even upon ordering they ran out of clams and said they will be replaced with mussels.  A cheap shot move IMO.  The other dish was the gnocchi.  For me it was horrible.  The potato noodles were green balls and a bland white cream sauce.  Biting into one revealed threads of dust??  Are they hand making these with cotton gloves?  I just manned up.  The glass of water had a bug on the bottom which I wasn't man enough to do.  The portions are small as hhell and I'm about 180lbs.  Service was horrid.  The place is loud and crowded which is good for certain occasions but not all.  I was so unimpressed by my experience I don't understand the hype and why this restaurant keeps popping up first on the long lists at yelp.  Go here for a loud crowded place that seats about 30.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

Met friends without a reservation on a Saturday night there were no tables in the dining room but we were seated family-style at a large table in the bar. it was perfect; it was noisy enough that we did not hear the conversations next to us but not too noisy that we couldn't hear each other speak. the service was very attentive the waitress greeted us very happily and made some suggestions she suggested the mussels and also the apple fennel bruschetta; both were delicious I had the chicken cacciatore which was very good. it had a very woodsy taste with the wild mushrooms; wasn't too saucy. It was served with potatoes instead of pasta which I thought was a nice change. My husband and our friend split the Paella which was a very nice serving as well and they're also very delicious. we were too full for dessert but did have cappuccino and coffee which was very good.

"I have traveled around the world and certainly the U.S. I ALWAYS go to local sushi restaurants. I rate HANA's sashimi, sushi rolls, sushi and creative appetizers as some of the BEST I have ever had! I am a tough critic on sushi and I would recommend HANA to anyone and frequent them about once or twice a week. Unfortunately they are a little off the ""beaten path"" of downtown Burlington and I HOPE they succeed but they need more business. They need more people like myself and others to get the word out. I would never think of having sushi at any other place in Burlington or the surrounding areas after eating at HANA. Their sashimi is always fresh: tuna is amazing, salmon and yellowtail melt in your mouth. They have two amazing appetizers the Luck Tree (spicy tuna) and their spicy squid are a MUST. They have some awesome rolls (and generous portions) and some new really creative rolls that include mango and jalopenos! Their signature roll the HANA roll is also one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their rolls or sushi/sashimi and I hope the word gets out soon, because this is the real deal for sushi and it's great to have a place like this in our area! Please pass the word around so they don't go out of business before people have had a chance to experience their amazing menu!","[0.0, 1.0]"

We were seated right away and immediately ordered a wide selection of their tapas- meatballs, mussels, olives, some fried chicken monstrosity- and a large pitcher of sangria. Overall, the service was good and the ambiance was nice- but the food was mediocre at best. One of the mussels I had was rotten which totally threw me off.

"(4.75 stars)  The gentrification of Montclair Center has been many years in its evolution and refinement.  Through this time the unspoken question has been, ""does Montclair offer a dining experience to rival those of Manhattan's elite?""  Osteria Giotto not only answers the question in the affirmative, but may rank among the best Italian restaurants in the metropolitan area. Through an interesting series of coincidences we had 6:00 reservations for both Saturday and Sunday, and were able to sample a solid cross-section of the menu and specials.  Two quick points; first, the dining rooms are tiny and packed, reservations are a must on weekends.  Next, there are probably a dozen specials recited by the waiters and this is more than can be processed and remembered.  Both points are, in context, trivial. DeMetri was our waiter on Saturday, and his personable demeanor and thorough professionalism compel a special acknowledgment.  Sunday's waiter was also very good, although she lacked the same level of polish.  We were seated immediately, as a party of four, on Saturday.  As eight on Sunday we waited forty-five minutes beyond our reserved seating time for a birthday party who overstayed their welcome.  The restaurant is small enough to make a wait of this duration a minor ordeal. Osteria Giotto is BYOB, and most tables avail themselves of this feature-- there is no corking fee. Portion sizes at Osteria Giotto are large, making it very fortunate that the food is so good-- there is plenty to share.  The appetizer sized portion of gnocchi are pleasantly light and served in an equally light (but flavorful) tomato-basil broth.  A foreshadowing of just how well the kitchen makes and serves pasta, the gnocchi were stellar.  The filet mignon carpaccio was prepared in a lemon infused oil and served with shaved parmigian and mushrooms.  The quality was remarkable, as were the presentation and flavor; a clear notice of how adept the kitchen is.  The antipasto misto was generous and very good. Sunday's entree was the homemade spaghetti in a light tomato frutti di mare, loaded with lump crab (scallops were listed, but no complaints here), calamari and mussels, and finished with some littleneck clams and shrimp.  Wonderfully nuanced, decadently prepared and flavorful beyond description, the perfectly al dente pasta combined to make this an amazing dish. Desserts here are up to the same standards.  A dense, egg-only pistachio panna cotta was extraordinary.  Their homemade gellato is excellent, particularly the hazelnut flavor.  A surprisingly light puff pastry and pastry cream napoleon was also delicious. Osteria Giotto has already become the front runner for my ""Best Meals of 2012.""  The loss of a quarter of a star has two causes.  First, there were a very few minor details separating it from perfection.  Next, I look forward to a return visit and need something additional to offer in return for another dining experience of this caliber. Has Montclair Center come of age in comparison to Manhattan's best?  Osteria Giotto says ""yes.""","[1.0, 0.0]"

I loved the chicken fried rice (It was very good compared all the other take out places I have ordered so far) and the chicken with broccoli.

"By the order of their appearance here are my impressions on this place: 1) we walked by it one weekend day and saw a bunch of people waiting. My feeling was : something interesting must be happening in this seemingly uninteresting place. 2) one Saturday night we met an acquaintance whose boyfriend lives in the  neighborhood and who, after asking us where we had been, said this was the best place to eat in Williamsburg. 3) we decide to go and we enter the place on a Saturday evening, somewhat late. It was clear from the first moment - the place is affluent in pretentiousness: intentionally unintentional. The crowd I'd say was similarly intentionally unintentional. The waiter writes down the plates of the day on the paper table cloth. Attention here - no prices ;) 4)  we order a salad and an entree each: one was chicken something, the other lamb-asparagus-something. The salad was delicious, amazing I can say. Both of our entrees amazing as well - delicious, well made and most importantly prepared from extremely carefully picked meat! I think I haven't eaten better lamb in New York. I wonder where he got it from.  But, be aware !!! the chef, as much as he is good in choosing the right ingredients and cooking them just perfectly,y has one little but important problem - I think he has salt-sensing deficiency! Both our entrees were very, very, very salty! Might have this been only on this specific evening? I don't know, perhaps, or I hope. I hope, because there was no real reason to cover the food with salt since the meat was so obviously fresh and good anyway. 5) oh, and we saw a rather famous musician sitting at the bar 6) finally, the check revealed to us that one of the entrees was seriously overpriced. For this hidden little trap and for the over-salting thing, I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The short version: I came to Chavela's for the first time in July, and I don't think I went to a single other restaurant all of August.

Anyhow, the artichoke slice is pretty tasty, with some spinach too I believe and definitely has thick crust.  The actual artichokes are not that prevalent, which for $4.50 a slice is  a damn shame.   Crab slice was on a thinner crust, more cheese and some good crab.  This one was just being taken out and was piping hot !  Its` sauce even several minutes later at the park, scalded my tongue.   If these fellas chopped a buck off each slice and had some basic tables, this could be a 4 star.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I used to live in Taiwan and am always homesick for Taiwanese food, first and foremost beef noodle soup (niu rou mien, NRM for short). Grace's special recipe at Ray's Cafe does not disappoint, with a rich beefy broth, delicious chewy noodles, and tender falling apart beef. It's not very spicy, like most of the renditions I had in Taiwan, but nonetheless so good I finished all the broth. Other than the food, the other reason to make Ray's a destination is their premier selection of coffee, prepared syphon style. If you have not had syphon coffee, you must give it a try. It is my favorite preparation of coffee, not just because it is so fascinating to watch, but because it tastes absolutely delicious. Ray's has a wonderful selection of roasts, including Jamaica Blue Mountain, Japanese Charcoal Roasted, and more. The tea selection also looks excellent, but I confess I haven't yet had tea here because I can't resist the coffee. I'm not sure why syphon coffee hasn't caught on more here, but this is one of the few places in Philly where you can get it. Don't get it to go - sit down and enjoy it. It comes on a tray with an elegant cup, a cute mini-pitcher of cream, and a cookie on the side. Finally, Grace is a wonderfully sweet person who remembers all her customers, and the service is fantastic.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The pizzeria was very nice. A group of friends and I went there for lunch the other day and didn't think that it would be as nice as it was. When you walk in there are two large, well decorated - Victorian style - dining rooms.  Very beautiful. Unfortunately, the service didn't match the decor. We were the only customers there for majority of the time we were there. After that two other couples came in. The waitress was no where to be found anytime we wanted to order. We had to wait at least 10 minutes before she would come around. She never smiled, actually she was very snappy and rude from the moment she came to take our drinks order. She served my friends and I in old plastic cups and we noticed that she served the other guests in nice glasses. Her overall service was below awful. The prices of the food were pretty expensive and the descriptions in the menu were incorrect. ""Grilled Portabello Mushroom"" isn't the same as HALF of a mushroom on salad. We didn't understand how how bill came up to almost $80 when we ordered 2 pizzas and two pitchers of sprite. I understand that there was 7 of us, but we didn't order that much. The food was okay, but I've had better. I definitely wouldn't pay that much for mediocre food and sub par service. I would never recommend this pizzeria to anyone.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Prices are good and service was good too.  I'm also excited to hear rumors about a ping pong table :)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I am a longtime Bubby's fan and we come here monthly. It can be a bit pricey, but the food and service have always been worth it. HOWEVER, we went today for brunch and everything had changed... We were still greeted by our friendly bartender (who makes the best bloody mary's around), but that's where it ended: Once we were seated, we ordered right away (bubby's griddle special for me and eggs benedict for my boyfriend). It took over 45 minutes to get our food, which is unheard of there. Everyone around us had been seated, ate and left and we were still waiting. When they finally brought our food, the eggs in the eggs benedict were hard boiled and we sent it back. My food was cold and worse yet, there was a quarter sized piece of eggshell scrambled into my scrambled eggs. We could barely flag down our waiter for more coffee and when we sent our eggs benedict back for a 2nd time, again WAY overcooked, he was overly rude and refused to talk to us or make eye contact again. We finally asked a busboy for the manager, Carlos, who came over and explained that the head chef had been ""moved to another restaurant"" by the same owner and that ""the new chef is killing me"". He was very nice and ordered us a 3rd eggs benedict, which thankfully came back hot and perfectly cooked. Carlos apologized profusely and was very nice, and even comped our meal. Our waiter still refused to talk to us and we left full but let down... Carlos is a gem, and we would consider trying again, but BRING BACK THE OLD CHEF!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"BREAKFAST PIZZA. A delicious combination of rosemary foccaccia, sliced potatoes, sauteed onions, scrambled egg, breakfast meat of your choosing (optional) and melted cheese. All for (I think) no more than $6. This place is awesome. The wait can be pretty long but they have an outside waiting courtyard area with heaters (pretty nice), so just don't go if its raining or sleeting.  You can also check off where you want to sit (counter or tables), so if its just two of you, the wait will be significantly shorter if you're at the counter (i personally don't mind waiting and like a table). The coffee is awesome and served in huge tin mugs. The biscuits are also delicious. My friend decided to go overboard and get a macaroni and cheese as an appetizer, and we were all so psyched once it got there, it was so good.  People who have gotten the fritattas have complained that it was slightly dry or overcooked, but I've never tried them because, I mean, BREAKFAST PIZZA. I've always wanted to try the banana bread, but never have.  The dessert menu/pie selection alwas looks awesome but after BREAKFAST PIZZA i just want a nap.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I arrived close to noon and there was only a 10 minute wait for a table. I ordered the ""Daddy O"" breakfast which was bacon, Sausage, Eggs, Homefries and French Toast. The Homefries and sausage were very very tasty. And I also had some really good coffee to go along with it. The service was satisfactory and the layout of the place was very nice.

"I am giving this place four stars.. It's a probationary 4 stars as I have only eaten here once.. Last night to be exact.. I ordered a few things and they were all good.. The biggest issue I have was with the Cacio y Pepe.. If they would have called the dish homemade spaghetti with a shit load of butter, I would have been happier.. But to name something after a classic, incredibly recognizeable dish, it should be that dish.. Instead of tons of spicy black pepper, it was a plate of well made spaghetti in a butter sauce.. The bruschettas were very good.. I had a rhubarb with ricotta and truffle honey and some charred eggplant.. They were both very good. We ordered fried zucchinni flowers which came out a little under fried.. Like the anchovy the mixed with the ricotta.. The star of the show was the rabbit.. They have this wonderful charr grill that although is gas, gets super hot..They also have cast iron grates on the grill that gives it a wonderful char.. My rabbit dish was perfectly cooked served with a birght mixture of yellow and orange peppers.. They also have pizza and a pizza oven that is wood burning.. I will have to go back and get this and some of the wonderful cheeses they had on display.. Basics like La Tur Robiola, or Hazen, or Ricotta, but then they have things like smoked Sheeps Ricotta, and a few other things I rarely see.. Wine list is ok.. I got an ok Nebbiola Langhe 06 for like 34 bucks, which is priced well.. And a Sangiovese which was really good for the 36 dollar price point.. All in all, its a great spot for the neighborhood. So far!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Pizzas are hands-down fantastic, and the House, Arugula, and Baby Spinach salads complement the pizzas well. The Spicy Pecorino is one of my favorites, but the Cipolla is a bit too rich and sweet for me to order again.  The artichoke dip offered on the summer menu is a dense, small-portioned, and cold-served appetizer that could easily fall off the menu for good. The seating outdoors is lovely in good weather, and indoors is charming.  The televisions are big, yes, but the volume remains down.  It's not distracting in the least if you are not there to watch. Staff can be testy at times, and they are not fond of serving water, even if you've already ordered a beer or glass of wine.  On different occasions, I've had to ask repeatedly for water before receiving any. At the end of the day, though, when friends and family are visiting, Toby's is one of my favorite places in Brooklyn to take them.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Would have been nice to try the food and sample a drink at this place but the service could not have been worse.  The hostess sat us under a blaring speaker.  My date and I moved ourselves to a messy booth (they don't clean their tables apparently) so we could hear each other.  Around  13 minutes later (I timed it) we still hadn't been greeted by a server or given water.  After waving with both arms to an insouciant waiter, the hostess came over and kicked us out of the booth (reserved for parties of 6 or more apparently) and seated us closer to the bar.  Very classy.  THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE RESTUARANT.  IT'S LABOR DAY!   Then, we have to wait another 5 minutes before my date says that no food at a mid-ling Mexican cantina is worth waiting a second over 30 minutes with NO service.  I agree.   I call the manager over to talk--Akiko, I believe--to let her know that we can't even get water.  Akiko offers nothing but ""I'm sorry."" NOTHING.  Must have had the sense beat out of her by a higher-up manager that doesn't give a hell about service.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.  If Northern Liberties Plaza is lucky, these folks will go out of biz and a REAL Mexican restaurant can emerge with service that's passable...even in Mexico!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"After learning that the former head baker of Per Se and Bouchon Bakery was one of the masterminds behind Runner & Stone, I'd been counting down the days until it opened.   My fiance and I thought it was a good idea to trudge through the snow the afternoon after a snowstorm with our dog with our minds set on pastries. Despite only 75% of the sidewalks being plowed and freezing/whipping wind, we really wanted some croissants. I must admit, it seemed like the longest walk I've ever taken-- literally, my fingers were frozen and my dog was covered in dirt/soaking wet- so much so, I knew I would have to carry him into my apartment and give him a bath right away as he would destroy my furniture. Needless to say, at this point, I needed some delicious baked goods and a warm latte ASAP! The space itself is warm and inviting and thanks to the snow, the place was empty and they were fully stocked with pastries. First things first, I ordered a mocha for my guy and a latte for myself. For baked goods, I was a bit overzealous and ordered a chocolate croissant, an almond croissant, a slice of the lemon poppy bread, apple turnover, and a brownie. My latte and the mocha were delicious!! Seriously, the first time in a while (sadly), that I've had a good latte! Unfortunately, all of the baked goods were a bit on the stale side-- I'm not sure if it's just due to the storm and perhaps they were made the day before?? Generally, croissants do have a relatively short shelf life and I did get there around noon. However, my brownie and the lemon poppy loaf had to have been made a good 2+ days ago which was very disappointing. The brownie had major potential-- it was fudgy- but had that cakey/dry consistency that occurs after sitting out for a while. The lemon poppy loaf was so dry, it wasn't enjoyable. 4 stars for my killer latte. Next time, I'll come back when there wasn't just a snowstorm and hope that the baked goods are worth the trek to Gowanus.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Before stepping down into the seating area I spied 2 sad pies near the register. The cat fish was just two skinny strips dredged in cornmeal. The tarter sauce was runny milky liquid with pickle and dill. The potato salade was just boiled potato drowning in the same milky liquid. The slaw was over chopped and tasteless. The watermelon juice was good but served in a small glass. La Superior serves fresh in a tall glass. Worth the price. Maybe the chicken is what to get. The family funded restaurant has the right idea but sadly I wasted 13 bucks on milky runny liquid and two dried out fish stix. Proceed with caution. I want a refund.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"yes. yes. yes. nothing has disappointed me at the meatball shop, except for the fact that i think it should be spelled ""shoppe."" but that's another issue altogether. my friend and i came for lunch at just the right moment apparently because after we were seated at the bar, people who came after us were told the wait was going to be an hour.  whew!   if you love meatballs, this place is for you.  balls of beef, pork, chicken, veggie, and sauces galore! lemonades with a twist (ours was anise, subtle but intriguing).  I had two beef meatballs slathered in tomato sauce on brioche with mozzarella.  one thing i could have done without was the family jewels option--a runny egg on top.  the sandwich was deilciously mess enough without yolky goodness all over the place.   the ice cream sandwiches? the cookies were soft and pliant but held up to the ice cream.  the ice cream was delicious.  we had brownie cookies and espresso ice cream--can't go wrong with the choco-coffee combo. all you haters--what is the deal? the meatball shoppe is pure ball of meaty goodness.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"So delicious and so much fun to eat. The only think I wish is that there was more more more Food..more more more Square Footage in the room and less less less people who knew about it - but I also hate waiting for a seat in the freezing cold (since there is nowhere to stand inside) but that may just be me. Food - My gang started with the Potato croquettes where were ok  but not very memorable to to tiny in portion for the price that they cost. I wouldn't get it again. The star was the Pork kimchee dip soba. I love the display and the playfulness of the dish, not to mention it is absolutely delicious. I will say though that this is my first time having Soba so I have nothing to compare it to (eeeeeh that might be important) Service - Our waitress was wearing a grey sweatshirt with a hoodie and it felt like she was in and IDGAF mode because she didn't come around very often, the wait for the appetizer was pretty long ( about 30 min for something very small). I mean, can you not wear gym cloths as you serve food, just saying. Also I felt like i was rushed to leave, there was no room to relax or talk to friends. If it weren't for her, the disorganization, and frantic feel of the room, I would give this place 4 stars Scene - Contemporary and minimalist - no especially coo vibe, the food is definately the only star of the show Biggest pro - The taste and nuance of the food. Biggest Cons - Cash Only, Little room and the feeling of being rushed","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I needed to use my groupon deal before it expired so we came here on a Friday night.  I guess a lot of people bought the deal bc there were tons of signs by the entrance advising to tell your hostess if you're using the deal & that you would have to pay in cash (are they allowed to do that?) Regardless, they were super friendly and welcoming.  The set up itself is strange & def needs an upgrade.  The decor seems like it should be on one of those restaurant makeover shows.  There's tons of space but the layout is awkward & I felt like I was walking into someone's poorly decorated living room. We started off with the chicken satay & crunchy shrimp rolls -- not so great.  The shrimp roll was 1 shrimp on a skewer with egg roll wrapping around it & deep fried.  The hot oil oozed out after my first bite.  I had the drunken noodles were just a hot mess & the bf ordered the Royal Rama chicken - which was just chicken & tons of sauce. extremely nice service & good thai iced tea but mediocre food =(","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Food so good it makes your eyes roll to the back of your head and forces you to answer in grunts and moans when the staff stops by to ask how you are doing. That's what you're in for here. Dinner and brunch, once each with the boyfriend. We got different things to make sure we got to try more dishes and we loved it all. Forget what you know or you think you about Mexican food. If you care not only about the taste of food but also about texture, you're in for a treat. Every single bit is treat with subtly different flavors and textures. I wanted to lick my plate. I wish I had. Also, it worries me that the chicharrón gorditas were a special. Will they be there again next time I go for brunch? Will I ever be able to have them again?

"Had breakfast this past Saturday  while moving my daughter into her new  apartment in University City. I had the breakfast burrito, actually I had two breakfast buritos; one with bacon and another with sausage. Both burritos were delicious. All of the ingredients were fresh and I really appreciate that. I also enjoyed the chips and quac. Quac was tasty and not bland like most other places. I also enjoyed the atmosphere. Has that college town feel. The staff definitely had personality and were friendly and polite. I will definitely be back. My wife and daughter had the sweet potato taco and they enjoyed that as much as they enjoy sweet potato sushi. So that means they really liked it. Portion size was perfect for my wife and daughter and their hunger was satisfied with just one taco. I needed two burritos to fill the bottomless pit also known as my stomach but I am a big eater and enjoy good food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My brother and I tried this restaurant because a friend recommended it. We tried the ceviche mixto and their chicken. Both were very good but my favorite was the chicken. It was so flavorful and juicy that it was almost ridiculous. Their sangria was also very good, a little more spicy than ones I've tried at other restaurants. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the decor is great. My only complaint is that their chicken is served whole, so if you go in a party of two and the other person does not want chicken you have a ton left over, which can be a problem if your not planning to go home right after your meal. They are also pretty pricey, but it is Manahttan so I was willing to let that slide. Overall I had a good experience and would visit again if I was back in New York.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Yes it is a cheap and the 3 roll combo for $10 is a total deal but to be frank...you get what you pay for. Given the large number of sushi places in the city, let alone in that neighborhood, they have chosen price to be the focal point of their business. By offering cheap sushi they have carved their niche in the sushi community. Unfortunately though, the sushi is just bad. The three times I have ordered from Vic (I have never actually been in the building) the rolls were sad with the rice falling off and the ingredients tasted like they had wilted a bit. With raw fish and veggies, that is never a good thing. In my opinion, you can go to Mizu a block away and while you will pay more you get larger rolls which are fresher and taste better. Sorry Vic, but I just don't think you have the chops.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am a Vietnamese and I live within 1 mile from this restaurant, and I also frequently shop at the Chinese supermarket in the same plaza.  So I wanted so much to love this place but instead I wish this place goes out of business soon so another owner can make it better!  Most of the positive reviews here are either from non-Vietnamese customers that basically don't know what real Pho is or those with so much cash in pocket that think it is ok to spend $10+ for a Pho (Extra Large) that is the same size as small in other Pho restaurants.  The owner thinks he is justified to overcharge customers because his place is ""modern"" but I go there for good food and/or good price.  You get neither.  Pho soup here is tasteless, bowl size is pathetic, and meat is scarce.  Come on, we are talking about noodle and beef here.  Why so cheap with these cheap ingredients?  The other dishes are equally disappointing.  Like when I went one time with 3 other guys from work, we ordered a few dishes of shrimp rolls and I was amazed that the table got 1 peanut sauce dish.  Are you kidding me?  In all Pho places, each person gets a sauce for dipping.  Enough said.  Now each time I drive by to go to the Chinese market, I see that his place is mostly empty - exactly what the greedy owner deserves!","[0.0, 1.0]"
Stopped here today for a business lunch.  I had the fried chicken with a biscuit and buttermilk mashed potatoes.  It was standard comfort food with a little tweak.  For instance the mashed had a small amount of diced chive on the the top that just elevated the flavors past standard mashed.  The Fried chicken was moist and had the perfect crust.  I'm a huge fan of flakey biscuits and while these were more bread like the flavors were perfect.  I will be back here to try more and looking forward to trying some pies.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"Fries good. deep fried good. Dipping sauces good. This place has been on my to-do list in NYC for a few years. Since they only do one thing, I expect them to do it well. Pomme Frites definitely knows how to make fries. Got the small (just ate at Crif dogs) and I would be hard pressed to order anything bigger. I think I waited 5 minutes for my order as it was freshly made. Went with 3 sauces, and wasn't too adventurous. The interior is pretty small (think typical NYC spot) so I got my fries to go. They were still tasty and warm after heading back uptown. Honey Mustard: Nothing really special here. It was an above average HM and went well with the fries. Very sweet. Cheese sauce: Typical cheese sauce. Like I said, not adventurous. However, I would reco this as the size/texture of the fries works quite well with the cheese. Peppercorn Ranch: Was hoping it would be better than what it was. Maybe I just don't care for the combination. Probably should have tasted other sauces before getting this one. Definitely not bad, but I suggest getting a taste test first. 4 stars, great value for great fries. Go with the small and then head down St. Marks to Crif Dogs to have a wonderful meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

All of these items had been left below a heat lamp for too long, which instantly adds a grody flavor; we were one of four tables in the entire restaurant, so this was unnecessary and lazy.

"Just yesterday on the 27th of December I treated my parents to Umami Burger. I saw a post on amNY Umami Burger offers $8 burgers through end of year. I saw this, went on yelp and found out that they got pretty good reviews (970 reviews and a full 4 stars). Umami Burger. You can see their menu here if you're planning to head out tonight! Price-wise this place wasn't so bad for a place in Manhattan. Place is 2 floors with comfy atmosphere. Hit-music on the speakers and some nice staff I didn't speak to all of them but the bartenders seemed enthusiastic about their job which is always a plus. Seating wasn't too squished... bar on both floors. I dont know! go try it and see for yourself ^_^ The Truffle Burger My burger was the Truffle Burger (Truffle aioli, house truffle cheese, and truffle glaze), I had it medium-rear as recommended (best if looking for the strongest flavor). I would say this burger was simple yet delicious. The bun was soft to the touch (had to be freshly made) with a U embroidery for Umami. The embroidery had to be fresh too, crunchy to the bite (probably did it after it was made with a brander). The meat was juicy as expected with a medium-rear cook and with the combination of the truffle cheese it was heaven! Tasted like a Truffle Gouda cheese with high quality beef. Out of a scale from 1-10 I would rate this an 8. The Ahi Tuna Burger My moms burger was the Ahi Tuna Burger (seared sushi-grade hand-chopped ahi patty, daikon sprouts, crushed avocado, gingered carrots, wasabi flake, wasabi tartar). She doesn't eat beef so I was glad that the restaurant offered the same types of burgers but 'un-beefed'. They would replace it with anything of your choice. The bun is the same bun as any other burger. The Tuna was lightly seared on both side but mainly it is raw (like tuna sashimi). Overall, the burger was decent. This one I didn't really like but that is only because of the gingered carrots (sort of like the stuff they have next to wasabi in sushi plates where its sour). The ginger carrots messed up the whole burger. The crushed avocado was good sorta like guacamole. I believe this burger would go better without the gingered carrots that took away the concentrated flavor of the tuna that would have been paired nicely with the wasabi and avocados. I would rate this a 6 out of 10 but would probably be a 9 without the gingered carrots. This rating can vary with different individuals as this is a sushi-type item containing raw fish. The Manly Burger This is the manly burger (beer-cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami house ketchup, mustard spread) for manly people like me BUT I was upset I didn't get to try this burger out. I originally ordered it for me but the order got mixed up and I wanted my daddy to eat the good stuff. I can't really give an honest review on this besides that the bacon lardons were DELICIOUS. I would believe that this burger is really good based on the pairings. Onion strings were fried, bacon is one of the most-loved foods on earth and a medium rare beef patty. The burger should be crunchy and soft at the same time giving your mouth an orgasm. Just by the looks of it, it looks good but NEVER judge a book by its cover!! Tempura Onion Rings and Truffle Em' Fries I am a FAN of truffles! On the right you see the truffled fries which I rate a 10!!! Only bad thing is they dont put enough on it but the taste is AMAZING. The Onion rings on the left are called Tempura Onion Rings... I don't like them that much but they were made with huge chunks of onions but didn't really taste like onions... but fried food tastes good almost all the time so I don't know! maybe you would like them! Caramel Coffee Ice Cream 'Sandwich"" I don't think you can really call this a sandwich... I did not like this AT ALL. Terribly made, sandwiches should be at LEAST some-what soft. This was more like a hard cookie with coffee ice cream on it. I don't know if this wasn't fresh or that's how it usually is but I DO NOT recommend this. I feel like it would have tasted a lot better if it went with a bun instead or something soft instead of this hard cookie... I would rate this at a 3! In general, this place was a pretty nice experience. Burger-wise it was fantastic, it's pretty hard to find a good burger joint now. I always go exploring for food and it's HARDLY ever that when you say medium-rear it is actually medium-rear...","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've wanted to try chicken and rice here for YEARS - seriously. I've heard about it in high school; people would go at night, when I wasn't allowed out. I've heard a high school friend say that his parents drive 8 hours down to North Carolina (where we went to college) with boxes of frozen chicken and rice because he craved it so much. I've heard various reviews from my friends - from the ""absolutely phenomenal, incomparable"" to ""overrated."" I had to try it for myself. I was actually feeling slightly ill as we were walking to the Halal Cart, and I felt really anxious; please, pleease let me be able to eat this! I've wanted it for so long ... :( A friend bought me ginger ale and I sat on one of the benches around the corner. (Walk along the street where there's a halal cart on every corner, to the end of the block - there is A LOT of great seating). My other friends stood in line and I waited anxiously for my body to recover by the time they got back. It didn't fully recover, and my friends were worried that the chicken (and lamb) and rice would exacerbate my situation. It did not. Contrary to all expectations, every bite made me feel better, and I eventually started scarfing it down. The pita was delicious, tinged with meaty flavors and white sauce. We didn't get as much white sauce as I would've wanted, but the taste of the juicy chicken and lamb really came through. The Halal meat was delicious - not exceedingly flavorful, as I had expected, but lightly done so that the flavors of the chicken and the lamb were brought out. I usually HATE lamb, but I couldn't say no to my friend (whom I was sharing the chicken & lamb & rice with) because she likes lamb so much. For the first time ever, I actually really enjoyed it. YAY! All-around fantastic experience - made me feel better, made me enjoy lamb, and all for only $3 (since I shared it with a friend). Very filling, too. Fabulous. Be careful not to go to the wrong cart; there are quite a few on the corner of 53rd and 6th. That said, I still need to try other carts' chicken and lamb and rice.","[1.0, 0.0]"

MUST TRY STARTERS:   GRILLED SEASONED MEATBALL STICKS:  These are AMAZING!!  Unfortunately, they don't always have it because 1) there was high demand for it that day and they ran out or 2) it's the winter time and they can't grill these bad boys in the cold!  I usually call ahead to see if they have any that day or can put some aside for my visit! PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH:  This is a caramelized ground pork with various spices.  It is served with seasonal vegetables that you use to dip in the minced pork.  The smell may be tough for diners who are new to Southeast Asian cuisine, but it's a tasty must-try! MUST TRY FAMILY-STYLE DISHES: SOUPS:  I really enjoy ALL of their soups/stews.  But my friends and boyfriend's favorite is the SAH-LAW MACHEU KAHTEEH with the PORK RIB TIP.  It is a slow-simmered sour soup prepared with coconut milk base, fresh pineapple, and fresh basil.  The coconut and lemon grass makes it very tasty and aromatic.  It has A LOT of pineapples and we wish they had less pineapples and maybe add potatoes or carrots to balance out the sweet pineapples and to absorb the tasty broth.  It is served with pork ribs and tips.  It would be even tastier if there were more pork ribs because the meat on the bones are much more tender! CHA MUSSLES OR TALAPIA FILETS:  This dish is prepared and cooked in a special blend green curry mix and spice tossed with fresh basil.  WE LOVE THE CURRY and always ask for extra sauce, please!  Most diners order the mussels, but I prefer to order this dish with the fileted tilapia.  It really depends if I'm already ordering another fish dish or not.  If I order another fish dish, then I order this with the mussels.  If not, then I order this with the tilapia. WHOLE TALAPIA with Tamarind Sauce:  Some may be afraid of eating whole fish with the head and bones in tack.  But com'on, the rest of the world eats their fish this way - it's so much tastier.  I love the tamarind sauce that they give on the side - I pour it all over the fish. SO-SO DISHES: GRILLED BEEF STICK or GRILLED CURRY CHICKEN STICK:  These are ok - they can be dry and lack taste.  The Cambodian street vendors' sticks are tastier and more tender.  I would recommend the meatball sticks instead if you can eat pork. BOK LA-HONG:  It is a spicy papaya salad with fresh tomatoes.  I don't always order this because of the other great dishes, but sometimes I will if I feel like I ordered too much protein and need some more veggies in my meal. SKIP THIS DISH: PLEAH SACH-KHOE: The menu says that it is ""thinly sliced choice beef marinated in lime juice, lemongrass, khmer kitchen sauce and spices top with fresh herbs.""  The description sounds good and we've mistakenly ordered it a couple of times, forgetting that we didn't like this dish before.  I would suggest SKIPPING this dish.  The beef doesn't have much flavor and is not the best quality.  And the beef is not marinated - the sauce is served on the side.  Khmer Kitchen has so many other great dishes.  Skip this one. Man, I am salvating and want to go to Khmer Kitchen now!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My darling husband and I spent the night in Princeton. While escaping our role as responsible parents, we ate at this delightful, family friendly restaurant. The food was amazing and I love that it was a BYOB. I've read many reviews saying that the wait is long. So, we made reservations on line for 7 pm on a Saturday night. I completely expected to have to wait. Pleasantly, we walked in at 6:56 and were instantly seated. Based on an earlier review, I tried the Lobster bisque. AMAZING! It was not too creamy or heavy. No, it was just right and had lovely chunks of lobster! Yum! The Crab Guacamole was perfect, enough said. I also tried the Garlic Clams and linguine. I am officially ruined for this dish anywhere else. There was a perfect amount of spice and no chopped clams, just fresh, in shell. Overall, a wonderful experience. The only reason I rated this establishment 4 instead of 5 stars is because, it was too family friendly for me. I wanted a romantic evening with my love and ended up being seated next to and near children on all sides. I would go again and bring my kids.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The best place to grab some late night grub when you're partying hard in the city.  Even better when you're just a short car ride (or a short walk) away. The line for this place is ridiculous, but definitely worth it (even at 3 in the morning!). Got the lamb w/ rice for only $6!  Don't forget the white sauce, and stay clear of the hot sauce. If you do choose to test out the hot sauce, don't use too much or else you'll sweat and cry. Mm, I can't wait for another chance to go there. I bet the lines will be even worse come summertime!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Can't recommend it. We live nearby and have tried four times. First time was lunch, had nice pizza with egg on it. We enjoyed our first visit. The next three visits were not good. Food was ok, had some nice short ribs. But numerous issues - out off food selections, out of drink selections (tip-don't recommend a drink selection you only have one of!), poor service (four people but only got two drinks, bartender forgot the other two!). But really the main reason we will never go back is the incredibly in attentive and RUDE hostesses. We are nice people, always smile, say hello - we know you get what you give. So absolutely no reason to be treated like we are bothering them by trying to eat there. We are professionals, no kids, eat out a lot, and have a good time wherever we go - unfortunately can't here. Which is not good since we try to support our neighborhood businesses.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been excitedly waiting for Saigon Pho to open and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the Saigon Deluxe Pho and Beef Satay.  The Pho was excellent.  The broth was flavorful and not salty at all, lots of meat, and the right amount of noodle to meat ratio.  The Beef Satay was flavorful, but I would have liked a little more sear/ caramelization to it.  Price was about 1-2 dollars more than what I would pay in NYC or Brooklyn Chinatowns.  But considering gas and tolls, I am ok with paying the extra 1-2 dollars.  Restaurant is very clean, but we will have to check it out once it's been open longer.  Will definitely return!  Pay in cash in a bill over $30 and get 10% off, reservations have an 18% gratuity.  Table of 5+'have a 20%g gratuity.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I have been a loyal Geno's guy my whole life, but I have never had his competitor's product until yesterday. Yesterday I had a half of each a Geno's & a Pat's cheese steak, and split it with my brother. We ordered a Wiz without at both places. Geno's is not chopped and had more fat on it. It was also not as meaty! It was also kind of blah!  Price of a Geno's Wiz Without $9.00 Pat's was chopped up and I could taste the flavor! The rolls and the whiz were both a wash, both tasting just as good. Pat's Wiz without cost $9.50, I  guess the 50 cents was worth the flavor, when in the area the next time I am gonna go to Pat's King of Steak's to try a whole Wiz with and then I will make my final decision, but after yesterday I must say my loyalty is leaning towards Pat's. I must add that John's Roast Pork makes a far superior cheese steak, and that you should try theirs instead. Both Pat's & Geno's are riding on their reputation and is really just a big tourist trap. Seating is outside so make sure to dress accordingly, and to bring cash cause neither of the establishments accept plastic.  Also you order your sandwich at one window and drinks and fries at the other. I will give Geno's 3 stars and Pat's a 4! As do most yelpers.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Just got sandwiches from here, not my first time. I'm used to the staff being unpleasant but today it went to far. First as we were walking up both cooks were walking outside to smoke. They made us wait for them to finish then came in and did not wash their hands. They rudely took our orders and made fun of a call in customer for saying ""I would like to order some sandwiches."" Then a woman walked in and ordered a sandwich. The main guy stopped taking care of our order so he could harass this poor woman. Our sandwiches were done sitting on the counter but he rang her up first. It's bad enough that they didn't wash their hands and were rude but watching him sexually harass this woman made me decide to never go to paesano's again. I refuse to fund misogyny.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"El Rey attempt to be what Jose Garces' Distrito is, but fails horrible, on a grand scale I went here last night with my girlfriend for dinner, with high hopes of trying Starrs newest resturant. In terms of appearance, the lighting and overall atmosphere are all well suited for the overall resturant feel. we were told our wait would be 15 minutes, which ultimately turned into an hour. this wasn't unsurprising due to the relative ""compactness"" of the resturant. When we were finally seated, our waitor was relatively friendly and somewhat educted in the menu and it's specialties. We order the overpriced chips and guac, the entire time we felt that the chips were overly oily whereas the guac was lacking flavor but tttempted to mask it with large chunk of avacado in the guac. Next we had the campechana ceviche. the whitefish and shrip paired well but the ceviche sauce tasted like cocktail sauce from a can. An insult to an educated pallet. We continues to have the arabes taco and skirt steak. The plating of these items felt akward and unattractive, an though they were just thrown onto a oblong plate. The skirt steak was actually done well and was surprising flavorfull, but the arabes was overly dry. Due to our long wait our server brought us a complementary black bean enchilades. I've never been one to turn down free food, but after two bites of the extremely oily and bland enchilades I put it down, and decided to wait for our final course, Los moles. I was actually looking forward to trying this after being thoroughly dissapointed by everything else, but once it arrive it became much of the same. The dish was so-so, for lack of a better word, with no clear  winner between the three choices of mole Negro with lamb, poblano with chicken, or the pipian rojo with pork. We didnt finish any of them infact, and choose to skip dessert. Our overall dining experience wasn't negative, due to the friendly staff and decor to distract you, but the food was not creative or innovative in an manner. As a whole if you are looking for quality tapas style dining you'll be better served and more satisified if you go to Distrito. Steven Starr receives an epic fail for this attempt.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The bread that came on the side was pretty terrible, but luckily wasn't the selling point for me, so I wasn't too upset.

"Tatany 52 was affordable and maybe the best all around Japanese restaurant in the 5 boros. It was the only restaurant opened on 911 in the area filled with Japanese tourists and us. It was open that week when most restaurants in the area were closed. It closed shortly after 911 and tons of bars opened  up. 911 changed NYC in ways you can't imagine. Culturally, the way we live our lives the way we eat and live. Sake Bar Hagi is as close to Tatany  52 as I have seen since 911.The only difference is the sushi is not as good as Tatany 52. Maybe if the economy improves it will be. The stand outs were the fried pizza which tasted like Zeppole's, best as an appetizer because at least for me it's not good to eat too much fried food. But it was nice more like a dessert. The bacon Asparagus and Pork belly were good both served at Tatany 52 and just as good. Emi had Uni my husbands favorite but it must have been a special. It wasn't on the menu. The Salmon was good and my hubby said the beer was super cold and delicious! The weaknesses of the dinner we had were the Duck Skewer which was dry, the corn dog and the Tuna salad  which as I said wasn't bad but I could tell it was not Blue Fin. Possibly as the economy recovers they will get Blue Fin. I am allergic to shell fish only he tasted the Octopus balls. He said the Octopus Balls were not that good.

"We consider ourselves ""foodies"" and we had plans to go a nice place on 11/3/2012. We had reservations at a restaurant that on the surface was amazing, but after looking at some reviews, it seemed like we would be better postponing our dinner for something ""amazing.""   We googled ""molecular gastronomy"" and we found Marigold Kitchen.  We called MK the night we cancelled our other reservation, but they did not have a table available  ( I called twice hoping they would have an opening) Nevertheless, we made a reservation for 11/10/2012. We were patienly awaiting our reservation. When we arrived, it was a humble atmosphere. One where you could feel completely comfortable considering the level of food we were about to experience. We chose the 5 course tasting menu with the fish and meat as the dinner options. That was only the beginning! They served about 7 amuse-bouche's. The dinner was so amazing, but the amazing tastings you will experience before you even have your meal are enough to talk about to everyone you know. We had truffle popcorn frozen with nitrogen, so when you bite into it, smoke comes out of your mouth! We also had Halibut ceviche, Caprese Salad Dippin Dots! (unbelievable), ravioli with salted chocolate, a homemade craker with cheese that oozes out of your mouth when you bite into in (and many more). The kitchen seems capable of anything you dream/imagine. The five course meal was just as imaginative and creative as anything you could dream. The desert  was an experience as well.

"I truly wanted to like this place. My husband and I were very excited after returning from our honeymoon in Portugal to find that Newark had a plethora of places to choose from. Unfortunately, we chose wrong. Our first tip off should have been when we called looking to make a reservation, and the person in the other end was short with my husband, told him not to worry and then hung up the phone. Our second clue should have been that no one was there eating when we arrived. Third, we were greeted by an older waiter who started by rolling his eyes at us for asking to be seated. The same waiter could not be bothered to pay us any attention at all as we looked at the menu. The service only got worse as the meal went on. He barely looked our way and rolled his eyes whenever we had a question. We both got the sinking feeling that it was because we weren't from the neighborhood, ie- we do not speak Portugese. The other two tables of customers were Portugese and the wait staff were on them like glue. I've never felt so uncomfortable in an establishment in all my life. Adding to this, the food was awful. The seafood rice had chewy seafood and lots of broken shells. It was listed at $15, and we were charged $17. The grilled cod my husband got was barely edible- the fish had zero taste, the broccoli rabe was beyond bitter and the potatoes were no good. I don't know how you mess up potatoes, but they did. Suffice it to say, we barely ate our meals, asked for the check (that took way too long to receive), paid and left without a word from anyone. Terrible experience. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My first visit to Sazon was with a large group of gluten-free diners, and the owners were very accomodating. For a fixed price, we were able to try a number of dishes family style, rather than ordering 12+ separate dishes. Our meal included the following dishes: Domino arepitas (appetizer-sized portions of the Domino arepa - black beans and white cheese in a corn patty) Ensalada Mixta - their house salad Fried sweet plantains - starchy and sweet Arroz con pollo Asado Negro (by far the best dish that night! beef slow roasted in brown sugar can and garlic - it melted in my mouth and everyone at the table kept going back for more) Pabellon Vegetariano (grilled tofu with portabella mushrooms, tomato sala, and served with brown rice and black beans) I would go back for the Asado Negro alone! There's another dish that I have yet to try that sounds similar to one of my favorite Filipino dishes, Bistek Encebollado. Sazon is also well-known for their hot chocolate concoctions. The owner takes pride in combining ingredients for any kind of chocolate craving you could imagine. This drinking chocolate is not for the faint of heart - I actually felt slightly hyper after drinking the Calabaza King (creamy chocolate with fresh pumpkin, pecan, nutmeg, cardamom, and cinnamon)...it was like drinking a chocolate pumpkin pie. The El Orgasmo is like a peanut butter cup with a hint of banana. When the weather permits (usually when it's colder outside) fresh chocolate truffles are also available. Reasonable prices, nice ambiance, and friendly owners. Definitely worth checking out.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"What the hell is wrong with this place?  Seriously,  DO NOT WANT! The food was just not that good for the long ass wait we had, and the prices were a bit out of line.    This is the only menu I've ever seen where it tells you both that you will have an unreasonably long wait for your food (15-20 minutes) and to hurry up and eat (be mindful of those waiting)..   Seriously, that takes some balls. I had convinced my breakfasting companion to come here since so many people were talking about it. We were thankfully seated straight away by some rude waiter.  It took forever for a waitress to come over and then 25 minutes for the food to come once we had finally ordered.  Again, it was good but not OMG I CAN WAIT 25 MINUTES FOR BREAKFAST good.   The crowd was an annoying mix of yuppies, hipsters, and your general not from Philadelphia scene of jerkwads ( That is the only reason I can think of why this place does so well is that it's a ""quaint"" place for people to be seen.  So that you can say you ate at Morning Glory and everyone can nod accordingly and mummer about how great their food is and how surly the service is.  I can't not stand this crap.  Where the hell were all the black people?

"Despite having a Groupon, at the end of the meal I felt that Catas was worth full price. First, their wine list is extensive and their glasses are BIG. Their house wines & sangrias are very good. Secondly, their prices are very fair for both tapas & entrees, so you could easily come here for just tapas or just entree and be happy -- and not break the bank. Finally, the food is delicious. We tried two tapas and two entrees, and for tapas we ordered a seafood salad, which was lightly pickled and had a good mix of different seafoods (not just tuna) and came in a little dish, and a roasted octopus leg, which was thick, tender, and wonderfully spiced. For entrees, we ordered the whole roasted fish, which was delicate, flaky, and filled the plate, and a sausage-stuffed chicken breast. Both came with a delicious sauce and perfectly cooked vegetables that balanced the main dish well. They also were totally cool about the groupon, the fact that we used opentable to make the reservation, and so on -- it's nice to go to a restaurant that doesn't freak out about the internet.

Maybe it was just a busy night, but this doesn't strike me as a place to expect a long, leisurely dinner. The restaurant is very cozy (some might say tight) and we were in and out very quickly. Great food, though.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The restaurant never explicitly or implicitly stated that there was a cancellation fee if a reservation was cancelled, rescheduled, or provided any time frame to cancel without penalty or if a cancellation was made. Needless to say that we had to cancel approximately 2  1/2 hours before our 5:00 pm reservation for Sunday (May 18-2014) or try to reschedule for a different day. Cancellation was made because two seniors in our party, 85 and 79 years old on wheel chairs took ill. A fact which was made known to the Manager, Mr. Justin Bothir who insisted that there was going to be a cancellation fee and that reservation for a later day, Monday was not available. To quote him, Mr. Bothir responded, ""no"", ""no"", we are fully booked. My wife then interjected to the phone conversation stating that it was the first time a cancellation fee was mentioned, and that it's not right. Our daughter then called the restaurant back and the manager stated to her that there is nothing he can do, but he later told our daughter after consulting with the owner, Mr. Avi Szapiro he could only give a restaurant credit for the $275 charged to the card for a future dinning. This was in line with our initial suggestion to reschedule for another date and make up the cancellation, even if penalty for cancellation was not relayed to us while the reservation was made, as well as during our 3 subsequent contact with the restaurant after the initial reservation was made. Anyway, my daughter's reaction to the restaurant's offer, was that, it's not fair, that her family came from out of town, and she's graduating leaving town, and that would not work. My wife then got on the phone, to see if she could reschedule for the next day (Monday), as I indicated earlier, but got the same response of ""no"" ""no"" that they're fully booked. However, we subsequently learnt from ROIA's website that the restaurant closed on Mondays; so was ROIA fully booked for the next day Monday or closed per ROIA's website? However, later in the day (Sunday May 18) at approximately 3-30pm the manager then called our daughter left a voice mail message that the best he can do is credit back $75 to the card. We were willing to work with the restaurant to honor either the restaurant credit for $275 for a future dining, or more than the $75 or all of the $275 credited back to my credit card. Subsequent calls and messages left for Mr. Bothir or the restaurant owner Mr. Szapiro are not being returned nor has any credit back to the credit card been made. I was left with no choice but to file a dispute for the unauthorized charge with my credit card services, and would go to small claims court if a positive resolution does not result from the disputed claims. It's a matter of fairness and having an ""explicit policy stating the penalties, if any, for cancellation of reservations"" which was nonexistent in our case at all times, but surreptitiously  became so only when we called to cancel or reschedule. Dining at SOULE DE CUBA (Friday), PACIFICO (Saturday), RUDY'S (Tuesday lunch), and especially ROIA's replacement and the highlight of all, from the 19th floor breathtaking view, cuisine to service; the JOHN DAVENPORTS at the Omni rescued our Negative Management experience with the ROIA.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A great lunch option! Ordered delivery from here half a dozen times with no complaints. Food always arrived ridiculously fast and fresh -- and you can't beat the price. An order of chicken tortilla soup is salty and comforting, full of tender shredded chicken and rice, and enough to last two meals. The tortillas come plain and wrapped in aluminum foil for you to shred and sprinkle on top of your soup; I typically just skip it. The pork, chicken and steak tacos were all delicious, served with fresh lime, onions and cilantro on corn tortillas. I'd recommend the shredded pork before anything else. Don't forget to get Jarritos Mexican soda, too!

"finding good sushi has been tough but the friend house was a pleasant surprise. we have driven by this place a million times without any thought. but one day my husband just drove there and made me get out of the car. i was totally thinking...i am so not eating here. first of all, its called the friend house. there are no cars here. and its probably another horrible version of  asian fusion. it was still their inbetween serving hours from lunch to dinner...but we were let in and served immediately. hence, the no cars. its actually pretty nice inside. simple and calming. the servers are very attentive. we ordered soups for apps and had the spicy maki combo and one of their specialty rolls and .... it was good. not the best but definitely surpassing ""good enough"" to satisfy any sushi craving. i guess since it takes 2 years to master the art of sushi rice...that's always weighs heavy on my ratings. the only con is that they put crunchies in much of their rolls and i dont like crunchies. good to know for next time...their fish is super fresh and if you want to order the MP marked items on the menu, we were told to call in a day ahead. i have to admit...i dont think i'd order the fusion entrees...but never say never! i recommend this place for sushi. you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised as well.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This rating is based solely on my experience at lunch, where I ordered the Pork Olive sandwich. The service was awesome - very ""mom 'n pop"" - and was also quite fast. The meatballs in this one were a beef/veal/pork combo, which lent a very tender and moist quality, while still having a great firmness. (The fact that I'm talking about meatballs like this is disturbing, but it's also unavoidable.) From its menu description, I thought it was going to be a bit dry, so I asked for a side of marinara, just in case. Served on a soft, chewy roll with heaping mounds of kalamata olive tapenade and generous slices of piave vecchio cheese, there was no need for the additional sauce. The sandwich was nicely balanced and quite flavorful. With 4 meatballs, I was able to make 2 meals out of it for just under $9. My lunch mate had the ""classic"" beef meatballs with marinara and aged provolone. He said it was rather ordinary, so I don't think I'd recommend it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

When I was more insistent he asked if I wanted to speak to a manager , yes I said....then he walked over to fetch someone. The 'manager' apparently told this guy to give me a bag.

"I have been coming here 1-2 times per week for about 6 years now. The food is consistent and delicious. First, let me debunk some of these bad reviews: The guy who said that Cluck has the smell of curry engraved in it? That's not true at all. That's the smell of cayenne pepper in the sauces. When the sauce comes in contact with the grill it carmelizes and smells like curry. And even if it did smell like curry, that would make sense. The place next door is an Indian restaurant. So your review is just uneducated and silly. Some people are saying the food has been dry? In all the times I have been there that has not been a problem. In all my experience there, I have gotten the mini-bites almost every time with traditional sauce. Then I do the side of Fries with cheese & gravy.  I recently started getting a side of ranch for the mini-bites and it is great. If I don't do mini-bites, I have the boneless chicken strips. Order 5, and get 6 or 7. There is a lot more meat in those, so they are more filling. The service is exactly what you would expect. A couple high schoolers working the register, they have never screwed up my, or any of my friends, orders. The food is consistent, and the location is very clean. The only problem I have ever had is the location is the parking. There is only 6/7 spots out front, but that has never actually been an issue. If those are taken, there are a handful of spots in the back always open.","[1.0, 0.0]"

And while I was initially reluctant to try the coffee (served from big urns), it was truly amazing (no acid stomach)!  Check-out this local coffee roaster, a worthy alternative to  Center City-centric La Colombe: oneworldcoffee.org/about… Wonderful service!  Despite the emergence of expectant diners outside, I was able to sit for an hour, enjoy my book, the local scene, and take a box for 7/8 of my frittata and a go-cup for coffee (both cheerfully provided @ no extra charge).

"Being my first time here, I found this to be a positive experience overall.  However, there are two things that come to mind that cast a negative light on this risotto paradise.  Firstly, the wait to be seated was un-nerving.  Admittedly, this is the sign of a highly regarded restaurant; but, were it not for my company, I may have been inclined to incite a riot.  The aforementioned delay in seating is problematic because there is no appropriate place to wait. Patrons are left to either wait outside or fight for a little piece of real estate in the form of a ledge by the door.  This leads to my second minor issue with Risotteria (and I suppose everyone's issue with NYC in general) -- space. There is one long row of bench seating along the wall with what seems to be on long table (actually many little tables) and then chairs on the opposite side of the bench.  If you can imagine, I felt like the portrait of ""The Last Supper"" was a point of view shot and the disciples were strangers as I dined with Jesus.  It was very tight and if you are looking for privacy, you probably shouldn't go here. Conversely, the service was good.  The food bordered excellence, although I did catch myself occasionally wishing I ordered what one of the ""disciples"" were eating.  While crowded, another perspective would be that it was a place where you could go to make new friends for the hour and it represents a trendier, gluten free version of a big Italian dinner. The wine was better than I expected, and all in all I hope to go here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Mexican food is my favorite; I've been to many restaurants looking for the perfect Mexican food. Mexican Mariachi is by far my favorite restaurant ever. I've had the Speedy Gonzaléz which I would recommend to anyone who likes steak. They always cook it to tender perfection whilst every strip of beef is meticulously selected for quality as I have never seen a piece of gristle in it from the fifty or so orders I've had of it. The chicken fajitas are excellent as well. The chicken always perfectly tender and never over or under seasoned ( get the side of guac for only a dollar it will be delicious :] ) Last but not least The Trés Leches is my addiction. I order it every week as much as I can. The best dessert I have ever had hands down, two thumbs up & five stars with a 11 out of 10 rating. I've never tried trés leches before I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I've found the best dessert in the world that I try to eat every day of my life. If you like mexican food or food in general check this place out! You will not be disappointed. In fact: you will probably return from the amazing quality accompanied by a more than reasonable price.

"On Twenty is my favorite spot in Hartford. It's worth the drive from Wallingford for me although whenever I feel like being indulgent, I take a half day from work  (I work in the Hartford area), get dressed up with my other half and meet him here for a long lunch. The setting is very intimate; if you want more intimacy then you can rent a private dining room (we do). The service is impeccable and it's like they anticipate your every need prior to them coming to the table. The food? Culinary masterpiece. The menu changes so there isn't a need to go into detail but we've yet to have a bad dish. The waiter will also explain each dish so your mouth is watering before the food gets to the table. I enjoy the fact that this is only open for lunch during the week and dinner on Fridays. It's one of the last few places where you can enjoy great food in an intimate and adult setting without worrying about the stroller set destroying your dining experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"One of my absolute FAVORITE bars in the city! I've tried tons of appetizers & entrees on the menu & have loved each and every one. My favorite entree is the cajun tilapia (mmm!). They have an awesome rotating beer selection on draft & tons of great bottled belgian beers. I tend to go on sundays when Michelle is behind the bar - as she is one of the very best bartenders in the city! The staff always make you feel welcome & at home. Every bartender plays music from their own ipod so there's always great tunes. It's basically the Cheer's of Fairmount Park, but smaller. If you haven't been, you have to get in here. Try & get in early since there's a limited number of seats at the bar. It's totally worth the cab ride!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I forget how much I love Spanish food then I go to a place like this... Every dish was so good.  From the simple peppers grilled with salt, through the perfectly cooked dates wrapped in bacon, stuffed with manchego cheese, the bacon perfectly crispy and scorched and smokey and the date sweet and soft, oh my god perfection--through an outstanding piece of fish with root vegetables, not to forget a heavenly crema caremel (all chased by sangria, then a glass of rioja)...this was quite the evening. Not to mention a hip setting, loud and buzzy and energetic but somehow with just the right acoustics that you can still talk to your date. Yea baby, loved this place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The ambiance is great, the service is super professional and polite, the bartenders make the best cocktails and they give awesome recommendations! What do they put in their food? Magic? I will try to explain this glorious meal... We had the octopus, the mushroom appetizer, the quail, the orecchiette, and the hazelnut torte. The mushrooms: do not pass on these, unless you DON'T want to know what heaven tastes like. It's topped with ricotta, pancetta and an egg on top. The charred octopus was seasoned so well, the orecchiette with sausage and the quail were cooked so perfectly. You taste all the flavors that go into the dish. It's exquisite.

"I went there with two friends and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The place was packed despite it being a rainy Monday, but we were seated promptly for our 8pm reservation. Each of us ordered one appetizer and one entree, and their sweetbread appetizer & escargot appetizers must have been one of the best I've had in the city. Their seafood ceviche, however, was a disappointment both on the plate and on our palates... It's not their specialty, after all. The entrees were very good, but not as memorable as the appetizers, I wished I had ordered two appetizers instead... We were also excited to read great reviews about their desserts, but the two we shared were a bit too sweet and kind of boring. All 3 of us loved their espresso and coffee, as well as the festive atmosphere and great service. Although I prefer to go somewhere more quiet for a date, it's a great place to dine with a group of friends. With a bottle of very tasty and very reasonable red wine (around $40), we spent about $80 per person after tip. Not cheap, but certainly well worth it for their solid performance on food, wine, and service.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've heard that service at Landmarc is bad, but thought that ppl just love to complain and  honestly expected way better service of that kind of restaurant in TriBeCa. Went there on Thursday night with friends for special occasion. They gave us a table right the way-perfect. But than we were waiting for a wine list for a while and no one came to the table even to say hi and welcome. Finally we got the list (menus are on the table already). Our waitress were nice, friendly and helpful in the beginning. Everything went well. Food was OK. Again, not for that kind or restaurant. File mignon and rib eye were same quality as u can get from a diner but twice more cheaper. When we finished our main courses we were waiting for someone to clean the table for, no joke, about a half an hour.  Finally when someone cleaned it we asked for coffees and check together, cuz didn't want to wait again and ask for breakfast menus, cuz that would be perfect time for it.

"Being at Diner on weekends reminds me why I have a distaste for the word ""brunch."" My friend and I stood awkwardly in the doorway in wait for 30 minutes, all the while having to make room for wait staff to get by and getting rammed by the door every time someone entered or exited. Inside and outside this place on weekends, you can often witness the quintessential ""new williamsburg"" hipster scene. I once spotted a guy sporting zany red-framed glasses with no actual lenses. Pratt student from Indiana, or plain douchebag? Some things I'll never know. Despite my qualms with the brunch scene, I give this restaurant 5 stars with no hesitation. The wait staff is lovely and warm-hearted. The food and ingredients are tops, and the prices (though people here are complaining) are fine by me for the quality of the fare. I've savored every bite of my egg sandwich special, which had Diner's signature pickled red onions inside. I love their omelettes and recently devoured a highly-satisfying grassfed cheeseburger. And consequently fell into the deepest food coma ever known to man. Diner isn't crowded on weekday afternoons, when the scenesters seem to have re-hibernated at their dayjobs in midtown or the local low-volume boutiques. This is when I attack.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place serves Polish ""soul food"" in a setting that most folks of Eastern European decent would say feels like home. When I was in Warsaw a number of years ago, I was impressed that the restaurants there were breaking away from the classic ""cook it till it's dead"" style of Eastern European cu sine that I grew up with. Lomzynianka is definitely old school and not new wave. That being said, it is good old school. I started off with mushroom barley soup. I had expected a clear stock with lots of mushrooms and barley. What I got was a hearty cream soup with a few mushrooms and lots of potato chunks. Good but not what I expected. As a main course I had the bigos...classic and good. Two of my companions had the Polish platter and one had the roast chicken. No complaints there as well. Serving are large and the prices are cheap. If you want to sample the real thing in the old style, I'd pay a visit. I'll be back to try other classics as well.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Bad - Salads aren't the typical salad you would imagine - Place is small and cramped - Ran out of whole wheat pita (pita didn't taste as good as i imagined) - Tabouli-- eh...has a weird taste to it The Good - Falafel-- I typically dislike falafels but I gave this place a chance since Bobby Flay lost to the owner; it sure lived up to its name....the three types of falafels were fantastic - Eggplant salad--- this is good....seems like salsa to me so just slab some of this to the pita bread with your falafel and bam! - Moroccan Carrots-- this is kinda normal but its good; just carrots with flavor - Israeli Salad-- nothing special but its not bad...its diced up version of a typical salad The Bottomline- Come here for falafels only.

I've tried other places in chinatown but they are all gross or have cockroaches running around (Hand to god, I saw it at Penang).

"Had the two8two burger and enjoyed it.  It was juicy and the bun, though wimpy, was good.   Everything else needs work. The burger didn't come with lettuce and tomato or pickles.  Apparently you need to ask.  And the fries are extra.  The 4 dollar ""Greek Fries"" are ill conceived.  The Feta simply falls off, so you're left with fries and side of crumbled cheese.   My waiter was ""not a beer person"" so he wasn't able to point us in the direction of a tasty beer.  If you're a waiter at a burger and beer joint and you don't like beer, at least pick the brain of someone who does and get informed.   The decor of the bar is great and the staff is pleasant.  And they have the most important thing, the burger, down.  There is room for the place to improve.  But unless they actually do improve, I wouldn't recommend.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"So this place has a lot going for it and I wanted to absolutely love it. As others have said, the interior is super cute, the horchata is authentic, and the patio is huge. I stopped by here with my boyfriend on our way home from the shore a couple weeks ago and we were starving. We ordered a slew of tacos and then saw the total on the register: $35?!?! Seriously? I have never paid that much for a bunch of little tacos in my life. For an authentic taco joint, those are not authentic taco prices. The tacos were good. They were not amazing, but they were good. They were a little dry for my liking, but we still ate every bite. If the price had been $10 less, I would give this place 4-stars, but the food isn't worth the price here. I am lucky I had that much cash on me! Maybe their rent has gone up in recent times since it seems like others have commented that the prices are very good.

"I was really excited to try it finally since it was hyped up by my colleagues. I even had a ""pre-taste"" of their salted caramel dessert since my colleague brought it in to work- and it was absolutely delicious. So with high hopes I headed in for my 10:15pm Friday night reservation. We had brussel sprouts, bone marrow, meatballs, gnocchi, and a few other things that just weren't that memorable. Brussel sprouts were delicious. Bone marrow was not so great itself, but with combination of flavors from the plate, it was good. Meatballs were horrendous - just overly salted and mushy. As for the gnocchi, I've never had anything more oily in my life. The gnocchi itself was slightly crisped on the outside and tender elsewhere, but then literally drenched in oil. Then finally dessert came which just wasn't as delectable as I remembered. Service was decent, however we had to wait a good 10 minutes to finally wave down the server for the check.

"3rd time feasting here. 3rd time here in a medium size group (6 to 7 people). 3rd time on an early Saturday evening (5pm). 3rd time the food was amazing. Sadly, 1st time the service was not friendly. Quite honestly - it was cold and unappetizing, and we even discussed going to a different restaurant. 1st & 2nd time there was no problem with separate checks. But tonight, for unknown reasons other than we were told ""It's Saturday night,"" we could not get separates. This really threw a wrench in the works for the group. Pleas of ""We've gotten thembefore on a Saturday"" got nowhere. We're told we could get the check spilt into 3 groups, which we thought would be manageable. But when it arrived - one lump group check. Lots of calculating. Lots of scrambling for correct cash. It all worked out in the end, but there was no true reason why we couldn't get separates except that the waitress simply did not want to be bothered. And that, for me, is not a good reason at all.

Dessert was also well executed.  I would hesitate to call this place spectacular or elite, but it is amazingly solid and consistent.  It's a regular in my rotation and doesn't seem to be in danger of falling out anytime soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place seems to have worked out most of the kinks that plagued their opening, such as closing in the middle of lunch prime time because they ran out of meat.  Now, months later, I finally made another visit due to an extreme burger craving.  The burger definitely hit the spot, but the experience was almost ruined by the fries.  Not sure why I'm reading so many rave reviews for the truffle fries because mine were so greasy and salty that I needed my milkshake constantly.  I still ate the fries, mind you, but I feel I may regret it later.  I was trying to give them their due because of the rave about them and I'd never had truffle fries before, but the salt and oil made it too hard to distinguish any significant difference from regular fries.  I think the shake could've used a bit more strawberry also, because it often tasted plain with just hints of strawberry, although that may have been the result of the salty-ass fries.  Oh, and $12.50 plus tax for a cheddar cheeseburger, truffle fries and a shake?  I dunno... it's really just a step above typical fast food, maybe two steps actually, so the price is about right for the location.   While I'm not an aficionado, I do get the occasional craving and have had my share of good burgers.  I didn't expect it to be as pink as it was inside when I ordered medium but it was juicy and tasty.  I may go back to give them another chance to get the fries right, but the burger was on point.  The portions were just right too.  Just the right amount of fries, over a quarter pound of meat and a good size shake (maybe 16oz?).  If you don't get the combo, the burger alone might be a bit underwhelming at glance but I think American portions are too big anyways generally.  I'm 6 feet tall, 190lbs and I was full after the combo, without getting the ""itis."" Bottom line:  a decent burger joint.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The decor inside is a real selling point, even if you are just there for drinks.  There is a huge double sided fireplace, so you can feel the warmth at both the bar and in the dining area.  The cozy dark wood and exposed brick walls really added to the feeling that we had escaped the storm to hole up in front of the fire.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Really amazing food, really amazing atmosphere. I felt out of place bc I wasn't as dressed up as I probably should of been, but nobody treated me any different. Haven't been to a nice Italian Restaurant like this since Faces was still open in Waterbury. Everything we had was better than we thought it'd be, portions were huge. Prices were kind of high, but that's expected from a place that's more upscale. Our waitress was weird. And I know another table thought so too. Just her mannerisms were odd and it was hard to hear her when we was talking. Maybe she was just nervous?? Not sure, but all the other waitresses we saw didn't seem to be acting that way. She did mention she was new and used to be a nurse, she had asked us how rental rates were for apartments in the area (?) So who knows. Was maybe two months ago that we were there so I don't even know if she's there anymore or not.

"The parentals felt like eating chaat (a popular variety of snacks served on the streets of India) and our go to place was closed on Mondays. A search for chaat on Yelp pulled up Delhi Chaat House in the list of local results and a glimmer of hope lit up in my mind. A restaurant with chaat in its name might have potential to serve some amazing plates that the parents were craving for. As we pulled into the Royal Plaza Shopping Center, it was apparent that a restaurant which we loved at first and loved to hate a few months later (thanks to two horrible incidents) was gone and what stood in its place was the brand new Delhi Chaat House. Ordered a papri chaat, an aloo tikki chaat, an aloo tikki burger and a tandoori paneer. When my aloo papri chaat arrived, I realized that I had forgotten to mention 'no yogurt'. The waiter had not asked about food allergies either and I'm mildly lactose intolerant and try to avoid it given the choice. Oh well whatever. A first bite revealed a punjabi homestyle chaat which was no surprise given the new owners but one of the ingredients was a bit too cold (read straight out of the fridge a little prior and onto the plate) and that was....you guessed it right - the yogurt. The papri was crispy and tasted fine. My mother said that her aloo tikki chaat was alright but nothing spectacular. The tandoori paneer arrived sizzling on a skillet mid way through our chaat course. The presentation on this plate was good and the paneer itself was grilled quite nicely, but under-seasoned. The accompanying mint chutney was very sad. If one muddles mint a lot,  the fresh flavor changes to a slightly grassy and bitter one and this seemed to be the case with it. The restaurant has more potential if the new owners put extra care and effort in producing sublimely tasty and homestyle dishes. Whatever we had tonight seemed like a half-baked attempt. We will give this place another shot to be fair and to try some of their entrees. But for now we would say that whatever we had on our first visit, was quite forgettable in the grand scheme of things.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Paulie Gee's is the place to be! Oui Oui! Mama Mia, Papa Pia! Pizza Pizza! When it comes to pizza, Paulie Gee's knows where it's at. FOOD: Delicious! We ordered two pies as we were advised that is a good amount for a party of two. It was just the right amount. We were satisfied and not super stuffed. We had the: - Cherry Jones: An amazing blend of sweet and salty at the same time. Makes your mouth explode. If you are not a huge cherry fan, don't worry, you won't even realize they are cherries. The prosciutto and mozarella cheese had a great contrast and complement to the bing cherries. A MUST HAVE!!! - Hellboy: One of their staples! You can't not come here and not have this pie either. Fair warning, it's got quite the spicy kick to it. HONEY ON TOP? Who would have thought? It provides a surprising and delicious complement to the spiciness of this pie. The spicy isn't overwhelming but it does linger on. The sopresatta is delicious and you will not be disappointed with this pie. SERVICE: Very attentive and sort of Brooklyn trendy as well. Can be a bit rushed at times to bring dishes but don't take it the wrong way, they are just busy sometimes. We came at 5:15 PM and it wasn't too busy. If we had got there at 6 PM there would have been a 30 min wait. Paulie Gee walks around and greets you and gets your feedback so it's nice to see the owner care for his business like that. He did promise me a drink that he never followed up on, so that was a little disheartening, but all good. No harm, no foul. ATMOSPHERE: Has a industrial, wine cellar vibe. I love seeing the oven in the far back and all the furniture and fixtures similar but nothing is exactly the same. The place has a very dim lighting and can seat small or large parties. They have a bar seating area as you come in and a decent amount of space for people who are waiting. I would recommend coming at 5-6PM as the wait can get long when the weather gets warm. SUMMARY: GREAT place for some of Brooklyn's finest pizza. I would definitely come back and bring friends to try. I would suggest two of the finest signature dishes in the Hellboy and the Cherry Jones. If you are near Greenpoint, this is a must have!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"LOVE. so much love for this place. Let's just say my family and boyfriend know this is where I want to go on special occasions.  I love the atmosphere, the lemon drop martinis and the hawaiian ribeye.  It brings me so much joy!  There is usually a long wait here but you can find some space at the bar to grab a drink and/or appetizer.  Some people even decide to eat at the bar-but if you are down to wait and/or make a reservation the booth seats are nice and comfy.  This location usually has live music in the evening (nice touch!). Appetizers: Spinach artichoke dip, cheesy bread (this isn't the real name and its not on most menus) but they should know what you are talking about, caesar salad Main course: Hawaiian Ribeye (order it medium- anything else is just too well done), Burgers, Ribs, Salmon, Crab Cakes (I also heard the prime rib sandwich is great-I'll be trying that next time) Sides: Loaded Baked potato, coleslaw, spinach Dessert: not really a fan (but last time I ordered the sundae and was happy with it!) The waiters are typically really on point here. They work under team like conditions.  Your waiter might not be the one around to help you but someone will be. I definitely recommend! (going to Houston's in Jersey is slightly cheaper though!)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I dined solo and the service was fantastic and friendly. The miso was quite nice, with silky tofu cut in a big slab. The avocado salad was perfectly underdressed. I thought that the Sushi entree was rather small for the price and the rolls, though delicious, were terribly small. They had nice, fresh fish that was well cut and prepared. They just need to upsize all the sushi and rolls by about 20% to make it appropriate. If not for that detail, I would give them 4 stars!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Before my visit here on Monday night, I only knew chef/owner Scott Conant from his terse comments as one of the harsher judges on the ""Chopped"" competition series on what else, the Food Network. I didn't even know he owned Scarpetta although I had heard about the place from my East Coast friends for the past several years. Lucky me I was in New York on the first day of a new job, a business trip with my manager and a local colleague, and as it turned out, we are all foodies. The first thing that strikes you when you enter Scarpetta is how incredibly dark it is. I get the cosmopolitan ambiance they are trying to capture here, but personally I found it a bit excessive given how much effort is placed on the presentation of the food at least judging from the website. Funny thing is I just read about a new app on TechCrunch called Chefs Feed in which famous chefs list their absolute favorite dishes at other chefs' restaurants. I downloaded it and found the $19 Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms mentioned with gusto by Chris Santos of Beauty & Essex. By coincidence, I recently saw the tail end of an episode of the Food Network's ""The Best Thing I Ever Made"" where Conant was making his signature dish. Sold. It was sensational - luxuriant with the chicken-infused morels and preserved truffles almost as velvety as the cream-based polenta itself (see photo). My dining companions agreed. But even before the polenta came one of the best bread baskets I think I've ever devoured. It was filled with not only thick slices of rustic Italian bread and foccacia but unexpected slabs of Stromboli oozing with salami and mozzarella, all of which was quickly devoured (see photo). The three condiments were almost unnecessary, but they were excellent - a buttery mascarpone, a citrus-herb-infused extra virgin olive oil, and an eggplant caponata. Just as we were savoring the polenta, the $25 Short Rib Agnolotti arrived, and the platter presented melt-in-your-mouth pieces of short rib into a ravioli-like folded pasta and blended them with root vegetables in a horseradish brown butter (see photo). Gone too soon. The entrees came in quick order, and each provided individual pleasures. The $34 Fennel-Spiced Black Cod came in the form of two large filets with the crispy skin left intact and piled atop concentrated tomatoes and artichoke leaves. It was all surrounded by a creamy mantecato & black olive oil sauce that brought the proper amount of decadence to the fish (see photo). The $33 Branzino was more simply presented with a large piece of the seabass covered in bottarga (tuna roe) breadcrumbs and sitting atop a blend of sunchokes, cotechino (salami) and leeks (see photo). Fish is definitely a specialty here, but I had the rock star of the night, the $33 Spiced Duck Breast surrounded by a foie gras emulsion (yes, it was a brownish orange foam) and served with butternut squash, Tuscan kale and pickled raisins (see photo). It was succulent as you would expect but with unexpected flavors that kept my palate tantalized. Mere mortals would have stopped there, but an expense account empowered us to move forward with the decadent dessert selection at $12 a pop. First up was the Amadei Chocolate Cake with a salted caramel gelato (a tad too bland) and chocolate butterscotch (see photo). The cake was deceptively small, but the Italian chocolate was obscenely rich. The second was the Sesame-Honey Semifreddo, which was milk chocolate mousse shaped like biscotti with a sweet potato gratin and malted chocolate crumble accompaniment (see photo). Both were lovely, but the unexpected surprise was the Coconut Panna Cotta, a milky tropical creation sitting in a pool of cool guava sauce with a sprinkling of caramelized pineapple. Delicioso, Mr. Conant. You're not chopped. FOOD - 5 stars...masterful execution of dishes that seem deceptively simple in concept with the polenta and panna cotta the genuine standouts of the evening AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...personally thought it was too dark to allow the eyes to complete the picture of the luscious food SERVICE - 4 stars...solid if a bit unctuous, almost too attentive perhaps due to the lateness of the hour TOTAL - 5 stars...Conant definitely knows his food","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Excellent excellent food! Also, great dishes for those of you who are low carbers.  They have a variety of seafood dishes that are succulent and flavorful, not to mention creative!   We started off with the mango mojitos which were pretty refreshing. Then for the appetizer we had the tuna (it was a special of the day) which came complete with what seemed to be their twist on pico de gallo with mango in it.  Wow, I was already intrigued!  For entrees, I had the salmon with carmelized onions string beans and hearts of palm.  My date had the special, grouper fish with asparagus and artichoke.  For dessert we enjoyed the chocolate molten cake but we swapped the strawberry ice cream for dulce de leche.  This is perfect for sharing. All in all it was a wonderful dining experience.  The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because it was a bit cramped (we were in the front section) and there was a lady sitting next to us who had a serious volume control issue with her voice and it was quite unpleasant having to listen to her shreaking voice while we were trying to eat.  Also, our waitress was kind of ditzy and not too attentive. It wasn't even busy.  Other than that, I'd definitely return!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Our group of friends went here to watch Belgium vs. Argentina on Saturday. Even though they had no more tables to reserve, they still accommodated our party of five. The food was excellent starting with the crepe Sarasin BXL. The mushroom and cream cheese really were very delicious and a perfect brunch before the match. They have an extensive Belgian beer bottle list as well as several standard Belgian beers on tap. The Cuvée BXL was particularly good as a house beer. Our group also ordered moules frites during the match. We chose the grand mere as the style and it was fantastic. The only reason I thought about giving them less than 5 stars was that the pot did not come with bread on the side right away. They eventually brought us some so it was almost like two meals: the mussels and fries then we got to dip the bread in the broth. Phenomenal! My wife also ordered a waffle dessert which looked very good but by that time I had filled up with the meal and 3 Belgian beers so I only had a bite of it - still, my single bite was crunchy and was paired well with fruits and a scoop of ice cream. Simply a great find - we hope to be back soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"How do I even begin this review? I have been anticipating this location for a long time, especially after hearing accolades over the Royersford location. I've wanted to drive all the way out there, but why travel so far when a location opened up in Olde City? My friend and I promptly visited at the end of January. Han was hilarious as he was helpful. For those who don't know already, most of the items have a number next to them that indicate what they are on a spice scale of 1-10 (10 being the spiciest). I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles (6) and my friend ordered Garlic Sauce Style Tofu (4). A-W-E-S-O-M-E!! The great thing about the Sichuan spices is that the heat doesn't annoyingly linger for ages but is able to be warded off. Whew! Trust me, my friend and I were sweating though. Since then, we've visited many times with friends and I've introduced the Dan Dan Noodles to my parents as well. Everyone I've introduced to the restaurant has enjoyed it, hands down. I just visited this past Friday and it's great to see that Han Dynasty is blossoming into a very popular place. The only thing I would change is the Mapo Tofu.

"I went to the old Rudy's only once, late into the night, after I had already done my fair share of partying. All I remember from that visit was walking into what seemed to be a biker bar and getting led from room to room until we reached the pool table and met up with some long lost friends. I recently ventured into the new Rudy's and found it to be vastly different. A dive bar no more. It is sleek and chic. It was a hot night and they had the windows next to the almost empty bar open, but it was a Tuesday night so I guess some people have to work the next morning or something. My friends and I sat at a table and put in an order for some drinks and an order of frites with mango sauce at the bar. The frites and the sauce were delicious. I washed it down with a glass of Petrus as the jukebox picks made by my friends filled up the room and I thought to myself, ""I like this Rudy's.""","[1.0, 0.0]"
"went for some Saturday brunch lovin'... -the food is spectacularrr.  lots of bold flavor.  fun presentation.  my bf is cuban and he went crazy over the food and savored every bite.  i had the beef/pork burger with the special ketchup and the chimicurri fries... the fries were to die for.  bf had some skirt steak and that was great too.  i'm not hispanic but i guess i can conclude from my bf's reaction that this place is on par with authenticity. one really awesome thing about this place is that instead of the usual white table bread and butter they give you a box of spanish sweet breads and strawberry butter... amazing. -the ambience is unexpectedly very nice... the space you walk into from the street is a narrow, dimly-lit bar area but behind that is the enormous, bright, and cheery atmosphere of the grand dining room.  the dining room is deceptively huge, and it's got some great architecture and awesome energy going on.  that's no surprise when the restaurant offers an unlimited gratuitous sangria bar... -oh, yeah. the FREE UNLIMITED SANGRIA BAR that comes with brunch on the weekends. 8 flavors. need I say more? i particularly enjoyed the one with the cinnamon, the one with the lychee (havana banana, i think?), and the mojito sangria.  i was surprised to find that they didn't water them down, at least i couldn't tell.  it's a serve-yourself thing so you can drink however much you want, however often you want.  suffice it to say, we were feeling gooood by the end of the meal... tip: there's a nice dog park across the street by the museum of natural history with some greenery and plenty of benches to walk/sit off your buzz afterwards. or you can walk it off by stumbling through the wonders of the museum, whatever you dig. -can't quite complain about the service. it was really busy and the waitress came around enough. we weren't hurried out despite the rush either. bottom line: I can NOT wait to come back here!  what a dining experience... and for the price it is really a steal.  highly recommend!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Perhaps a 3 and half Stars (if offered) We spent a sweet day here antique shopping and hiking down to the gorge. We went in early spring and were able to pick several handfuls of fiddle heads which we later made into a yummie Grub Bud special. As evening came upon the Grub Buds, their tummies began to growl and took nearly an hour to find a decent place that was affordable and didn't look like tourist trap. We nearly ate all the crumbs from the bottom of the Triscuit box in the parking lot of the glass blowing place!! Luckily Grub Buds iPod Touch got service in a strange location and Yelp was there to help! We got the Shepard's pie and it was very good. Way better then Grub Bud (male's) parents used to make. He hated it, but this trip gave him a newfound respect for the dish. Grub Bud (female) enjoyed the salad bar. We also got a special which was several BBQ'd meats . This part of the meal was decent, but nothing to write home about. We think you should just stick to the homestyle dishes this joint offers. The dudes behind us got Chicken pot pie which smelled and looked pretty good.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was in Park Slope trying to find a place to eat. I had really wanted to eat at Blue Ribbpon Sushi but it would have been a longer wait so we decided on the Brasserie instead. I ordered the hanger steak with wild mushrooms and onion rings which was delicious! My friend ordered the red snapper special with a side of rice and beans. Then for dessert, we ordered the profiteroles. I thought the food was great, the atmosphere was date, family, friend oriented. We had to wait about 20 mins for our table and so we just ordered water at the bar and the bartender was nice enough to keep refilling our water,which is rare for a bar. OVerall, I believe that Blue Ribbon lives up to its name.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Love Bayou on SI! I had dinner there last Tuesday and Friday evenings! I've been there quite a few times before and it's always wonderful. Tues, had live blue music, which is an added treat, since the food is always great. Tues. we had the Fried Creole Sushi App.- which we get every time because it's delicious! Hubby had the Chicken wrap and loved it. I had the Seafood Jambalaya- over rice, which was delicious and a huge portion. Fri. night I took a friend who had never been there. We shared a Fried Sushi - which she also loved! She and I both had the fried catfish with the cream pecan sauce. It is yummy!! I must warn you though, if you're not used to fried oils, it is deep fried, but not overly oily. It's one of my irresistible must haves every one in a while. Fried Cheesecake desert - OMG - Had this both nights I went. YOU MUST TRY - it is simply amazing!!   Pair it with the Boston Creme Pie after dinner drink...you'll be in heaven! The services is always great, like it's sister restaurant Beso. They are setting the bar high for Staten Island! Thank you Bayou!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Excellent. Met a friend here for lunch yesterday for the Taste of Hartford restaurant week menu.  It was the first time for both of us and we were impressed with every aspect of our experience.  Other reviews have noted the incredible views of the city from this restaurant that is on the 20th floor of the Hartford Steam Boiler Building.  The dining room is elegant with patrons and staff to match.   An amuse bouche of chanterelle mushroom, parmesan cream, truffle, wrapped in a thin crisp so light it practically melts in your mouth arrived before our first course.   Appetizer:  White Gazpacho with Marcona Almonds, Verjus Grapes, Compressed Cucumbers, Anise Hyssop.  If light, refreshing, and creamy can all be used to describe a dish, this would be it. Main:  House Made Berkshire Pork Sausage with Summer Squash Succotash and Lemon Verbena Pesto.  Wonderful play of textures and flavors. Dessert:  ON20 S'more, Graham Cracker Croquant, Chocolate Marquise , Smoked Caramel.  A blowtorch was brought to the table! Everything was presented beautifully.  The service was the most attentive I think I have ever received at a restaurant - almost a little too much, but appreciated.  Parking and finding the restaurant was not as difficult as I had anticipated.  Followed the instructions on the site:  parked on Level 3 of of the garage, walked to the lobby, found the set of elevators next to the On20 sign, took the elevator to the 20th floor, and entered through the glass doors to one of the most memorable lunches I would have in a long time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

This is also the type of place where you can ask the bartender's opinion about which beer you should order. Service is super friendly. Also: fries are good, and I had this killer vegan pastrami sandwich. Props for creative and tasty vegetarian options. Noise level is perfect: you can have a meaningful conversation with an old friend, but if you get a little tipsy and sorta lose control of your voice volume (not that I did that!) you won't be super obvious.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I did see a cougar here and there =)  I had a martini and a sangria. They were great, the bartender defianatly knew his drinks. We ordered guacamole to share, and it came out on this beautiful dish with plantain chips surrounding it to dip.

"I went to wazu tonight. I ordered an Italian sub I was the only one there. As the man was slicing the meat for my sandwich someone else came in. The employee pressured her for her order. He had prepared my sandwich and it was sitting there wrapped and ready to go. I only needed to pay. One employee came to the register and was going to ring up my purchase. He was told by a reddish blond man to take out the garbage. So he did. I had to wait while another customer came in and ordered a chef salad, was being made. I got impatient and asked the reddish blond person with his underwear showing can I just pay for my purchase? I was standing there waiting for 2 or 3 minutes by now. He told me he would have to take off his gloves to ring me up. So I said I see its about ur convenience not mine as the customer. He told me  he would have to take off his gloves to ring me up. Ok so u r more interested in the number of gloves use? He said to me it's a good thing this was his industry. I said yes good thing but he rang me up. Big mistake,. We order for delivery from work , I will def be telling my coworkers on Monday. I was not unreasonable and he should have said sorry no problem. I will not be going back.

"after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge (and running into The Way of the Cross with 3,000 people), we jumped in line to try the pizza at Grimaldi's Pizzeria who has a coal-fired brick oven. Once again you can not order pizza by the slice but it is well worth the pie. Their pizzas are made with fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, and dough made daily. The coal brick oven gives the crust a crispiness and smokiness. I couldn't' pick between here or John's- I loved them both equally. One this that made Grimaldi's a tiny bit better was the whole basil leaves they cook on top! As soon as you took a bite the basil flooded your mouth- Yummmmm","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Initally checked out this place because my bf was djing a party there. i was surprised when i walked in. the decor is gorgeous but the basement could use some work. Almost got lost going to the bathroom. Feel like drunk people would wander around down there. But other than that every thing was good. GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES. flavor is perfect but they could make them a little thicker. felt like i was eating fancy chips. and the drinks are tasty too. i always get the champagne drink. its chambord, lemon juice, and champagne. i think its called a french twist or fizz something like that. you'll know it when you see it on the menu. but omg its heaven in a glass. the perfect drink. you can taste the flavors in the drink and not the alcohol in the drink. You should have a chat with your Bartenders about etiquette. The blond girl needs to realize you don't have to throw yourself at a guy to get a tip and one of the male bartenders plans to open his own restaurant and bar because all bars have a 300% markup on alcohol. this i learned while munching on the fabulous fries.

"My date mentioned this place to me a few times, I think deep inside he is Mario Batali's number one fan (I doubt he will admit it though). He knows good food, he knows good Italian food, BUT hold your breath, this is not one of Batali's Italian gems. This is when I guess Batali was trying to get out of his comfort zone of Italian culinary and might I say did a great job with this Spanish tapa joint. I'm not a seasoned Italian foodie, but those that are familiar with Batali's food say this Spanish tapa place has an Italian flavor to it. First of all, if you ever visit Casa Mono, please sit by the bar where you will see the food made right in front of you, almost home-style with no plastic hand gloves (you know the way your mom or grandma makes your favorite dish at home, before everyone became a germaphobe). My date insisted that we sit by the bar and I'm glad we did. We enjoyed as the guys showed us the art of making mouth-watering small-plates while enjoying a good wine. Believe you me, if you are on a match or OKCupid date, you will at least have something to talk about in case you run out of things to say to each other. You just watch and see how the guys at Casa Mono make the food and talk about the different plates as they come out heading to their respective tables. It's also a plus in that the place is intimate, so it should make for a great date. This is not an overstatement when I say every dish looked like a piece of art and what we ate tasted like the best thing in the world, definitely tasted like 5-star food. One good plate came after the other, from good cheese, salads, seafood, beef, chicken, pork. I won't name the plates we had because a few people on this page have reviewed these plates pretty well & thoroughly. What a way to get introduced to Batali. The only negative about this place is that if you do a sit down during dinner-time (that's when we went & we went on a packed Sunday), I don't know about any other time of the day, you have to buy a minimum of 5 tapas for two people. That can be quite heavy on the pocket.  Per my recollection, the average cost of each of these tapas was somewhere between $15 and $18. Now think about multiplying that by five. Keep in mind that there are items that cost on the high end of the spectrum, i.e., over $20, some are on the low end, like $9. I'm not sure if this 5 tapas order requirement is the norm or if it was just for that evening. It may be worth going once in a while when you want to impress your date or when you want to treat that special lady in your life to something different or ladies, if you want take your man out for his birthday.   It's an awesome place!!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Well, what can I say? The food is always great, but at what price? The accommodations leave much to be desired. We (party of 4) arrived early to have wine at Bar Jamon. No way! Waaaay too crowded. So we went to the organic wine bar next door & had a glass of outstanding Rioja. We arrived back at Casa Mono at 9 for our appointed reservation, but were informed that our table would not be ready for another 30 minutes. They advised us to wait at Bar Jamon. I checked again but it was still waaaay to crowded.  The hostess then advised us to wait outside. In 40 degree weather..... really, Mario?? Our group decided to cancel & move on. If you don't mind being cramped, elbow to elbow, very loud acoustic environment & don't have expectations of any sort of timeliness, then Casa Mono is ok.

"So looking for a good brunch place in Queens wasn't an easy task but this has become a staple of mine. Like, every Saturday for the 2 months and the hostess knows me by name kinda staple. The best deal is the prix fixe where it comes with a bellini, mimosa, bloody mary, or juice (with a refill), coffee and an entree. It's not some weak alcoholic drink either, it's an honest to goodness REAL drink. What should you get? Peanut butter banana pancakes. I've gotten it multiple times, my friends have gotten it multiple times, it's blow your mind awesomeness. Other good recommends include steak skillet, crab cakes benedict, bbq pulled pork sandwich, bistro burger, crispy chicken sandwich. Be sure to get the sweet potato fries with the burger. My friends and I have tried almost the entire prix fixe menu.  I have not had a bad thing yet, but I would not order the croc monsieur again. It's not that it's bad, it's just misleading as it doesn't taste like an actual croc monsieur, more like a good grilled cheese. Not as worth it with all the other better choices on the menu. As for off the prix fixe, the soups and mussels were also great. It's open 24 hours, great environment, just a awesome find in Queens.","[1.0, 0.0]"

My girlfriend loves the salmon tempura in the Kamakaze roll. They put in Jalapenos in the roll, it's taste a bit spicy to me at first, but the sauce make it taste pretty good! Lastly, we had a pretty cool desert ""Rockslide Brownie"", they served the brownie with Vanilla ice-cream on top.  That is fabulous! We got our check....$42, which is pretty reasonable for a salad, 2 main courses and a desert.  We found out they have a pretty decent lunch menu, i think i will try it later this week.

"Delivery was friendly and on time, but I just threw away $22. Soup dumplings were terrible, and not because of the travel time (which I was willing to live with) they were doughy and smelled nasty. The Wonton soup was nasty too, the broth was decent but the wontons were terrible and chewy, they also had a stench that made the odor of the soup dumplings seem appetizing. Chinese broccoli was ok, but I could have saved $21.50 had I just sautéed some up from the store. Gross.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"i had a chicken gyro at the Monarch diner. It was dry and over salted. Not good, not bad. The greek salad my gyro came with what literally amazing!!! Being a chef myself i can understand when having a packed restaurant food must be served quickly for the anxious NJ foodies. Maybe my chicken was forgotten about while cooking, which is understandable, and maybe the reason why it was dry. The salt issue...i don't know. For the chef if he is reading this, try to not over cook the chicken for the gyro, and don't use to much salt. For the owner, get a better brand of pita bread. My parents go here from time to time and they absolutely love it!!! Enjoy!!! i will definitely be going back for another taste!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We were in the area, and trying to find a place to shelter us during the flash floods, and ended up going into Laetus for a couple of drinks while the rain stopped, and we ended up staying there for almost 4 hours. The friendliness of the staff, the relaxing setting and an amazing cocktail list lead us to diverting our friends from our orignal destination to spend the evening there. Few of us ended up ordering food, which was delicious, authentic, and just complimented the evening. The last pleasant surprise was a DJ that was playing that Saturday. The prices were amazing compared to the quality and quantity. Definitely going to be one of our top destinations when we're in Hartford next time.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Cool atmosphere and good food.  Very fresh, unique and delicious dishes.  We tried several small plates and weren't disappointed by anything.  We also split the baklava dessert which was differnt than traditional but a nice sweet end to the meal. We felt like the waitstaff kept taking or asking for our plates while we were still eating, which annoys me.  They were very nice but felt rushed while eating- also felt a bit like they were trying to upsell.   They also have a bar and a side room that could be fun if I went back with a larger group.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm done for good with Italian Peoples Bakery. In the past, I've ordered catering and deli trays many times with them. It's always been difficult to order, because I would call and leave a message, never to have it returned, and the people would be rude, or I couldn't understand them, or they would tell me to call another number, but I did it because my family is from Trenton and has always loved their rolls. This last time, I called the main store and asked to pick up at their Yardville location. The rude woman told me that I needed to call the Yardville location directly, which was in direct opposite to what the Yardville location told me only a month before. But whatever. I called the Yardville location and placed the order. Then, on the day of the party, the Yardville location has NO clue about the order. They contacted Matthew, the owner, who said that he would make up the tray right away and have it when they got to the store. So we had to drive all the way into the ghetto of Trenton (in an open Jeep), only to pick up a tray that was mostly lettuce and very skimpy on cold cuts. Hugely inconvenient, dangerous, and very poor customer service on their part ... never again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Of all the little coffeeshops on Macdougal, I think La Lanterna has to be my favorite.  It's got great desserts and coffees (even if they're a bit overpriced), and each of the three sections of the shop have their own select ambiance.  The regular cafe area, which you walk into from the street, seems like an unassuming little cafe.  The garden in the back is a lovely little oasis - you feel twice removed from all the hustle and bustle of the Village.  The basement area, though, is my favorite.  It's way too dimly lit to do any kind of reading or writing whatsoever, but it's usually quiet and uncrowded, with comfy banquettes.  A great place to relax and have a nice, private conversation with a friend.  Not really for those who like a rambunctious crowd and explicit people-watching.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been to this place two times already having to be in Hartford on business a few times a month from NYC. Lots of potential. Too bad that this place is so horrible. WHO IS RUNNING THIS PLACE????? Looks like another one of those places that I see pop up in Manhattan that opens and is closed in less than two years. The service sucked! The food was not bad once they corrected the order and brought it out (we were there 35 min at this point). Then we noticed a gentleman who we thought was a customer (due to how the employees were serving him) walk into the back. Wow!!! Was this the owner?? That was second and last time at this place. If my business associates in the area tells me it is better then I might give it another chance. On the other hand, I can just go up the block or around the corner and where they have a clue on how to be great to the customers. The funny thing is that when we were leaving the first time we went there were encouraged to take a menu with us. We all had a good laugh when we ready what this place was about. Look it up.

"The first thing that struck me about Graffiti is the size of the restaurant. It's small even for a New Yorker. I had read about it and decided to visit it but nothing prepared me for it. Having said that I have to mention, that if you just want to see the creative use of space then you have to pay a visit to Graffiti a. Even though it's a small place, you feel cozy rather than cramped. Chef Jehangir Mehta (who owns Graffiti) has added so many quirky design elements to the interiors of the restaurant that for a few minutes after entering you just look around in wonder, taking in all the personal touches to the design that make the place so warm and inviting. I really loved the funky animal chopsticks. The service at Graffiti is flawless. Actually that is how I spoke to Chef Mehta for the first time and heard that he was one of the participants on the Next Iron Chef. I now watch the show regularly and make sure I tell everyone that I have met him. The place is almost always full so I prefer to reserve my table, especially on Fridays. Though they do accept walk-ins, be prepared to wait for quite a while. Graffiti is always full! I don't like waiting for my food and that is another reason why I appreciate Graffiti so much. They serve food giving a detailed description of each preparation. This is something I really appreciate about the place. It makes you feel like they really know their food and they genuinely take pride in what they create. The proportions though small are filling and the best part is that nothing gets wasted. My favorite dish is the crunchy crostini and walnut salad as well as the watermelon feta salad. But no meal at Graffiti is complete without ordering atleast 2 portions of mango paneer!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ramen-Ya in West Village is my favorite place to eat. Their broth is much creamier and tastier than IPPUDO and TOTTO Ramen ! Ramen-Ya is a new restaurant that has a great atmosphere albeit rather small in space. My favorite is their tender and flavorful CHASHU also knows as Grilled Pork). I went to Ramen-Ya last week, I tried their new ramen called the ABURA-SOBA. it is a unique creation of ramen with no soup! They have 2 kinds, one spicy and another is their traditional flavor. The traditional version uses a Kakushi-Aji, whick means ""seacret ingredient"" in Japanese. This is a Ramen-Ya original and never seen before in NYC!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Manhattan prices, Montclair fare -- disappointing. My wife and I finally made it here for lunch with great expectations.  She's a ramen fanatic and frequents many in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  We ordered Shoyuzo and the wing appetizer--a $30 lunch here.  The wings were OK, the ramen was fairly average.  Specifically, the broth was pretty good, but you had to ration it.  The overall portion was nearly half a bowl, and the vegetable count was low.  Chicken was perfectly tasteless.  We were surprised and disappointed.  When we had to leave early and thought to take the rest home to the kids, Ani's policy is Bring Your Own Container.  We couldn't leave the money on the table and relented with a quick CVS tupperware purchase. Let's be honest.  Even a bowl of very good ramen should not cost $12 at lunch, and if it does, it should be ample and full of flavor.  This was truly mediocre at best.  I'm sure the rents aren't low, but the only way people are going to stop being gouged by Montclair restaurant pricing is to stop pretending the value's here.  This one is what it is: a $9 bowl of half-decent ramen.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm giving this a 5 star rating because the food here is consistently fabulous. I've never had a less than incredibly delicious meal here and I've tried a lot of the menu.

As someone with concerns for the environment I find it hard to eat here often because of the amount of plastic and styrofoam garbage created by each meal. I thought about taking the rating down one star for that but I don't want to discourage anyone from coming here and supporting an incredible local business and also because the food is just that good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"On a Friday night, we walked into the restaurant, the ENTIRE restaurant was EMPTY. There were SO many servers just walking around aimlessly who looked like they were literally trying to find stuff to do and maybe 2-3 tables in the entire dining room had parties seated. When we walked in, we were told to wait a moment then taken to our table. Our server was a pleasant gentleman but something just seemed really off about this place. There was a weird smell in the restaurant the servers just looked very unkempt...something wasn't adding up. We put our gut feelings aside and decided to place the order for our food. Here's where it got really bad - the bread came out, stale as ever. It almost felt like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a week and they just brought a basket out to us for the sake of serving bread. Few minutes later, the fried calamari rolled in for our appetizer. The moment I laid my eyes on the calamari I knew it wasn't going to be good. It just looked like it was drenched in oil without any seasoning and of course, one bite of the calamari and i wanted to literally vomit. All you tasted was breadcrumbs drenched in oil. About 5 servers walked by our table and gave us puzzled looks as to why we weren't eating the bowl full of calamari and just siting there waiting instead to be acknowledged. Finally, our server made his way over to us and we told him how we felt about it - he was nice enough to offer to get it remade but we politely decline and gave it back to him, and hoped that our caesar salad and mushroom with crab meat (2 more appetizers) would be better. Took about 25 minutes for the caesar salad and the mushroom with crab meat to come out since the calamari incident. It wasn't even like they were busy - the restaurant was literally empty and we were sitting right by the kitchen where we could see the kitchen door opening and closing - the entire kitchen was visible and all I saw were people just standing in there yapping away constantly. Anyways, so the salad and the mushroom with crabmeat came out - the salad was DRY without any sort of dressing on it. And the mushroom, lol well it was looked burnt. My husband took one bite of the caesar salad and just said no, I can't do this - it tasted STALE as anything and dry...it was literally just romaine lettuce tossed with cheese, that's IT. My mushroom was SO burnt that I actually heard it crack and burnt pieces fly out when I was trying to take a bite of it - the crab meat was horrendous - again, felt like it had been sitting there for ages and was jus heated up with lemon juice and served to not have to waste old food. We just sat there, again, waiting to be acknowledged and when another server walked by, we asked him to cancel our entrees and bring us the check - we just couldn't put up with this. Our server came rushing to us and asked what happened and we explained to him that this food was just not cutting it for us and meeting our standards - he was very polite and went away for a few minutes. About 5 minutes later, we were approached at our table by someone who seemed like the manager, a younger gentleman with an older gentleman. They asked us what the issue was and my husband explained to them how his caesar salad was dry and how my mushroom was burnt - the older gentleman had the audacity to ask my husband ""Do you know what a Portobello mushroom is?"" As if he didn't believe that the mushroom was burnt and that we were idiots for thinking it was....t was so SHOCKED by the way he approached us and almost was trying to challenge us in a way that we were wrong and what his kitchen had produced was fine. It was the worst response from a manager/owner I had ever experienced. In the mean time, the younger gentleman took our appetizers to the kitchen and both of them disappeared. My husband I just sat there puzzled wondering what the heck was going on - we just wanted our check and wanted to leave ASAP. Few minutes later, the younger gentleman comes out and goes ""I'm sorry it was our mistake - the mushroom was burnt."" And then he disappeared again....we were just sitting there wondering what in the world is going on we just wanted to get the heck out of there and get some food. Waited another 5 minutes and finally saw our server, I asked him for the check and he was nice enough to say that there is no check - it's all fine. We insisted on paying him at least a tip because it really wasn't his fault and he did wait on us but he refused to accept anything and we were on our way out in no time. It was just weird how we kept asking for the check and no one would flat out tell us that there's no check or you're free to leave - the situation was handled SO terribly.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The service was good, the ambiance was good, the appetizer was good, but the main dishes were not. My husband and I went on a Friday late in the afternoon. Considering there was only one other couple in the restaurant I thought it was interesting that they insisted that my husband take his cap off. My husband loves his caps. We ordered the calamari appetizer which was different from what I'm used to, but a nice change with the hot peppers and being pan fried. I went for the paella which is what I usually get at the restaurants in the area. It was huge, filled with seafood and meats. But the rice was strange to me and I didn't really enjoy it. It had a chewy consistency. My husband got steak, which was not that good either. It had a charred flavor. We had a Groupon so it was a good deal.

The food is piping hot when served and it's one of those kinds of meals where you may be full, but you are going to keep scooping that food into your mouth.

The waffles were a tasty substitution for the usual, boring bread, and combination of beef, tomatoes, sprouts, and other condiments was just right. I would definitely get this again. In addition, we also had the baja tacos, which was satisfying, and also a side of waffle fries were a nice complement to both entrees. I am not a huge fan of the Max Brenner desserts. We had the banana waffle which was okay, but it had nothing compared to the food. I would come by anytime for some lunch or dinner, and maybe have some dessert as well.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Edited 1/5/11 I went back to Ten Stone a couple months ago for the tuna wrap... AND GOT SALMONELLA.  Buyer beware. I'm taking away a star for that torture.. ----- I have to agree with the reviews that have been posted - Ten Stone is a bit pricy, but it's a nice/casual place to get a drink and some bar food. The hummus comes with a pesto sauce which was a nice touch.  The nachos are pretty standard.  The server seemed to know a lot about the beers on tap, which was helpful. I ordered the tuna wrap which was stuffed full. It was pretty delicious, and I would go back just for this item. However, I give Ten Stone three stars because I am not thrilled with the prices.  While it is consistent and you get what you are expecting (tasty bar food), I'm just not totally sold that it's worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The secret to getting the most out of this place is to sit at the bar.  I prefer the better light there (the food is beautiful, why not see it), and the bartenders, while busy, know their stuff.  Ask for their recommendations and try whatever they suggest.  As for the quality of their Italian fare, the only place I've been in this city that does it better is the uber-expensive Il Mulino.   My single and mild criticism is that, now and then, you'll catch a whiff of elitist pretensions from some of the tables that have gathered around you; that's one dark aspect of finding yourself in the West Village.  Sitting at the bar carries the added benefit of helping you to ignore such problems if and when they come up.  And it's not a bad place to meet some interesting people who are either eating there too, or stopping by on the way to their tables.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Not quite the dining experience I was hoping for. My family and I regularly do brunch in the city, and we love trying to new places, especially restaurants with great reputations such as Maialino. To be fair, I think your dining experience here will depend on what you like to eat for brunch. My family typically chooses an egg dish, and true to form we ordered the fritatta bianca, contadino, and porchetta. Overall I found our meals lacked a lot of taste and the pork too fatty. However, the almond croissant was absolutely delicious! If you enjoy savory home made pastries, then this place is definitely for you. I must also give credit to their dessert selection. I feel this review of their sweets deserves its own paragraph to emphasize how phenomenal they were. Their gelato/sorbet selections were unique - I chose the strawberry basil, lemon curd, and olive oil. While lemon curd was my favorite due to its rich and creamy texture (literally could have been the custard filling of a pie), the strawberry basil was refreshing and the olive oil was simply very tasty. We also tried the torta della nonna (pine nut and custard tart) and although I was full from my ice cream, I gladly finished it off. Based on my experience, I'm wondering if kitchen staff shouldn't open their own bakery!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Real NYers beware!! Yesterday, I had a very bad experience at Bathazar. Food was good and waitress was great but they were rude in their need for turning the table. Scene was Xmas lunch for work colleagues. 4 people for a long lunch with cocktails. Arrived at 2pm...but after a few hours they told us we had reached our drink per hour maximum and we were being cut off...we didnt think much of it and let it go. But then, we requested another round to see what they would say...they said no but now they said then needed the table at 6pm despite the fact there were many tables open....we had just spent $500 for lunch and, despite many drinks, we were completely in control and certainly not boisterous or bothersome to our neighbors. In fact, one neighbor couldnt believe they were treating us this way. We are not tourists. We are professionals who entertain for business. And, we dont appreciate being treated like naive tourists. Most of us are native NYers. As we left, i  thanked the hostess for ruining a perfectly wonderfull afternoon. I will never go to Bathazar again or its other restaurants my money is better spent at establishments that respect their patron.. Real NYers beware.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Miriam is an Israeli restaurant in Park Slope serving brunch and dinner, warmly furnished in wood and brick, restrained accenting with ornate glass and metal decorations.   The small corner dining room is lined with windows, anchored by a bar on one side (serving up wines, beers, and cocktails) and many small tables on the other, along with a showpiece table by the front window for a larger party.  Staff are friendly.   Israeli food bears similarities to its Middle Eastern neighbors, and will look similar.  Miriam serves up a more refined version that falls between casual and fine dining.  They offer a long list of mezes, or small plates, served at the great happy hour price of 4 for $12. In the name of full disclosure, these are truly small plates and will not be adequate for more than 2 people. But for 2, it's perfect for a variety of tastings. Our four mezes were good and, at a bite or two apiece, satisfying and worth the sampling although none merit special mention.  In all, preparation, flavors, and textures were fine but not exceptional.  The meats, meatballs and merguez sausage, were basic; the former came with a pomegranate sauce we were curious about, that had sweet and sour notes but was not otherwise memorable.  Fried eggplant and cauliflower were limp from not being freshly fried.  Probably the best were well-cooked shrimp wrapped in kadaif.  House seasoned pita wedges paired nicely, and were plenty tasty on their own; I may have liked it better than all the mezes. The flavor of their couscous leans on sweet, co-mingling with savory, slow-cooked with butternut squash, raisins, pumpkin, zucchini, and cabbage.  Of the four additions offered, shrimp and calamari was not a great match, overwhelmed and disappearing into the flavorful couscous, but they were also not exceptional specimens that could stand up to the task.   Miriam's food is not ambitious, and it is not a culinary destination.  But in Park Slope, it is squarely in its own niche when accounting for type of food, ambience, and price, and when combined with daily brunch hours and daily happy hour specials, Miriam is a very good neighborhood restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food was good, nothing amazing but good. Definitely more of a tourist restaurant.  As you can see the insane line and wait.  I took my cousin here and to say i was disappointing wouldn't even begin to describe. We had our lunch the duck. Which was cooked perfectly, we had dessert .We were speaking in our native Portuguese, when the waiter came back with our check he asked if we were speaking Portuguese, we were amazed that he knew. Thinking it was a nice comment he says ""just want to let you know tip is 16% or more"". To say that I felt so ashamed and discriminated would really describe how i felt. We were so embarrassed we couldn't even speak to a manager about that. I m sure some tourist don't know how the tip process is here but to say that to a customer a PAYING customer is an ABSURD! So Balthazar make sure to really train your waiters. Not that would make any difference, wouldn't eat her even if my meal was for free. Spending over $110 and being treated that way was such a waste! Make sure not to speak in any other language besides English.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was very excited to try Local 44 when I heard about it, but sadly I had a bad experience because my group was asked to leave our table after finishing our food. First the good news: The selection was phenomenal, with about 15 drafts plus a couple on cask. Everything I tried was delicious. It was Philly Beer Week, so perhaps they pulled out all the stops, but it seems they always keep a great line-up of drafts. Although the beer was clearly the main event, the food complemented it well. It was a nice selection of pub fare, very tasty, and reasonably priced. Then the bad news: Our server was wonderful, but the owner asked us to ""finish our drinks at the bar"" once we had finished our food. The bar was too crowded to comfortably accommodate our party of five so, in effect, the owner asked us to leave. To be fair, at least one other party was waiting for a table. But I have never before been asked to leave a restaurant or bar, and I found it to be particularly offensive in this case for the following reasons: - All but one in our party did order pub fare, and we were asked to leave very soon after finishing it - All five of us were consuming and continuing to order beers (in fact, we canceled our pending orders when asked to leave) - It was Philly Beer Week during an advertised beer event - The menu begins with and is dominated by beer, not food - Local 44 advertises itself as a ""Beer Bar,"" not a restaurant (Website, local44beerbar.com, says ""Local 44 is a neighborhood beer joint."") Because of the clear focus on beer, I was most surprised and disappointed to find that the owner will only allow a table to be used during such time as its occupants are ordering or consuming the pub fare. The Bottom Line: Local 44 has a wonderful concept, but I was both frustrated and disappointed by my experience there. It seems like a great place to enjoy good company and potables, and the beer is fantastic, but if I can have a table only at the risk of being ejected when the next party shows up, then I'll choose to take my business elsewhere.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"On a Friday evening, I set food in Coppelia. I faintly heard Cuban beats while waiting for a table. It was dimly lit. The host was nice. Though I didn't order a drink, there's a bar with a good-looking bartender. In retrospect, most of the staff were good looking and helpful. The waiter sat us down and ask for our drink orders. After he delivered our beverages, we ordered our meals. My sister ordered a torta, the chicken cutlet sandwich. It is cut into 2 halves. She gave me 1 half to take home. The next day, the guac was brown. Guess adding lime or lemon juice would mess with the flavor of the sandwich. Otherwise, that's a tasty sandwich cuz of the chipotle mayo and bread & fried chicken cutlet. I was SO tempted to order a rice & beans dish or Cubano. I ordered a few appetizers:  oxtail empanada and fish tacos. With all that came on top of the empanada, it tasted flat. The fish tacos came alive with fresh squeezed lime juice on top and lots of guac. Guac added a creamy-feel to each bite. I wanted more tacos. For dessert, I forgot the waiter told us the special dessert of the night:  Kahlua tres leches cake. DAMN, I ordered the tres leches cake from regular menu. At first bite, I tasted alcohol as if Kahlua liquer and waved the waiter telling him he gave me the wrong cake. He said it is the right one and that the kahlua cake is brown. After he left, I ate a few more bits and waved him again. I told him it tasted like alcohol. He again said it's the right cake. He left and after a few more bites, I waved the waiter over and said it tasted like alcohol. He finally explained that rum is in the sauce on the plate. AH-HAH. The rum sauce kinda got to me so I didn't eat the entire cake. The sauce smelled & tasted menthol-ish. I feel the restaurant should've noted on menu that there's rum sauce for the tres leches cake. IMO, the tres leches cake can stand on its own. OH, there's one bathroom. It stenched (at least that evening). PLUS, there's a urinal and a toilet further into the bathroom.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I come here for the pastrami and imho the leanness of their cut is superior to all others in terms of fat content.  Some of us love lean pastrami and others like it medium to fatty.  I like them all and this is fantastically prepared. When I think of fatty pastrami, Katz's is my immediate go to favorite. But as far as lean cut pastrami goes, this place is outstanding and easily my favorite in NYC. Now for the bread...It is good, not the best rye you have ever had but very good flavored rye bread. In no way does the deliciousness of the juicy pastrami get thrown off by the bread when eating your sandwich. It also holds up well to the meat even when you get the large size sandwich. It should be noted that the pastrami's flavor is not overwhelmingly smokey.  It is not as robust a flavor as other deli's pastrami meats are. This is a delightful difference for me from the pastrami I was raised on for 35 years which tended to be much fattier than David's is. The beautiful pastrami that David's offers is available in 3 sizes to serve your stomach's needs. It is lean, mildly flavored, and in a class of its own when it comes down to the fattiness of the meat.  If you eat your share of pastrami, you will notice the subtle difference once you take your first scrumptious bite!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wow what a great experience!!!

"I'm not one to write reviews, and This is actually my first time.  But I just had the worst experience ever... I frequented el almecan at least once a month, but sadly that's all over now.   We went at saturday evening (we had friends visiting from germany and they really wanted steak)  The hosted told us an hour wait and to go some place else for a drink and when the table was ready and that they would call us.   An hour and 1:15 minutes passed and we went back, and she said it was going to take just a bit longer.  We went for another drink, at this point starving, no call, I went back to check (2 hours had passed at this point).  2 new tables where sat.   I asked the hostess about them and her response was they are friends of the managers... then a large party was about to leave, I asked about that table, her response was another party just called and they were coming in.  She just told me to go try to see if there sister restaurant down the street might have seats available. My problem is not that the restaurant was busy, but the rude mismanagement of the place.  If you know there are multiple large parties coming in, then deter the customer away from the start,  Don't make them wait hungry for over 2 hours.  I've worked in restaurant all over the city, and we never treated the costumer with such rudeness.   Luckily we ended up going to marlo and son's afterwards where not only are they pleasant, but the food is alway excellent.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Finally at Amal D.'s suggestion, I came to Cafe Luluc for a much needed brunch with my friend Chris. The cafe is conveniently located in Cobble Hill which made for a great little walk through the neighborhood. We got here around 12 pm on a Sunday and luckily there was no wait. We actually were able to score a table at the outdoor patio in the back which was quite nice... until a bee decided to torment me by hovering around my face every 5 minutes. I get it, you think I'm sweet, but buzz off before I curse you with CCD. It was one of those Sundays where I wanted a drink. Hm something spicy or something sweet? Let's go with spicy. I had the Bloody Mary to ease my headache which I must say was pretty good. Not the best I've had but it was definitely made from scratch with some good L&C. For food I ordered the Tuna Fish Club sandwich, he got the poached eggs with gravalax salmon, and we got an order of the famous pancakes to split. Now my sandwich wasn't bad by any means, but I didn't think it was delicious. I felt like it was a little dry and I forgot how much bread is in a club. Three slices of bread people!!! I wish the salad had had something sweet/with texture to make it a little more interesting like apples or cranberries... Again, not bad by any means I just felt like it wasn't fully satisfying me. However, the pancakes with fruit and maple syrup were great! I don't think I could ever eat the whole plate by myself as it would just be a total sugar/carb overload but these were so yummy. I don't know how they do it but the tops of the pancakes were slightly crispy. I'm just going to blame it all on butter and the Devil. The inside was so soft and fluffy that you just wanted to lie down and take a nap using the pancake as a pillow. Those little qualities really make these pancakes stand out in my mind. They also topped them with freshly cut bananas and strawberries. So freaking good. I think everyone should get an order of pancakes to share; they are the true winners. Overall I enjoyed my little trip to Cafe Luluc. I don't think I'm dying to run back here as there are tons of places to try in Cobble Hill, but I will say I have fond memories of those pancakes... and they're only a 15 minute walk away.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I would live here if they'd let me. New Haven sorely needed a nice cheese shop/ bistro. And when my server sincerely told me they encourage people to linger at the tables and enjoy their company (the operative word here being sincerely- and I don't blame servers for wanting to turn tables; I've done it myself), I knew this place would be an instant favorite. Yeah, there are improvements to be made (some of their house wines are bland, and making suggestions on the menu for pairing the booze with the cheese would be nice), but it's a new place and I'm relatively unconcerned. Also, if you want to make a suggestion, the owner is an awesome and open-minded guy, so instead of fussing on yelp I'd just tell him myself. Good things: -Cheese board (enough for three to snack on, and I love the tapa-style feel of appetizers like these) -Soups (onion gratin and the veggie soup are always amazing) -Tarts (three words: good flaky crust) Oh, and for the record, the cranberry-walnut bread is not from Trader Joe's.

"Rubirosa is a great place to have a wonderful reasonably priced meal. Number one appeal factor, no tourists! That's one great sign. The atmosphere is what you would expect from being in Nolita, a small, authentic and welcoming place. I tried the roasted octopus which was wonderful. Some pieces were a bit chewy (the problem with cooked octopus), but most were little bites of heaven. With a bit of mache, tomatoes, roasted almonds... perfect combination. Then the classic pizza. Hard to describe. The crust is thin, cracking and buttery. The tomatoes are sweet and tangy (is that even possible?), the mozza is melting in your mouth. Also tried the cavatelli (my motto is, if there are homemade cavatelli, you have to have them--same with gnocchi; they have both, but don't serve the gnocchi for lunch). They were perfectly cooked with a hint of garlic; the broccoli was a bit bitter, but just enough to marry the flavor of the bits of sausage. All of that accompanied by the house wine (white--2010 Borgo M. Friulano) with citrus nose and fresh taste. Perfect for this lunch. If I only had a bit more appetite to try more items on the menu...

It was the best spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil i've ever had. but it wasn't the best PASTA i've ever had. big difference. ravioli- rich, creamy, slight bitterness from the foie gras. it was delicious, but not going to lie, it was beginning to get a lil bit too much bite after bite. all in all, an a-okay experience.

Best chicken wings I have ever tasted.  Crispy on the outside, perfect on the inside. The sauce definitely had me wanting to lick my fingers... a lot. Pork belly with  canteloupe.  Delicious, the way pork belly always should be. Cheese and strawberry , who would have thought?  A nice touch and soft and sweet. I will definitely be back here ASAP, and am considering having a small birthday dinner here this summer.  I will definitely eat AND drink, then.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"OK....I was so wrong. This place is god awful. The last 2 times i've gone back the service has been piss poor and the food is terrible. I feel like I ate a mushed up veggie burger in an old shoe. When a friend told the waitress/bartender that his soda was flat she just said ""oh its cola, not coke"". What the fuck does that even mean? When did 0 bubbles become cola? The prices at first glance are OK then when you add all of your toppings you're getting into the $11 range for simply a sandwich....no sides. Terrible.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Following a performance at L'Etage, my friends and I were famished. And, after 2 drinks on an empty stomach, I was feeling tipsy as well. South Street was mobbed on this Friday night, but we were seated immediately on B. Foy's outdoor patio which provided the perfect perch for observing a plethora of police officers canvassing the area status post the flash mob fiasco. I don't think I've seen so many brothers in blue since the Rodney King videos. Given the number of teenage twerps out and about, I was glad to have the extra security. But I digress... B. Foy's hit the spot but their food isn't exactly inspiring. I ordered a Walt Whit and the crispy chicken sandwich. I swapped the pepperjack for cheddar and got exactly what I ordered. I would have preferred a bit more avocado and less chipotle mayo as the sandwich was more spicy that I like. The bun was flaky, soft, and big enough to hold everything together. I felt the chicken was a bit overdone, but still good. The fries were average and lacked sufficient seasoning. The prices were more than reasonable, though, and three of us ate for $50, drinks included. This location is definitely a plus if you're doing the tourist thing with friends or family and need a place to please most palates. Just don't expect too much.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"You just have to go... its the complete all around experience of going to a historical place where iconic figures have visited. The burgers, well... they aren't much of anything really, but that's not why you go. You go to see the old booths, covered in carved initials like ""TC + KS Forever"" or ""Matt wuz here '87"". You go to listen to the chatter of patrons as well as the staff whether it be about politics or sports; there is something for everyone to comment on. You go because the burger is unique and one-of-a-kind. I recommend you get the works (cheese spread, tomato, chopped onion). The potato salad is very good as are the pies. They also serve Foxon Park soda which adds to the local food feel. Its a fun place to go every now n then. Its not about the burger really, its about the restaurant itself.

"Let me be absolutely clear: do not dine here if you have even the slightest sophistication of palate - you will be thoroughly disappointed. Yes, they have festive lighting and hype the Latin theme, but there is no quality. Your small town friends may feel in vogue that they got a unique Manhattan dining experience here, but deep down in your cultured New Yorker heart, you'll know that this is Epcot at best. Our friend's restaurant concierge convinced us to try this place and having read the reviews before going in, we made clear that we wanted chicken that had not been oven roasted for too long a time. Despite the request, the chicken was among some of the driest meat I have encountered. It was arroz con pollo constituted from a dehydrated mix to which insufficient water was added. The ceviche was not fresh, the fish tacos were all batter presumably to cover up the frozen fish, and the cocktails were made incorrectly (no salt rim as requested with the margaritas). As if the bad food was not enough, the service was OFFENSIVE. We waited 25 minutes for our first drink. To their credit, the manager recognized the inappropriate wait and came to our table to take our second drink order (as if his presence at our table made up for the long wait). Of course, the second round was equally slow to be brought out. I am normally not this snarky, but the series of events that transpired next prompt me to warn folks about this place far and wide. We asked our waiter to remove the food from our table. Seeing that we barely ate it, he inquired why this was so. We explained our disappointment in the food, however we did not request a re-preparation or alternative dishes. Rather, we planned to finish our long-awaited cocktail, pay our bill, and depart. Subsequently, the manager returned to our table with a fiery step and defended the chicken, exclaiming to us that it was our taste that was flawed. Rather than pointing out the well-traveled background of our friend or the significant amount of time we have spent in Latin America practically living on arroz con pollo, we respectfully disagreed and requested the bill. Thankfully, the most prompt feature of the service that evening was the bill arriving at our table, and of course the bill arrived without even the slightest reflection of culpability. The manager accosted us as we walked out of the restaurant, continuously defending the meal-gone-wrong like a child who knows he did something bad but will not admit it. He followed us out of the restaurant with escalating anger at our staunch disengagement from his antics. Perhaps he had a few too many drinks. Needless to say, we will not return. The restaurant concierge will remove this from the company's repertoire, no longer to be recommended to their large clientele, and I sincerely hope that I have saved you from wasting your time, money, and mostly your appreciation of Latin American cuisine.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Been here a few times now and I will still keep coming back. The food is good if you're looking for filling and savoury. The portions are generous for what you pay. It's BYOB, which means your tab will not exponentially grow. The service is not really something to make a big fuss about. This is a very laid back place run a by people who may not have strong background in hospitality, but want to offer fun comfort food with affordable prices in a not so affordable neighbourhood. I really liked either their Truffle burger or Chorizo burger. Their wings are really good too. Don't come here with expectations of a full-service restaurant with well tailored customer service.

"Went here for a quick bite with the wife and was pleasantly surprised at just how good the sashimi was, my wife had the sushi and we were both very happy. The temperature on the fish was just right and very fresh tasting. Service was a OK nothing to write home about but adequate. Im hoping they can duplicate the experience for delivery. As for decor, it was pretty typical, they also have hibachi there which was pretty empty, they had one group of 4 for the whole hibachi and then it looked like it ended up with just 2 people at the other later on so if you're looking for the whole social aspect of hibachi you might not get it for a couple and the oddness of being the only 2 people at a hibachi wouldn't appeal to me. It could have just been a slow night but it was a Saturday so I don't know what to think about that so I would say if you're planning on hiibachi make it a group event. EDIT: Went backa second time, things were still good but I rethought the 5 after getting salmon sashimi that was frozen and somewhat poor service, not so much bad as inexperienced it seems.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Move over cupcakes, your illustrious time in the dessert spotlight is over - it's now all about the macaron. Cupcakes and macarons are diametric opposites. One resembles more and more like a mini couch while the other is cute and petite. The cupcake is decadent and guilt inducing with its many sugary decorations. The macaron is sinfully good, but without all the consequences of a dietary quandary afterwards. I never do after eating half a dozen within a matter of minutes. Growing up, I only knew about the American macaroons. You know, those dense pastry clusters of flour, almond paste (or other nuts) and coconut flakes. Moist and sweet, they come in a variety of ways. Sometimes dipped in chocolate, sometimes piped in different shapes and so forth. Macaroons were solid dessert options for a post-dinner dessert or the perfect accompaniment with tea or coffee. But, Ladurée macarons are not the aforementioned cookies. French macarons are in a league of their own. ""You must mean macaroon right?!"" No, these aren't the American versions of macaroons. No coconut flakes here. What are these concoctions with the singular o? The French macaron is sly with its light and fluffy texture. It teases you with its two meringue based outer shells filled with jam/ganache/buttercream reminding me of an adorable petite UFO. It comes in a dizzying rainbow palette of colors that would make even GLAAD jealous. Flavors can be as simple as one singular flavor such as strawberry, vanilla, chocolate to as unorthodox and complex such as fried chicken, salted butter popcorn, Vegemite sourdough and burnt rice. If you bite into one, it should feel effortless with very little residual crumbs left behind. It should be slightly hard on the outside and moist on the inside with the inside jam complimenting the meringue flavor. The filling shouldn't be overly sweet or powerful. While they are delicate baked goods, it shouldn't be delicate to the point of disintegration once you hold it. You don't sharply bite into them, but slowly wrap your mouth around one to envelop its goodness. It's best consumed slowly with multiple bites to intensely savor each bite. Follow with a sip of sparkling water or hot tea to cleanse your palette. The tastes are nuanced and subtle with each flavor having its own distinctive aroma. I prefer the rose (very light, floral), salted caramel (rich, creamy with a kick of salt) and the pistachio. Ladurée was founded in 1862 and eventually became famous for their macarons, though the store also sells other confectionaries such as chocolates, sorbet and pastries. There are currently outposts in 15 cities including Paris, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Japan and the New York City (the only United States brick and mortar store) location which opened in spring of 2011. Currently, there is a second planned location in New York City which will be opened in SoHo this fall of 2012. The store shines because it focuses on simplicity in its macaron offerings. Unlike other shops (see: Pierre Hermé)  offering fusion, unorthodox or multiple flavors in one cookie, Ladurée  offers singular flavors ensuring quality ingredients and products.  It doesn't attempt to re-create the proverbial wheel and focuses on what they know they do best - a simple macaron. The store is also synonymous with fashion. Remember that scene in Sophia Coppola's 2006 film Marie Antoinette where Marie (played by Kirsten Dunst) lounges around in her palatial compound with Ladurée sweets adorning her room? Yeah. Macarons in general seem to be stylish with its air of sophistication and elitism. Ladurée sell its for $2.70 each, a decadent and indulgent treat for those who adore the finer things in life. I've been lucky enough to experience them as gifts. You can have these sweet babies wrapped up in a variety of heavy duty printed boxes with ribbons for a small fee. I love re-using the boxes for crafts or to store other odds and ends such as old stationery and cards. I like to think of the store as a jewelry store for pastries. It's absolutely gorgeous and luxurious. If you're in a never-ending quagmire over where to purchase macarons in New York City, stop researching and go here. Ladurée easily creates some of the most sumptuous delicacies with a luxurious experience to boot. While there are almost always long lines on this Upper East Side establishment, it's justified as I believe it's one of the best places in NYC to purchase macarons. Bon appétit! PS: Enjoy them as soon as possible. PPS: Did you know French McDonalds sell macarons? I am so jealous.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My husband took me here tonight for Valentine's Day dinner. I knew nothing about the place in advance except that it's a Marc Vetri restaurant, and he is an amazing chef (though I've yet to make it to Osteria, it's on my list). We were not disappointed. Every dish was fantastic.  I stuffed myself silly (small plates? how much can I eat? yeah, right) and hope to save up all day next time for a meal this good. Brief description: this sleek industrial/modern space is really inviting. I love the fact that you can eat at the bar and watch the cooking take place. That is really cool :) The place was noisier than I expected and the tables were very close together, so you were kind of sitting (almost) on your neighbor's lap.... but these are minor details :) Now onto the food..... there is much to choose from, which is nice... I'm a huge eggplant fan, and the highlight of my evening was the eggplant brushetta dish. I have never had eggplant spread that good. My only complaint was that two small slices of garlic toast were not enough to sop up all of this goodness (no fear, there was other delicious bread on the table). If you get nothing else at Amis, get the eggplant bruschetta. A close second are the eggplant ""fries"" that strangely decorate the rigatoni with swordfish. Delish and addicting. If they sold these fries from a street vendor, I'd be in big trouble.... Other standouts: Roasted potatoes (my husband's favorite), crispy and delicious Baked clams (yummmmm) Turkey cutlet - who would of thought that turkey mascerading as a thinly pounded veal cutlet could taste so good? Simple, but delicious, and nice with the accompanying greens and freshly shaved parmesan. Others: The grilled cauliflower lightly breaded -- ok, but not exceptional. It was too hard for my taste. Beef carpaccio - nothing against, it, just not my thing (hubby loved it) I hope I'm not forgetting anything.... Desserts were good. The menu is extensive and everything looked delicious. We had an ""ice cream sundae"" with the most delicious amaretto-tasting ice cream I've ever had, sprinkled with walnuts and covered in fudge. My husband had the chocolate ganache cake that was good, but I wasn't a huge fan. I'm coming back for the Belgian waffle with nutella ... had I not had pancakes for breakfast, I definitely would have gotten it. Service was great. Very attentive and helpful. A new favorite -- we'll be back for more.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Anyway, there is no menu to look at other than is what is on the wall and from our table in the corner we could not read it and it did not have descriptions. We ordered the Caesar salad - there were 4 of us and we had more than half of it left on the serving platter. I think there was enough for 8 people. It was OK - but we would not order it again. We got the chicken parm and it was tasty. The worst part of our meal was the pasta side dish the waitress talked us out of ordering the sauce we wanted into a more expensive meaty sauce and my husband and I did not care much for it at all.

I've obviously been to crowded bars, and I know it gets hectic and it can take a while to get the bartender's attention. At JB though, each time, I get the impression the girls behind the bar are purposely being rude. I've stood there trying to get their attention, while they reorganize the ketchup bottles behind the bar. From now on, my strategy is to send my boyfriend to the bar as it seems guys get the bartenders' attention more quickly. And I'll keep my tip until the attitude changes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Very disappointing food and service from Nubian Flavor restaurant. Ordered through Grubhub, on which the restaurant offers delivery service. After placing an order (and paying a delivery fee) we received a call from Grubhub informing us that the restaurant does not deliver on Sundays as they are just, ""too busy."" We decided to go and get the food ourselves. On Grubhub, the restaurant lists that grits, hash browns and toast come with a breakfast platter, but when arrived I was informed that I had to choose between hash browns OR grits. Once we arrived home and checked our bags we realized that we should have cancelled the order entirely. The food was prepared carelessly and parts of our order were left out. There were hard, gritty pieces in the eggs over easy which I can only hope were eggshell and not something worse. I'd ordered the corned beef hash that comes with the dish well done - it was not. My hash browns were missing - never included with my order. The hash browns that my girlfriend received with her platter were bland and flavorless. Very disappointing. We contacted Grubhub about the missing hash browns, and the 'restaurant' refused to make it right, insisting that they were already included in our order. This is not our first time ordering from this establishment and we noticed a lack in consistency with food preparation and delivery time, but we wanted to support a local business and give them another chance. They blew it. The kicker - we purchased drinks that we later discovered to be EXPIRED - as of APRIL of this year! Terrible! Steer clear!","[1.0, 0.0]"

When we entered the establishment, we found that two employees were sitting in the front lobby and had not even attempted to open the door for us on our first attempt.

"I've been to Sampan a handful of times, all of them great experiences, but I'll recount my most recent one for you here. Girls night out and we decided to come here because they have a gluten-free menu (for my friend) and are really accommodating about it.  Busy, but for a Friday night we were expecting nothing less.  It gets loud but still possible to carry on a conversation with your dinner mate. Drink: Heat.  Cuervo Silver, grapefruit juice, Sriracha.  AKA awesome in a glass.  Tangy with a big kick - if you like spicy stuff, you'll totally dig this.  But don't be afraid of it - I can't handle even the medium spice level at a certain other geometrically-named Thai restaurant in Philly, but I could totally handle this Heat drink. Food: My friend & I split the calamari salad and side of broccoli, and we each had our own order of shrimp Pad Thai (hers being GF).  Don't let the ""side"" label deceive you - this is a HUGE portion.  And it is darn good - best Pad Thai in the city as far as I'm concerned.  Everything else was also fantastic. Waiter: adorably attractive, even-keeled, quick-witted, very attentive.  If you're lucky enough to be seated in the tall ginger's section, watch out for his secret killer smile.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I heard about this place from the Foodnetwork and have been dying to try it. When I finally visited NY, I made sure to stop by. First star because the place was run by fellow filipinos who were really friendly. Second star for their endless variety of sauces. That's about it. The fries sucked for me. When I was watching it on tv, they looked waaay crispier and appetizing. When I finally tried them, I didn't find anything special about them. Belgian fries, huh? More like, plain, boring, thick, soggy fries. I've only tried them that one time, maybe they were having a bad Belgian fry day... or not. Nonetheless, I wasn't impressed. Plus, I felt bad for raving about this place to my friends who were vacationing with me and dragging them all the way over there in the middle of our site-seeing. What a bummer.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"L'Angelo is probably Philly's best kept secret for Italian food. Everything here is just amazing: the food, the service, the decor, even the size. It's hidden away on Porter street, right off Broad, and since it's pretty close to South Philly Tap Room, I'm in the neighborhood quite a bit. L'Angelo is small, but that's most of its charm. I doubt more than 20 people can sit here at once, but the (slightly) cramped quarters are pretty cozy, and only enhances the intimacy of the meal. I've been here several times, and I try to get something different each time. It's hard to beat their gnocchi though, or any pasta for that matter. I've had the veal milanese, which was delicious and perfectly done. The salads and appetizers are wonderful, and they've got my favorite bruschetta here. The waitstaff is great, even though they can't speak much English. Everything they say has a wonderful Italian slant to it. Absolutely amazing people and very nice. It's a BYO, so don't worry about getting shafted by a marked up wine list. Just bring a nice red and a date. You will get laid. I promise.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We had high expectations for this restaurant as we heard it received four stars.  Well, you can tell by the rating that it is definitely not!  The service was fine.  The food was dismal, tastless although presented nicely.  I personally had the Ricotta Cavatelli - with the duck ragu.  There was no duck ragu, but the duck that was there was tasteless and seemed to be on par with boiled chicken.  I ate only the cavatelli.  Other diners with me had scallops, pork chops and roasted chicken.  Of those three, the pork chops was the only good dish - but not excellent.  We had soup, the cheeseboard to share and chicken liver as appetizers (which we shared) - the soup was not hot, and needed something to bring it up to four stars, the cheese board was fine (but the server did not tell us what cheeses were presented - we recognized the blue cheese), the chutney quite tasty and was used to spice up the liver.  Desserts were fine, but the coffee was not worth drinking it was so weak, while on the other hand the double decaf espresso I ordered was only a single and so strong and bitter I was unable to drink it.  I am completely happy with a perfectly brewed espresso and was expecting a lovely taste.  Unfortunately, all in all we would never go back to this restaurant and cannot recommend it.  We had heard the quality of the food was ""spotty"" and we must have hit that spot!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"A favorite for years - not sure why it has taken me so long to review! This place is the best for all your Mediterranean meze needs.  The only thing I've really ordered here is the vegetarian appetizer platter which is a ""combination of our delicious vegetarian mezzes"" - you basically get the Turkish equivalent of common favorites - hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki, grape leaves, tabbouleh, and some other deliciousness.  The plate is $17, and comes with endless loaves of warm doughy bread to dip, spread, and devour.  Two people can easily split this for dinner and be more than full by meal's end.  Though the UES seems like a world away from the far West Vil where I live now, this place will always lure me back.  Making me hungry just thinking about it.  Enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The only saving grace for this place is its location. The food was ok - only ok - but overpriced. Our server was inexperienced, slow, and simply didn't deliver multiple things we requested.

"1st time here because of diningdeals cert but will base my review if 100% was out of pocket Came this past Sunday(cert not valid on Saturdays) around 5pm & place was virtually empty(no more than 3 parties were there at any time).  I can understand this somewhat during the Summer but not at this time of year. Decent sized parking lot but maybe not large enough if there is valet on fri/sat We were told to sit wherever & of course I chose the table(it's at the far wall on the right) with a warped floor area as 3 diff chairs were wobbling noticeably(didnt wobble at the tables i took them from).  Was tempted to change tables but dealt with it.  Also, the pepper shaker had a brownish hardened something on it?  Switched that with another table & that one had a smudge. Standard sesame Italian bread--butter was hard so had to wait a couple of mins before eating.   For drinks I got the thin mint martini(tasty but low on alcohol & at $12 not a bargain)--other got red wine Wanted the fried homemade short rib ravioli but waiter came back to say they were out & offered cheese ravioli instead.  We passed & wanted something similar so we ordered a 1/2 portion(you can order appetizer portions off the pasta menu) of the papardelle braised short rib tom sauce & dollop of ricotta--that was very good but at $13 considering the entree price was $18 was a bit higher than expected(usually restaurants will charge a little over 1/2 the price so I was expecting $10 - $11--not that a couple of dollars is a dealbreaker but it still creates the thought of being gouging). They were out of 3 different seafood entrees but none of them would have been ordered anyway so no harm. Entrees were jumbo shrimp oreganata(tasty---sides of string beans a bit too crunchy, mashed pot plain no taste).  Other got the cavatelli bolognese which was very tasty.  For a togo got the veal milanese which was pretty good though was hard to find the sausage(keep in mind it's preparation description looks like it got inadvertently switched with the filet but that is how they prepare it). However, you can have preparations altered to suit your taste. Desserts were spumoni(standard) & tres leche which the cake was ok but the icing was a coarse sugary type which is not how it's supposed to be(maybe it's the Italian way to top it as I've always had it at Spanish restaurants previously) I had cappuccino(misspelled on the menu) which was hot but not too strong. Service was fine & sociable but keep in mind there were only 3 tables at any given point so on a fri/sat not sure maybe check other reviewers. So for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, 2 desserts & 1 cap with tax/tip(if total out of pocket) would have been $140 which is a bit high. I prefer to give a detailed rating as opposed to just saying I liked it or I didn't. For me I rate a restaurant in 4 categories in order of importance: Food Service Value Décor/ambience/misc If you're wondering why this is the order for me I rather have great food & so-so service than the other way around.  You can always plan around a slower evening to make it just as enjoyable but not around mediocre food whether it's fast or slow paced. My 3rd item I call value instead of price because based on the taste & serving portion of the item compared to similar items at other restaurants tells me if it's a good value.  For instance the best steak I've ever had to date runs about $44 but besides being delicious(a way to tell is it stands on its own w/o adding any sauces) it is boneless & about 24oz so you get two good meals. Food(2.0), service(1.5), value(1.0) & décor/ambience/misc(0.5) I then take the # stars for each category & multiply by the # in parentheses then divide by 5 to get my final rating. If the final average is exactly 1/2 I'll round up or down depending on other reviews. So my calculations are as follows: FOOD                                     3.5 x 2 = 7 SERVICE                               4 x 1.5 = 6.0 VALUE                                   2.5 x 1 =   2.5 AMBIENCE/OTHER             3 x .5 = 1.5 Total pts 17 divided by 5 = 3.4 which rounds to 3 I have 1 more cert so if my next visit is markedly better enough to change my overall rating I will do so accordingly","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My family and I just had the most unbelievable experience at Continental Mid-Town. We went to Continental around 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon figuring it would be empty, and we could get in and out without issue...... I was right about it being empty, dead wrong about not having any issues. Our experience started out ok.  Seemingly friendly waitress, drinks ordered and French fries ordered for my child.  We ordered our meals, which the waitress repeated back to us.  Our appetizer came out but with no plates.  We had to wait for the manager to come around to get us plates and napkins.  Then half of our meal arrived.  This is where our experience gets ridiculous.  After waiting 15 minutes for my husband's meal to not arrive we started looking around for someone to ask.  Literally 10 minutes without anyone on the floor.  No servers, no bussers, no manager and a bar tender eating in the corner.  Finally we see our server and ask about my husband's meal.  She proceeds to insist she didn't hear us order it.  But she had repeated our order back to us.  There were 3 of us, so common sense would tell you 3 plates of food right?  Also if you are a server your job is to listen and hear what your customers are ordering so you claiming you didn't hear us order it makes you horrible at the job you have.  The matter proceeds to get completely out of hand from here.  She starts giving us a ""what do you want me to do attitude"".  Her options are discounting our meal or putting the order in.  Now these seem like perfectly fine options but not while you are rolling your eyes and giving an attitude about it.  Well, we didn't have any more time to spend, we just wanted to leave but there was no way I was leaving without saying something to a manager.  She says ""You want my manager, FINE"" and storms away.  She also quips in that ""I was nice to you guys, I even brought you syrup like you asked.""  Well genius, we ordered pancakes, which on the menu states they come with syrup so if that makes you a nice waitress I stand corrected.  As we are speaking to the manager she proceeds to keep eavesdropping and stomping back and forth and rolling her eyes at me.  That's the point I pop her the middle finger because I am severely annoyed with her childish behavior so when in Rome.  As we are trying to discuss the situation with the manager the waitress proceeds to stand behind him stomping her feet, pouting and rolling her eyes at me.  I am not one to keep my mouth shut and quite frankly I was at my absolute limit with her so I asked her to remove herself from us.  She proceeds to call me a ""Psycho"" and makes some comment about me having a child.  How the managers didn't remove her from us in the first place is completely unprofessional but allowing her to insult me being a mother, drawing my child into it?  Can you imagine something like this ever happening to you in a restaurant that is expected to have a higher caliber of service?  Yelling insanely personal insults at a customer that you gave horrible service to?  3 hours later I am still insanely shocked and appalled.   We eat out several times a week, from places 5 star to 1 star all over the city.  Never in my life have I ever had such a horrific experience at a restaurant.  Not even at a McDonalds.  We used to frequent Starr Restaurants, not just the Continental, but that will end as of today. It's not just screwing up, but having such an unprofessional childish meltdown over being called out about it, and then being allowed to remain on the floor, eavesdrop and insult customers.  Two mangers were sincere in their apologies, but at that point the situation was too far out of control to be rectified.  Obviously we didn't pay for our food, but we barely touched it waiting for my husband's meal.  The managers offered something to make up for the issue but I would never go back to the place after being treated like this.  I am really conflicted posting a review about this because you could tell the managers wanted to try to make up for her behavior.  If she would have just apologized without an attitude or blaming us for her mistake we probably would have walked out remaining customers, and she still would have gotten a tip as we are minimum 20% tippers even for lack luster service.  I hope this review steers people away from a restaurant that hires people who treat customers like garbage and don't deserve to be there.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Who says brunch can't pack a little bit of heat? One of our freshman year hallmates was in town, so we decided to have a catchup reunion over brunch. Not sure how we picked Cafe Condesa, but it turned out to be a pretty good choice. I was extremely late (20 min) and we had an extra person come, but the hostess was very accommodating, reseating us to match our larger party. The only downside is that I didn't receive a water glass until another 20 minutes after I had sat down (which I guess is my own fault but still...) I settled on the huevos divorciados (which apparently is a secret menu item!), and a long while later (I think they were seriously understaffed), I got my platter! Covered in a red and green salsa, this was probably the spiciest brunch item I've ever ordered. The eggs were cooked to a great consistency, with the yolks soft to the touch. I got a side of steak, which was recommended, but honestly, the dish would've been fine without the meat: add-on at your own discretion (add'l $4). The home fries were also a welcome change. Not crispy as I'm used to, they had more substance and spice to them, which was a great contrast to my spicy eggs. All-in-all, the food was delicious and well-priced (most entrees are less than $10). My only complaint is the waiting. We ended up spending close to two hours there, even though we were only eating for 30 minutes. However, it was rather relaxing and we weren't really rushed out, as would be true with some other brunch spots in town. You make the call.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As others have mentioned, it really is a hole-in-the-wall place in the middle of the residential area of Woodside. Nonetheless, I very much enjoyed the focused attention provided by our server, and even the owner (who said that the recipes were his Father's hence the name ""Papa's Kitchen""). The food is a little different than what I'm used to but given that it's a home-family-style recipe, that was expected. Plus, it was delish. More so, the portions are huge that I, my friend, along with her baby were full when we left and even go left overs. As for our server, he was very attentive but not suffocating. He even asked if I'd like to sing but given that our lunch is scheduled to be a ""chika"" time for my friend and I, I politely declined but will definitely take up the offer when my Husband and I visit this place in the next few weeks. The server and owner also said ""Hi"" to my friend's cute but ""malikot"" baby and even offered to help clean with the mess she made. Of course, my friend and I cleaned as much as we can but to have such understanding people is very assuring. That being said, I loved Papa's Kitchen!

The rolls are creative, the fish is fresh and price is fair. It is not a boutique like Oishii in Boston, RA in Scottsdale or Water in Tampa but it provides a clean, casual atmosphere with reliable service and food. We have dinner here at least once each time I come to town (every six weeks) and always leave very happy. They even continue to make a roll for us that was removed from the menu two years ago! For all these reasons I confidently endorse them. They do not take reservations so plan ahead if you are going on a Friday or Saturday night between 6-9pm.

"When you run around the chaos of Manhattan, you need some corners in the city to hide away and regain your sanity. Cha-An offers a few remedies for your developing schizophrenia problem.

Second, the tea itself cleanses and soothes you in a way that other drinks that we typically consume in the city (coffee and alcohol) cannot.

"My experiences have been generally okay, although, as the reviews suggest, there are many options for better halal food in the city. However, if you must go to 53&6th, remember the following guidelines: Go with exact change, because the vendors have pulled a bait and switch on me in the past. I don't mind paying $1, but I hate the idea of being cheated out of $1. Keep you interactions with the works short- almost non-existent. I can't remember which worker it was, but I've seen rude behavior coming from at least one of them on more than one occasion. Again, these things won't generally happen. But just be on the lookout.

"there's something i really have with the traif/xixa people: i trust them. i would literally eat or drink anything they served me. even if it's made with crazy ingredients that i have never liked before or combinations that sound highly suspicious, i just KNOW it is going to blow my fucking mind. it doesn't matter what i order, it's going to be intense and i am going to literally grab the last bite out of my dining-mate's hand (sorry, baby, but who saves one last bite to carry home?! too tempting.) i see other people have written about bad service, but i've never experienced that with either place. in fact, when i called xixa on friday night at 7:30 they gave me a res for 8:30 over the phone. that's pretty rare for a recently opened, williamsburg hot spot type of place (or has it some how managed not to be that even though it clearly is?). honestly, even if the service was shit, i would go to both restaurants, because the food is just always incredible. i feel like someone spent many days in a test kitchen trying combinations that sound counter-intuitive but shock and please your tongue in ways that can't even be articulated (by me). loved the fois gras al pastor, lamb meatballs, cornmeal flan with blue crab, and the octopus especially. it all melted in my mouth. it was all somehow firm but creamy. sweet but savory, but not salty. god, i want to go back right now. the agave-based drink menu is really unique, and i think because i know xixa/traif will never do me wrong, i was willing to try it. i had never had high quality tequila like this before. literally feels like you're just swallowing air, and a few long seconds later, warmth and smoke all the way down. like drinking a glass of good bourbon. and the way they set up their neat drinks with lime juice/sangrita/infused tequila as chasers/combiners is just genius. the sangrita itself is really complex and delicious-- sweet at first, then super spicy after it goes down. how did they even do that?!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I am rudely told by the cashier that I either have to get the side in the same container or I can't have it. When I ask her why she says its the managers policy, so I ask to speak to the manager. When the manager arrives he very rudely tells me the same thing. Again when I ask why, he says ""that's the policy."" After a couple of minutes going back and forth and feeling like they are making a big deal over nothing (like really, it's not even a SIDE if you can't get in on the SIDE) and also remembering the other times that the staff was rude to me I decide not to spend my money there. Instead of being apologetic, the manager looks at me and says ""okay, bye."" I guess he doesn't care about keeping customers! If they treat others like this, it's only a matter of time before they start to lose people. I work in Newark right at Rutgers and I will never spend my money at The Green Chicpea again.

"Very good Mexican food.  Let's take it from the top: Complimentary starters: Chips - good. Salsa verde - good. Pico de gallo - great.  I could eat this with a spoon. Apps: Trio of tacos (pork, shrimp, fish) - okay.  None blew me away. Guacamole - good, but not great.  Needed more salt and more jalapeno.  However, the avocado was extremely fresh. Main: Enchiladas rojas (chicken) - great.  Very flavorful, what you want when you order enchiladas Mole pablano - great.  The mole sauce is the best I've had in awhile.  Large, boneless chunks of white meat chicken.  Somewhat lacking in garnish (only a sliver of onion).  No frills, just good mole. Rice and beans (with both meals) - good. I'll be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"
I live down the street from this restaurant and I am always surprised by how busy it seems to be. The food is OK but that's about it. If I want to eat macaroni and cheese I'd rather not spend 15 plus dollars. Service is good but the food is just glorified diner food.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"Came here because my friend and I wanted to go to western tavern nearby and it was too packed. We came across this closet sized restaurant and it was totally worth it!

"Cute little Japanese izakaya off of k-town.  It's downstairs in the basement and could be easy to miss. Once downstairs, the place has a great ambiance with a trendy and hip decor. They have a pretty good happy hour special with $3 sapporo drafts, $4 wines, and $3 hot sakes before 7pm. The food is reasonably priced and super tasty.  They have traditional Japanese izakaya dishes like chicken karaage, fried squid, takoyaki, croquettes, gyozas, omu-soba, etc. along with some Korean inspired dishes such as kimchi cream udon. The standouts were the first two i mentioned along with the kimchi cream udon. I went with a group of 8 people at 6:30pm on a Wednesday and they were able to seat us even without reservation but only until 8pm so I think we got lucky and would suggest definitely making a reservation. They can accommodate groups but the diners we saw there were generally couples or less rowdy young professionals. It's more of a place for a quick drink after work or a date.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It's still good but not what it once was. The faces inside have changed and so has the flavor. The only thing consistent in this place is that creepy portrait of the Kennedys hanging on the wall. I used to love this place before they created their other offshoots but without most of the original guys in there making the pies it's like a great musical group without the original members. Naturally, I went with the artichoke slice. The bread quality is the first thing I noticed that seemed a little off. It seemed like they had these pies preheated a couple times. The cheese still has the familiar taste but it's as if something is missing. I guess you just can't hand off a recipe and expect it to taste the same when it's in the wrong hands. I didn't even bother with the margherita or the sicilian slice. I'd rather remember the good times. Coming back to here made me feel the way I felt while watching The Godfather 3.

"Love, love, love this place.  We've been going to this place for sushi for over 6 years now. There have been a lot of changes over the years but, the best one has been the new owner. Ivan is such a great guy. He is a creative and talented sushi chef who really enjoys interacting with his customers. Despite the renovations, the iffy wait staff at times (yes, I agree the ""dreaded"" waitress is the worst) and a really tough location he has remained loyal to the neighborhood and survived where I think most would fail. That should tell you just how good the sushi is here. Every person who has tried this restaurant on my recommendation has been very impressed. It's been really nice to see the place full of customers on a regular basis. I hope they get their patio back once the reno is complete.

"If you're craving just fries, this is the spot. I mean, this is as good as you can make a fry joint. Delicious, crispy, perfectly seasoned fries, with a choice of a kazillion different sauces which all make your imagination go wild. We tried the rosemary garlic, parmesan peppercorn, and just plain vinegar as our sauces. All of them were awesome. The rosemary really stood out in the mayo. I actually just really really enjoyed the plain vinegar with the fries. Price tag for the fries was cheap, but when we added the three sauces it came out to like $6. Atmosphere-wise, it was an awesome little hole in the wall which works perfectly for the food they're divvying out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"LOVED IT! Came here for an anniversary dinner just the two of us. The waitress told us right off the bat that everything comfortably serves two people, but of course my husband ordered two appetizers to start us off. We got the fried calamari/fried shrimp platter and the baked clams. Both were excellent. Calamari was a bit salty, but was neutralized by the marinara sauce (not thinking about the actual amount of sodium I ingested during this dinner- yikes!). Baked clams were quite tasty too. We had the fettucine alfredo and chicken parmesan as entrees. Obviously we were so stuffed from the appetizers that we barely touched the entrees, but they made a very tasty lunch the next day. For dessert we had the tiramisu- phenomenal. So light and airy and satisfying. Definitely will go back- pretty touristy but its not a pretentious place, waitresses are sweet and down to earth, nice ambiance. And the platters are HUGE so don't order the way my husband did!!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"DO NOT step foot in this ""restaurant"".  My son and I got sick a few hours after eating their food.  My son was violently throwing up and sick to his stomach ALL night.  He ate chicken that apparently wasn't cooked.  I don't want anyone else to experience what my son and I went through so contacted the Health Dept.  If you, or your family, get sick after eating here please do not hesitate to contact them as well.  They are not cooking the food properly or not storing it properly.  You will get VERY sick!   When I called to inform them that we got sick the guy was very nasty, called me stupid and hung up on me.  They make us sick and have the nerve to insult me!   If you read other reviews, like I did-after the fact, you will see other bad experiences others have had as well.   There are young children running around and not being looked after.  The girl at the register looked about 12 years old.

"So I went to Zahav with really high expectations, given Philadelphia Magazine's rating as well as great reviews from my fellow yelpers, and I was sort of, well disappointed.  I really liked the space and thought they did a good job with the interior of the place.  I was meeting a friend for dinner and arrived before she did it, so I stepped to the bar to have a drink.  I asked for the drink list and the bartender sorta snobbily ""rephrased"" my question...""would you like to see a drink menu?""  Tomato, tomato, list, menu, she knew what I meant!  Then I ordered the limmonna a great mix of bourbon, lemon and mint, which was quite tasty and apparently only $5.50 during happy hour.  To which she responded, ""you are 21, aren't you?""  Really!!??  Would a 17 year old saunter into a restaurant in the Society Hill Towers at 6pm on a Wednesday for an expensive drink??  Maybe she thought I had mistaken the place for Rotten Ralph's?  And if I wasn't 21 would I have said so?  I get the whole ID thing and appreciate that bartenders and establishments that serve alcohol can never be too careful, so, card me or don't, but don't be snarky about it... On to the meal, which was good but I don't think warrants the number one ranking in Philly. Both my friend and I opted for the taste menu.  So you get the 8 salads, one of the hummus selections for the table and then you get to select one thing from each column on the menu, plus a dessert.  I explain this here because our server while very charming didn't do a great job at explaining what this selection entailed. So, the 8 salads were...meh.  The hummus was awesome, we ordered the one with the fava beans and thoroughly enjoyed every morsel.  I had the stuffed peppers, the chicken with some sort of grain that I can't remember, and the salmon with pomegranate and Israeli cous cous...All very tasty but nothing near a culinary orgasm kind of experience.  I finished the night with the ""deconstructed baklava"" which was just ok.  I'm usually good at this but for some reason can't remember what my friend chose, besides the grouper which was delish!  I can say that she was similarly underwhelmed.   In conclusion, I would go back to try some of the other things on the menu, and definitely have a few drinks, but it's not at the top of my list..so take that Philadelphia Magazine ;)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Grimaldi's used to be the best. I used to wait in line in the winter cold at the DUMBO location to get it, but Patsy Grimaldi sold his restaurant about 4 years ago and now the new owner lost his lease on the original location and moved next door to 1 Front St. In addition, they are expanding throughout the USA - I saw a Grimaldi's in Houston and Tucson.  The pizza is still good and the coal fired oven makes it the one of  the best, but not as good as the original. Now, Patsy Grimaldi is coming out of retirement and opening Ignazio's at the original location next door.  I think it will be pizza wars and we'll be the winners.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"*** 3.5 stars ***  Glad I checked out this whiskey-paradise, but here are some things I wish I had known before: Try to get a chair facing the bar. The huge, simplistic wall of whiskey bottles is very beautiful and memorable. Menu was vast and had a lot of interesting combinations of flavors. The rabbit appetizer was good, but there was not enough rabbit in my opinion. Pork chop entree was the better between that and the duck. I found the cabbage with the duck to be too strong in contrast to the more subtle duck. The peanut butter and chocolate dessert was divine, though, and definitely worth it. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. Lots of fun cocktails to choose from, but I found the Bourbon Insider and Noreaster to be a little low on the whiskey. However, flavors were nice. Overall, portions are small especially compared to the price.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We were at the bar, which had a great ambiance.  The bartender was friendly and, though it seemed pretty busy, she still checked in.  The food was okay (the shrimp in my shrimp and asparagus salad were overcooked) but the weirdest thing happened: When we received our food--plated very well--the person (not our bartender) asked if there was anything else that we needed.  I just said, ""Oh another one of these would be good"", and raised my can of Sofia sparkling wine, which was stored in the fridge right next to her. It was such an odd exchange, she said something like..""Let your bartender know"" --and it was punctuated with an odd beat that said ""That's not my job.""  I was drinking a can of wine....it wasn't a cocktail or even something you had to prepare, and you asked a question--""did you need anything else?""  This food runner also doubled as a bartender.  If this were a territory thing, she could have just said, ""sure"" and delegated to the ""right"" person.  It just left an odd taste in my mouth.   Now that I learned the rules, I will still come back--and feel more comfortable interacting with the staff.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We were pretty hesitant but excited (paradox?) to try Veggie Heaven, as I've been vegetarian for years and have been eating dairy/egg-free for a few months. We went on a Friday night right before the restaurant and area got busy - and were seated right away. Upon looking at the menu I knew I had to try a little of everything: appetizer, meal, and dessert. We started with the fried dumplings, which were fantastic. My meat eating boyfriend loved them as well.  When it came time to order I was honestly a bit squeamish about ordering ""chicken"" as those words haven't passed my lips at a restaurant for four years. However, I went with the genera tsous chicken, and my boyfriend with the sweet & sour chicken.  We were both pleasantly surprised at how delicious the meal tasted!  The texture was a bit chewy, but really quite good.  The only strange part was the color - which was more beefy than chickeny. Regardless, I enjoyed my meal immensely and did not leave feeling greasy and yucky like from other chinese restaurants. When it came time for dessert, I knew I had to try the cheesecake. We went with the waiter's recommendation and ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake.  Without the strawberry topping, the cake is a bit ... off, however if you take each bite in with the strawberry deliciousness it'll knock your socks off for being made from tofu.   Overall we had a great experience here, and both agree that we would like to return to see how other familiar dishes taste.  Definitely worth a visit by vegetarians.","[1.0, 0.0]"

First of all, the service was poor.  I had to take my father's coat at the table and seek out someone to check it.  Our table was repeatedly interrupted mid-sentence for inane questions/comments from waitstaff.  Two  of our dishes were served to the wrong person at the table, which is unimpressive at a five-top.   In terms of the table, we were seated two on one side, three on the other.  I couldn't hear or see one member of my party because of the table setup.  The music was so loud that it inhibited conversation considerably-and I'm young (and love the velvet underground and the clash!).  I don't know how the older members of the group managed at all.  When we left, I heard that someone had asked that it be turned down a little; it was not. Secondly, the food was not up to standards for a restaurant of this type.  I've been to other Colicchio restaurants, and there was clearly something wrong here in comparison.  My baked ricotta was nicely flavored but inedibly hot, which left me way behind everyone and slowing down the pace of our meal.  It was served with nothing to spread it on and also no spoon.  An embarrassing amount ended up on the table since  it was too flaky to be eaten with a fork.  My biggest disappointment, though, was the quinoa ""risotto.""  I was excited to try this hybrid of two of my favorite carby indulgences.  Instead of the creamy dish I anticipated, I got a wet plate of one-note quinoa, like the last helping of a grain salad with too much dressing, or a bowl of brothy grain.  I left lots on my plate, but no server asked if I was satisfied.  Obviously, I skipped dessert--why waste the money or calories?  People at my table enjoyed the pumpkin panna cotta, which they said was excellent, while I suffered through bitter and weak coffee. Tom, I expected better!  I won't be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I recently moved to Plainsboro and discovered the charming town of Cranbury. I have gone into Cranbury Pizza on a few occasions, the food was good, but I immediately got the negative vibe of not being a local. The people taking the orders are very cold and unwelcoming, unless you are a regular customer that lives in town, only then are they warm and friendly. Someone else mentioned that he too never got a warm vibe from this place. I'm glad it wasn't only me that feels this way.

When to this jose tejas for dinner. My wife and I placed our order for an  appertizer and entree. As we started eating I placed an ordered for the another entree that my wife had order. Told the waiter that I wanted the entree but I might take it home if I wasn't hungry after finishing my first entree. This is the part you won't believe. I was not AllOWED to order the second entree if I was to take home the entree. This I thought was a joke since it was April 1st. It was...... wait for it. NOT A JOKE! The manager stated that they do not allow you to order something from the menu and bring it home. Been in the service industry for 35 years in jersey and never heard of something as stupid. Next time you are in Ask them about taking something home.  And wait for the answer........wait....wait ....wait......NO!!!!!!!!! Online sites claim that management sucks and with policies like you can order an entree because you might take a portion home is crazy.

"Just left from Rose Petals Cafe where the cops were called on my grandmother. Last week we both went to Rose Petals and the food was delicious but today 7/23/14 I've never experienced a business calling the cops on customers for bad food. My grandson order pancakes,eggs, and bacon and I ordered the wheat French toast. When the food came out My eggs were runny when I asked for fried hard my grandsons pancakes were old not fluffy and her eggs were scrambled hard when she asked for light. We sent it back and they brought out the food again our bacon was burnt my grandsons eggs were still hard, my eggs were the same ones they recooked and runny still. I sent my food back a third time and my grandmom didn't want her food at all at this point. The manager a Hispanic woman came out and apologized but then stated they would cook the food again at a discounted price but she had to pay for the food. We couldn't believe it pay for food she didn't want or eat. Non the less they called the cops and brought out my food for the third time and my bacon was cold and greasy my eggs were fine and my French Toast was made with the ends of the bread and weren't fluffy. We asked for the manager again and waited about ten minutes to find that she didn't come out because she was waiting for the cops to come.  Never again will I return to this place being forced to pay for something I don't want, having the cops called on me.

"Some of the hostesses are horrendous, self-important, and exude misanthropy: you will know them instantly. One has turned the miscalculation of wait times into an art form (try an hour over and then blaming the patron), but several appear chronically indifferent to ""the customer."" Service on the bar side is generally good but on the restaurant side has been consistently inconsistent, self-righteous, and--female. The last point is not a problem but it is suspicious. (I wonder how they feel about the larger-than-life naked girls in the men's room; the latter's breasts are considerably smaller than the average server. Someone should speak to the management about that.) The beer is exceptionally good; pears and caramelized walnuts in the salad make it worth a few bites;  the pizza is pretty good but not amazing. My advice? Get your pizza elsewhere and go to the bar on a weeknight when it's not too crowded. Don't hate before hated upon, but be prepared to avoid the sensual harpies with commercially ideal bodies.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Don't know which was worse the all u can eat pork ribs, the baked beans, corn bread,  some of the uncaring waitresses and/or the manager with the same awful mindset.  I treated my African American self and my nephew to a $23.00 per person all u can eat rib feast at the Percy Street Barbecue on Monday July 23, 2013 at 6:30 PM. Although meaty, the pork ribs tasted freezer burnt and were dry. The baked beans were similar in texture to the ribs, old and/or under cooked. The corn bread was saturated with butter, reminiscent of movie theater popcorn.  I requested corn bread without butter and was rudely told by the waitress its only made with butter.  The collard greens were very good and it was the only thing I finished eating. The waitress did suggest the beef brisket as an alternative so I agreed to try it. Meanwhile, the nosy elderly White couple (primarily the female) sitting next to us within 6 feet watched intently my dissatisfaction with the meal. After finishing their meal, some 10 minutes later, the White female stood up and stated that I was trying to get a free meal which was over heard by the approaching manager (he was also White). The couple then abruptly left as the manager and waitress arrived at our table with the beef brisket. I calmly told the manager that the ribs, baked beans and corn bread were awful and why. Before I could even sample the beef brisket the manager felt I was annoying his customers and it was best that we leave, so we did. I offered to pay for the overpriced drinks, he said it was okay, just leave. Now, had we been White, not Black and male... I believe we would had been treated much differently with a better remedy. We left, drove off and who's walking down South Street, it was the elderly White couple. I stopped along side of them in my 2011 top of the line Acura and flashed a wad of $20 bills at them. I shouted, ""Does it look like I'm in need of a free meal?"" The White male apologized for his ignorant, prejudice wife. I simply pulled off. I have eaten in some of the best restaurants from Los Angeles to Florida, to New York, this is by far the worse when it comes to food preparation and management. You live and learn, never again! I also had the pleasure of discussing my awful experience with one of Percy Street's regular customers who told me the restaurant is known more for it's beef brisket than ribs. This Brazilian and Asian couple also told me that the best thing I could do was to document my experience and share it with the world. You want a great atmosphere, FRESH, meaty, flavorful, moist all u can eat ribs? Try Bone Lick Park in Manhattan, NYC on Wednesdays and the Margaritas are only $3.50.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"a solid 4 stars alone for their kind and very graceful approach to our first attempt to eat here.  unfortunately, erawan has the honor of being the first restaurant in which my son decided to have a full scale demonic meltdown as we were seated.  i mean everything short of his head actually spinning around kind of meltdown.  what instigated temporary demonic possession?   elephants.  mommie won't let me touch the elephants in the front window.   pfff, two year olds. the staff was so kind and sweet to him, but he wasn't going to have it and so we decided to leave before ordering a thing. our second attempt to eat here involved getting a babysitter so we could guarantee some peace and quiet.  we started with the spicy beef salad- thai-style medium heat.  specifying the heat level is needed here and they do deliver that when requested.  well seasoned salad and beef was tender.  the red snapper is a large deep fried fillet.  the sauce was described on the menu as a tamarind sauce, but it mainly tasted like mae ploy sauce. might have had tamarind in it, but i wasn't tasting it.  for the most part it's good and nicely presented and filling enough for two.  we also had the rad nar noodles, which was served in a claypot.  it was a decent dish and a nice change from the other two spicier dishes, but we were so full from the other two dishes, we ended up taking most of this home. it's more expensive than what i am used to paying for thai, but they are sweet and extraordinarily professional.  definitely on the list as a repeat for thai.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I generally go for the noodle soup here - some of the most authentic Asian food in the University City area. That comes with a couple caveats: the shou lamian (hand-drawn noodles) don't have the texture you generally expect, and the broth is a little generic. It doesn't feel like there's a huge difference between the shave noodles and shou lamian. I'd also stick with the 'Chinese' noodles options versus the 'Japanese' noodles (i.e. udon, teriyaki noodle soup). Overall, still very good - a great option when you're craving something of substance. I'm not too familiar with the bubble tea or sushi, but I do think the bubble tea is good for its price point - also some of the best in University City. Convenient and with a large selection. The sushi selection looks good and my friends enjoy it, but that's all I've got. The restaurant interior is new and feels comfortable; the ambience works. Service is above average. They also have a (somewhat expensive) selection of Chinese/Japanese beers.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My husband and I had Valentines dinner there last night and it was the worst dining experience we have ever had (we're in our 50's). The service was excellent and the food was good (although overpriced for what we received).We dressed appropriately for a ""fine dining"" restaurant, shirt, tie, and jacket, nice slacks and blouse. We had reservations and sat in the small dining room. About 15 minutes later a family of 5 sat next to us. There were 2 teenagers and a boy about 10. They were in jeans and tee shirts and had been skiing earlier. Their conversation was so loud we heard everything they had done earlier.  They were loud and obnoxious and we could barely hear ourselves talk. Then shortly after they were seated a couple sat down at the next table. They were in jeans too along with giant Michelin tire jackets hung on the backs of their chairs and a baseball cap. Our waiter was excellent, but was so busy running around tending to this large demanding family that we were not of much concern.  At one point the boy was laying half on the table with his feet on the chair. We had planned this dinner and were anticipating a romantic quiet meal. Instead we paid almost $300 dollars and felt like we had just been to The Olive Garden. I guess we should have stayed in our sweat pants and ordered Chinese take out. We won't go back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"My most recent visit was probably my 6th or 7th dining experience at Mehek.  The one thing you can count on is inconsistency of both food and service.  I guess it survives because of the proximity to Princeton University.  I went there this past Saturday night and the complimentary papadum rounds they give you were horribly stale.  They tasted awful.  This is the first time I've been there and received stale papadum rounds, but it's another reason to go to an alternative Indian restaurant rather than return to Mehek.  The main courses were pretty good...I don't have any complaints about the 2 dishes ordered, but I also remember my chicken dish tasting a little bit better last time I was there.  I asked for the gajar halwa for dessert.  Guess what?  They didn't have it.  Now if this was the first time, I wouldn't mind, but this is probably the 4th or 5th time they've had issues of not having a dessert available.  If you have a dessert in mind, there's maybe a 1 in 3 chance that they will have it available.  Luckily, Halo Pub isn't too far away, so I went there for some nice and cheap ice cream.  Thomas Sweet is right across the street as well if you don't want to venture out far from Mehek. I had a coupon which Mehek had emailed me from from their own restaurant email list.  The waiter looked long and hard at the printout and even tried to turn me down initially for it until I was adamant to point out that the coupon was valid for almost another week.  You'd think that a restaurant with so few waiters would know about the promotions their own restaurant is sending out.  Lastly, a young gentlemen (non-indian and most likely a busboy or assistant waiter) was kind enough to pack up my food, but I realized when I got home that he combined the rice with the non-vegetarian chicken dish.  That's a big no-no.  Now I can't use the rice with the veg entree which I brought home.  Rice should always go in a separate container!  It comes off as cheap trying to cut corners by not using a separate container like that.  Despite being open for several years, this restaurant still has room for improvement and can't survive if it keeps making these mistakes. As another reviewer mentioned, the waiter gives you a tough time on the minimum credit card charge as I've gone through it.  I understand why restaurants have a minimum limit for a credit card charge, but I don't see why they have such a big issue with it if you are going to add gratuity to your check (which will put you over the minimum limit).  If you're going to be using Groupons or discounts, be aware of this minimum credit card charge for balances so you don't have to go through the hassle with the waiter,  Doesn't the business understand they'll lose a customer over giving them grief over a minimum credit card charge?","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Since my previous review (yelp.com/biz/percy-stree…), Percy Street listened to my grievances and changed the recipes for their sauces so they are again gluten-free. I greatly appreciate when a restaurant listens to its customers like that, especially when it concerns food allergies. When we went to eat here last night, the service was excellent, as always. The food still left a bit to be desired for our own tastes, though. Our turkey tails appetizer was tasty, and while I was able to enjoy the two new sauces, I still prefer the old trio that used to be served. Our waiter informed us that the chicken is now being grilled instead of barbecued, which seems odd to me, so I opted to try the spare ribs with a rootbeer-chipotle glaze and pickled watermelon rind, while my girlfriend went with the pulled pork sandwich with a red cabbage-apple-sesame slaw. The ribs were cooked well and the pickled watermelon rind was decent, but I didn't taste any hint of rootbeer in the glaze. Adding some of the house sauces helped put a bit more flavor in the dish, but I wish the rootbeer would have come through more, as I've always found that and beef to be an excellent pairing. My girlfriend wasn't crazy about her sandwich. Though the menu clearly stated that it came with slaw, she wasn't expecting a huge pile of slaw to be *on* the sandwich itself (she said the ratio of slaw to pork was greatly skewed in favor of the slaw). She had to eat a lot of the pile before she could even put the sandwich together to take a bite. When she was finally able to try the sandwich as a whole, crumbs flew everywhere, as the bread was extremely crusty and not very conducive to holding together a sandwich. She tried adding a bit of the house sauce to try and soften up the bun, but to no avail. We did take the leftover sandwich home, though, so perhaps a night in the refrigerator will soften up the bread a bit. Overall, my feelings toward Percy Street from my previous review still stand. I understand their wanting to take a risk and change things up, but for us, the changes are mostly negative. While I again commend them for changing their sauces to be gluten-free, the quality of the dishes just doesn't correspond well with their current prices, which increased again since February for the spare ribs and chicken, though the lamb ribs are now a bit cheaper. I'll continue to look at the menu on their website now and then to see if they continue changing it around in terms of both price and selection, but for now, I don't feel the need to dine there again anytime soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Each time I go to Percy St. I fall more and more in love. Every detail makes me swoon: The roll of paper towels that gets clamped to the end of your table, the handwritten masking tape labels on the three sauces they serve, the juke box playing old school Americana blues and rock. Then there's the meat. Ohhhh, the meat! The moist brisket is possibly the best piece of meat I've ever [fill in your pun here]. Then put a little Hot Mess sauce on it and you'll be [insert one more dirty bird here]. It's so wrong yet it's so right. It gets wrong-er too: Mac and cheese I dare say is the best I've ever had. Vegan chile is an admirable inclusion on a BBQ joint's menu, but it also happens to be delicious. Then of course there's the pecan pie for dessert--killer. All washed down with a Sazeroot (rye, absinthe and root) or the most excellent Manhattan, TX (rye, capano antica and campari) you'll be so full, drunk and happy you won't care that your fingers are stuck together from too much Hot Mess ;)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been here a few times and enjoyed it. Last night i went with my boyfriend.  We called and they do not take reservations for two. We waited for nearly an hour.  We thought it would be okay because the food would be worth it. I went last night and it was beyond terrible.  The food was just so-so and the service was pathetic.  We asked for water 3 x and bread and did not get served. When we asked someone for the manager, we were informed that our waiter WAS the manager. He was rude, when we asked him about the menu, he gave short answers. We did not get attention nor did we have a great dining experience. It ruined the entire night. Let's just say we will think twice before dining there again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Hagi... My first time experiencing what a Japanese Restaurant (without the sushi) is really like. Or shall I say, Japanese Bar. It is definitely a restaurant, with a full bar and a large array of Sake. Yum... The place is fairly big, but the wait can get up to 2 hours if you come around dinner time on a weekend. Me and my friend came here at midnight, just the two of us after a movie. It was still quite busy. They close at 3am. My friend raved about this place having the best Sake and food ever! So I HAD to try it. And I was quite impressed. The waiter we had was super nice, he gave great service. But I heard the waitress are bit... meh. Try to avoid if you can. Me and my friend started out with the White Peach Sake. SOOOOOOO GOOOD! A bottle is $25 -the size of a wine bottle. It was a good size for two people. We ordered the Buta Nabe with the chicken, chicken meatball and pork belly yakitori as well. The yakitori was tiny and not filling, but good. You have to order a lot of it though if you want to get full. The Buta Nabe was excellent. It's basically just veggies and pork belly stir-fried. SO GOOD! It's light and not oily. My favorite! Then we were still hungry so we added the Bara Nin soup, the octopus balls and the chicken and garlic fried rice. Yeah... Uhm, we were slightly tipsy and very hungry. The soup was SO GOOD. Not too salty and flavored perfectly. The chicken and garlic fried rice was just okay, it could do for some more seasoning. And the octopus balls were just meh. Not to my liking. It was my first time trying it, so I know now that I'm not a big fan. But they are very popular on the menu. All in all, the food was great. Service was great and the Sake was absolute SO good and officially my FAVORITE. I will be coming back often! The bill came out to be just about 45 dollars each person.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I was in Philadephia with work and had been craving Indian food for weeks coz surprise surprise! Indian is my favourite cuisine in this whole wide world. Since I'm new to Philly I had no idea where to go to satisfy my craving until last week, when a really sweet Indian colleague recommended Tashan to me. So off we went, a party of 6, to try this place out. On the way she explained to me that Tashan meant 'style' in Hindi and I found that bit of trivia amusing.  The first thing that will strike you about Tashan is that how they have done away with that typical kitschy interiors that most indian restaurants in the US seem to love. Tashan is apparently designed by some famous NYC based designer which is probably why they look like a really upscale fine dining restaurant. However, because of the open kitchen, the place smells great, with a great mix of all indian spices and herbs. Coming to the food, I ordered the Samosa chaat for starters as I was really craving a samosa. My friends ended up ordering the Tandoori shrimp and the Duck Shashlik, both dishes were top notch! Their portions are ideal for sharing and since I was having Indian after a long while, I really wanted to try as many things I could. For dinner, we went with the Tasting menu which is a great way to acquaint oneself with the things on offer at a new place. We ended up having succulent butter chicken, some quail and also a vegetarian dish. The tasting menu comes with wine pairings which were done quite well. For dessert, we ordered the Tashan Creme Brûlée which came with this indian dessert called gulab jamun. It was decadent. I also must point out that even though I didn't drink much, I noticed that they had a GREAT wine selection. I really feel that Tashan has managed to keep the essence of Indian flavours alive while taking the entire preparation to a fine dining level and adjusted the palate to suit our tongues.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ah Sidecar...My new favorite beer spot. I go for happy hour when they run half price nacho's and carnita's. Neither are true to form Mexican, but both are decent adaptations and worth the $2.00 to $4.00. I like a little munch-munch when I'm sipping my great American microbrews. The only beer this bar serves is from the good ol' US of A. you get a few cool points for that. They have an great selection of micro brews from across the country and I believe they carry at least 1 cask beer. I love to make my bartender work for my tip. Beer from the cask also has its own special quality to it... My finace had the black bean burger and liked it. From what I hear the rest of their food is good too. 3.5 stars for atmosphere, 3.5 stars for good pub food (not a gastropub) 4 stars for good beer menu. 3.75 total stars, but this time I'll round up.

"The fries are delicious enough on their own, but the myriad of sauces are amazing!  They usually let you try a sample before selecting which sauces you want with your cone of hot, fresh, greasy, thick-cut fries, so it's easy to try something new every time!  One of my favourite places to take visitors to the city, because who doesn't love french fries?  My favourite sauces are:  cheddar cheese, parmesan peppercorn, basil pesto mayo, wasabi mayo, and just plain ketchup, but I encourage everyone to try whatever appeals to them the most.  Seating is unfortunately limited, and it gets really busy during peak hours and late night weekends.  They just re-decorated however, upping the ante on decor slightly.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Mine was priced at $13 (which is outrageous if you consider what you're getting and what you're paying for), and each additional topping ranged from $1-$4, which is incredible.  The taste was OK.  I will not be going back.

"I can't tell you how much I appreciate Georgie's Diner.  They have gluten free bread and pasta that allow me to have sandwiches, burgers, pasta dinners and toast with eggs or french toast.  This is very rare in the restaurant business.  The GF items do cost more due to the products they purchase are more expensive as well.  When I try to cook GF pasta at home it does not turn out like it does when I have it at the diner.  One minute overcooking it becomes slimy and it is hard to find the perfect timing for this type of pasta.  Therefore, I go to Georgie's when I have a craving for pasta. They have the #1 burger for me, they are so flavorful, juicy and always cooked perfectly.  I was never into burgers until I had theirs so now I'm hooked and especially because I can have them on GF toast.   The diner is very clean and the service is always great.  The wait staff is always cheerful and friendly.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"After walking by this place no less than 20 times, a friend recommended that I try the place and I'm so glad I did! The food by itself would be enough to warrant 5 stars, but the owner, Hassan, really goes above and beyond to please his customers. I told him that I never had chaat before and it was also my first time to his restaurant. He gave me a brief history of chaat as well as reasons behind why it is so satisfying (texture, balance of flavors, each bite is different than the last.) He asked if I wanted vegetarian or not, spicy or mild, and then got to work. Honestly I was glad not to have to create something myself because there are so many options. Better to let the pro take over. Anyway, the end product was this tremendously satisfying mix of mangos, dried cranberries, figs, potatoes, mint sauce, chickpeas, a samosa, and several other ingredients I couldn't make out. It was all delicious! I also got a fig lassi and another couple got a mango lassi. He gave us some of their extra as well as our own extra. The lassi was also, not surprisingly, amazing. Bottom line: He won't charge you unless you think the food is amazing, and he absolutely deserves every penny.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Koreana comes recommended by my DAD. Which is weird because while my Dad has great taste in food, he's not a big fan of eating out or leaving the house at all. So when I hear him suggest a place I know it must be worth the trip. I've visited twice now and got different hot pots each time. I don't remember their Korean names, but one was with pork and one was with squid. I've also tried the beef one. All three were pretty great, but for me the pork reigns supreme. Perfect amount of spiciness and lots of flavor, and my hotpot was just the right temperature to get some nice crispy rice bits in there. I like that with all the hot pots it's not just getting the same thing with the meat swapped out, but they actually change the veggies and sauce according to the dish. And the place is pretty cheap! My dish plus bubble tea came to around $12 and was my lunch the next day. Not bad if you ask me. While the food is my favorite part of any restaurant visit, I also gotta give Koreana points for efficiency. The service is friendly and fast. You order and pay up front then seat yourself, help yourself to water and condiments, and bring up your tray when you're done. It's not luxury dining by any means, but considering it gets crowded with college students by dinner time it's certainly better than waiting around. Also, they're closed on Mondays. So don't go then because your other options are Abner's, Chili's, and a strip joint.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After spending a few days of researching which pub to visit with my friend who was in Philly for grad school interview, we came across this awesome pub, McGillin's, which was literally less than 500 feet away from our hotel--Holiday Inn Express on Walnut.   From the outside, it's sort of deceiving with its old looks, but once you step inside, it's pretty vibrant and it's got a good crowd that loves to drink!  My friend and I were lucky enough to grab some seats at the bar--and for sure, the bartender was awesome!  Asked him what is his recommendation was, and whatever it was (forgot the name), it was pretty darn good!   Didn't stay too long because had to leave early for an early morning flight, however wished I stayed there a bit longer.  My only drawback, if any, would be the music is a bit too loud, but I guess it's expected...it's a bar, can't expect shhhhh.   I'd definitely recommend it.  Great bar!","[1.0, 0.0]"

We booked with Angelo and Sheila few months ago, who were both attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and responsive to questions and needs. The night of, our ceremony ended a lot sooner than anticipated a quick call to Angelo and he said no problem we're ready to go. We were greeted with complimentary cheese displays, the entire staff was there lined up to greet us including the chef!!! The room was set up exactly as planned, decorated beautifully with seasonal décor, bar tenders were attentive, fast and very friendly. The food was great, prime rib cooked perfectly, everything was hot and fresh, a waitress had the chef make 2 plates up for my wife and I so we could finally sit and eat and so our guests would not have wait for us to go thru. Talk about service!! Not at one moment thru the entire night did anyone have to wait for anything our drinks were never empty, buffet was full, servers were taking care of all of our guests all of whom commented on how great the service was. I've been in the food service / hospitality industry for close to 15 years and there places few and far between that understand the importance of great service and how to deliver it, and to everyone who was there that night can agree that Angelo and his team get it and have mastered it. huge thanks to Angelo and his team once more and if you're looking for a place that has great service, great food at a price that's fair for everyone.

"Let me start by saying I worked in the same building that this coffee shop is located in and barely visited for the first 6 months... Yeah, I know... not a good way to start a review... But it gets better, I promise. I started with the Chef's Salad ( to test the waters) and once it passed my taste buds' very prejudiced test, I was hooked! Now I'm a regular... Have my own seat and all... Now for the real review: Great atmosphere, great people, and excellent food! It's nice walking into a place, that no matter how crowded, you're greeted by first name and with a big smile! My faves include the fresh fruit smoothie, the Asian Chicken Salad (the homemade dressing is to die for), the Chef's Salad, and of course the daily special! The specials are unique, vibrant, full of favor and ALWAYS satisfying! And I love that they listen to their customer's suggestions. If you're looking for your run of the mill-just drop in for a coffee-Starbucks impersonal touch coffee shop... Save yourself the headache and keep it moving. The company, the food, the atmosphere...

"Mooncake Foods has a great deal of promise, but they are not without their problems.  For a Seamless Web order though, they stand out from all the sandwich places.  Indeed, it is a rather pleasant thing to be able to order ""Grilled Prawns and Glass Noodles"" ($16) for lunch rather than a poorly constructed panini.   I really enjoyed the attempt at elegance, but the dish had its misgivings.  The prawns, served with their heads on, numbered three in total, all of which were overcooked.  The tough, near rubbery texture of the bodies, was a clear letdown given how attractive they looked.  Everything else though, it must be said, was actually quite delicious.  I loved the noodles which were interspersed with salad greens, batonnets of carrot, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes, all of which one could top with a cilantro, mint pesto.  The dish seemed especially healthy and tasty to boot.  I loved the clean flavors and the nice mix of textures.  The sauce really zinged!  The colors were beautiful, and it was a real delight to eat this dish.  Why in the world would they overcook the prawns?  Also, why would they include a side of rice with this dish?

The food is probably the best in the area given how cheap it is (it's very wallet friendly). Spicy Wok Basil is my favorite. However, beware of the service. Sometimes it's ok, but it can be truly awful at times (especially downstairs.) It literally took over an hour to get our food once, and all the employees are gruff and to the point. But the food is very good for its price. As a result, I've come to use this place as a takeout place, for which it is very well suited.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"COME HERE ON A WEDNESDAY! It's the best. $2.50 rolls and a great happy hr! Every time I come here, I order a bunch of sushi, and I'm in and out in about half an hr. Fast and quick service, and I'm in love with the sushi. Lately they've been doing happy hrs where you pay $25 in advance and it's all you can eat sushi, all you can drink and all you can karaoke! Of course, the selections are made before hand so it's a select five drinks or something like that, but SUPER FUN. You can get tanked and eat and sing and it's wonderful.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Really freaking good pizza. Definitively better than Lucali, not as good as Saraghina, but that's a good place to be stuck between. What separates this place from other pizzerias is their incorporation of sweet flavors into their pizzas. Surprisingly, it works well. The crust is near perfect. Chewy, crispy and charred. Many of their pizzas do not have tomato sauce so know this when you order. The only complaint I have is that I saw a roach running up the wall while I was waiting and that grossed me out a bit. Maybe a restaurant cat would help with that. Otherwise, probably the second best pizza in NYC.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went to this restaurant with a buddy of mine a few weeks ago...coming from Korean ethnicity, I know a little bit about Korean food...been to a bunch in New Jersey, NYC, and Seoul (the Korean city, NOT this restaurant)...by far and away this was the worst and most disappointing...where do I start? 1) VERY OVERPRICED: the $40 bulgogi meal for 2 was seriously for one person...literally a handful of bulgogi with two small heaps of rice...I could literally get the EXACT same amount in the H-Mart food court in Hartsdale, NY for $9 or $10 with similar quality...other restaurants I've been to at Palisades Park, Flushing, NYC, etc. gave significantly bigger amounts for similar prices...this restaurant probably figures people who are not too familiar with Korean food won't know the difference and figure people are willing to pay the price for it since extreme scarcity of Korean restaurants in CT...as a CT resident, I will NOT be going here again. I also like (and I mean this sarcastically) the way the ""Ajumah"" (those that know the language knows what I'm talking about) kept trying to sell me the $50 Kalbi for two instead of the $40 Bulgogi for two because ""it is a more healthy & satisfying dish"". 2) EVEN THE SIDEDISHES WERE DISAPPOINTING: they gave 3 pieces of kimchee for a meal of two...need I say more? 3) QUALITY: the food itself was not bad nor was it that great...actually hard to ascertain how good/enjoyable the food was when there was such little of it to eat in the first place. 4) SERVICE: not the most important category here as long as they are not rude, which they weren't...however, after giving us the bulgogi, they pretty much ignored us till we asked for our check, though...my water was never filled and left empty all the way till check time..could not necessarily ask for more water when they were not around for me to flag down 5) OPTIONS: to get decent Korean food and decent prices, there are no other options for CT residents other than NYC (a bunch there, especially in Koreatown) & New Jersey...few half-decent ones in Hartford, CT & the Edo restaurant in Norwalk gives you a little more for the same price but nothing to write home about. I'm writing this review because it's important that people get decent value & service for their money and I don't want people thinking this over-priced Korean restaurant represents what all Korean restaurants are like, because there are some truly phenomenal ones in NJ and NYC. I usually try Korean restaurants out before I decide to bring my Korean wife (who is picky about Korean restaurants) and well, even my non-Korean buddy said two-thumbs down.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Have been a customer of Beana's since they opened their doors soooooo many years ago. When we started coming, our (now) 24-year-old son was little more than a toddler. Beana's play area meant that my wife and I could have a rare meal out where we ate together while we watched our son entertain himself with puzzles and coloring books. Now, our boy is a young man and we still go to Beana's. In the 20-some years, I have only sent back one meal. I found their chili to be greasy. That aside, Beana's food is always consistent. Their refried beans are wonderful. The taste can't be found in something in a can on a supermarket shelf. I always ask that they serve them 'naked,' without cheese or salsa on them as they taste great all by themselves. Also recommend the fajitas dinner, which is too much for one person to polish off. Tacos, hard OR soft shell are another delight. If you are a vegetarian, you can ask for black bean filling instead of beef or chicken. Although I am a dedicated carnivore, I have frequently opted for black bean tacos. Yes, the drinks are in red Solo cups. Who cares? The birch beer is just as sweet as in glass. I wouldn't turn away a frozen mug, though. Big props to Gina and the gang for providing happy dining for many years.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Was Fogo de Chao amazing? Yes, due to the concept and the service. Was the quality of the food amazing? It was great, but not amazing. Having all you can eat meat was great, but a restaurant like this seemed to lose its quality over the quantity which I find completely understandable. I did enjoy the waiters and the chefs. They were a delight and were always very considerate and very personable. Moving onwards to the food. I would have wished to try all the meats, but there was such a wide selection and so much to get to that it became exhausting, in a good way. As for the meats itself... Frango- the chicken I was not a fan of at all, I actually did not eat the whole piece simply because the flavors tasted a bit off. When it was wrapped in the bacon, the flavor of the bacon overpowered the taste of the chicken which was disappointing. Cordeiro(the lamb)- the leg of lamb may have been the best part, however the lamb chops were constantly dry. The leg of lamb was so tender and moist. They had begun my meal with the leg of lamb and it was a great start and led me to high expectations of the other meats. Sirloin- All of the Sirloin meats were fantastic except for their house meat the Picanha. The Picanha seemed a little too salty for my taste. Filet Mignon- The Filet was great, very tender, and each piece cooked to perfection. Even  the bacon wrapped filets were great, and the bacon this time did not seem to mask the taste of the filet. It was a very fair balance. Linguica- the sausages were small but so good. It was very sweet, and had a nice little kick to it. I thought I would be one to never flip the red/green disc and keep it on the green side the whole time, but I was wrong. I wish I had saved room for desert, perhaps next time.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I think this place falls somewhere in the 2.5 star range.  The food isn't really bad, but it's just very forgettable which is pretty consistent with any fancy Mexican spot I feel.   We got the queso which I thought was pretty good, but they came with these weird chips that kind of looked like Captain Crunch cereal, why can't they just have regular tortilla chips??  Anyway, for $9  it was also a relatively small portion.   For the entree I had the hanger steak which was good, but not good enough to have me coming back for more.  The stuffed chayote that comes with it was pretty good, probably cause it was just a bunch of melted cheese with a little bit of squash.   I also got to try the fried plantains for a side which were fried very well, but lacking in flavor.   This place just reaffirms my belief that you can't take foods that are traditionally cheap and fancy them up into something as good.  If you're in the WV and are looking for something that won't break the bank, this is a spot to consider.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Honestly, this place should get 4.5 stars because the pros really out way the cons by a land slide. First of all the location couldn't get better as it is only a couple of feet off of Times Square. If anyone has eaten in this area you know that due to huge influx of tourist most restaurants charge an automatic 18% gratuity to your meal regardless of your party size. This high class establishment does not, impressive!      As you walk in you notice the decor, rustic modern but very much warm and welcoming. I must say though the hostess and waitresses aren't easy on the eyes! My wife and I was seated fairly quickly for a busy Saturday night, it seemed like they had endless sitting for them to be able to accommodate the revolving door of people walking in. Even though the portions are family style the seating was not which is always a plus when you want to have romantic night out alone.      The food was decadent and flavorful, you could actually taste the freshness in the seasoning. As I stated before the portions was plentyful so we ended up sharing a plate of chicken parm over penne (Three people could of eaten from this plate). If you order the meat over pasta it is only a $10 extra charge as opposed to paying $25 more for a side plate of pasta. The meal came out to under $50 with soft drinks, bread and tip. For a couple to eat for that amount of money in Times Square and have the quality and portions be what they were is the reason this place has now gained a loyal customer for years to come.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"High expectations after reading the reviews here but.... Went without a reservation on a Wednesday evening and got seated in an elbow to elbow table not fit for European cloister phobics. After pleading, got our wish to be moved to the open table in front of the open window. Ahhh. Ordered wine - a bottle they also sell by the glass- a Pino Blanc from Alsace and requested to have a taste before making the $47 decision (one of the more bottom end priced bottles). Not possible, the handsome,  French accented waiter said. I stupidly accepted then he brought the bottle, opened it and proceeded to pour two FULL glasses - half the bottle without letting us taste it. It turned out to be luke warm and slightly sweet. when I remarked about this, he retrieved an ice bucket noting awkwardly it would get colder soon. It turned out the guy was in training, first day on the job. But that shouldn't be our problem. The more competent waitress who took over explained this to us and apologized, at least. But that was it. We ordered the mussels and clams as an app- our impression was they were slightly overlooked. The broth had flavor but was over salty. I had the sautéed halibut in lemon sauce- fresh tasting, nicely done - best with the good ratatouille we ordered as a side. The fries were not worth the $6 price or the calories- fat and mealy and tasteless despite the spice layer. Husband ordered the steak which was perfectly fine. The best part of the meal was the warm mini baguettes with butter!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I really like Peppinos - though I do wish they had a more enticing reason for me to stop by more frequently. I live very, very close so I would like to take advantage of their great pizza more often; but unfortunately their really good pizzas are not sold by the slice.  With Joe's pizza being right up the block I often opt for Joe's just for the sake of variety. Admittedly Peppinos has much higher quality in their regular menu but so many of us in the neighborhood are just picking up dinner for ourselves, and I think that Peppinos is designed to sit down with a family. Personally, I would like to see at least  one of their specialty pizzas available by the slice daily.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I do not believe BAR should be mentioned in the same breath as the other 3 real New Haven pizza meccas but the pie is not bad. Different, but not bad. I am not a fan of sweet sauce so my immediate reaction here is negative, there is virtually no acidity to the sauce and I imagie some people like this...I do not. As far as the crust, yes it is thin but unlike the other big New Haven names it is tough, it holds up well in the oven and does not get soggy but in order to get to this thinness the dough has been overworked with a cardboard like result, some people ay prefer this over a real thin crust that will not be as firm I do not. The crafted beers are great and reasonable, and the overall ambiance nice. I am not a ""clubbie"" so I can offer nothing to say here...but as far as the pizza it is pretty good by other state standards but not even in the top 6 for New Haven.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This wasn't my choice of Ramen from Japan. I give two stars because of their quality noodle, toppings and added A/C. Problem was thta their Chicken(Paitan) Ramen's base.  Paitan means clear soup but this wasn't clear anymore. Ramen base is their life and whole thing, almost. I tried both Chicken and miso ramens. The concentrated soup flavor didn't work and stayed in my throat and stomach for a while.(Unlike Ippudo's Tonkotsu soup base) Probably, grease comes up on top of the soup should be removed little more or work on the smell.  (I like fatty soup and fatty food, though) I ate all noodle and toppings but left most soup that I usually emptie it. Little later I had to go for second dinner. Their noodles are very good in flavor and texture as well as all toppings.  However, the soup base killed all the good ingredients. I understand that ""Totto(name) has to use chicken base"" but it could be better. More problem was their staffs or related people. They were sitting on the entrance steps(outside) and eating and drinking.  Also, some of the staffs outfit somehow improper as restaurants. This kind of restaurant can be very casual and staffs can be same but they exceed the border line. It is not too late to fix up this small problems and they could make this ramen place little better.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I headed to Vesta on a Sunday evening with mom and bro after reading so many good reviews to check it out for my self. We had the bocconcini appetizer which was super fresh and delish. Homemade mozz and olive tapenade with crostini. (the breadbasket was a winner too). I had the capellini with eggplant and tomato...it really didn't taste like anything at all...I've made way better pasta at home and was disappointed. Bro had the skate  which was better than ok but less than wonderful and mom had one of the specials that I don't remember the name of but it was actually the best of our 3 entrees. We had the chocolate bread pudding for dessert....really strong dessert option...fresh out of the oven and warm...soft on the inside and a light crust on the outside...not too chocolatey. The espresso was excellent while the cappuccino was too milky. Dinner for 3: 1 app, 3 entrees, 1 dessert, 1 espresso, 1 capp, 1 coke and 2 glasses of white wine came out to $104 with tax and tip. Great price point. Service was really great and friendly and everything went accordingly...and the place was hoppin on a Sunday. After looking at what other people were eating we decided the steak was the thing to get here...everyone looked happy and the meat looked excellent. I used to live exactly a block away and think if I still did I would come here out of convenience...but I live in Forest Hills now and I wouldn't consistently make special trips for it but they have great prices for what I think could be great food so I will give them 2 more chances...You better win me over Vesta.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Based on the general manager's kind and sincere response and all the wonderful things I had heard about this restaurant from friends who have dined here I decided to partake in a second dinner during a recent brief stay in New York City. The dishes I ordered were all very unique, creative, and prepared with care. The best was the GRILLED OCTOPUS. It was a bit spicy, a bit toasted, and a bit crunchy. The texture of the octopus was like it had been massaged for hours. A delight to eat.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Eurgh. Overpriced Tacos served with plastic sleeve cheese leaves me feeling queasy. Add to that heavy handed uses of salt. I swear, the Carnitas was too overpowering and salty, but at least it had flavor. I didn't taste anything in the vegetarian Tacos at all, as it was overpowered by the watery salsa. My whole ordeal came out to 11.90. I mean, this might be a good deal for the Village area, but a New York deal it ain't. Also, my tacos easily broke apart under one tortilla due to the poor presentation and weight of all the food.  It's normally custom for places to double wrap these babies.

"I ended up at Cantina for a birthday dinner with friends. We were told we could not be seated until our whole party arrived (annoying) so we ended up waiting a bit for a table.  At this point I was starving and a big crabby as a result of my hunger pangs. Luckily this place has Free Chips and Salsa and they do a great job of bringing re-fills of chips and salsa. Unfortunately that's the best part about this place... it's somewhat necessary to fill up on chips and salsa because the service is absolutely horrible. Four different people helped us with drink orders, food orders, served us the food, got us refills, and brought our check. I hate not knowing who our actual server is and it annoys me when no one wants to help us because they're not ""our"" server. The staff was rude and really did not look like they knew what they were doing. The food took forever to arrive and it was a steady, but not crazy, Thursday evening. The food was average. The burritos could feed a family of 4 and the nachos are huge as well. I recommend splitting stuff here as the portions are huge (especially after you fill up on chips and salsa and margaritas). I wouldn't recommend this place and will be sticking with my usual Mexican spot.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Thank goodness for Boho Cafe. The sandwiches are awesome and filling. My personal favorite is the buffalo chicken with blue cheese...you just can't beat that. Also the prices are totally reasonable. The only thing keeping me from giving this places 5 stars is the coffee and the decor. I don't know what look they are going for but it's quit the mishmosh. The iced coffee I got a few days ago was, to be frank, undrinkable. But despite that, the customer service is solid and so is the food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of my favorite places to eat when I visit Vermont.  I enjoy their lasagna on Wednesdays.  And on Thursdays the stuff peppers are huge!  I love how their bread is always so fresh and they'll give you all the bread and butter you want.  The one draw back is they have the world's smallest (or close to it) men's room.   It is in an old Vermont building which once was a First National Supermarket way way back.  My great grandfather was a manager there.  I can not imagine how different things were then.  Oh I love the mostaccioli too.  Be forewarned, sometimes they get long lines on Wednesdays when they serve Lasagna.   I believe they are closed on Sundays and Mondays.  Bring change for the parking meters.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here in January during off peak hours (4:00pm) on a Sunday with my boyfriend. They have a limited menu between 3-5:30pm but that didn't really matter since we were both going to order the burger. I had the burger cooked to medium and it was very juicy. The fries were crispy shoestrings with rosemary and garlic ships. I also wanted to try the Gnudi but they weren't available. Desserts didn't sound that tempting so we skipped it. The space is very small but cozy, the second floor is much better spaced and isn't quite as boisterous as below. The bathrooms on the 2nd floor are pretty tiny and nasty: read smells like urine so maybe don't use the restrooms here. All in all, I would say that although the food at the Spotted Pig was good I prefer the food at the Breslin.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was just here for my birthday and I cannot say enough great things about this place! If you're looking for an amazing restaurant, this is it!! The ambiance is so beautiful, filled with nothing but cool lamps, flowers, and candles. I had specifically asked to be seated in the back with the retractable roof but it was cold out so they instead kept it closed and started a fire in the fireplace. The food was a bit pricey but it was all delicious! I highly recommend the goat cheese and tomato sauce dish, garlic and buttered shrimp, and the hummus toast. There was not one cocktail on the menu that we didn't enjoy; half the initial reason I booked here was for the drinks and I was not disappointed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and they went above and beyond what I'd ever expect. The hot bartender in the front made the best drinks and he was very attentive to us. And Donald, the owner, not only check in on us continuously to make sure we were taken care of, but he graciously walked my party over to the speakeasy next door and cut us to the front of the line. My night got started on the right foot because of Salinas - thank you, Salinas!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Awesome Sunday brunch spot!  $25 for all-you-can-drink mimosas and/or bloody marys.  There is a make-it-yourself bloody mary bar for those who like to personalize their drinks.  Be sure to drink a lot though, so you don't pay too much attention to the food.  Okay, I'm not going to totally bash, them, I'd say it was a bit below average.  I had a breakfast burrito.  No major complaints, but it was just a typical egg in a wrap kind of a deal.  Not much flavor or pazazz to it, and there was more floury wrap than there was eggs.  The ""potatoes"" (i think they were potatoes) were tough to swallow.  And chew.  They were barely cooked and they had sort of a tangy or bitter taste to them.  I'm not sure what was going on there.  All in all, definitely a fun spot to go with a group of friends to start out a Sunday Funday.  Just avoid the potatoes!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Over 30 years ago, when I first had L&B's pizza it was truly excellent.  I enjoyed it for many years.  However, about ten years ago, I tried the pizza again, & it was doughy & undercooked.  My feedback to them was met with utter indifference. Willing to let bygones be bygones, I tried them again this month, & got a pizza to go.  Not only was the exterior burnt to an inedible crisp, but the rest was an insipid, unpalatable mess.

"It's really a shame about this diner - it's been open only about a month or so as I write this, the staff is friendly and because it's new, the place is clean and generally inviting, not to mention that its location is right on Rte 130, making it a dynamite spot to grab a fast bite because of its easy access.  But what a major disappointment it turned out to be.  Food was cold and remained so even when it came back from being ""renuked"".  Condiments were cheap versions of the real thing (you can taste it) and corners were cut in spite of the large portions.  For a Saturday night, you can practically count on one hand the number of patrons who were in the place, and that was a tipoff right then and there.  But now I know why.  Unless the kitchen staff is either changed or better educated on how to deliver a good hot meal, I believe that the diner will (or should) close down.  A true disappointment.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This is my first review as a yelper. I decided to review my favorite restaurant in NJ. My wife and kids and I have been here at LEAST 10 times and have never had a bad meal. In fact it has always been excellent. I have been to many thai restaurants both in NJ and NYC. This small place where the husband (Iggy) takes orders and the wife cooks up the most delicious food ever is the best thai I have had. The pad thai is excellent. the shrimp and garlic lover is amazing. The coconut soup and the hot and spicy soup will leave you wanting more. My kids love the spicy fried rice. The prices are very reasonable. We have never spent more than $70.00 which usually includes 2-3 apps, 3-4 entrees, soft drinks ( the thai iced tea is so refreshing) tax and tip. It is BYOB for those who care.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Food was pretty good, but not  amazing as many of the reviews here attest to.  Even though I've definitely eaten better Italian food in the city, I might have given the place another star if not for their completely miserable service.  Our servers were not only lackluster, but they seemed to convey that our requests were inane, imparting upon us a very cold vibe. Decidedly, the most offensive moment was at the end of the meal.  Instead of being packed in boxes, our left over pizza slices were layered between paper plates and stuffed into white paper bags.  I might expect this from a place I walk into off the street, but not a nicer sit down pizza restaurant.  The server pretty much refused to give us boxes, and needless to say our food was ruined. Safe to say my first time here was my last time  There are tons of Italian restaurants littering the city that have better food and friendlier service.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food got off to a good start with the warm rolls. The salad was standard - a good size, good taste, nothing terribly memorable. There was a minor service glitch when the wrong entrée came out, but the right one quickly arrived. The salmon was a little dry. The tables were much too close together - I felt like I knew the life stories of the people sitting next to us. The noise level got louder and louder as the night wore on - if you don't like noise, come here early. They have a lively bar scene, so that accounts for some of the noise spilling into the dining room. The prices are reasonable, so I would come back if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been wanting to try this place b/c I hear they have a killer burger... so, last night, a group of us descended upon the Spotted Pig to see what all the fuss is about. Sure, the burger was okay, but it was definitely not in my NYC top 20. The meat was tender and tasty enough as was the bun, but the Roquefort Cheese was a bit overpowering. Plus, I asked the waiter for lettuce and tomato b/c I generally enjoy them on my burger... and he said, ""We don't do that."" Well, they certainly have salad on their menu, so how big a deal would it have been to send out some leafy accoutrements?!?! A bit of a crazy policy, IMHO. As for the shoestring fries that are served with the burger, they are tasty... but they're hard to dip into ketchup making them more of a mess than anything else. Again, IMHO, the fries are just all hype. [SPECIAL NOTE: The food runner mixed up the ""medium rare"" burgers with the ""medium"" burgers when he was passing them out to our table, so be sure to double check before you bit down!] The atmosphere at Spotted Pig is eclectic and interesting and is probably comfortable most nights...however, on the night we visited, it was hot and humid outside and the air conditioner in the restaurant was broken. NOW I understand why our wait went from 2.5 hours to ""oh, we can seat you immediately."" Beware of this place until they get that fixed, or you'll be sweating like a pig in the Spotted Pig! [The management should have warned us of the heat issue before seating us; I felt that was super discourteous.] So, would I return? Hmmmm... I guess the jury is still out. Someone would have to do some heavy convincing to get me to return.

"First let me be clear that I am not commenting on the food.  It could be great but, I didnt go to eat.  I went to this place as a recommendation for Salsa dancing.  So, my comments are for those who really like Mambo/Salsa/ Merengue/Bachatta, and the occasional cocktail.     The good: 1. The place is well kept.  It's actually pretty appealing on both the inside and out, and for a nightclub in Hartford, I would say its definitely pretty upscale.  Both younger and more mature people would have an equally nice time / feel comfortable here.   2. The dance floor was immaculate and there was a sufficient amount of room to dance.  It is probably one of the best in the region.   3. There were quite a few pretty good dancers and plenty of people to dance with.   4. The drinks are descent.  They are not watered down but they are not large either.  They are reasonably priced and the service is fair and prompt.   5.  They have two dance floors so, if you want an occasional break or you are like me and prefer salsa over meregue etc. etc., they have another room for the mainstream stuff.  Even this room is pretty good because they mix it up with newer music raggaeton and some old school hip hop / R&B. 6.  They people are pretty cool here overall.  No drama, just people who sincerely like to dance.   The Bad: 1.  If you are a guy, you will still get felt up by security / patted down.  It is not ultra aggressive and doesn't leave you feeling like you just got groped by an ex-con.  Unfortunately, some knuckle heads have ruined it for the rest permanently.   Overall, very nice spot to do some salsa dancing!  The earlier you get there the better as the floor gets crowded quickly.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The waitress refused to let us sit/order 4 portions just because the 4th person is not here. Rigid rules that made customers feel that they are not as important and that they want to make the fastest money in the shortest time by not allowing customers to sit just a little longer.

"Oh Percy Street. I have loved it here since they opened, but I had to subtract two stars from a perfect score. As others have mentioned, they went through a menu change about a year ago, and from a business standpoint, I get it. The platters were a lot of meat and at some point, it can't be cost effective. And for those of us who can't eat half a pound of BBQ in a sitting, the more traditional entree items were welcome. However, by removing the platters and the meat choices all together, it killed the feeling of an authentic BBQ joint and now just feels like any other upscale theme restaurant in this town. Nail in the coffin? The tiny glass jars of sauce that replaced the ketchup bottles that once were. It's also really loud, even during an afternoon lunch. Now that I'm done mourning: the brisket sandwich is great. The hamburger is ok, but I've had better. The Mac and cheese is the stuff that dreams are made of. When the man and I go, we each order one because sharing it can lead to some nasty ""I want the last bite"" fights. And if you have room left, the pecan pie is sticky and sweet and delicious.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Gennaro's is a wonderful restaurant!  The food is excellent, the wait staff is attentive and accommodating and the ambience is welcoming. We have been eating here for years.

"We've eaten at the Yardley Inn several times. The service is always good and they have an interesting menu but... I always seem to order the most bland thing on the menu. This time I had the Griggstown Chicken Breast. It was a little dry and flavorless. The side veggies were good, especially the broccoli rabe. I'm sure we will be back but next time I'm going to have a burger. Hopefully I can't go wrong with that. (famous last words)","[0.0, 1.0]"

"somewhat disappointing dinner. nice ambience and design of the restaurant, but: Sushi dishes are overpriced (28$ for an 8-piece futomaki role? Surely you jest), which drove us towards the ""bowls"" with set menu. fried pork or chicken over a lot of rice... Really nothing more than just OK. Misu soup on the side was good, egg custard dish  was interesting as a curious. Nice presentation of dishes but left us unimpressed in terms of taste, texture, etc. disappointed to see that nothing of the subtleness and minimalist approach of Japanese cuisine came through these dishes... Service tried but could not make up for the rest.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went to Oaxaca the other evening with my friend who was new in town. I was immediately impressed, the guacamole is incredible and alone a reason to go. We each got the steak which we were impressed with. After dinner we decided to sit at the bar and enjoy some of the great beers which were on tap. The service was brilliant and the manager made us feel very comfortable. We were amazed to see the place transform from a great restaurant into a lively bar. We enjoyed a few drinks and sampled the tequila selection. I will most definitely return and couldn't recommend the place more. Easy 5 stars.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Shopping and a burger!? What could be better than that. Plus, I'm sorry adult milkshakes? You had me at adult. You can design your own burger and that makes me happy even if it does mean that service is a bit slow.  Honestly I'll take slow service in exchange for good food versus the opposite.

"Parking here sucks! At the next block, make a left and just park on the side. Walk the 1/2 blocks because you'll need to walk back once you're done eating. Reason is that there's so much food at this place for the 10 bucks buffet, you'll end up falling asleep while eating because you wouldn't be able to finish tasting a sample of each food. It has a lot more choices than Fiesta Grill of Jersey City and they've got a lot of desserts. I would have given them a 5 but the parking stinks and the place needs to be fixed up. Try their ""taho"" (tofu gelatin) that you can add with sagu (tapioca balls) and sweet sauce. It's what I recommend if you're into eating pure protein but vegetarian or doing weights and don't want to eat anything heavy like red meat. I was told it has more protein than meat, but it's like a dessert! So in reality, you can have your cake and eat it too, well tofu I mean.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Shifty's is a small boutique Mexican joint. The menu offers some inspiration on traditional Mexican fair.  $8 will get you three tacos that fail to serve as a full meal.  Add ons for chips and salsa are available, but come in servings so small they're gone in an instant.   Shiftys has almost no atmosphere to speak of; it's best as a quick stop or a take out joint.  Some audible frustration/argument between the front of house and kitchen made it pretty awkward for us as we waited for food. Bottom Line:  Shifty's is a good idea, but needs some work.  In the mean time, I'd prefer a hole-in-the-wall for cheap prices, larger portions, and better food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

My coworkers and i ordered a bunch of different meals and ended up sharing. Beware of the spicy range. Last but not least, the ambiance was very soothing.

"Not a very good example of a speakeasy with great cocktails. That's really too bad because the potential is there. Not a very good value, either. The bar itself is beautiful, but it's barely a speakeasy (basically just a bar behind a curtain), and the drinks are way overpriced given the quality. The best cocktails I've had in the city have come from some of its better New American restaurants (e.g., Buttermilk Channel, Marlowe & Sons, Gwynnett St., etc.), and Employees Only is more expensive and not in the same league. It's the little things that matter with these drinks, and it's the little things that weren't there. The egg whites and the purees came from bottles (i.e., weren't made fresh), and when you say pistachio encrusted rim, I assume that's what I'll get. Not great complexity in the cocktails--I wouldn't say one-dimensional, but underwhelming given some of the genius drinks being made around the city. Plus, they're priced 50% than their competitors. Just not worth it. Go to Fig. 19 instead. The bar is beautiful inside -- absolutely. But there isn't a ton of bar seating, and even if you're a party of four just getting drinks and there are open tables, you can't sit. Just not the most comfortable space if you're not eating (or maybe bribing the host? not sure how that might work).","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I like that I can get a very generously sized taco at a reasonable price here.  Sometimes I don't want an enormous ten dollar burrito a la Chipotle.  The lines can get long but the people working here are pretty quick so it's never too long a wait.  Honestly I'd say you get what you pay for, that is, it's not the best taco all around but it's the best bang for your buck taco that I've found so far in New York.  I usually get a chicken taco and it's almost like a small burrito minus the rice. It can get pretty crowded inside, and when I can't find a seat I've been tempted to take my food over to Union Square to eat.  However I haven't done so yet cause the tacos can get quuuiiite messy--but that's only because they pack it so full with all the ingredients. There's always a generous helping of tasty chicken in my taco.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"We stopped in Mulberry & Vine to take a peek at the new healthy food stop in the neighborhood.  It's bright, open, spacious, clean (at least for starters), and cozy. We only wanted a quick look, but the male server by the coffee & cookie area was so friendly we ended up staying.  He offered us a try of the snickerdoodle cookies - very tasty.  Then he told us we could try anything we'd like.   We went to the other end of the counter by the salads and noticed the asian garlic pepper beef with pickled onions in the hot area.  The girl by the salads said we could not sample the hot items.  It's too bad, because we ordered this item.  I would have to say it did not leave the best impression.  The sauce was good, but the beef was not tender and it wasn't what I would consider a hot item - I wish it had been warmer to enjoy.   We, also, tried a sample and ordered the african curried tomato soup with bits of peanut.  It was delicious, warming, and satisfying.  I would recommend this item. I would say this place is nice, but I wish they would extend their sampling as they are a new business - to build loyal visitors,  people need to find their favorites.  Their choices of sustainable packaging and local ingredients are an added bonus - these are the types of responsible businesses we should support. It's already, unfortunately, seems to have turned into, yet another TriBeCa mommy hub for the women with nothing to do, but lunch and leave their children's messes everywhere - SNORE!  For the kind parents that are responsible, give their children appropriate boundaries, and are wise enough to impart manners - we salute you and thank you for bringing up proper citizens of the world!   I sincerely hope this restaurant adopts firm policies about the expected cleanliness of their guests - as in, please leave your tables clean upon departure.  It would be great if guest's children were not running wild through the place and strollers we're not blocking all entrances as well - adults need places to relax, too.

"I'm usually a very pleasant person but when you put dumplings near me, watch out. Do not place your hands near my fork if you want to keep them. The dumplings here are the perfect mix of juicy, soft, and crunchy. Texture is very important when eating food and this combination results in a very satisfied tummy. The best part is they are $1 for 5 pork and chive dumplings. This is an especially good deal considering most of the places have raised their prices. The place is literally a hole in the wall with just four flimsy stools to sit on. Take your food to go and find a nice dark corner so no one can see what a glutton you are as you scoff down 20 dumplings by yourself ;)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been to Han's restaurant on three occasions now. The first night my gal pal and I were headed to another establishment following promises of outdoor seating and tasty veggie dumplings. When the night turned windy and rainy my friend asked about switching locations after seeing Han himself standing outside of his restaurant. The two had struck up a conversation and by the time I arrived I felt like was in Han's pocket. We were intrigued by the Dry Hot Pot style with rabbit and were dissuaded by Han himself to sample the dish with another meat. If I weren't sold already on the simple decor and delicious scents in the air his recommendations sealed the deal. I would have eaten out of his palm. And then there were the dumplings in chili oil. Oh dear lord. I have gone back each time dreaming, salivating, having dirty thoughts about the satisfaction of Han's chili oil sauce. These dumplings make me want to write home to Mama. The flavor is full and well-developed. The heat of the chili pulses outward from my mouth into every pore and yet the food is delectable, not at all overpowered by the heat. Han and Eric (the other gentleman who I've had a chance to meet) are both wonderful. They are warm and welcoming, make genuine recommendations that show they have truly eaten everything on offer and have a keen eye for what makes each dish sing. I told my date tonight that if either of the aforementioned gentlemen suggested anything of the sort I'd have to run away with them. I love the food that much. They've only been in this location a short time but they've already seated themselves firmly in my culinary heart of hearts. Please do yourself the favor of visiting them. Please.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Be sure to read the house rules and chew slowly to get the most out of the bottomless sangria special. I got the: Vaca Frita - the skirt steak was tender and juicy. Very well seasoned. the only downside that it was kind of small. I think I finished it in 6 bites. the guava french toast - not overly sweet, soft and fluffy. Not enough guava paste tho. Sangria: Havana Banana - Tastes like a tropical paradise with a lot of bananas, I wasn't a big fan only because I don't like bananas that much Fresas - Best bang for your buck, love the fruits and the subtle berry flavors in the drink.

"Where do I begin to describe how awesome Traif is?  Let's start with the reservations.  After weeks of reservation making and changing, I finally got a date that worked.  The girl on the phone was really patient with me and even called me the day of to make sure I was still set for dinner that day.  Seriously though, folks, make a reservation! And if possible, ask if you can get a seat in the glass canopy area in the back.  It looked so nice in the early evening and it's probably better lighting in that area for picture taking! By 7:00pm, the small space filled up quickly.   The dishes are tapas style and go from small to large down the menu list.  My friend and I ordered 4 small to medium dishes and it was enough food to be quite full! Salt & pepper shrimp: DELICIOUS! There were sweet potato chunks in this dish that I absolutely LOVED and I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet potatoes.  The shrimp was breaded in a nice batter and super juicy and crunchy.  The dish was not too flavorful or salty and the portion was satiating. Icy blue mussels: The mussels were soaked in a pesto pea soup.  Don't neglect the delicious fluffy buttered toast wedges on the side.  They were soooo delicious!  The mussels were served in a generous portion.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the peas as my friend was. Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs: AMAZING.  My favorite dish of the night! The meat fell right off the bone.  The tenderness of the meat was paired with a nice BBQ sauce made of cinnamon and strawberry reduction.  The cinnamon aspect was really unique, but not too overwhelmingly pungent. BBQ, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli: The sliders are about 3-4 bites so don't expect anything extravagantly large.  The short ribs resembled something similar to pulled pork - shredded and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were fried lightly so they had the perfect texture.  The smoked paprika aioli was great, but moderate - it's a bit salty! Unfortunately, we so full that we didn't have any room for the infamous bacon doughnuts, but I'll definitely be back for more!  The menu changes month to month so I'm looking forward to trying something new.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I wish I had more of an excuse to venture to Beau Monde; I live a little too far away from the city to make it a weekly treat (but if I lived in the city, I would make this place my second home.) I first went here when I was a jaded little Francophile in high school - we took a trip to see Phantom of the Opera while it was in Philly and Beau Monde was our pre-show lunch. I have not forgotten my experience since. I spent a week in France before starting high school and subsided mostly on croissants and baguettes and cheese and street crepes. Needless to say, I was spoiled as all get out when I got to Beau Monde; I was not disappointed. I should be honest; I don't remember much of the service other than one minute I was crepe-less and the next minute...I had a hot, fresh, delicious Coq au Vin crepe steaming in front of me (this is, to date, still my favorite crepe in the whole world.) The sauce was creamy but not globby like you'd expect from a chicken pot pie; the melange of vegetables inside was cooked to absolute perfection - they still had some crunch to them; the chicken was tender and succulent; and the crepe itself was wonderfully thin and velvety.  I could have died. I'm sure my unparalleled enthusiasm for French cuisine just enhanced the flavors... And of course at the end we had to have dessert. I'm almost positive I had a strawberry and Nutella crepe but the foodgasm my sweet crepe induced has made my brain a little fuzzy. But that alone should speak volumes to you, dear reader. I poked around for Beau Monde's menu and what they're serving up for dinner almost makes me think I'll traipse on down tonight and pay them a visit. Seriously. Check out this menu. Om. Nom.

The only reason I hesitate to give it five stars is the wait staff; who interrupt your conversation without pause whenever they please.  Instead of waiting by the table until you pause, they just interrupt you in the middle of the sentence and start talking without saying ""excuse me"" or something.  If you don't mind the rude waiters, it's a great place to eat.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Have been here twice in the past couple of weeks and both times were very enjoyable. The staff is very friendly and is a great place to catch a game, as I was there a few weeks ago with a couple of friends to catch the Jets on MNF. They have an extensive beer selection that is quite good and the items on the menu are tasty and come in nice portion sizes. I found myself there again this past week to meet up with my sister and brother-in-law before they headed to the Beacon to catch a show. We split the calamari in a sweet chili sauce with toasted almonds, which was very tasty. We also had the mac n cheese bites with roasted red pepper ketchup (very good) and had one of their Oktoberfest specials (bratwurst sliders) which were also very good. The bartenders are attentive and friendly, while the atmosphere is great, whether meeting friends for a few cocktails or to watch a game. It is a nice respite in Midtown Manhattan, where establishments can either be bland or tourist traps. I will definitely be back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Born and raised in Brooklyn, I've become very critical of any pizza other then the select few establishments which have been around for years (L&B, DiFara, Totonno, etc), but I must say Lucali ranks up there at the top. Not only is the pizza one of the best pies you'll have in your life, the atmosphere makes it even more worthwhile. It's the perfect place to go an impress people, take a date, go with your family or on a causal Sunday evening. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Natalie at the front desk always takes good care of us and is extremely professional and courteous. Once of the great things about Lucali is that they keep it simple. Many of these new trendy boutique artisan pizza places (Fornino's, Nate Appleman's place, Artichoke, etc) have all these fancy choices that are over priced and frankly nowhere as good. When you come to Lucali's you come for the pizza. Plain and simple. Their topping selections change consistently and they are all fresh. Since the pizza's are thin crust, I would suggest limiting the toppings so you enjoy the flavors of the cheese, sauce and crust (and so it's easier to eat). Make sure you get one of their calzones as well. They use the same dough that they use for the pizza and the ricotta cheese is the perfect constancy. Make sure you get some of the marinara sauce on the side for dipping Tips: Lucali's is a small place intimate place and obviously had developed a following. They do not take reservations, however if you call a few hours in advance and are going to be in the area, they will take your name and number and tell you approximately what time a table will be ready. Just make sure when they call you, that you are 5-10 minutes from the restaurant. Also, they are BYOB. If you bring a bottle of wine or beer they will kindly give you glasses and uncork the bottle for you (no fee). All in all, if you want to have a quality pizza for dinner in a nice setting with nice service, Lucali is definitely worth it. Simple, cheap, great pizza and in Brooklyn! What can be better?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"We've been eating at ULC since it opened, and have always enjoyed the beautiful room and ambiance. The service is rarely great, and the food is generally good to excellent. However there have been surprising lapses in the food quality and these have become more frequent. Recently three of us dined on a Monday night and I was served a sole mousseline with a cream sauce that was inedible. The fish smelled fishy, the texture was rubbery, and it was barely warm. It was blanketed in a sauce with the consistency and color of sputum. This $28 mess was garnished with a piece of wilted parsley. I can only surmise that the server recommended this dish to push it out because it was stinking up the kitchen. My advice? Stay away from ULC on Mondays when the kitchen appears to be run by subs without tastebuds. Or better yet, head down Chapel St. to Zinc where the food is always freshly prepared and the servers are on the ball and personable.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Yerba Buena is a small charming restaurant occupying what is little more than a storefront in Alphabet City. We visited on a slow cold night in December and were greeted with extraordinary courtesy and attention. The food - best described as ""pan-latin"", was creative and at the same time sufficiently familiar to make one feel comfortably at home. While everything we had was terrific, what stands out is the almost ""old world"" quality of the staff - rarely seen these days. Professional and attentive but not cloying or insistant.

"Thank you, Yelp folk, for an awesome find. We needed a place to eat downtown on a Friday night and I had been in the mood for Japanese fare for a while. During a Yelp search, I stumbled upon Zutto's, who conveniently enough, took online reservations. At 7pm, the place was empty. There were maybe one or two other tables taken. But come another half hour or so and it was packed. The service was very good, though a bit frantic towards the end, and the ambiance was lovely, especially since we had secured a table in the window. We ate family style and the bill came to $75 a person, which included a very generous tip. Here's the order (for 4): Four bottles of hot sake: Decent enough, though low in alcohol content. They let you pick out a glass for your sake. It was a cute touch. Short rib steamed bun (two per order): Amazing. Flavorful and rich but light at the same time. Pork belly steamed bun (two per order): Another amazing choice, thought not for those who do not like fatty foods. Edamame: Not your mother's edamame...Charred and delicious. Different but great. Shishito Peppers: Spicy, tasty peppers very similar to those you find in Spain. Lemon aloi on the side cuts the heat in those that are on the spicier side. Premium Sushi Assortment (we ordered two) and Sushi and Sashimi Combo: AMAZEBALLS (and those of you who know me, know I do not use that term loosely.)  Some of the best sushi I've had in New York City. It melted in your mouth. I had to order a few extra pieces of Toro just because it might have been the best I'd ever had. Overall our experience was one of an amazing meal of super high quality food and reasonable prices. Zutto is a serious win in my book.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I am Greek and I love all kinds of sea food! Yesterday, at the fish restaurant of Eataly I had sea urchin slightly roasted on a porchini which was one of my best lunches.

It was as if I was at an open piazza, where you get to watch people walking up and down. Can't wait for my next time!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Ever hear of Di Fara's pizzeria in Midwood on Ave. J and E. 15 St?  It's been reviewed extensively by the N.Y. Times and written up both in print and online. People rave about Di Fara's and the joint definitely has a following. I've been meaning to go there for years and today was the day. The pizza is definitely hand made, with fresh chunky sauce, Polly-o mozz, lots of grated cheese, olive oil and fresh basil. But the pizza just didn't work for me.  The sum wasn't greater than its parts. The slices are smallish. The sauce and cheese slid right off onto the plate. And each slice cost $5.00!! ($30 per pie). This is the most expensive pizza that I've ever had. Not to mention, the place is a dirty dump. After Di Fara's I drove straight to L&B for a real slice (only $2.25) to chase down Di Fara's lest I return home to Long Island completely disappointed. Many may like Di Fara's. I just don't see it. Personally, I'd rather have pizza at Totonno's, Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Lombardi's or L&B Spumoni Gardens.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The frittata are pretty big and filled with your choice of veggies/meats, but I did think that they were a little bit on the greasy side. They came with a side of potatoes that were pretty tasty and filling. Everyone seemed pleased with their dishes and the service was attentive. Will be back for brunch if I'm in the area! They have a cute little back patio area so you can enjoy the summer weather without roasting in the sun.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is quite good.  I like that they source their ingredients from local farms, and that they serve craft beer from Zero Gravity.  The flatbreads are pizza-like and quite good.  I like that they allow you to half and half the flatbread with different toppings.  We tried both of the special flatbreads including a cream corn, heirloom tomato and arugula one one half, and meatball, spinach and red peppers on the other half (now that I'm writing this review, I'm salivating again).  We also got the special beet salad which was just okay as it really didn't have many beets as they were mixed with couscous.  I liked the Zero Gravity micro brew lineup offered, but was disappointed that they don't offer flights for tasting.  But they do offer 1/2 and full pints, so I tried a few including the TLA IPA which is a solid IPA, the Narconaut Black IPA which was quite tasty, and finally the Stout which was very good.  The restaurant has a nice large bar area, and the dining area faces the open kitchen where you get to watch them make the flatbreads in front of the large old wood fired oven.  The wait staff were friendly and attentive.  If in the area, I would definitely come back in. Oh, I should warn you that they request ""no cell phone use while in the restaurant"", so you will have to enjoy each other's company and try and remember your food experience for your later Yelp review :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Loved the spicy ramen (make sure you get the egg with it!). The Classic version is also pretty good. However, these soups seem even saltier than Momofuku's in East Village. In any case, I would much prefer to come here on a regular basis, as you don't have to deal with the long wait since there is plenty of space, including a rectangular counter top and table seating. Glad we tried the chicken (deep fried) Hirata buns. A nice change from the traditional pork variety and with just the right amount of spicy :) The Calisco soda drink (carbonated yogurt flavor) was the perfect balance to the salty and spicy food entrees.

"I'd been dying to try Northern Spy for awhile after reading about it on NYMag's Grub Street, my favorite NYC restaurant information network. Its focus on fresh and local ingredients was certainly a draw, and I knew I'd found another East Village gem upon entering. The interior reminds me of a country home in Vermont - hardwood floors and tables, wall panels of faded shades of blue and green, a bit of exposed brick - not to mention the couple of tables near the back that are these cute little nooks where your party can dine in what feels like a more private atmosphere. I came for brunch with a fellow foodie friend. We both started with mimosas - for myself, the blood orange mimosa, and for my dining partner, an apple flavor of sorts. Both had a good punch to them and tasted very fresh. And because we eat essentially the same foods, we both ordered the kale salad with eggs over easy on top. Magnificent! Fresh, light and flavorful. The perfect amount of food. I will definitely be returning for lunch/ dinner to try something else on their fabulous menu - the sandwiches do sound inventive, and I can assume I will not be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"As soon as I saw sign outside, I knew I will love this place. It's an ultimate surrealism of urban absurd in the best tradition of it, with perforated metal, handwritten notes and all. Walk in - and first question you hear is "" Are you thirsty, hungry, or both?"". (I am in love already). Damn right both, most definitely both! Bar is endless, more  tables on the back, and backyard - so pick your poison there to sit. There are few TVs and pretty awesomely random music selection to entertain you - and on top of that, there are bartenders, who are just as entertaining. Of course, being an Austrian bar, you can expect their beer selection to be top notch. Trust me, it is. Go for dark lager, man, go for it - it is smooth as black gold. And there are the bites... of sausages. Bursting with juices as you bite into it, soak all that goodness with perfectly crisp bun, and do not forget to order their sides! Cucumber salad was nice, my only gripe that sides are rather smallish to be a separate item on menu. But, hey, lets get back to those sausages. I mean, that's what we came here for, right? (and beer of course!). The käsekrainer is classic. If you been to Austria, you will agree with me. It's super juicy and rich with cheese stuffed into it. I liked the bite though the crisp skin - it had a perfect snap. Special that night - brisket sausage - was the best. Packed with flavor & spices, dryer and richer than classic version, it delivers full punch, and as meaty as sausage goes. Carnivores heaven. Tipping hat to attentive bartender - for all the food explanations, for refilling my glass when needed, and for chill attitude.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I know a lot of people go here for the meat, but the buffet is my first and only stop. I normally hate buffets, but every dish here is distinct and flavorful. Nothing is ever dry, they vary the dishes throughout the week, and I always over-pack my dish, because I can't get enough. Grab yourself a guarana soda, and perhaps one of their amazing deserts, and you're good to go. People have complained about the price, and I never walk away for less than $15, but it's my own damn fault. Or maybe theirs, because I can't get enough of their food. Look for the yellow corn dish that looks almost like cornbread-topped cassarole, which is one of my favourites. The breaded chicken wings, when they have them, are salty and delicious, and some of the salad bar items always make it on to my plate. My girlfriend especially loves the potato salad from there, also. Bottom line, I have not found a better place than this for basic, flavorful, delicious food in Astoria. I bring my parents there when they are in town, my girlfriend on our first date, and my roommate and I return at least once a week.

Showed up roughly at about 545pm, soon after they opened back up for dinner at 530pm and they were already packed. We had a group of 4, but they suggested that to speed things up and to not have us wait any longer that we should split up 2 and 2. We did just that and we were served right away, less than 5 minutes of putting our order in, we got our huge bowls of tasty ramen! I ordered the mega ramen with char siu pork and added a seasoned egg. The soup was the best I've ever had so far. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The char siu pork was deliciously awesome.

"Located right next to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, The Islands is a great place to catch a heavy lunch or dinner. The dishes here are heavy, and you get huge portions. I tried the following: Curry Goat - Goat meat marinated and cooked in curry spices and herbs $11 Jerk Leg of Lamb - boneless leg of lamb stuffed with Jamaican jerk spices and roasted with mint chutney $12 Jerk Chicken - Spicy chicken baked with spices from the island $10 Between the three my favorite dish was the curry goat, it may have been because the jerk leg of lamb was too spicy for me.  Spicy and a bit oily.  Although Ben G seemed to have liked all the oils in the Leg of Lamb dish, he wanted me to pour the whole thing in my rice and eat it. The curry goat and leg of lamb were both super tender.  If I lived near here, it would be a place I'd come to at least monthly.  I've never had Caribbean food before, but it was (to me) similar to Indian food with all the spices and curries. The Islands is a super super small restaurant.  It's actually not even a full service restaurant, most people just come here and order to go. There is only one or two people working here and the same person does the order taking, cooking, and serving. They have a more limited menu on the weekdays, so come on the weekends so you can try EVERYTHING! My most favorite thing on the menu, are the stewed veggies that came with each dish. :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Strictly food speaking, the place was only A-OK. I know everyone else recommended the catfish burrito, but honestly, I did NOT like it!! The fishiness just permeated the burrito and so it didn't taste good at all. However, the CUBANO on a SANDWICH is highly recommended. It's savory, like a nice Philly cheese steak, but somewhat....different (in a great way). I seriously never tasted anything quite like it, and I am amazed at its novelty. The corn is not like anything I've ever had before. It tasted pretty good, but I felt like it was bit forced in that they added so much seasoning on it that I could barely taste the corn itself. I still recommend it, though, because after all, it IS one of their specialties. I have to admit that they did a great job of not overcooking it though. Nothing's worse than trying to nibble soggy, squishy kernels off the cob. Overall, the portions are a bit small, but it's enough to keep you satisfied. More than anything, I loved the milieu. It's a very cute place, full of vibrant colors. The outdoor seating is self-seated and family-style arrangement. I could see it being a great bar scene at night, so perhaps I will return for it's nightlife. As for now, I won't be coming back for the food any time soon.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Today was the last time we will be going to this place and we are heartbroken.  We used to go all the time, even when it was located next to Aroma Thai and Dunking Donuts.   We went today and ordered a Jessica Salad and a Pastrami sandwich - nothing too hard or complicated to prepare not to mention that the place was not full or busy at all.  We got our drinks, ordered our food and then were left waiting for 30 minutes for our waitress, Kathy I think, which looked like she rather be somewhere else than there to come check on us, let us know where our food was or to let us know that she was still around.  My husband had to go to the counter and asked the lady to please check the status or our meal since we were left there for 30 minutes and no food. Mind you, we got there around 12:45 (were seated immediately and Kathy came right way) and left hungry at 1:32.  Just ridiculous but the top of the cake was having our waitress come with an attitude and let us know that it was not her fault and that she put the order on time which we suspect she didn't because the ticket that she showed us had an entry of 1:30.  She quickly recovered by saying that the time printed was the time she printed out the ticket to show us then she goes on and tell us that they had a party going on in their party room and that again it wasn't her fault.  The thing that did it for me was her attitude - NASTY in my opinion.  Never again we will be going here, even if I think they have the best ice cream in NJ.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Best pizza in East Hartford I've had, which isn't saying much.  If you like mediocre crust and the need to purchase extra cheese as an extra topping to compensate for a standard Southern CT/NYC cheese pizza, then this is the place for you.  If ordinary Northern CT pizza must be had because you can't travel to New Haven or Bridgeport, then this is as good as it gets up in these parts.  The sauce is great, though.  Earned this place an extra star.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The food is really good.  Better than I expected from a local place.  They are very accommodating.  They are known for their wings which are awesome and they have many flavor choices.  I have tried their salads and now that's my first choice.  I usually get the grilled tilapia salad.  Portions are huge, so it lasts me at least 2 meals.  They even make smoothies. I haven't tried them yet.  So if you are looking for decent food, I would try them.  Prices are reasonable as well.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went for Dinner after the theater. We had problems getting a cab so I called and told them we would be late. We arrived at 1130 pm and they close at 1 on Saturday. They were extremely friendly and escorted us to the back of the restaurant. The decor was amazing and cozy!!! I asked our server what she recommended and I was also with my mother and aunt. We ordered the Greek salad. No lettuce but it was outstanding!! We also had the saganaki again amazing!!! The 3 meals we had were the moussaka, braised short ribs, and lamb chops..all were FANTASTIC!!!! The manager came by to check on us.

"This is a review of their delivery service through Seamless (which, I received 15% off on my first Seamless order from this restaurant). I'm not sure if this place is supposed to be a fusion between Vietnamese and something that speaks Spanish, but the name is catchy. However, the bánh mì is not the most authentic that I've tasted. I ordered the beef short rib sandwich and the pork chop over rice. I've never had a beef short rib bánh mì from a Vietnamese restaurant before, so I don't have a benchmark as to how it should taste. The sandwich was nonetheless very tasty, and the short rib was marinated well. But, the sandwich is spoiled by the over-powering vinegar from the sliced carrots. The sandwich is also missing the crunchiness from the baguette. The pork chop over rice was probably the more underwhelming of the two dishes. They really skimp on the meat portions here, and for what you pay for a pork chop over rice, there was an obvious imbalance of rice-to-meat ratio and a clear intent to fill you up on rice. As I mentioned in the beginning, I'm a bit confused by the name of the restaurant, as there wasn't anything remotely Spanish about their menu. I am most likely not going to order from here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've really become addicted to this place. I try to make it here at least twice a week. When they tell me they've run out of pork belly, I react for a moment, as if I've just heard the most depressing news. But then I snap out of it and go for either the Khmer Sausage or the Pulled Pork Duroc sandwich and I'm as happy as a pig playing in slop. Although the Pork Belly, in my humble opinion, reigns supreme, the selection of sandwiches as well as their usage of fresh ingredients puts Num Pang in the pantheon of NYC sandwich makers.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So, a couple of weeks ago the wife was jonesing for Mexican and had  heard about this place from some friends. I'm not a big lover of Mexican but usually order beef fajitas when she drags me to one of these places.   We arrived later in the evening so the place was fairly empty,, only 2 other tables occupied with 4 and 5 people. So imagine my surprise when we stood waiting in the entrance-way for over 12 minutes waiting to be seated. I finally wandered to the back of the house looking for an actual employee.  At that point the waiter pops out from somewhere and asks if he can help us. I inquire is they are still open as we have been waiting in at the door for over 10 minutes. He say, ""yeah, well, I'm by myself tonight"" as if that should explain and make everything alright then, So we are seated and he take our drink order. The wife orders a margarita a I a coke. Just about another 10 minutes pass before the drinks arrive. During this time I note that fajitas are not on their menus. However, when I inquired he states they make them, it's just not on the men. Although the price quoted seemed a bit high, I was just happy that I could get my fajitas. My wife also ordered a beef dish although I forget exactly what. And off he goes to put in the order. About 10 minutes later he's back at the table to tell us that ""they are out of beef"" and asked if we'd like a chicken dish? Having now wasted almost 3/4 of a hour here  just to come to find out that they don't actually have anything we felt like eating, we gave the thing up as a bad job and headed to the local Chili's having sampled only the Coke and a margarita, which the wife says pretty much sucked. To recap, service sucked, drinks sucked and the food was non-existent. I believe we'll be passing on Fiesta Hut in the future and can only suggest that others do the same.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I was excited to get breakfast on a weekday. I went on yelp to see where in the area had open places before 10am. Cafe Renata had OK reviews and we decided to give it a shot. My friend got the Waffle Ranchero. My friend said it was good, but nothing amazing. I tried a bite of this and I agreed. I do think the idea of this was pretty cool. I got the Eggs Benedict... I never had such yucky disgusting poached eggs in my life. First of all, one poached egg was already popped and the yolk was flowing all over my english muffin and to the bottom of my potatoes. Second, the egg white part tasted nastyyyyyyy. It was far beyond than just being bland.. I am tolerable with weird/bad tasting things and will normally try to eat everything b/c I don't like to waste food, but this time I cut out all the egg white out and ate just the english muffin, ham, and the runny yolk. The potatoes were good and I liked how they added sweet potatoes too. Cafe Renata is definitely overpriced considering the taste, and I will not come back here unless a friend says this is the only option..but you know Philly has way too many other places to try out.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Top of the line service, food & hospitality.  As big fan's of Marc from his ICA appearances, we had to check out his food for ourselves.  Marc went out of his way to say hello & recommend dishes while we had some drinks at the bar.  The drinks were a little pricey but the time & fresh fruit used in them made it worth it. We had 2 tartar's (avocado & tuna) that were unreal.  Our main dishes feature a duck foie gras & a sea bass plate that blew us away.  Of course the meals were expensive because of the location (TriBeCa) & the time/effort put into each dish, but coming from CT to visit the city for the day, it was well worth it.

I settled on splitting a order of disco fries which was essentially fries covered in gravy and cheese. It was pretty OK but to be honest, I would've much rather had my fries drenched in gravy and cheese because I love heart attacks on a plate.

"Finally a fat sandwich spot in the North that is easy to drive to instead of going all the way down in New Brunswick to wait in front of a food truck in back of hungry college students...you can now wait inside. They go everything against my fake raw diet of green vegetables and fruit, but it's worth it. If you want mozzarella sticks in your sandwich then they will do it for you! If you want nacho cheese sauce in your sandwich with chicken tenders they will do it for you! And they have the classic must french fries in every sandwich. Their list of sandwiches are bigger than the fat sandwiches down at RU and also have sides as well such as Fried Mac n Cheese and corn bites, which are also deep fried. Open late on weekends which is dangerous as their business can only fit probably 20 people inside and may not handle all the drunk people who stumble upon looking for a Fat Elvin. The sandwiches are good but definitely one of those places for me where I have to say to myself, ""I'm hungry and I do not give a sh*t about my waistline.""","[1.0, 0.0]"

For my entree I tried the Enchiladas de huitlacoche de queso - they were very very good. They weren't too cheesy and stuffed with the mushrooms. I did not want rice so was able to substitute plantains. The plate also came with a side of black beans. My boyfriend got the Pollo en mole poblano. The mole sauce had a nice flavor. The chicken was a little dry, but not enough to take away from the overall meal. The service was very friendly as the waiters were very attentive.

"I don't normally give 5 star reviews, even for friends who own restaurants.  However, after my last meal here, this place totally deserves it.  This was probably our 7th time here and it was the best dining experience we've had in a while, and definitely the best one we have had here hands down.  This place started off as a solid 4 star for me and now is a 5.  The Mac and cheese we had tonight was out of this world, 3 Leek Mac and cheese, I love you.  Also everything else was better than I ever have had previously, even the service.  They are definitely getting it right on the money now.  Speaking of money, this place is cheap and BYOB.  So while I sip some Sierra celebration ale from the bodega next door, I can also enjoy amazing food for a great price.  The menu changes but you really can't go wrong with anything.  Burgers, sandwiches, po'boys, chicken and waffles you name it, it's great!  Also the desserts are divine. We had pumpkin butterscotch bread pudding tonight and it was amazing, and also could have probably served a family of four.  I honestly cannot type anymore, I'm falling into a food coma right now as I type.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Faced with a two hour wait at Roberta's on an evening that seemed to be filled with off timing, we had passed Momo's by and revisited it after a ""nearby"" Yelp search. And it friggin' blew our mind. Only after we arrived did we realize that this was Phillip's restaurant. Phillip from Marlo & Sons. The guy that is completely dedicated to his craft, informed and just frankly, oozing enthusiasm. Seated at a communal table, our waitress was quick to bring us wine and a pitcher of water. And then came the pork betty. Every bite of this decadent, perfectly proportioned pork belly was mind blowing. We devoured it and then insisted on keeping the broth on the table to use for our sushi. A sushi bomb came, various other sushi items came. We continued to think about the pork betty. We ordered some fried chicken as an afterthought. Fabulous. With excellent service and incredible quality, Momo is the ideal addition to the neighborhood.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I have been wanting to try PYT for a while now, I've kept hearing great things. I never knew where the Piazza was, even though I frequent Liberties Walk, which is right next to it. Stumbled upon PYT while walking home one day, and my boyfriend and I were both starving. I was excited to finally eat there, and we even sat outside because it was finally a nice day out. He ordered the original PYT burger with onion rings, and I ordered a normal cheeseburger with the PYT ""special sauce"" added to it, with french fries. We waited for our food for a long time. Another couple who sat down 10 minutes after us, ordered after us, got their food before us. Turns out, they received our order. I suppose that's what happens when people other than your own waiter brings out your food. I told our waiter about the mix-up and she told us we were right, and apologized. Asked if we wanted anything else, and the manager would definitely do something. I told her kindly that it wasn't her fault, and sure enough, we got 50% off our ending bill.

"From the moment you step into this establishment, you will love the industrial decor. But then within minutes, when you sit down, you'll realize how LOUD this place is. But it is happy hour on a Friday night so can't be too surprised. My girlfriend and I just had eaten across the street at Lobster Joint so we only popped in for a pint. Yet when the menu was given to us, our eyes both went straight for the cocktail section. Why have a beer when there's a cocktail called Contraband and Mexican Revolver? Such excellent concoctions they were! I was a little apprehensive because I'm not a big fan of spicy cocktails and the Contraband has Jalapeno in it but our lovely waitress told me it's more smoky than spicy so I went for it. Glad I did because she did not lie. My girlfriend had the Mexican Revolver and enjoyed it so much, she ordered it twice because I'm a slow ass drinker. As it was happy hour, the cocktails were $8 instead of the usual $12. Not bad. The service here is great. They were checking on us without being in our faces and the manager (Jaime, I believe?) came by for a chat. He was funny, helping us find a solution to my slight insomnia, and friendly. The food menu looks awesome so I will be coming back for their homemade pickles, roasted bone marrow, steak tartare and duck fat roasted potatoes.

Only drawback was the lack of heat.  Place looks warm and cozy but didn't feel that way since we were all cold inside. Come here earlier if you don't want to wait.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Known as fine dining in a casual atmosphere. Mamma Flora's takes tradition italian food and mixes it with a modern American style! It really is a hidden gem. You can find almost anything on the menu, from chicken parm with spaghetti to homemade burgers and brick oven pizza to new york strip steaks and salmon. Literally something for everyone on the menu. Want to change a dish to make it to your perfection... don't fret just ask your server and almost all of the time the dish can be adjusted at little to no charge. These dishes are made fresh and the prepping is constantly being done in the kitchen. Thats what separates  this place from the rest, the quality of the food you are getting at mamma floras.  During the fall you can sometimes see Live Music on Saturdays. The deserts are bakery imported and fresh. Cannolis as well as coffee, espresso or cappuccino are always available. Also back in fall are 2 soups every day! Mamma Flora's is also BYOB! There are lunch and dinner specials every day, which you can read on the website. All day delivery. There is a banquet room that seats up to 40. Mamma Flora's also does catering for any kind of event or party. We have done weddings and events with up to 200+ people. Call now to book for the holidays!

Very good bar scene for drinks and apps.  The guac is one of the best i have had anywhere including Mexico.  The fresh margaritas are among the best in the city.  We also enjoyed the flat bread.  The crowd tends to be very friendly and we met other couples who are a pleasure to speak with.  I recommend it for drinks and apps.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I got married at The Counting Room two weeks ago.  We have been patrons of the bar since it opened for its great cocktails, nice music and open airy feeling.  It is a great place to meet friends for a quiet drink or party downstairs later in the night.  The drinks are always interesting and the bartenders know their stuff.  When we decided to get married in the neighborhood we looked into every option (on a budget) and finally ended up there and are so glad we did.  We had the ceremony, reception and very late night dance party all in the space.  Ruth and the rest of the staff were awesome, our guests raved about the drinks and they were so accomodating and helpful the whole way through the planning process and actual wedding day.  The space is gorgeous as is and all we brought were flowers and it was beautiful.  It has a good sound system, projector, DJ booth and plenty of restrooms, etc.  plus two floors and two bars.  We had the dinner catered by Sips and Bites on N. 10th since The Counting Room does not have a full kitchen and it worked great (see separate review).  I recommend The Counting Room for any kind of private event (I think there was a baby shower earlier that day).   Our party went until 4:00am and the staff stuck it through the whole night!  It was just perfect.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Hands down..best burger I ever had and yes better than 5 guys (whom I used to be a big fan off).  Some of my co-workers told me about this place and because of the location, I was a little indecisive at first but man am i happy i went there.  I got the cyclops burger and it had to be the best burger I ever had not to mention it was huge.  I got full half way through my sandwich.  The fries are really good too but try not to eat alot of it otherwise you won't be able to finish your burger.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Never had ramen before so i gave into the hype and tried it at one of the best rated places around. It was OK. I don't know why white people go crazy for what's basically soup with noodles. Its a big bowl of ramen with tons of broth and some noodles. You eat the noodles with chopsticks and since noodles don't retain any flavor... they don't taste like anything. Then you scoop the rest of your $13 bowl of broth with a spoon to get whatever veggies are left. Ramen = hype I will say the ambiance is great though, felt like i was in japan. The spot is tiny and cozy and everyone speaks japanese.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have been in restaurants where the service was mediocre or inattentive.  Pietro's, however, moved from that level of total disregard for service to MEAN and NASTY.  I eat out all of the time and have never been treated this badly.   We made a reservation for 10 and all of us sat at a table for 6 although there was no one nearby to our table NOR did any one sit at any nearby table for the total of 2 hours we were in the restaurant.  It got worse however.  My personal favorite was the server yelling at a 5 year old to remove her fork from her plate.  And....it goes on.....as we were putting on jackets to leave, the clearing staff began pushing the tables together by shoving them into us.  And this was after we left a 30% tip.   How did you manage to find so many terrible people and put them together in one part of the restaurant?  You really need to think about restaurant management and policy.  OK pizza and a bunch of lettuce on the plate cannot compensate for this.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Well the name calls for lot of attention Vetri, one of the pioneers of Philadelphia food culture, but sorry to say that this is just like any ordinary pizza joint. Don't mistake me, the food us amazing, but then very typical of any pizza place and that's why the 3 starts, nothing extraordinary ""Vetru"" standard, but the I guess every restaurant by this chef cannot be a top class. This is more like for the masses, though the price is slightly on the higher side..... I would say give it a shot, just for hmmmm curiosity, or to try anything from Vetri or just to sample the new food culture. Definitely give it a try for once but then that's about it, no second or repeat chances!!!! The Calzone is huge and to be shared, but if you are nota. Big fan of too much meat, them give it a skip and a little bland since we had ours with extra red pepper flakes and still found it not so spicy. The pizza al taglio was the star with amazing crust n broccoli rave, once again a little bland so keep the red pepper handy. We also tried the Rotolo - pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto, which was good but heavy on the doughy part, so not that amazing. Like I said earlier okay for one try that is only if you have yet to come across a great pizza place and are still searching for that perfect pizza. Regular pizza that is just slightly heavy on your wallet!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"3.7 Undoubtedly, Taiyo Foods is one of its kind in the area. A conbini*-like store (i.e. convenience store) out of the ordinary around as it carries all things Japanese you need, and the ones you don't know you need**. I found myself regularly at Taiyo to get some essentials like rice, tea or nori. Regularly too, I found myself spending quite a bit of time browsing around and giving a try to other things. The variety of snacks all kinds their carry looks infinite. As well as noodles, or instant ramen. There is sauces and spices and a small aisle dedicated to some beauty products. Also available some small dishes in the fridge like onigiri, grilled fish, small salads and so on. Definitely, grab a beer package before you go. The selection is quite good and unique. Perhaps my favorite aisle of all. Then, you are all set. I found myself into a shopping routine at Taiyo already. The service is courteous and friendly. The closing time is 10 pm everyday and credit cards are accepted over $10. However, I also find that due to business type exclusivity at the moment we may overlook the fact that is neither well priced or that exclusive or carries that infinite variety of things. And so I realized while shopping at Katagari in Manhattan*** or the Food Bazaar supermarket located reasonably near by. I was particularly surprise to find cheaper items in Manhattan. On the other hand, the available space is far to be comparable and Taiyo may expand sometime in the future. This being said, I definitely like it and will keep coming back as long as I am around. *urbandictionary.com/defi… **chopsticksny.com/content… ***yelp.com/biz/katagiri-ja…","[1.0, 0.0]"

Sides of crispy potatoes with shishito peppers seasoned with a spice we just couldn't figure out but didn't care because they were so good along with fresh spinached sauteed to perfection.   We took our time to soak in the ambiance and to allow room for dessert...two cappuccinos and a shared smoked chocolate and butterscotch parfait, yummy.  Although the table next to us had the blueberry pie which looked out of this world....""Next week"" my husband said...lol.  Our next visit will be in the brick face back room to watch the chef at work while we enjoy a table with our friends. The service was so courteous and prompt and I love the Converse sneakers the servers wear as it adds to the non-fussy feel of the place.  Celebrations, happy hour, theatre crowd, date night....this restaurant is for everyone.  Sensible prices worth every penny and their classy hostess, Julie, made us feel welcome and special.

"By far one of the most authentic Turkish restaurants in the city, complete with a knowledgeable staff and Efes beer.   Warmly lit with candles, the first floor is cozy and romantic, while the second floor is more apt to crowds and parties.  A big neighborhood spot, regulars crowd the bar and seem to know the maitre de and hostess on a first name basis.  Indeed, they will both recognize you after your first visit here. The vegetarian platter is a sampling of various Mediterranean cuisines, served with traditional Turkish bread still warm from the oven.  The kebobs are cooked to perfection, but the real winner is the branzino fish served with a side salad and warm lemon dressing.  If you are lucky, you may be able to get one of the gracious waiters to de-bone your fresh catch table side.

"One of the ""newer"" additions in South Orange that developed while I was at Seton Hall a few years back, Above was somewhere nice and classy that we would go to feel better about our midterm blues... and somewhere that we'd frequently go for that in pre / in between class cocktail. This is not typically a college kid restaurant as it is a little bit on the pricier end. Located ABOVE the gourmet grocery store, it is kind of cool that they get their produce from downstairs. The food here is exceptional and we've never had a problem with anything we've ever ordered here. They have a good menu with inspirations from Italian, Asian and American foods.

Best part near the end of the meal, I heard patrons in here speaking Italian to the staff saying that the food is ""perfecto"", and I take that meant perfect, so more kudos to the restaurant and the food served. Rewind, so we started out with the meatballs which were large and juicy. You get a trio of succulent meatballs. The sauce it was sitting in was sweet and too addictive that I sopped it up to the last drop with the bread served. Got the Bufala 16-inch pie to share with my wife. It's cut into 8 slices. This is the signature pie with buffalo mozzarella scattered all over the pie. There's also a 12-inch personal sized one, but we opted for the larger just to go all out. Pizza is so awesome. When you take a bite and land on the toppings, you're gonna do a happy dance in your seat. Love the coal fired pizza with the crispy thin crust. The end of the crust is spectacular. This is not your typical foldable NY slice but who's to say you can't eat it that way. Gets it in your belly faster. If you have a craving for pizza this is your spot but pies only.

Eating here feels refreshingly honest; they make their money on the food alone. My only complaint are that it can get pretty loud (I've only been here Fridays), seating can be a bit tight (there was an awkward date next to us one time), and it would be nice if they had nicer wine glasses for people who are there as much to drink a special wine they brought as for the food, but that last point is minor.

"Had a terrible time. Came in with a group of five and were seated at a booth, but the waiter refused to take our order (including several appetizers) and the bartender, after taking our order, told us we had to leave the booth we had been seated in because we had not ordered enough food. So we picked up our ten-dollar beers and moved into the much less classy back room to wait for the appetizers. I should add that our old booth and several others at the front of the restaurant remained empty the entire time we were there. After forty minutes or so they had not arrived, so I went to ask the bartender where they were. He dived into the kitchen and then back out thirty seconds later with our appetizers, which I suppose had just been sitting there. The calamari was a very small order and the poutine had ice cold, never-melted cheese curds on top. We sent it back for reheating. Between the rude staff, overpriced beers, and bad food, this place is no good.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I wanted to like the place very much, and perhaps I had too much expectations. If it was service alone--they are quite good 4 to 5 stars. The food was just okay--maybe a 3.5 is more appropriate. Maybe I ordered the wrong items, but here is the list from most liked to inedible: Tuna Tartare: B+ Interesting take with the fried eggplant. Scallops: B+ Cooked perfectly, but nothing that cannot be done at home if you are a home cook. Strawberry and Cinnamon Ribs: B-, Rather disappointing considering all the raves. Looks like it was braised, then cooked on the grill (or might be even broiled) and cinnamon/strawberries were added with a sauce. Meat was tender though. I love ribs and this is nothing close to any of the ribs I've eaten in Memphis. Salt and Pepper Shrimp: B --to salty but the BF liked it. Broccoli Rabe with mushrooms and truffle toast/egg: C+ It was just okay--not good/not bad. Not what I was expecting for dinner.  It was more of a brunch menu. Probably my fault though. Very little truffle flavor. New Zealand cockles : D  --way too much bacon in the stock, made this dish inedible. Cockles were fishy and there was nothing unique about this plate expect the overpowering salt. Too bad, as this was our last plate. The bill was about $118 for two (including 2 beers) so it was not a huge regret.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Looked at the menu on yelp and was excited to get a whole chicken for $9 and empanadas for $1.25 as I'm on a budget. Got there and looked at the menu and it was different. Whole chicken for $16 and 2 empanadas for $8 (the whole menu was different). Was told by our really nice waitress that the menu changed 2 months ago and they didn't change it online. I wasn't expecting this but we were hungry so we stayed. Ordered maduros but the server said they weren't coming out very good today which was dissapointing but nice that she told us. The whole chicken was good but I wouldn't go again for the price.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"After reading many reviews, my family and I were very excited to try out this place. Unfortunately, the food did not meet our expectations. We have tried many other Izakayas in the past and we all thought our past experiences were a lot better. Immediately after glancing the menu we all noticed that this Izakaya attempts to deliver authentic Japanese food. My family and I coming from Japan were very excited to try out the food because we were looking for Izakayas that provided the traditional taste. However, the food was mostly tasteless or bland. We all also agreed that the service was very slow. At a Izakaya, we all thought that the food should be coming at a constant pace which is very normal in Japan. This is so you and family or friends can enjoy drinking at the same time with the foods pace. They all spoke Japanese to us with proper service but we wondered since most staff members are Japanese, how might their service be when serving American customers? We understood what they were trying to deliver but thought they could work on more than a few things to make things better. Just to put it out there, for people that have a keen sense of tongue for Japanese food, I would not recommend this place for the listed prices.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"FINALLY! after months of long lines. My roommate was able to pick up an artichoke slice for me and i am forever grateful. I must say, the artichoke slice was phenomenal. You know that great creamed spinach you get at really good nyc steakhouses? Its basically that slathered over a thick crust (minus half point since i'm a thin crust dude) with really tasty cheese and artichokes on it. Big plus on how enormous this slice is. Had to deduct another half point on the wait (fortunately i didn't have to) which is how I was able to get to 4 stars. Also i believe there were only two choices yesterday - plain and artichoke. Get the artichoke!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After returning a few more times I have to adjust my view of the place.  Pizza on the buffet has sometimes been sitting a while and tastes like it.  And on a couple of recent visits pizza that I ordered made specifically for me (because it was not out on the buffet) was inconsistent - specifically the spinach alfredo and the square cheese.

"I'd hate to do this - but I really don't recommend this place for anyone who claims to be a) a foodie or b) has an advanced Asian palette. I was so excited to try some of the best Japanese food I ever had - especially after reading all these 4.5-5 star Yelp reviews AND it being an obstacle to get a reservation booked. I emailed the restaurant to request an invitation (and got a very polite response!), and took my friend here for his birthday because his favorite foods are Japanese wagyu beef, seared foie gras, AND he loves scotch and this place shaves their own ""ice ball"" for their scotch on the rocks. This place seemed perfect.... But sorry to say, this food was only mediocre at BEST. The birthday boy was so disappointed in the quality of the food...  AND we found pieces of plastic on two separate dishes of our food! :( The first time we told the waitress, and she was very responsive and brought an extra dish. The second time, it was in our dessert, and at that point we were just so appalled that we decided to stay quiet and just enjoy the night as much as we could. Some tips: 1) The ""Japanese Wagyu"" was not anything special. DON'T SPLURGE ON THIS. It tasted like a standard ""good steak"" you would pay $50 for at a nice restaurant. It was pretty tough too. $150 for the NY Strip was just such a disappointing waste of money. 2) The Branzini was something I could have made at home. I am Asian and it was a simple dish that wasn't cooked over an open fire or anything, but just on a simple cast iron (which I have at home). Nothing impressive And the fish was overcooked and tough. 3) The pre-fixe menu was NOT worth it. The foods were so simple and mostly bland - flavors were nothing impressive at all. 4) If you ARE going to come here, get the foies gras soba. That was a unique combination of foods and you really can't go wrong with seared foies gras! 5) Request to sit at a proper table - NOT on the couches + coffee tables. It was pretty uncomfortable to eat leaning over the entire time. We spilled stuff constantly since the table couldn't fit everything comfortably. All in all, I was really really looking forward to this place! Especially because I took one of my favorite people here for his birthday... and expected so much. Instead he ended up getting plastic in his birthday dessert and he, being the classy gentleman he is, payed for the dinner and you can tell he just thought it was the biggest waste of money :( The place really isn't BAD - but given we came here with such high hopes, I had to give it 2 stars. In reality, if there was no super hype and ""exclusivity"" wrapped around this place, I would have given it 3 stars. *** If you're looking for an amazing bday food experience + service that goes above and beyond, go for lunch at Bouley! Similar pricing for pre fixe, and it's just phenomenal. No way you can be disappointed at Bouley*************","[1.0, 0.0]"

"With the Pho 75 in Chinatown closing and the bulk of the Ramen Boy reviews scaring me I found myself in serious need of finding a quick and easy noodle fix when I didn't feel like climbing aboard the Pho Train (yelp.com/biz/pho-xe-lua-…). Fortunately I remembered Rachel's and Steven's reviews and was able to savor a bowl of the comforting pleasure that hand drawn noodles delivered. if my pho addiction had taught me anything its that the perfect asian soups have to be filled with a revitalizing broth, a plentiful and oftentimes odd assortment of additional ingredients, and a helping of some of the best noodles that you've ever had; all while coming at a fairly inexpensive pricetag. And for just $6 the seafood soup with shrimp, scallops, clams, and fish balls had Nan Zhou delivering on all cylinders. But the main thing I wasn't expecting was the fact that the tantalizing consistency and interesting back story of the hand drawn noodle recipe may have me giving pho and ramen a stink eyed comparison for the forseeable future. Be sure to bring cash to get your fill, but not a whole lot unless your table feels the need to split random delicacies like marinated duck, beef tendons, and spicy pig ears. And be sure to keep your vegetarian friends at a distance.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"5-star food 5-star service from the owner to the server's assistant 5-star decor Combine this with reasonable prices ($45 for two dinners)  and you have Piccoli Trattoria! Okay before I begin I know you are asking, okay Neil B. if it is so good why not 5-stars? Well it is a pet peeve of mine, but often restaurants do not list the price of the daily specials on their menus because they know that most people (not me of course :-) will be too embarrassed to ask the price in front of their other half so they can tack on a few extra bucks. Now I am not saying this is why Piccoli does this, but in my opinion a restaurant should list the prices of everything it offers. Thus my current ranking is four (actually 4.5) stars which will go to 5 if prices of everything offered are listed on our next visit. We have been to Piccoli's takeout restaurant in Windsor Terrace several times and each time we have been very pleased. I think we were even more pleased last night when we happened to choose a Tuesday night when the restaurant was not crowded (which I am sure is quite unusual at a restaurant this good). The place is small and the tables are line up in rows allowing for easy passage between the rows but on a crowded night you will be only inches away from the people eating next to you. The atmosphere is exceptionally pleasant with customers of varying ages and as previously mentioned, the service was friendly, efficient and spot on. We began with rolls that were so good that we took them up on their offer for more. The second serving happened to have been rolls that had just come out of the oven...heavenly!  The rolls came with a tomato base dip but we asked for butter that melted on contact with our second batch of rolls! Now while I would have been happy eating warm rolls and butter all night, we then split orders of rigatoni Norma (eggplant, tomato sauce, fresh basil & fior di latte Mozzarella) and risotto bianco (cauliflower & parmigiano cheese risotto topped with anchovie pangrattato). Both were excellent and the tomato sauce, we agreed, may have been the best we have had in our visits to countless restaurants! We ended the meal splitting one of  Piccoli's exceptional tiramisu's and two decaf coffees.   Wow...what a great restaurant at which to have dinner! Update: We went back last night for another visit. The food was again excellent, the prices were still not listed on the specials but we had a server named Justyna who was even more fantastic than the very good server we had on our first visit. Thank you Justyna for your help, friendliness and attentiveness! Yet another update:  Last night was first time I used their restroom. It looked and even smelled nice!  Also we say outside on a temperature perfect night! We were, however, disappointed that we were charged for our coffee refills ($2.50 a cup) when even the diners refill for free. I asked our server why we were not charged last visit for our refills and she said it must have been a mistake (it was a different server than the one we had last visit).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I've been here twice for brunch. For the first time, I arrived at 1pm and waited 2 hours. The food was probably good because I was starving. For the second time, I went at 10am and didn't wait at all. I ordered one of their omelets that barely had any spinach in it and their pumpkin pancakes that was decent. My friends' dishes looked much more enticing (poached eggs/pancakes seem to be more popular) so I may have to try that next time. A huge con is that the waitress pretty much asked us to leave because there was a line of people waiting to get in. It's definitely not a nice place to have brunch and casually chat with friends. Also, I would not wait 2 hours for this. 1 hour? No. 30min? No. You'll find good brunch food elsewhere without having to wait so long and to be rushed out afterwards!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Hartford, what the hell happened when I was gone? First Max Fish and Sarape went down the tubes, then Bartaco, and now East-West. It's like an epidemic of average food is swarming the city and I'm relegated to hyping the praises of the Whole Foods sushi bar and City Pizza in order to convince friends to come over. To be honest, this is kind of the last straw. Full disclosure, I've been going to EW for about two years, since I moved to Hartford. My partner and I love the quirky decor, the music on Wednesdays, the menu, and begrudgingly don't mind the prices for quality food. We've had credit card mishaps here a few times but still came back- the food was awesome! Unfortunately, the last two pick-up orders have significantly dropped in quality. Our standard, two orders of pad lao, tasted like they'd been waiting for someone to pick up since lunch- bone dry, tiny shards of noodle, a paltry amount of dry chicken, and barely any sauce for $13. We all but had to remake them ourselves with Bulldog sauce, vegetables, and more meat. Totally uncharacteristic and a real bummer. Because I'm so enamored with this place, I'll come back one last time, perhaps for brunch or pad lao to see if the last few months have been a fluke, but if it happens again, I'm afraid to say I'll have to cross another former favorite off my list.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The only downside is I've never experienced a server walking around when sitting down at a table and ask if we need drinks or refills. Definitely would be a nice touch. The food here is pretty good and served until a decent time, I think around 10.00 or 10.30... I'm not exactly sure, I just wish it was a little cheaper for bar food. All in all its a good place to go hang out with friends or even with a date after dinner.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was reading through the Times article about Soup Dumplings/Joe's/Yelp today and i was like ""hah, hah, i am a yelper who has reviewed about how to-die-for Joe's soup dumplings are"", and then i look through my reviews, and nope, i'm not. I can't believe i forgot to review Joe's, so now i have to. The last couple of times I've been in NYC i haven't had the time/patience to wait an hour for a seat. I think next time i will just go by myself for a better shot at getting seated. Service and ambience are blah blah, who cares, soup dumplings and scallion pancakes are mega-awesome. Everything else i've had there is good-standard NY chinese food fare, but these two items are the stand-outs in my memory. The soup dumplings are a little tricky to eat your first time, my method is putting them on the spoon, carefully, and then poking a hole in the top of the dumpling with a chopstick to let the steam vent. Then sip from the hole, then do whatever you want when most of the liquid is gone. Inevitably i will end up tearing one taking it from the steam basket, as i will inevitably get some liquid on my shirt. I am not a mega bizarre-eats-foodie, i won't even touch seafood, but i love these. It's soup and meat in pasta, what's not awesome?

"My first Yelp review and am so sorry to say that Buvette totally missed the mark. From hyper rude waiters and a bottle of wine that tasted like soda pop, this dinner did not start well.  We were given no option for seating and were wedged into the community table, then offered the aforementioned wine when the one we wanted was out of stock.  To say the food was underwhelming is an overly generous assessment. This ""French"" restaurant offered a cassoulet hardly worth serving - very little pork, a small piece of sausage & an average duck leg.  The steak tartare - two small slices of toast each with perhaps 3 ounces of beef - had absolutely no flavor.   It was a particular disappointment to our table mates who had eaten here in the summer & found it delicious.  Jody Williams has had a great reputation around NYC & seems to be dining out on her past successes, rather than paying attention to her current gig.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Empanada Mama as its name suggests, sells empanadas.  In addition to empanadas, they also have entrees, tapas, and arepas.  But let's be honest, when you go to a place called empanada mama, you're going to get their empanadas!  Empanadas are in the $2-3 range depending on what you get for the fillers.  I had a pernil (although they were out of the chorizo) and a reggaeton.  For dessert it was the romeo and juliet.  The reggaeton was pretty good by itself and it was decently seasoned.  I thought the pernil was a bit dry and lacked any real distinguishing flavors.  On the bright side everything was brought to life with their magical green sauce.  My favorite however was the romeo & juliet, the guava mixed perfectly with the cheese. The restaurant itself is pretty small but cozy.  The crappy thing is they have tables right up to the door as a result and if you're one of the unfortunate ones on a cold night....sorry!  Service was pretty standard and the ambiance was nice for a little empanada place.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I also found that the wait staff could not give me a clear answer on the ingredients in the dishes I asked about, which is of great concern to me as a vegetarian and a person with food allergies. I would recommend Crescent Grill to a friend but until there are more vegetarian options on the menu that I can be sure I can eat because I know the ingredients, I don't see this as a place I would return again and again, which is a shame because I did enjoy my meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place always does me right. Pasta, fish, beef, pork and fish all great recipes all prepared well.  I've only had one bad dining experience here and I blame it on the odd rush of people that were dining on a weeknight. The place was a bit under staffed and not ready for the flow of customers. Besides this one time I've never left hungry or unhappy. I recommend the sweet and sour rib eye or my favorite double cut stuffed pork chop. I tell then cook it med rare by the time it hits the table the hot cheese and nuts finish it off and it's nice and moist.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came here with a friend around 3pm. The place wasn't that busy but i didn't mind it soon filled up. The leather seats were all torn up but the server/ bartender was super nice. I ordered the grilled catfish sandwich which was ok, i expected spatacular  since thats the name of the place. My friend had a salad with cajun shrimp which was pretty good. I also tried the oysters and they tasted very fresh!. We also had a few cans of the white rascal beer. The highlight of the meal was the bread pudding and ice cream we had for dessert. Ill go back and try another dish just for the great service. But its more like a bar then a restaurant.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It was really nice of my bf to surprise me with a reservation here on NYE. Unfortunately though it seemed as if we found the Philadelphia Olive Garden. Holy disappointment this turned out to be. The star is for the excellent service from our very nice waiter. Eggplant caponata app -- Nice price of $6.  This is usually a fave of mine but found it to be much too oily and lacked the true flavor it should have.  Served with super thick slices of not good tasting bread which were all terribly charred. Okay..so the 3 pasta dishes should be better..After all we were told to only order the pasta here and from the looks of our dining neighbors next to us they left almost all of their food on both their plates and sort of shook their heads (looked as if they had some sort of fried filet with a salad?)  So of course we were lucky enough to know to order the right things! Wrong. I have never had heavier sauced pasta dishes in my life.  Normally I am a salt-aholic and put salt on everything.  This was the first time I didn't want to.  Everything was so completely OVER salted it was barely edible. The pastas all so overcooked you couldn't tell if you were eating fresh pasta - In fact it could have very well been a store brand. Squash lasagna- an oily mess with what tasted like cheap cheddar cheese melted over the entire thing.  Overcooked mushy lasagne with a tiny amount of squash, which gave it really no squash flavor - just salt and cheese. Tonnarelli cacio e pepe - thought I was going to choke to death on a peppercorn.  The tonnarelli was wayyy too overcooked. The most overly creamy/buttery/salty dish I have ever had in my life.  Olive Garden could do it much better than this - and that's not saying much - at half the price. Pappardelle with oyster mushroom ragu  - the dish I was dying to get after seeing it on the online menu.   This was the best one of the night.  Again- too much oil and salt but the mushrooms gave it some actual flavor.  Noodles were again too overcooked, but not as badly as the other 2 dishes. Once again my theory proves right!  If I don't like the bread at a restaurant I end up not liking the meal.  The bread looked like focaccia but tasted like some stale sourdough.     This isn't good cooking.  If it were the pasta would have been cooked al dente to perfection, the sauces would be light to compliment the pasta, half a salt shaker wouldn't be poured into the food.   I'm a tough critic, I know.. But this food left me with Italian food nightmares and perhaps a few pounds. Not sure if I will ever try Italian outside of my family's home again!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I went here for dinner for my best friends bachelorette party, a small group of 6 of us, they sat us in the back near near the ""wine cellar"". We waited a really long time, even with reservations (about 45 min), but let me tell you, the food was well worth the wait! We shared the burrata mozzarella appetizer, it was absolutely amazing, a smooth creamy cheese served with perfect tomato slices and basil leaves. I got one of the specials, a short rib dish with fennel and this cheesy casserole. The short ribs were amazing, falling right off the bone with lots of flavor. The other people in my party weren't incredibly impressed with their meals, one person got salmon and it looked more like lox on top of greens than a salmon fillet. Two people shared a pasta dish and they thought it was great, and a pretty large portion. Someone else got the mashed potatoes on the side and fell in love with them! My best friend got the polenta and although it was really good, she wasn't impressed with it or the proscuitto de parma that it came with. I'd definitely go back to try some other dishes and I loved the cozy, laid back atmosphere. They didn't rush us out and weren't pushy with overselling the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Based on a friend's recommendation, I visited here on a Friday night for dinner. Apparently, this is where all of the locals go. Half of the place is a pizzeria and the other side is a sit-down restaurant. I ordered stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, which were subpar. It seemed as if the mushrooms weren't even cooked through and the filling was a tasteless mush. For the entree, I ordered the salmon in a white wine sauce with chucks of crabmeat. For nearly $20, I had high expectations, but the meal was average at best. And even though the food was considerably below expectations, perhaps the most disheartening aspect of this visit was the service. The waitress had the nastiest attitude I've ever seen, forgot to bring the salad that I ordered, never refilled the water and not once checked to see how food was. At first I thought maybe I did something to her, but she was one of only two waitresses working and treated every table the same way .... poor. The below average food combined with the surliest waitress ever made this my second worst restaurant experience ever. I will not be returning and neither should you.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Since we came at 5:30pm on a Monday, our group of 4 had no trouble picking almost any seat in the restaurant.  The outdoor seating is a nice option to have, too.   We shared: 1. Homemade ricotta ($11) Always good; a simple dish that's hard for any decent restaurant to botch.  *Why* is it $11? 2. Black kale salad ($12) (Its anchovy dressing was surprisingly, satisfyingly spicy 3.

Truffle French fries ($8) Maybe I'm too plebeian to appreciate truffle flavor or even know what it is when I eat it, but they just tasted like fries to me.  *Heartily fried* fries.  Not bad 5. Soup of the Day ($7) was a lamb stew.  Very good, according to my companion 6. Asparagus & black lentil stew ($13).  Excellent, according to another companion 7. The 'Old Cuban' cocktail ($11; how about having a Happy Hour, huh, guys?) was great - very drinkable, in a subtly sweet, subtly fizzy, expensive-mojito-(on account of the mint)-esque way Overall, well-done but pricey.   Definitely do not leave without getting #2, #3, #5, and #6.","[1.0, 0.0]"

It was creamy, smokey and perfectly seasoned, it comes with grilled panini bread brushed with a basil pesto so delicious I would bathe in it, simply a perfect pairing with the soup.

"Casa Mia is one of several restaurants trying to carry on the tradition of good Italian Food in what is known as the Little Italy of Hartford, which is mainly Franklin Avenue. I lived off of Franklin Ave. for a few years as a kid and have a lot of mouth-watering memories of spinach pies, gelato, lemon ice (the real thing), anise flavored cookies, huge aluminum containers of melt-in-your mouth ravioli - and on, and on.   Back then, most families also had gardens in their backyards, complete with grape arbors for making their own wine. There was never any garbage on the sidewalks and it was safe to stay outside with your friends well into the evening in the summertime. A lot has changed since then, but as I said, there are a few spots trying to hold on to the traditions. Casa Mia, a family-owned restaurant at 381 Franklin Ave. (at the corner of Preston Street) is one of those. It's a little bit formal - you wouldn't go there in shorts and a T-shirt - a little bit subdued, a little pricey and the waitstaff is a somewhat reserved (not aloof - more like dignified). The menu items include plenty of pasta dishes and lots of seafood, as well as chicken and beef. They post their menu online, so you can browse and see that most of the dishes are upscale Italian. When I was there earlier this month, I overheard a fellow diner say he was surprised to see a wine from the area where he grew up in Italy. Casa Mia serves lunch and dinner, but when I was there on a Wednesday for lunch, there were only 6 people in the place. It seemed a shame. They have a cozy bar and a nice glass-enclosed area with a few tables - with brick walls and wooden beams and wine bottles tucked into arched windows - where you can watch people coming and going. Lunchtime specials (appetizer and entrée) are all priced at $16.50 and dinner specials are $28.50. Or you can go with antipasto - choices include veal, sirloin, chicken or seafood and range from $13.95 to $16.98 per platter. For my appetizer, I chose Calamaretti Affogati - squid slices in a spicy tomato sauce with capers, olives and spinach, beautifully cooked and presented. For my entrée, I chose Ucelletti di Manzo - beef top-round rolled with asparagus, cheese, proscuitto and herbs served with broccoli and cauliflower on the side. The beef was tender and deliciously seasoned, with a pleasant salty note from the proscuitto. Casa Mia also will serve your meal family-style for a group of at least six. This includes four courses with unlimited servings and salad, a side of vegetables and coffee, at a price of $16.95 for lunch and $28 for dinner. Hours are from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (closed Tuesdays), from 4 to 10 p.m. on Saturday and from 4 to 9 p.m. on Sunday. Major credit cards are accepted. There's plenty of parking, but you have to watch for the entrance, which is off of Franklin.

"A new restaurant in town, and a brand new building with a seemingly good breakfast history. My wife and I decided to go there for lunch today. The outside decor, and newness were awaiting us. Inside, booths ,chairs and tables were viewed as a step up from a Denny's! Now the food. My wife ordered a short stack of Pancakes with Bacon, and Maple syrup. She enjoyed them, but when the bill came we were somewhat surprised. I ordered a Turkey Dinner. For the price I thought I would receive Roasted Turkey with Turkey Gravy with many thick slices. What was plated was lots of stuffing, a small pile of shaved Turkey that was supposed to be oven roasted, A white floured gravy, veggie, and mashed potato.The staff was friendly, kind of green, and did not make up the difference for the lack of good food. The total bill was higher than I would pay at a better restaurant! The restroom had much to be desired especially for a new restaurant. Looks like the folks at Chip's were trying to save a few dollars on this one! The other thing that really gets me furious. Chip's charges for soda water....that is nothing else but Tap Water with carbonation. Many restaurants are not charging for this For the money, the taste, and presentation this dining out experience was not worthy of another visit.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I ordered the cabbage and pork steam dumplings (10 in one order) and the sesame sandwich with pecking duck. The dumpling skins were thick... which I didn't mind, but the flavor was lacking. Definitely needed seasoning and more cabbage.. it was loaded with meat and didn't have a nice balance. The sesame pecking duck wasn't too bad just that the duck meat was dry and had no flavor. Total rip off even though it was only 1.25. I've definitely tried better and would recommend that if you did go there..try not to have any high expectations.

"This was one of the most hyped openings this summer and given the headlines on the long waits I didn't think I'd be eating an umami burger this soon. (This review is over a month late..) Well, my bf and I decided to check them out one evening after cocktails at Greenwich Project. The wait wasn't terrible but it was long enough to have a chai at a nearby cafe. Once seated I quickly decided on having the Manly Burger and my bf had the Original. We split them in halves so we got a taste of both burgers. They were delicious! Definitely one of the best burgers you can have in NY right now. And as far as the taste goes I'm tempted to give them 5 stars. And I might, if I'm consistently impressed after future visits. But for now the wait is too long. And yes, there's a bar and you can order a bottle of wine with your burger but it's still a semi fast food joint that's fancied up to correspond the hype. And at $15 a burger it's right alongside other gourmet burgers in the city. I'm sure I'll be back but there are plenty of other burgers that rival the quality and flavor of Umami Burger in NY, in my opinion.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is a God-sent to Bed-Stuy.  Let me explain... I live a block and half away from here.  Before, there were NO decent pizzerias in the neighborhood.

I would have preferred a softer and chewier type of Neapolitan pizza but it's a matter taste. The vodka half was unremarkable. If you've tasted vodka pasta sauce then this is the same thing. As for the Rubirosa supreme side, I was very disappointed with the very thin film of mozzarella cheese that you could barely taste. The meats were okay and again nothing to write home about.

"Our worst dining experience in NYC. By far. Ridiculously overpriced, the food has rather little, if anything, to do with real, authentic Italian cooking; at best, it should be characterized as 'misunderstood Italian'. If you want to pay this much for (real) Italian food, go to one of the top Italian restaurants in Manhattan. They may be overpriced too, but at least their quality is much more in line with pricing. Notning we tasted was particularly delicate, memorable, or anywhere near justifying their prices. The numerous 'specials' -- not priced so obviously a sneaky way to increase profits -- add to an already overly long menu, which by itself raises a red flag; a good Italian restaurant never has a menu this long. The pizza was awful too, prefabricated, don't let the wood fired owen fool you. This is a restaurant where the ratings are completely detached from reality. A scam. It only gets one star in part because the app seemingly can't leave that field blank and in part because the service while not great wasn't as bad as the food and the prices.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Love that Palo Santo Restaurant!!! I hosted a Bridal Shower Brunch for 30 the guest 2 months later were still talking about how they had an awesome time at the Bridal Shower.  Let me 1st say I could not have had a successful Bridal Shower Brunch without Gonzalo's assistance; he is very professional and also helped in the direction and planning for the day of the Bridal Shower. The Private Event Room held an ambiance that made the guest feel comfortable and relaxed as if they were in a home setting. Everyone loved the food which was fresh and divine, it was an open bar the drinks were served as my guest entered the brunch and the servers keep the drinks coming to my guest the entire duration of the event....there were a variety deserts which were heaven. The servers and Gonzalo were very accommodating in every way I can think of they were a happy and energetic staff they made me feel very comfortable and welcomed. I would definitely recommend the Palo Santo Restaurant for any event. I must go back for the Slow Pork Thank you Palo Santo","[0.0, 1.0]"

Great Maitre'd and waitress. However when we ordered a dessert and asked for 2 rather than one scoop of ice cream we were told we would be charged for it. This after already ordering $200 of food and drinks for 2 people. It turns out they were going to dock the waitress several dollars for an 8 cent scoop of ice cream. . The chef would not see me and sent this charming Mexican sous chef who could not understand most of what I was saying) was insistent that they were going to dock the waitress. Apparently the owner is not often there. I left the waitress a 35% tip and can say that the owners of this place do not deserve your business.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"My husband and I visited this restaurant for the first time Sunday night around 6:30. I heard about it from co-workers and decided to try it out. We were amazed at how busy the place was, people coming and going constantly. Busy or not, waiting for the waitress to pay attention to our table is one way of keeping me from visiting the establishment again any time soon. The food was actually very good, and the wine that we chose was actually very good as well, we had the Menage et trois Red and White. We ended up paying our tab, with no bill to look at, because we did not want to have to wait for the waitress to make another appearance at our table. We actually paid her very well for not having very good wait service.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Geronimo Tequila Bar is just that...it is a bar.  The food is ""upscale"" bar food, mediocre, thoroughly uninspired and over-priced.  The mini bison burgers were not as good as white castle burgers and at ten times the price.  They have a large tequila bar but who could afford them at these astronomical prices...ten to forty dollars a shot!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Went for the New Year's Buffet. What a joke! The buffet was $30 per person and so, so not worth the price. The whole experience was just wrong. First of all we had to take a shifty elevator up to the second floor, together with the frantic servers and bus boys. Then, the food was right there, in a small alcove right in front of the elevator! Upon getting off the elevator, we bumped into a few patrons who were getting the buffet food, because the space was very narrow and awkward. Then, I noticed one of the bus boys sneaking some of the food off the buffet and earing desperately, huddled by the elevator. The food itself was cold; the flimsy little serving tray warmers were not sufficient to ward off the cold air people were bringing in via the elevator. Honestly, the presentation of the food itself in that buffet looked like a make-shift continental style buffet you see at those hotel training seminars. I can only say that the food, had it not been cold, was actually quite good. Very good food. To add to the experience, somehow Champagne was sold only by the bottle, their Chai tea was all 'out' at 9pm. And the waitress we had was so busy that we were long done eating before she came back to bring our Coke, and tell me that Chai was all out and they were done making it for the night. I must have had high expectations, because even décor upstairs seemed drab and a little creepy. There was no artwork no the walls, our table was one of the outdoor ones. I kept hitting my shin on a metal bar underneath. I can tell you, honestly, that was one miserable experience for the both of us. And the final bill of $79 was absolutely a slap in the face.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Came here with a group of 4 for breakfast and we only had to wait for about 30 min before getting seated. Just a note, if you have parties 5 or more, 20% gratuity is automatically added. I don't know about your but 20% is A LOT for a cash only place. We ordered, The Big Boy, Pulled Pork Hash, Chicken & Waffles, and Fried Okra. I liked my Pulled Pork Hash. It was very flavorful, the egg still runny and the dish tasted great even after breaking the yolk and mixing it into the dish. One issue is the pork, it's not as soft as it could have been. The dish does appear kind of small but it is filling. I kind of wished it was served in a bigger bowl. I didn't get a chance to try The Big Boy but there is a lot of food on that plate. Really nothing special about this dish. The Chicken & Waffle was okay. I thought the gravy and waffle were a let down. Not much flavoring/seasoning in either components. The chicken was was moist, probably over fried but quickly became soggy because of the large amount of gravy that was put all over it. The waffles were also dry. The fried okra was okay, just felt too much friend stuff towards the end. I wish they did a little more twist to the dish. It's basically battered okra, nothing else. Very much one note. We also had a strawberry milkshake. Tasted more like a vanilla milk shake Barely any strawberries or strawberry flavor in it. Overpowered with milk. Service was excellent. They definitely have enough staff and they are attentive to your water level. Everyone is really friendly there. Also, the consistency needed to be more viscous. It tasted kind of water downed. As for the food, I think it's more of a solid 3 stars. I may come back and try some of their lunch dishes but I'd be hard pressed considering it's cash only and there are better places for the same price that accepts credit cards. If you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try but I definitely would not make a special trip to eat here.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I lived in S. California for a few years so I consider most Mexican food in the Northeast to be crappy. Taqueria didn't disappoint. Went here last Saturday night around 8pm. The place is small and there was a line of people outside. I arrived first and gave my name to hostess. My friend was en route so I was told to let her know when we were both there (totally fair, especially with a line). Once my friend arrived we were seated quickly (they definitely move you through there and flip tables quickly). We ordered the guacamole and chips (very fresh, not much heat...could have been spicier). My friend had margaritas and I had homemade Palomas (they have Jarritos soda!) with a glass of tequila on the rocks and a full bottle of soda. Food: one each of Pork, Fish, and Steak tacos. My friend had the same except got the ground beef instead of the pork. Rank them in that order (the ground beef was a little greasy and had peas in it). The pork and fish tacos were both great. Service was good although had to ask twice for waters and a chip refill (the small guac is generous but the basket of chips was stingy). Food and drinks were good and the food is CHEAP! our drinks were the bulk of our bill. Service was friendly but I felt a little rushed. They flip tables fast so if you plan on lingering, maybe sit at the bar. Would definitely come here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went here for our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect. Not wanting to splurge too much even for a special occasion, we picked the cucina povera menu, a three-course prix-fixe ($35). We got the wine pairings to go with (3 good-sized glasses for $15). Prix-fixe deals can be disappointing because the rest of the menu hints that there are greater things to be had. But this combo hit all the right notes. The chilled zucchini basil soup was creamy but light and topped with a delicious basil oil and pine nuts. The pork tortelli were in a very flavorful broth with a little bit of kale. Pig explosion. The dessert was panna cotta with candied almonds. I LOVE panna cotta. All three wines were interesting and delicious and I would never have had the good sense to pick them out for myself nor the opportunity to pay so little for them. This is the kind of place where you have a waiter but really everything in the restaurant is looking after you. For example: my husband's napkin got folded when he got up to go to the bathroom; I arrived schlepping too much stuff and the hostess checked my bag to unburden me. The only downside was a particularly loud and obnoxious woman at another table. Here's a hint: please do not sing over dinner in public. But there's nothing the waitstaff could have done to chill her out except start feeding her, after which point she was quieter. Bonus: as an amuse bouche they served a shot glass of chilled fennel soup. My husband loves it when you get a treat at the beginning of the meal. They have a ginormous binder of wine and other alcohol offerings, which we did not delve into because of the pairings, but I'm sure you could find whatever you wanted here. We went on a Thursday night and made reservations on Tuesday via Open Table without a problem. We were going to a show at 9 in the Theater District and didn't have any time crunch (we started at 6:30). Perfect for a special occasion. Would definitely return.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Take it from somebody who really HATES eating out for Indian food. This place is FABULOUS. I had the privilege to go there for dinner with my parents last weekend. Lets take it piece by piece shall we? The ambiance has an intimate, romantic, ethnic feel to it- basically what I want my future home to look like. I am just in love with the decor. It is very cozy and just wonderful (warning: instagramming may not be possible due to dim lighting) The service is exceptional. Water was always filled without question, servers were attentive and treated each customer with a lot of respect and patience. Indian food can be complicated for those who don't eat it often (and even for some who do!) but our server took time to explain everything and recommended some great dishes to try. The food is just perfection. I am trying to think of an Indian restaurant that I've eaten at in Philly that even compares and none comes to mind. We ordered the lamb kabob and the naan pizza (the rotating special. ours was a paneer and caramelized onion one) for the appetizer, the lamb rogan josh, and the chicken makhni (along with naan for the table). Everything came out very promptly and the food was absolutely great. When it first comes out you don't think that the portions are that much, but we ended up having enough leftovers for the next day. This truly is a great spot to go if you are interested in eating quality Indian food.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The meal, experience, and aftermath was a disaster, so much so that I am driven to write my first Yelp review.  Let me break it down by issue, although I think what may be of most interest is the last section where the manager promised to mail a complimentary gift certificate because of the negative experience AND HAS YET TO DO SO OVER A MONTH LATER. 1.  The Context:  6 of us had reservations for 8:15 on a Friday night (October 19) to surprise a friend for his birthday.  We all arrived promptly and were seated by 8:20.  Their menu is very limited, which I don't begrudge them, but it was very frustrating that by 8:30 on a Friday night they were already out of 20% of their appetizers and 30% of their entrees. As this is one of the most expensive BYOs I've attended (think $15/app, $25/30/main), I at least expected excellence in the quality of the remaining dishes they had.  We ordered around 8:35/8:40, although we were ready to order earlier.  In solidarity with some pregnant friends, nobody was drinking.  We are all 30-something parents who got babysitters for what we expected to be a special meal, albeit not one that would last close to midnight. 2.  The Service:  To be kind, it was abysmal.  We waited approximately 30 minutes for our appetizers (which we ate promptly) and were not served our main courses until 9:50.  The table next to us had ordered after us and were served their main courses before us.  At no point did our server make any acknowledgement that we were waiting an inappropriately long time (almost 1 1/2 hours for our main), nor did she even provide us with a refill of our bread or anything to hold us over.  When we made some comments to her about the wait, she said nothing sympathetic or reassuring in response, nor did any manager or other employee.  When the food finally came out, we were served unevenly and some of the dishes were lukewarm.  Again, at no point was there any acknowledgement that this was not right nor was there any offer to make amends with a comped dessert or even a bread refill (not even for the birthday boy).  Completely tone deaf. 3.  The Food:  The food was most definitely not worth the wait.  Of the remaining dishes they had on the menu, the food was generally bland and not more flavorful than what friends have made for dinner parties.  I don't even remember what I specifically ordered -- it was eminently forgetable.  We also did not even get to ""enjoy"" the food at the appropriate temperature as it came out lukewarm.   4.  The Aftermath:  My friend, the birthday celebrant, is non-confrontational so in deference to him we did not raise an issue at the meal.  The following day, however, I called to speak with the manager about my experience. He didn't disagree with any of my characterizations that it was an unpleasant dining experience and one that Russet should not provide to its customers.  While he initially did not offer any kind of resolution, after a little prodding he volunteered to provide a gift certificate to Russet, which I in turn intended to provide to my friend.  I provided my mailing address, which he read back to me, and thanked him for his time.  It has now been OVER A MONTH AND WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE GIFT CERTIFICATE.         My dining experience was awful but what I find even more insulting/offensive is Russet's failure to even do what it said it would do and provide the gift certificate.  I don't know if the manager thought I wouldn't follow-up or if this just was not a priority, but there is no excuse.  Each couple paid about $120 for sub-par food and a below-average dining experience.  Not only do I not recommend Russet but I found the whole experience so disagreeable that I want to share it with others.","[0.0, 1.0]"

My sandwich always showed up still warm. The lettuce, tomato, and onion were crisp and fresh.

Bacon cheeseburger was large, juicy and tasty served in a brioche bun and served with crispy shoestring fries. Some might say they are too crispy/dry/overdone. Side a barbecue/ketchup sauce? Whatever it was was quite good and regular ketchup was no where to be seen.  Service was basic.

"I've heard good things about Santucci's so on a busy work day, my co workers & I decided to give it a try. We called & ordered a large pizza, half red, half white & we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We work in a busy Hair Salon & we all eat lunch whenever we have a free moment so a 45 minute wait was workable for all of us. I can't explain how surprised we were that our pizza arrived 2 and a half hours later after 1 follow up call at the 1 and a half hour point & reassurance that it was on it's way. At that point they could have delivered the best pizza ever created and it would leave a bitter taste in my mouth. What was most disappointing is that we received no apologies & no explanations. We won't be giving them another try.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Love, love, love this place. I've been there multiple times now, and just getting around to writing a review. It has a great atmosphere. It seems like when you walk in, you're going to be hit with hipsters, but the neighborhood vibe really just overpowers. The people drinking in there love good beer, but they aren't snobs about it. Ask the servers about the beers! They know their stuff and they aren't condescending with their answers! The selection of beer is always interesting and always changing! The food menu is just as great and interesting as the beer. I've never had anything there I haven't liked. My favorite was the brunch selection of bacon, eggs, and cheese fries. Despite how small it is, I've never had an issue getting a table. So glad this place exists!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As I don't often take the subway to that stop, I just noticed this place a few days ago. Plus stars for the fact that they have several vegetarian (not vegan) options, but minus stars for the fact that some of the sandwiches are ""pre-made"" so you can't have them take off certain items. For example, the fontina and goat cheese with mushrooms - if you don't like mushrooms, they can scrape them off, but not make you a sandwich from scratch without them. Another plus is that fact that the ""classic"" can be made from a choice of cheeses (not just ""American"" which is not, in my opinion, real cheese!) and breads (wheat, white, or sourdough). I went with the Classic but aged cheddar instead of American. It was grilled well, crunchy on the outside and the cheese was thoroughly melted. Final price: $5.43, which, I believe is less than the grilled cheese at Burger Heaven and tastier.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"What a great addition to the area! A little fierce opening up 2 doors down from vive le crepe, but very happy they are so conveniently located from the Spring St 6 train stop. The cone shaped bundles of joy are made of rice, so the crepe isn't extremely heavy. Crepes are no overcooked and do not get soggy or bogged down by the amount of food stuffed into them. I got the azuki berries and don't let the name fool you. its got more matcha sauce and a scoop of green tea ice cream than azuki or strawberries... which is kinda the way I wanted it. the poki sticks are a nice way to top the crepe... very fun and takes you back for the times you ate these japanese treats! I didn't try a savory crepe but my friend did mention the edamame and tofu was pretty good. There are only 2 stools in the tiny spot and 2 benches outside but we were fortunate to get a seat. I'm guessing these crepes are meant to take on the go, but I am one to not be coordinated enough to eat and walk at the same time.

"Love.Love.Love. Right to the chase-the food was superb!  All split with a friend: started with the zucchini and hummus pizza & the chili pork dumplings.  The pizza was incredible--warm & savory with crushed wasabi peas to add a perfect, spicy crunch!  The pork dumping were delectable--an order came with six or seven which was delightfully surprising--not to mention the fact that they were the most delicious pork dumplings I've ever had!  Next had the cumin eggplant buns.  These were quite good, but I wasn't a fan of how doughy the buns were (although that is probably not a sound complaint, being that buns are doughy).  Finished with the chocolate cupcake which was outstanding (no actual caviar--giant chocolate balls-score!!).   All wine is $25 a bottle and they have a pretty decent selection--we were very happy with the two bottles we downed during dinner.  They also have wine of the week bottles which are $45 each.   *Only warning-it's community seating and quite intimate, so if you're not prepared to sit in close proximity to some strangers (this is NY people), then maybe rethink... *Oh and whoever took my reservation was really annoying--kept putting me on hold and was really flighty--deal with it and go!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm sorry Steve T. did you just say that you had an hour to eat dinner at a steakhouse and then you ordered THREE COURSES?  Are you insane?  I'm sorry for the rest of your bad experience, and service doesn't end when the check is down OR paid for, even though it was a prefix dinner, which is a way for people to spend less when they go out for dinner and that makes servers annoyed, but really.  Use that head of yours.   The manager should have told the server that you had ordered dessert, had you in fact made that clear with said manager.  The server should have been more attentive.  You should have ordered one course.   Bottom line, their steaks are pretty darn good.  I'm not usually one for crusted steaks, but I'll take it here.  Also, if you sit at the bar and order the steak sandwich, you will not be disappointed.  The booths look like crazy 18th century dining experiences at the palace.  A little out of place, which is why I prefer the bar.  It's more real.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Shared a crostini appetizer with my husband that was the perfect pre-dinner bite for two people, and very fresh and delicious. My husband got the burger and said it was great, the fries were really hearty and good-more like wedges, with the skins on, love that. I had the vegan mousakka, and I am not vegetarian but this was really good. Didn't miss the meat at all and it was a perfect portion.

"This is one of the best intimate places for pizza that is fresh out of the oven, thin crust that is not too fatty and made to your desire! You can see them making the pizza in the back with all the fresh herbs, mozzarella and toppings. It cannot get much better than  table full of fresh greens, meats and cheeses. We are talking authentic, crispy, herb-y pizza that you cannot stop eating! Reminds me of Italy in the olden days and you get the brick oven taste! Definitely worth the wait. :) We came since a friend found it on yelp and I've been craving their pizza ever since. Way better that than touristy Grimaldi's stuff. It's big and so fresh tasting you would've thought the stuff came right outta the ground. We ordered half artichoke and basil and the half was pepperoni and artichoke...OMG delish! The artichokes were whole slices not the junk outta jars. We ended up ordering two pies for 4 ppl. Best of all, BYOB!! AWESOME! {Pies are a bit pricey, with all of our toppings we averaged $25-30 a pie}.

I have been here about six times and typically get a spot at the bar.  I used to love it but lately I feel that they are banging out too many plates and QC is falling down.  A little too much salt the past two times on multiple dishes.  Salads seem to be shrinking in size.  Still very good but I dunno I want consistency....perhaps they have the B team on the line.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went for an early dinner at 5pm on a weekday.  Very nice server named Robert who is 6 feet 6 tall quickly came to us and briefly help us to understand the Jamaica style of menu.   Our order came quickly, only about 5-7 minutes.  My friend ordered the Pan-seared salmon pasta  which he found it too sour and acidic.  The salmon was chopped into small piece and mixed with the bow-tie pasta.   But the dish look waterly and the sour taste didn't seem like overuse of lemon.   My friend worried that something may be wrong with the dish because the menu didn't say that it's a sour taste pasta. We waved for the waiter but the manager Steve quickly came to us.  He's charming and freindly.    After hearing our concern, he first explained that one ingredient made the dish taste sour and nothing wrong with it.  But he said that if we simply don't lke the taste, he's glad to take it back and change to another dish.  In order to make us feel better, he told us that this is the only dish he doesn't like among all.  Server Robert came after the manager and both of them work to together to help us to choose another dish.   They featured fresh fish menu for freshly caught fishes like Salmon,Tilapia  and Mahi-mahi.    So I asked how fresh there fishes are.  Steve said that they have their own fish farm for the first 2 types of fish and line-fishing for the Mahi-mahi.  They were neither swimming nor deep frozen, shipped only with a thin layer of ice.  Since we always have fresh swimming fishes in Chinese restaurants in New York Chinatown.  My friend skipped them and ordered the Seafood Paella (baked sausage, scallops, fish, mussels on fry-rice).  Robert told us that we can ask to take out any particular ingredients.  That one came out nice and smell good. The dish I ordered was the Calypso Shrimp Linguine which was great.  Each dish costs around $16.99  but they do have light-portion for the same dishes that cost $12.99.  Very thoughtful menu.   With the unique setting and atmosphere in this restaurant with excellent service, we have a very pleasant dining experience.  We will be back for sure.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Are you that freaking lazy? I should i of said screw you guys and walked to Genos' but i don't' know who's the lesser evil..  I will never go back to Pat's NOR Genos.  ONLY to Jim's steak on south street.  At least they treat me like a human being and actually cook their food there and then.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Bought a groupon to try The Elbow Room.  We didn't need a reservation and were offered seating on the rooftop which we thought would be great.  There is a bar located on the roof and a lot of noise.  The lighting is poor and menus were hard to read in the dark.  We used our cell phone flashlights to read.   We ended up being seated between serv staff area's and told that the other server would be taking care of us.  A non-food server, came over and asked if we wanted  a drink and since neither of us drink alcohol we declined but asked for water-it never came and we never saw that server again.  We finally caught the attention of the other server and she got upset because the original server was supposed to take care of us but she waited on us.  It took a long time to receive our order and although the food was good the service was 1 star.   The silverware is stored on the roof but not in a weather proof cabinet therefore the storm the night before soaked the napkins and made a mess of the silverware.  Before you start serving meals that should have been cleaned up and sanitized! One other thing, and MANAGEMENT PAY ATTENTION, there were smokers which is against state law and none of the staff did anything about it.  We didn't make a fuss about it but it is ILLEGAL and could/should affect you liquor license.

"So I should have known better than to trust yelp with finding an AUTHENTIC dim sum restaurant. The ""dim sum"" was no better than any other random Americanized Chinese takeout or buffet. I was coming into the area four hours away from Syracuse and knew that I had to get some dim sum since I was in the Chinatown area. I am only basing this review on the dim sum options which was not much even though the name itself contains the words dim and sum. I walked in with four other friends and immediately knew I was in the wrong place. There was barely anyone there, no food carts, no wheel tables but we gave it a chance anyways. Yes the food was cheap and it came fast. Some of the dishes were alright, like the scallion pancake but  the pork dumplings and shumai were EXTREMELY questionable. When you grab the pork dumpling with a chopstick or fork a watery/pinkish ooze came out of it and that's when I knew that those pork dumplings were something hellish and steered clear from them. Shumai is normally made with a filling consisting of pork, shrimp and black Chinese mushrooms. The ""shumai"" here was made from some type of rice mixture. Definitely not shumai. Besides the food the waitresses were OK. They were prompt with water refills and service. On the other hand the cooking crew in the back were creepy as hell. The restroom was right next to the kitchen so when you walk past you get the eerie feeling of being starred by multiple kitchen members. Gross. Some tips for finding some GOOD ASS dim sum: - the restaurant should be VERY busy - there should be servers pushing carts stacked with steaming entrees around the aisles. (the steam indicating the freshness of the food) - there should be no menus, you order by what you see from the carts - the restaurant itself should not look modern - there should be a circular revolving table in the center of the dining table (confusing but you'll know when you see it)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been here twice before for dinner, but brunch is definitely the meal to catch here. The atmosphere here is glamorous, styled after a Parisian cafe, yet not so elegant that it feels stuffy or overly formal. The outdoor tables with a view of Rittenhouse square are charming and romantic. The space is so large that we didn't have to wait for a table- a HUGE plus during the brunch rush. The bread basket is a delicious starter, with particularly amazing sourdough. My table ordered the salad lyonnaise and the macaroni au gratin to split. The salad was light and tasty and the egg on top was cooked to perfection. The macaroni au gratin was unbelievably rich and flavorful. I got the eggs florentine, which was outstanding. Although it's a pretty standard brunch dish, not every restaurant can execute it to perfection quite like Parc. Eggs florentine is my go-to brunch dish, so I've eaten it a lot, but this is the best rendition I've had. Adding this to my list of spots to take visitors from out of town for sure.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I live in the neighbourhood, and i went there when they first opened. the portion was decent back then. now the guy in charge of the steam tables looks like he is scared to scoop the dish. portion is getting smaller and the choices are almost the same everyday , am getting bored  coming to this place. and they have this breaded fish which is mostly flour and less fish. the place is clean and nice for a fastfood. and they have amazing desserts and i love their Thai iced tea for $2. come visit them and you decide. but i have to think if im coming back again except for the dessert and Thai iced tea. they are closed mondays btw.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Fabulous restaurant with consistently good food.  Love the simplicity of the menu, even the quirky ordering system involving checkboxes and wipeable markers.  You're basically choosing your preferred combination of meatball type (beef, spicy pork, chicken, daily special, etc), sauce (tomato, spicy meat, parm, etc) and style (naked, sliders, hero, smash, etc). Yes, the lines can be horrendous... but The Meatball Shop has implemented a courteous text messaging system where they'll take your number and text you a few minutes before your table is ready.  There are plenty of fun places to explore in the area, so this frees you up without risking having your name crossed off the list (*cough cough Totto Ramen*). Staff are, for the most part, friendly.  Best service I've had tends to be at the bar (which is first come, first serve seating btw).  The restaurant is small and loud, so it's best to come with a party of 2... and no more than 4 if you want to have an audible conversation. The Foodnalysis: - Meatballs - My favorite combinations include: (1) chicken + parm sauce + risotto (under)... rich and decadent (2) spicy pork + classic tomato sauce + smash (3) chiken or spicy pork or daily special + spicy pork sauce + simple salad - House Lemonade - Homemade and tart, just how I like it.   - Beer & Wine - Lots of great options, very reasonable prices. - Ice Cream Sandwiches - LOVE these.  Love how you can pick two different flavor cookies as well!  My favorites include chocolate chip cookies + mint ice cream and ginger cookies + ginger ice cream (daily special). The Bottom Line: Great concept with affordable, quality food and drink.  Any combination of meatball entree + drink + ice cream sandwich will prove to be a winning meal.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend introduced me to this place as his go-to hangout spot when he was in high school. Why did I not know about this spot 5 years ago?!! Seriously, the fries are so thick and crunchy and filling and GLUTEN FREE! The selection of dips is amazing with sauce combos and flavors that I have never heard of before in my life, although I always seem to be drawn back to my all-time fave Chunky Mango Mayo. The prices are decent and it's perfect for a small after-bar snack on a saturday night/ early sunday morning (1-3 am) ;) or even a small midday snack. Space is very small so most people get their fries to go but it's not an issue. Seriously worth every bite. French Fry heaven in East Village looks like Pomme Frites","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Not Impressed. I thought this was going to be allot better. I'd much rather eat at the sushi restaurant in Manhattan than eat this over priced American fair.

"Goodfella pizza was terrible. Chicken was cardboard and although broccoli rabe is always delicious, the pizza overall was dry and flavorless (even with tons of hot sauce poured on it, i tried tabasco and sriracha to no avail).  the roasted garlic tasted like mush and the lack of sauce is a terrible idea for these ingredients. I thought this place would have more flavor!  Admittedly the ingredients are fresh but next time maybe i'll try the bbq chicken.  Delivery was fast tho to center city.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is near Queens Courthouse and the jury's still out. We ordered the radicchio salad, spaghetti, sirloin cap, French fries and beignets. The radicchio salad was bland. A little salt and pepper helped, but I wouldn't recommend it. Radicchio is too strong for such a mild dressing. The spaghetti was just the right amount of chewy and full of flavor. I ordered my steak medium and it came out very well done. The server took it back without hesitation. The second time around was a charm - it was tender and juicy and the accompanying baby turnips were tasty as well. The French fries in truffle oil were delicious, as were the beignets with blueberry sauce. The food, except for the salad, was all quite good. The service was fine if a little rushed. She seemed a little too eager to take our various orders i.e. to get us out of there quicker even though there were plenty of open spots. When I say I need more time, that means more than a minute! My only gripe was the portions - they are skimpy (which my companion had also said after his first time there). I am not a huge eater by any means but after half a salad, half an order of French fries, a whole 6 oz. sirloin and a few beignets, I still felt like I could have eaten a little something else. My companion's spaghetti was downright kid-sized. There was a bunch of beefy guys at the table next to ours and they ordered two appetizers and two entrees each! Anyway, it was a fine experience. I would go back for brunch since it's in the neighborhood and there's less at stake in terms of expectations and the wallet, but I probably wouldn't go back for dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"There are a lot of pizza places in the area, and their menus are pretty similar, but Cantore's manages to stand out.  The pizza isn't the best, though it's pretty good, but the rest of the menu - especially the sandwiches - is fantastic.  Everything I've ordered has been delicious; a clear step above anything else around here. This place really pays attention to the details, and it shows in everything down to the stylish black-white checkered paper in take-out boxes.  The service is top-notch; really friendly people.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wavering between three or four stars, Henri's extended weeknight hours gives them the nod. We'll start with the basics: decent, consistent food, adequate, cute waitstaff, pleasant, cafe-like ambience with French pop background music. I like their breakfast/brunch as well as Henri's burger and short-rib sandwich, and if you're a fan of crepes, they have many to choose from. I choose to give it four stars because every other restaurant (diners not included) in the QueensWest/Hunter's point area, is closed by 10ish on weeknights with the exception of Shi, which closes at 10:30pm. Henri is open until midnight! This is a big deal if you feel like decent food later in the night. I'm not a big fan of diners, so eating the short rib sandwich tonight around 11pm (take out) with a glass of wine at home had me feeling like a happy camper. Thank you Henri for staying open!

"What can be said about Traif that hasn't already been said?  First off, they have a short cocktail list (around 5 drinks) but all 5 are unique, innovative, and use different spirits / flavor profiles so there's something for everybody. We did the chef's choice menu, which comes with 9 savory courses and 2 dessert courses for $50.  An INCREDIBLE VALUE.  Hard to think of another restaurant in NYC that gives you 11 courses for $50.  It's not an obscene amount of food so you don't have to worry about rolling out of the restaurant, but the variety is great. I suggest getting together a group of friends and coming for the chef's choice.  You won't be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Ordered to have their duck meat loaf dish delivered. The portion was small, but worst of all, the meat loaf was badly over-salted.

Blue margarita is the way to go & if you even think about ordering a coors light in this bar then you aren't in the right place! AMAZING selection of beer. I've tried well over 100 different kinds of beer (yes you read that correctly!) I'm an IPA fan so I only stick to those now when I go.

"The ultimate sensual experience. I have been going to Bouley for a decade now, and the chef's recent decision to focus on the main restaurant and close the others in Tribeca has paid off. Bouley has improved and innovated, and the service is better than ever -- unobtrusive, intelligent. The decor plays delightfully --  something of Morocco, paintings opening onto Provence landscapes -- bringing a deep relaxation in which you taste a succession of almost dreamlike dishes. The contrasts of citrus risotto and Japanese sardines, the Russian caviar on the oysters, the fallow venison with micro-Brussels sprouts and rutabaga puree, the caramelized pear -- everything inventive, new, perfect. The bill is reasonable compared with a flight to the Mediterranean (and no jet lag!).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I had dinner at Alice's Arbor a few nights ago and absolutely loved it! The atmosphere  in the restaurant was cosy and laid-back. Everything in it seems to be made from recycled materials, with old industrial tables and a lot of weathered wood. Really beautiful! The food was excellent: we had a delicious salad made with different types of green beans and superb roasted asparagus with goat cheese to start. As a main dish we had the steak frites and the trout, which were both good. The cheese cake for dessert was one of the best I've ever had. Creamy and light at the same time, and not too sweet. While the waitstaff was indeed a tad slow, they were super friendly and knowledgable, and we actually didn't mind eating at a leisurely pace for once. And if you just need some provisions for a picnic, there's also an old-fashioned type of store area where you can buy local produce and take-out food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This place was exceptional. I always base my reviews in the following: Atmosphere Service & People Quality of food Atmosphere: The restaurant had an awkward layout. The lighting was very dim and as soon as you walk in, you see the sushi bar. The habachi seating was in the center of the restaurant all the way in the back there were tables for the customers ordering from the regular menu. If I had to guess, the previous use of the space was for a bar. Service & People: the restaurant was not busy. There must have been only 10 customers while we were there and two servers. It took the server about 10 minutes to approach and ask us for drinks. Then it took another 10-15 minutes for the waitress to take our order; meaning it took 20-25 min to have our order taken after we were seated. I wonder how they would have handled us if the place was busy?!?!? Food: So they have three menus: A la carte menu, all you can eat sushi menu and habachi menu. We ordered from the all you can eat menu. The appetizers were a bit disappointing but the sushi was amazing. It was very tasty. Their spicy tuna and spicy salmon were spicier than most places I've tried. There was either jalapeño mixed in or the spicy mayo was extra hotttt! Overall the food was good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"You can't pick your family....so don't go judging this place by the other Handy's you know.   While every experience I've ever had with Handy's towing, or gas station, or otherwise has been less than pleasant, I left Handy's Lunch today full and will a smile on my face. I saw old friends, met nice people, and was greeted and served with class.  The owner was onsite and he was friendly and helpful, and everyone there seemed to be seeing old friends.  It felt like Cheers, but with food instead of beer and no fat dude or mailman to laugh at. For lunch I had a roast beef sandwich with tatertots on the side.  They suggested a house sauce to go with it and it was perfect.  The sandwich was a good size and with a soda and side it was $11...pretty good deal. I went because I stumbled upon a yelp coupon...but I would definitely go back for a nice, low key delicious lunch. Thanks for the experience, it's clear why you've been in business since 1945! Oh...they even gave me a free cookie for checking in on Yelp.  :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Friday Saturday Sunday has a nice old-fashioned home-like feel.  It is small, the lighting is quite low for dinner, and a neon billboard showcases the daily specials and desserts.   We came here on a Friday for Restaurant Week.  I tried: Cream of Mushroom Soup  - 4 stars - mushrooms, chicken broth, cognac & cream - perfect for the cold night - (yelp.com/biz_photos/frid…) Horseradish-Panko Crusted Tilapia with cilantro-lime beurre blanc - 3 stars - this dish was good but not spectacular - (yelp.com/biz_photos/frid…) Dessert - fruit tart - 4.5 stars. (yelp.com/biz_photos/frid…)   Dessert was unexpectedly the highlight here.  Some of the other choices (cheesecake, banana pudding, are also quite good). The service was generally attentive.  However, when I asked for hot water the waiter seemed quite disappointed and was kind of rude.  ""That's it?!? You only want HOT water?""  Given the temperature outside, I didn't feel that the request was unreasonable, although he probably would have preferred that I ordered a beverage (tea) so he could have charged for it.  Overall, the cost was ~$45 / person for Restaurant Week after tax and tip.  They definitely make an effort with the food and service here, but the soup and main course seemed more like items one could whip up at home, and not quite up to par with other Restaurant Week restaurants.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"On the banks of the river ... is the best pizza I have ever eaten, period.  Its as much about the crust as it is about the balanced accompaniments.  A thin but delicate crust with rewarding texture and flavor that offer meaningful contributions to the topping interplay (rather than delivering toppings in an after-thought, unremarkable, edible vessel). The perfect meal so far ... - VASI - Ceci Beans and Lentis (tomato scapece, grana padano) - ANTIPASTI - Aggrodolce Pork Ribs (green apple, pistachio) - LE PIZZE - Spicy Ham (coppa piccante, san marzano tomato) - DOLCI - Zeppole (blackberry yogurt, lemon curd) Honorable mentions and amazing seconds if you can manage ... - VASI - Cannelini Bean Aioli (smoked pepper, arugula, sicilian tuna) - ANTIPASTI - Carciofi Fritti (fried artichokes, lemon yogurt) - LE PIZZE - Quattro Formaggi (ricotta, scamorza, marinated tomato) - DOLCI - Cannoli (pistachio, lemon-ricotta, chocolate-olive oil).","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I found this place through word of mouth.  The fact that they have pinball machines peaked my interests.  I went with my wife and my 5 and 7 year old.  It's kind of a bar scene with an arcade feel.  They had few tables which were all high tops but and friendly atmosphere.  We arrived at 3 when they open but the kitchen doesn't open until 4.  So we waited and used the time to play some games.  My kids were in heaven.  I walked over to the pinball machines and the only had three, which was slightly disappointing.  At least they were top end machines.  I played the ACDC machine and had a blast.  45 minutes just melted away.  I even got some triple ball bonuses and a free game, I was back in the 80's!  The service was great and the menu is made up of fresh local ingredients.  My burger was well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Fries were good as well although they seem to be a frozen product, but cooked properly and seasoned nicely.  My kids did not eat all their food but the games trumped food on this occasion for them.  My wife ate her chicken sandwich and said it was yummy.  All in all it was a good experience.  I'll be back.","[0.0, 1.0]"

I went on a random Saturday and they were having a pirate themed night. Drinks averaged $9. I had a specialty pirate rum drink and 2 ginger ales and tequila.

"Would I wait for one hour to eat this pizza again? Maybe. Yes it is better than most pizza places I have been in. The waiting is not what bothers me, what bothers me is how they decide to seat people. He skips around and he was seating groups of people based on the nummber of people in their party. I was with a friend, but somehow 8 other groups of 3 or more who were all behind us in line were seated before us. It is a testament to the pizza they serve that despite the wait, and the weird door man, that I actually consider coming back to this place. What makes their pizza special? It's the crust. It had a distinct flavor that  I can only attribute to their oven. The toppings or the sauce were not especially memorable, but the crust is sublime. One tip, do not put roasted peppers, somehow their roasted peppers were too watery and it made the pizza soggy. Oh another tip, bring your cutest girl friend to come along, and ask her to wear next to nothing, that seemed to help shorten the wait for a table.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I enjoyed my visit before seeing a show and glad I made a reservation through Yelp before going since I was on a tight schedule. I was seated almost right away even though I was about 10 minutes late. Not only was the restaurant packed, but the bar and waiting area were filled as well and barely found a seat to wait until our table was called. The wait staff was so-so. Took a long time to order but once I did, everything arrived as expected.  The poor patrons seated next to our section waited at least 20-25 minutes before they got water or menus.  It made me feel uncomfortable because I couldn't really enjoy my meal sitting so close to those poor souls and I felt like waving down the wait staff for them.  I'm not sure what was up except for maybe disorganization of the wait staff. At least they were offered a free app for their trouble. Bottomless pasta  (choice of ravioli, pesto penne, spaghetti) after a long day of traveling was great but I should have passed on the Caesar salad starter. My daughter's antipasto appetizer was a lot better and wish I hard ordered that instead. Enjoyed the ambiance somewhat but it is quite loud and a bit claustrophobic but I was warned by other Yelp reviews. I'm really glad they asked if I needed to get to a show before ordering, so I will say my order arrived just in time to enjoy it before rushing out the door. If I come again, I will do it on a non-weekend night and give myself more time to enjoy the experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Upstate is a small restaurant and they have a pretty good happy hour special of 6 oysters and a beer for $12.00.  This really draws in the crowds so expect it to be difficult to get a table during happy hour.  They have a number of specialty New York beers and the watermelon was amazing.  For my entree I ordered the boullabaisse and unfortunately I thought it was a bit bland.  Although it had the right flavor profile I was hoping for, you could tell it probably needed to reduce further to concentrate that seafood goodness.  It was a pretty healthy portion of fish, a scallop, one large shrimp, and the rest mostly comprising of mussels and clams.  Service was good and there was nothing inherently bad about my food.  It just seemed like it could use a little tweaking.  Overall a decent restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Great breakfast options like bagels/eggs/croissants/parfaits and a really nice looking oatmeal that's finished off with a blowtorch. Soups are warm and hearty for the cold winter months, and if you want an amazing snack for any time, make sure to get some warm pita and Renata's homemade Hummus or Baba-Ganouj.

"This was our first time at Anastasio;s. It was a little odd dining experience. It is a small very open dining room so it can be very loud. Right off the bat one of the most annoying things was having take out  customers dressed in their beach clothing sitting and standing near the hostess desk. Listening to complaining about how long of a wait (hour plus) they had for take out pick up. To make matters worse the food service was slow, as a table near us was complaining to us that they had been waiting an hour for their food! They were approached several times with the offer of free drinks and apologies. The take out customer received a free app but if she was correct she should have been offered more. The dining room was not busy at all so it was a little odd that the 5 or 6 take out orders could throw a kitchen off by that much? The other annoying and health code violation thing was the cabana boy from the beach club who came into the restaurant for an order with no shoes and beach sand all over his feet walking around the entry and restaurant. It was ignored by the staff. It was disgusting and is a health code violation for a reason! It is a very small restaurant so  to make it a more enjoyable experience for the sit down diners that are looking for some kind of ""dining experience"" the management should really have their  take out customers wait for their orders in the lobby where there's plenty of seating with the statues. :) So they're not gawking at you while you're trying to eat your expensive meal. And here's a hint for the manager, your wait station for napkin folding and doggy bags and such should have a partition around it so we don't have to watch this activity while we're trying to enjoy a night out . It was just a little ""campy"" like being in a Ponderosa Steak House Restaurant. Figure out who you are a campy place, casual, rustic chic, beachy convenient?  But, don't try to be a little bit  of everything it just doesn't work. As for the food it was pretty damn good! Steak was awesome tasty, tender and cooked to perfection. The calamari app was not my cup of tea... too thick like x large rubber bands and the ""special"" calamari with peppers was just sliced cherry peppers thrown around on it. Where was my garlic,  lemon white wine sauce to make it have some Rhode Island flavor?? My husband loved the bread though!

I was the first to arrive and as I waited for the rest of my guests I was asked if I wanted a beverage. I had called ahead and there was a nice table for 8 set up. However, I did notice that there were several walk-ins who were immediately accomodated around prime dining time (7:30 p.m.). I ordered the unagi maki (eel roll) and their special for the night, which was a lobster salad roll topped with walnut and almond crumbs. For appetizers, our table split their shrimp shumai which literally melted in your mouth. They were easily the most satisfying that I have ever had. My sushi was delicious, very fresh, and flavorful. Other members at my table had the sea bass, yuzu chicken, and beef teriyaki - all with positive reviews. The restaurant wasn't overwhelmingly loud so we were able to have decent conversation, but by no means was the restaurant empty. I would recommend this as a place for lovers of japanese cuisine - sushi fiends or otherwise.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm going to be honest, compared to ramen I've had in LA and OC, I have to say I was really disappointed with Ippudo. I ordered the classic ramen and it was pretty good. I think this ramen is extremely hyped up and considering the 2 hour wait time and $15 price tag, I was expecting magic. Instead, I got ""just good"" ramen and a very small portion. I was disappointed despite the fact that on its own, it is still pretty good ramen.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I met the co-owner and chef at a foodie event in NYC. Of course the preparations would be wonderful in that venue; I wanted to check out the real deal. So off I go to Zahav for lunch. Everything about our meal was delightful from the opening hummus appetizer. Then... beets and eggplant and peppers, OH MY! Delectable fried cauliflower, and folks, I don't even LIKE cauliflower. The beef with pistachios was a flavor combination I couldn't have imagined, but really enjoyed. Last, but certainly not least, the award for the best description of a featured dessert goes to the young waiter who served us that day. I was practically drooling by the time he finished the description of the baklava with chocolate mousse and sour cherry drizzle. I was in heaven as I ate every single bite and drank Turkish coffee. I love the location, the decor, the food, and the staff. I found the pricing absolutely fair for the quality and quantity of food. I shall return to Zahav, again and again and again!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Tiny little gem of delight! No, they do not take reservations and I have waited 3 hours for a table but it is so worth it! When the wait gets long, we just give them our number and then head to a bar or come back after a nice stroll around the block. Really, there's a ton of bars around there so don't just stand there waiting. Start your drinks early! One thing I do admire about their no reservation policy is that they abide by it no matter who the guest is. Shrimp & grits - Amazing. Very tasty and you feel comforted and loved after a plate! Makes you want more but you have to hold yourself and resist. Jumbo lump crabmeat - Don't get this... This comes with a side a hardcore mustard which unfortunately becomes the best part of the dish. The crab doesn't have the fresh taste to it and whomever pulled the meat out of the shell didn't go a great job so you literally had to eat it with care since 99% you'd bite into little pieces of shell. Crispy braised pork hock - This is what I call badass! I've been here around 10 times and I always get this as an entree. Yes, I do want to try other plates but I can never get myself to cheat on the hock. I feel like they've changed the hock in recent months. It's become much smaller but yet tastier. Still, to me it's a tad on the bland side so I love spreading some of the hardcore mustard which I save from the crab over the meat. Try it, it's awesome! Escarole side dish is tasty but I can't wait till the brussel sprouts are in season again. I haven't had better than here! Hashbrown side dish is crunchy on the outside and soft and gueey on the inside. Spring stuffing - just get it... It's great! I'm a huge fan of Gabe's especially since he humbly works at the bar and takes care of everyone sitting around. I actually had no idea he was the owner until the end of the meal. I remember asking him about the pate and after he introduced it, I thought to myself ""wow, this bartender is well trained!"" Ooops!","[0.0, 1.0]"
Simply Perfect. Above Perfect. If there was something higher than perfect. First the lamb is the best I've ever had. Spiced well and just the right amount of fat. The chicken is also very good but I think its best paired with the slightly more spiced and fatty lamb. The rice is beautiful. The bread that soaks in the juices is so great you will be sad when its gone. The spicy sauce is crazy hot yet still mouth wateringly good. Be careful and start with a little. And the white sauce is the sauce to rule all others. You cant put enough white sauce. Heck take some home and put it on anything and it will taste great.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

It's just a down-home, no attitude, good time with straight-forward, dependably good food. update: not sure what the hell happened, maybe they were having a salt fight in the kitchen but the food certainly was not the winner.  Still trying to get my blood pressure to a normal range.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Between the 2 of us, everything we got was delicious and definitely worth coming back for.  Started with the roasted octopus, then on to the kale and wild mushroom paella (those crispy artichokes!  YUM!) and pork chop with polenta (*drool), and then got the side of crispy potatoes (brava!).  The plates were licked clean... haha.  Wish we had had room for dessert...","[1.0, 0.0]"

From sweet to salty to creamy to fluffy to crispy!  It was like a party for my taste buds!! I enjoyed all of them, but I felt like the red velvet didn't really tasted that red velvety or maybe it was too hyped up which led to my great expectations. Nonetheless it was a very delicious and fluffy stack of pancakes with chocolate chips! There was parking right outside the cafe, which was very convenient! The staff were nice and friendly.

You can put down your name and number and they will text you when your table is 5mins away. We ordered all East Coast oysters because the bf thought they would be fresher - but judging by the quality of this place, I bet everything would be super fresh. They give you a piece of paper with the list of oysters on them and you order them by writing how many of which oysters you want. They are in order of least mildest to most flavorful. The oysters were plump, fresh, and we could taste the difference as we made our way around our oyster platter. We also split a seafood bouillabaisse. Ugh, such a great decision. The broth was TDF and the mussels, clams, shrimp, fish, and scallops were big and flavorful. How is seafood SOOO good? I don't understand it!! They also have a great beer selection - perfect on a summer day. A gulp of beer and a slurp of oyster. What more can you ask for? Oh yeah, free whiskey cake!","[1.0, 0.0]"

I thought the dumplings had plenty of soup inside.  However, I thought the soup and meat filling were greasy and had too much fat.   The meat in the dumpling was also fatty enough and/or finely ground enough that I found the filling mushy.  I would prefer a thinner broth with a leaner meat filling. I came at 11AM which is right around opening time on a Saturday.   There was no wait at the time, but the place quickly filled up after and there is table sharing.","[1.0, 0.0]"

There were only two guys running the place and they seemed a bit busy, so I'm glad it was a buffet where we could help ourselves. I liked just about everything on the buffet. The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala were joined by a lot of other great dishes, so it was worth it. They brought fresh naan to the table, too. My husband said it looks like an Indian diner with the booths and the location isn't the most fortunate (squeezed between an automotive repair place and a hole-in-the-wall take-out Chinese place) but the food was good enough to overlook the lack of ambiance.

"SUMMARY: The wife and I had a lovely dinner at Baker & Co. last night. It was delicious and the service was good. We look forward to a long brunch (once they launch it) on the patio in the summertime. We plan to go back to Baker & Co for sure. FOOD: Very, very good. We both cleaned our plates. I had the Burrata with roasted artichokes ($12) followed by the Paccheri pasta with lamb ragu, olives and mint ($17). The pasta was delicious and perfectly cooked. The mint added a very interesting dimension to the dish that really worked for me. The only hiccup was that the burrata was served cold. It's typically meant to be served at room temperature. My wife had the grilled squid with smoked paprika, capers and rosemary ($13) followed by the pappardelle with veal cheek ragu, fava beans and Grana Padano ($19). She very much liked both of her dishes. I'm not a huge squid guy in general so no comment there but her pappardelle was excellent. We selected the Friulano (Tocai) at $38 which was very good. SERVICE: Good, but there were definitely a few ""we've only been open a week"" kinks that we noticed (two bus boys stood next to our table and chit chatted for like ten minutes in the middle of our meal. It disturbed us, what can I say?). On the whole, however, our waitress was attentive, helpful and in no way overbearing (we took our time and never felt in any way rushed). The manager, Marcus, was very involved and I suspect that these kinks will go away. DECOR: Rustic, cozy, dark, comfortable. All good.=","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A few of my coworkers had heard excellent things about Cuban Pete's and after doing a fair amount of research online as well as calling the establishment, my office decided to conduct our annual holiday dinner party (for about 20-25 people) at Cuban Pete's to appalling results. Firstly, we contacted Cuban Pete's a couple of weeks before the date of our party in order to make reservations for our party. However, we were told firmly that the restaurant has a strict ""no reservation policy."" Fair enough.  We then asked if we could arrive at around 6:30-7:00 and we were told that the wait time would be about 3 hours for 24 people. We then followed up by inquiring if we could be seated at around 5:00 pm before the dinner rush began. We were SPECIFICALLY told we could do so and while the restaurant couldn't guarantee us reservations, as long as arrived before the dinner rush (around 5:00) we would be accommodated. Fast forward to December 8th, members of our party arrive at Cuban Pete's around 4:45- 5:00pm and were flatly refused any kind of seating inspite of the fact that there were 2 large tables in plain sight completely free and set up with plates and napkins. We asked the hostess as well as the manager for a reason and were also refused any kind of reason for why they were refusing us any seating.  At this point, most of our party (including children) have arrived at the restaurant and are waiting so we asked them if they'd be willing to seat us as we come in (in groups of 4-5). Again, we were refused without any reasoning and were told that we'd be waiting for hours for any kind of seating.  At this point, there were two tables of 12 completely unoccupied. We sought out Cuban Pete's since a few people had recommended the place to us and people couldn't stop raving about their food. However, their customer service was nothing short of appalling and we will not be attending Cuban Pete's or recommending it to people from this point on.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Am I the only Irishmen who spends St Patrick's day drinking at a French restaurant? Maybe, but I would definitely do it again. The Parc sits on a street corner on Rittenhouse Square. Two sides of the restaurant open up onto the sidewalk and, in Parisian fashion, they have sidewalk seating which is the perfect place for having a drink and people watching. Inside the restaurant, they have done a great job creating an authentic Parisian feel to the place.  From the marble columns to the inlaid ceiling and tile floors, the architect got it all right. Decent selection of wine and beer.  The steak tartare and the mussels were both amazing.  Maybe the best steak tartare I've ever had.  I plan on going back and trying a number of different entrees and appetizers that were calling my name. I dropped a star off of my rating for the service.  Our waiter had no 'touch'.  Every time he came over, he was unable to stop himself from interrupting our conversation.  And, he must have stopped at our table, no exaggeration, 10-12 times during our meal.  Dude! our food is fine.  Stop bugging us.  That said, I have only been there once so it's likely that the service provided by our waiter was an anomaly.  May amend my rating next time.

Unfortunately for the other Harry's, their move from Farmington Ave to S. Main street in the center hasn't done them much good. The new space is awkward, noisy and kind of hard to find [next to Radio Shack]. I had a mediocre pizza there recently and though Bishop's Corner is another 5-7 minutes away, I think it's worth it.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Just walk in and be patient. Don't expect the servers to coddle you. Its noisy if you eat inside. Bring cash, of course. Now that you know, there is no need for you to visit, then come back and leave a bad review because the 'experience wasn't satisfactory.' The servers there are totally cool, but really busy most of the time. Despite this, they've always been patient with us. I never felt like an imposition. By Philly standards, they are downright pleasant. Most importantly, the food is really great. They have some creative options that I wouldn't think to, or want to, make at home. Everything tastes exactly as it should. Even the morning deal- $4 ham and eggs (with coffee or tea) hits the spot. Of course, not everything is a winner, but this place is consistent enough that we walk past Honey's to get here every time.","[0.0, 1.0]"

It was my friend time sitting in front of the sushi bar and man did it feel kind of awkward.. It was interesting seeing them make the sushi though.

"Yes, delicious Yes, long wait Yes, worth a try No, if you have been before, is it worth going out of your way or waiting in the cold until your fingers are numb and fall off? If you are in the area, the pizza was definitely satisfying with a Peroni beer. The pizza was very good, but I'm not sure how it compares to other pizza places. Not sure how it lives up to the hype, but it was good--just didn't live up to what I had imagined it to be while waiting in the freezing cold. This place gets packed so be prepared to sit in tight quarters","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food was great, light, and the recipes (some simple, some complex) were wonderfully executed with regards to taste and presentation. I'm a light eater, so ordering two appetizers (the hamachi crudo and a roasted beet salad) was perfectly filling; I definitely appreciate their portion sizing. It was a little loud, but mainly because the place was packed and everyone was in close proximity to everyone else. The atmosphere was fun and trendy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were able to make a reservation for (two) us 'day-of' on a holiday weekend (9:45pm). I did have to call, though, as they stop taking reservations on open-table at 4pm daily. Service is also very attentive and great; our waiter, Peter, made a great wine recommendation: Barbera d'Alba ""Vigna Clara"" (1995).","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Although the food was decent, the seating was cramped and uncomfortable, the service was poor with a condescending attitude and the intense heat emanating from the unshaded window made this dining experience awful! This restaurant epitomizes the mind-set of certain NY restaurants associated with showbiz personality chefs whereby they treat their clients as objects, rather than valued customers, and no matter how much money is spent on small portions of food, it is unappreciated. This is revealed in their lack of concern for the comfort of their patrons and in the general attitude of their servers and Maitre'D. Personally, if we were in the presence of a brilliant Neurosurgeon or Rocket scientist I may be in awe. However we are talking about a restaurant associated with a highly publicized chef, and in such a context, especially when the ambiance, seating (level of comfort) service and attitude is poor, and the food is merely decent but costly, I am not impressed whatsoever. I would recommend that others seek more pleasant dining experiences in more comfortable and respectful restaurants.","[0.0, 1.0]"

However, it took only one knife stroke to know that the chicken in my francaise was microwaived and quite salty. I finished up with a tortoni that tasted like it survived the ice age.

"Had really high expectations....it was not all that glorious. First of all, this place is packed. Everyone seems so smushed in this place. Tables are shared among other parties (if you're not a big party). I found ordering to be a little difficult because they speak little english. Ordered their juicy dumplings (pork and one with crab), pork dumpling, and scallion pancakes. The pancakes was the best thing. I heard many great things about their juicy dumpling, but it was just TOO greasy for my likings. Two of these will do for me. No more than that. Oh my gosh, and for the crab ones, I couldn't even eat it. I like crab, but it was pure seafood in my mouth. I felt like I had the ocean in my mouth. People ordered orange chicken and those other dishes....and that looked good. I think next time I'll skip the dumplings and go with dish items.","[1.0, 0.0]"

However, I have the fortune/misfortune of being from Texas, where the Mexican food is homemade (if you go to the right places) and phenomenal. It's really tough to beat. The chicken quesadilla isn't horrible. The smokiness in the chicken is pleasant. There isn't a whole lot of cheese, which isn't necessarily a bad trait.

"Can't go wrong with this place. If you're craving good Italian by Times Square. Here is where it's at. We ate here before we went to a musical and it was such a good choice.

He was always there making sure we were ok and was joking with us the whole time. He made it a great experience. The food was delicious. We started with a fried shrimp and calamari appetizer. It was perfectly cooked, very light and not chewy. We also got the ravioli and the stuffed chicken special that was stuffed with cheese asparagus and mushrooms over pasta. The dishes were filling and so good. Would definitely come here again. Try this place before heading over to Carmine's and waiting an hour to be seated.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My first time at El Camino Real was pretty nice, mostly because the margaritas got me pretty wasted face. I went with my boyfriend and another couple on a Saturday night and was surprised with how short the wait was. We ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas, chips, salsa, and guacamole as our first course. I have a pretty low tolerance to anything spicy but the chips were still addicting. As an appetizer, my boyfriend got The Chronic, I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, and the other couple shared a Smoked Chicken Quesadilla. My boyfriend's sandwich was incredible and the Mac N' Cheese definitely made it. My sandwich was fine, although it was a bit dry. I wish they added some more mayo or ranch dressing. The other couple loved their quesadilla. Before completing our entree's, we asked for another pitcher but asked for peach instead of strawberry. After a short deliberation, we confirmed that the second pitcher was also strawberry. That was a small mix-up but based on his overall attitude, it seemed a bit intentional. I guess it seemed easier for everyone involved to fill the pitcher with strawberry instead of dumping the remaining ice and getting a new, clean pitcher for the peach flavor. Whatever, I still got drunk and the strawberry was still good. I'd like to return and give this place another shot since people do seem to rave about it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I must say that my favorite is the Pistachio. My friend recommended the Rose, but I didn't like the aftertaste...I felt like it tasted too much like perfume, which is kinda the only thing I associate ""rose"" with...so take my opinion with a grain of salt. Nothing is horrible, but I definitely have favorites. Everyone likes different ones, so don't be afraid to try one of everything! They're totally worth it! Also, I'm sure it's been mentioned in one of the thousand reviews here, but these are french macarons, which are not to be confused with coconut macaroons.

"Not a native to Philly restaurant/nightlife but went to Spice 28 as recommended by a good friend. We went on a Monday night during Happy Hour. Spice 28 is conveniently located near the Market East train station and Macy's next to City Hall. The area, as I was told, is part of a gay community where a bunch of restaurants are owned by two older women. Spice 28 has outdoor seating which is nice on a not-so-hot-and-humid summer day. The interior design is a mix of modern asian meets urban chic. When I went they had two menus including a drink menu. We had a Long Island Iced Tea and a Watermelon Wheat Beer (so good!) and some entrees. I love spicy food so definitely recommend the Drunken Noodles and my friend suggests Pad Thai. The portions are reasonable and decently priced for central Philadelphia. As far as parking is concerned there are some parking lots nearby but its probably best to bike or take SEPTA.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My first impression of halal was that it looks like a burrito bowl. With the choice of lamb or chicken, this is thrown on top of a bed of rice and lettuce and piled with the white yogurt sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce was actually pretty spicy so unless you wanted a taste-bud shocking experience, tone it down on the hot sauce. The portion was actually pretty decent, enough to share between two and maybe get a small snack elsewhere. If this is your first time also, I highly recommend doing half chicken and lamb to get a taste of both and see which one you like more if you were ever to come back again. I wouldn't say this is better than the burrito bowls at Chipotle, but for being open super late and the convenient location, and also cheap price of course, I can understand why the line always wraps around the block.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Please do not patronize this awful ""establishment"". We went to pats afterwards, though it costs fifty cents more, I suggest u do the same, the bread is softer and the meat actually has flavor.

"This is one of only a few restaurants I have repeated over the last two years, partly because it's down the street from my boyfriend's apartment, but mostly because their pancakes are unbelievable. If you go there and do not order pancakes or eat any biscuits, then you are missing out on what makes this place great and the sole reason I'm giving it 4 stars.  The rest of the brunch food is good, but not particularly groundbreaking.  Clinton St is the type of place you go when you want the most buttery, decadent, filling breakfast you could possibly find.  I can't finish an entire order of pancakes. The brunch lines are absolutely insane, so I would recommend trying breakfast for dinner, and come on a weeknight just to try the pancakes.  The fish tacos are very good for dinner as well, and I like the shrimp quesadilla appetizer (which is big enough to be an entree).  I've also had their black and white and carrot cake, but they pale in comparison to the pancakes.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Oh my gahhh so delicious. And so much food. I think this a tie with Sabrina's for best brunch in Philly that I've had so far. I came here on a sunday morning with two friends. We called to get an idea of the wait, and we were told 15 minutes but it ended up being more like 30-40. When you get there, make sure to just write your name on the clipboard because there is no hostess. I rarely say this but that long wait was really worth it. I got an italian frittata special and there was SO much food on my plate (monstrous frittata, huge biscuit, homefries, and cinnamon apples) that I literally ate it for two meals afterward. They also have homemade jam and ketchup which are amazing. The servers were nice enough, but obviously super busy with all the business they get at a popular brunch time. The only other downside is that like most small joints in Philly, it's cash only.  I will definitely be back!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The $13 Farmhouse burger just jumped to $17, what the heck!? I will never go back to this place with price jumps like this. IMO, This establishment is not out for the good of promoting local food if common working and middle class folk can't afford to enjoy a meal here.  The are turning the local food movement into a rich folk only scheme.  Go elsewhere if you want to support local food, there are better options then this place.  I literally felt sick to my stomach looking at this menu last weekend after waiting over an hour to be seated.  We left after seeing the price hikes.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My girlfriend and I have been to Park Central 3 times now and are big fans.   We have sat at the bar twice and have decided that is our favorite atmosphere in the restaurant. I usually judge a bar by whether a place can make a manhattan correctly and this was probably the best I've had in quite some time (also stirred and double strained - not shaken!!). My girlfriend had a drink that I think was called salt and smoke. It was a combo of mezcal, pisco, cucumbers, fresh lemon, and salt - don't quote me on exact ingredients. The drink was phenomenal and all of the cocktails on the list looked very innovative and had a great focus on seasonal ingredients. The draft beer list was refreshing, and you could tell that they spend a good deal of time selecting the choices as nothing was mainstream, but there were good local alternatives. I like to try new things and this is a great place to do that. The only problem seems to be that the majority of the crowd didn't feel the same and was content drinking bud bottles. Changing the local crowd is very hard to do, but I do not think this place is going to hit it's full potential if they cannot get their regulars to try the 'brand' they're going for. To move onto the food some of our favorites after our 3 visits have been: oysters on the shell - they had 2 different kinds to choose from and the bartenders were very familiar. The cucumber mignonette was something different and the oysters were certainly fresh. The fire islands were our favorite! Steak Burger with Jalapeno relish was smokey, savory, and juicy. Fried Chicken was ridiculous and had some kind of truffle honey on it that was addicting. Truffle oil can be overpowering when used in the wrong place but the balance with the sweetness of the honey was just stupid! yum! We have also enjoyed an asian inspired special with udon and a kung pow duck confit leg, which showed just how versatile their chef is. Besides the drinks and food the live music on Saturday nights is great and the service is very homey and warm. There was some acoustic band that was there a few weeks ago playing some americana, blues that made the night. I don't see why Park Central is rated so low on yelp. Maybe the restaurant doesn't quite fit the neighborhood? We go out at least once a week and Park Central is now in our top 3 list of restaurants in New Haven area. Thanks and cya soon!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"With some colleagues in town from Yelp's San Francisco and New York offices, I knew I wanted to impress with my dinner selection. I rolled the dice with The Treemont, since I had never been, and it worked in my favor! We started at the bar with wine and cocktails. The complimentary popcorn is delicious! I could have happily munched on that all night long. But, we headed upstairs to our table and began our feast. To start, chickpea fritters, charred squid and squid ink gnudi. The fritters were light and fun, the squid worked really well with everything else on the plate, but the gnudi with brown butter and raisins were off. the. hook. I wouldn't think twice about ordering that dish again. And not sharing. My dining companions seemed very happy with their fluke entrees. I went with the strip steak and was surprised to receive two large hunks of beef instead of, well, sliced strips of steak. I would have preferred the latter. I really liked the barley and mushrooms on the plate, and the red wine sauce was nice. I thought this dish went well with the lemony crushed potatoes. While I didn't partake in the desserts, they went over well with our group. I'm interested to see the next version of the menu and I'd definitely like to return.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"3.5 stars! Cute and kind of Brooklyn hipster yet cozy little brunch spot in the middle of nowhere(or it appears to be according to NYC standards for middle of nowhere) for brunch in Philly. The bf and I yelped this place for breakfast and had no wait even though it was packed. It has kind of an artists studio look with exposed industrial touches. I would believe it if it used to be an old warehouse. I realized the tables were too close together that further emphasize how packed we were. You can hear conversations from both sides! But getting on the food. The menu looks great! Everything sounded so delicious. I was stuck between the mushroom frittata and the huevos. I chose the frittata, my bf got the breakfast burrito which he loves. We ordered a side of sausage and lemon ricotta pancake to try. Food took long to come out which is understandable for very busy morning brunch hour. They actually forgot our pancake until we nearly finished our meal, apologized and put it on the house which was a nice touch of them to do! Philly people are so nice! But unfortunately it was not memorable. It was light and fluffy in lemon flavor but ricotta to batter ratio was too low. The BF's burrito was good! But too little cheese! On the other hand I didn't realize my frittata had Italian bacon on it(which I don't eat) and instead of sending it back to be remade and starve, I gave it to my bf but still didn't feel as satisfied with it as I hoped to be. It was decent because I like eggs but I feel it was missing something. Maybe a variation in bite. The texture was a-okay, not too soggy but lacking in flavor. I would've made it with onions and fresh green bell peppers for a little more interest. (I make mean a frittata btw!) the home fries were absolutely delicious though! It was an Eagles game day and everyone and their moms had their Eagles pride on! It was funny seeing a whole lot of green that wasn't the Jets. I would most definitely consider hopping on a 2 hour bus ride from NY to come back to Philly just to try the rest of the menu.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Reaalllly impressive! Wish I knew how to say amazing in Portuguese to add some flair to this review but oh well!! We ordered a bunch of things as a group of four getting a little bit crazy for lunch out. I ordered a Panini, the vegetarian one off the lunch menu and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We also did the potatoes in chipotle sauce and yuca in garlic lemon sauce as sides and loved both.. Yuca was more impressive though! We also got scallops which was tasty and fresh! The waiter was also really friendly and asked us a few times if we needed anything so I found no problem with waitstaff. The ambience is a whole other story and loved the exposed brick (although also very common for the area). Their lattes were tasty as well. I didn't love the apple dessert I had and should have went with their tres leches since a few people raved about it! I wish there were more shrimp options (I believe there was maybe one off the specials menu)? For one entree, one special, four tapas, one side, and one panini from lunch menu, it came to $96. We then just added one dessert, Irish coffee for a friend, one latte and two espressos for $30. Not the cheapestttt lunch, but a good semi-splurge spot where you can trust the food will be tAsty! Anyways, I would love to come back and sit in their patio and eat more amazing jam-packed flavorful food! Great place!","[1.0, 0.0]"

(Tasty Pulled Noodles, Bennies in Miami and some stupid NJ diner that made Apple Pies. Yukkk) I'm not here for Guy today. I'm here because my kids want Chicken and Waffles. In 2007 my family & I went on a cruise out of LA and then went to Disneyland. Our hotel was a few blocks away from Roscoes Chicken. Yay! My boyz have been jonesin' for that chicken ever since. I hate when people come to NYC and say, the pizza here is OK but I like the pizza in ""X"" (X being Akron Ohio or Blueballs Pennsylvania) Shut your friggin hoser mouth! You're enjoying something regional, don't kick my NYC to the curb. You can eat your crappy food when your back in Iowa. I'm not gonna knock the folks from Pies 'N' Thighs. I don't think its a five star meal that's being shown on TV. Here's my BillySalts review: We walk in and its a cute, quaint restaurant. The smaller dining room was packed with Brooklyn hipsters, I thought we were going to wait. Our hostess says, ""walk this way"" and takes us to a really cool back room. Its all bricked and has barn doors. Here's the funny part. Back in the day? THIS WAS A GARAGE! Imagine the original owners thinking of having people eat in their smelly garage. hahaha! I do like the surroundings but to have a ripped plastic tablecloth?? Uncool Pies, that's not right no matter how hipster your trying to be. So the waitress comes and we all say in unison: CHICKEN & WAFFLES! (I ordered a side of grits) The waitress comes back with some horrible coffee. Like the type at an old fashioned diner, sitting a glass pot on a warmer. Ugh. The comes back with our food pretty quickly. I'm not gonna do a Roscoes comparison. No! The plate after eating it didn't make me crave more. It didn't wake me up at night saying, remember those waffles? Remember? Mmmm.. Nope The waffles aren't savory. its like a buckwheat waffle, think of a belly bomb when you eat it. Lotsa stuff to just fill you up. To me it wasn't tasty. And the chicken? One small drumstick and One small thigh. Wah They had good specials listed and my Yelp BFF said the biscuits are the bomb. Pies 'N' Thighs is a local, hipster Brooklyn joint that people wait outside on long lines to get in here. Here's my report, use your judgment. Cheers!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The Meatball Shop has great food, with the meatballs as the main course. To say the least a very interesting assortment. My only grip is that it can be really busy and sometimes is over an hour wait. However, they take phone numbers and will call you when your table is ready. This gives you a great chance to go and have a drink somewhere in the Lower East Side. Lastly it can get really noisy, so if your looking for a date spot this is not it. The meatballs are well worth any issues you may have with the restaurant.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place is bad.  The waitresses are ditzes who try to sneak extra drinks on your tab if A: you're in a large group so you might not notice or B: you're in a small (seemingly inebriated) group so you might not notice.  I've been part of both at this place.  Don't F*** with my money.  You will NEVER see my business again.  The manager also seems like a jerk from the way he talks to people.   I'd rather spend my money in a place where the food might not be great, but the staff are friendly and honest.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Favorite, favorite, favorite! What's not to like about this place? From the start they welcome you with the tequila bar - with a spinning low rider bike, then you move on to your table which the entire restaurant has this look and feel of awesomeness! They had a large selection of food, but on every visit I keep to the same; corn, chicken fajitas (which the presentation alone is a reason to order) and blood orange margaritas. But your night can't be complete without taking your photo booth pictures!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been on a quest to try every pho place in the area, and especially given the fantastic Yelp reviews, this was on my list. First impression was that it's a very ""hole in the wall,"" family-owned kind of place. Finding parking at lunchtime on a Saturday was a nightmare, and the lot was almost too tiny to turn around in. We ended up parking across the street in the commuter lot. The menu is incredibly simple and is posted on the wall. (Certain items are only available on specific days.) I was a little turned off on the walk to our table because one of the restaurant employees was busy shredding a huge pile of raw meat at a table in plain sight of where we were seated (not wearing gloves or a hairnet, didn't seem incredibly sanitary, and I'm a vegetarian on top of all of that). But I've been to Chinatown restaurants plenty of times to know that appearances don't always represent how good the food is. The one type of pho they had on the wall-menu for Saturday was beef pho, and I asked if it could be made vegetarian (meat broth was fine with me as long as there wasn't chunks of meat in it). The waiter asked if I wanted extra vegetables, to which I agreed. When I got my non-beef pho, I realized ""extra vegetables"" actually meant three times the normal amount of onions. As someone who appreciates what onions do for flavor but is not a huge fan of them as a vegetable, I was really surprised that the waiter wouldn't have clarified what he meant. I didn't really complain but did my best to avoid eating most of them and added more of the complimentary bean sprouts than usual. But I have to say that the broth was delicious, and the portion sizes are very generous. Price-wise, I ended up paying a little over $7, which was fantastic and beat out every other place I've ever eaten pho. But I'm probably not going to return because of how plain my order ended up. I think this place could make their pho a lot healthier and please a lot of customers (for vegetarians and non-vegetarians like) by adding some broccoli, carrots, and snow peas like every other pho restaurant and realizing that ""extra vegetables"" doesn't mean copious amounts of onions.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The place is a nice addition to the neighborhood, and the food is good and reasonably priced. It's too bad that the service is so poor, or I would visit this place more often. Me and my dining companions as well as other people in the bar and restaurant were constantly trying to flag down wait staff on a recent night when the place was not that crowded. Be prepared to wait and don't come expecting good (or friendly) service. If you are in the neighborhood, beau mode and good king tavern are much better alternatives.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Glad I'm finally in the know about this underground Japanese izakaya/sake bar!   In the basement of a non-descript office building, you have to enter the building and go downstairs to find a lovely, Zen decor that I could say is Tokyo-like but I've never been to Japan. While they have a wide-ranging Japanese menu (no sushi though), I've just tried the sake (they've got a ton to choose from) and the dessert so far.  Liked the sake.  Had the green tea truffles and strawberry truffles - both were very good.  I'd compare them more to bon-bons than traditional truffles since it was ice cream inside instead of nuts/caramel/wafer/etc.  The chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream and raspberry syrup was fantastic.  As Japanese as apple pie - I know - but still really good. While this place doesn't appear to be a secret - on a Tuesday night it was full and had a number of Caucasians! - it still feels like a find and I dug the vibe.  5 stars...","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Absolutely amazing and worth every dollar.  This place is a must try and their signature dishes are phenomenal. First things first, arrive early, get a drink at the bar and ask for their homemade chips (on the house of course).  They are to die for.  We were seated on time and service from the waitstaff, busboys, sommelier, etc was excellent all night. For appetizers, we had the yellowtail crudo and the polenta.  The yellowtail was excellent but nothing compares to the polenta, which was out of this world.  I have never really been a fan of polenta but thats because I had never had any that tasted that good.  We followed the appetizers with the Spaghetti with tomato and basil, the squid ink tagliatelle, the duck foie gras ravioli and the rabbit cavatelli.  They were all excellent, with the duck being the most rich and the spaghetti and tagliatelle being the lighter, but very tasty, dishes.  Dessert was also amazing. We had the sommelier pick out a wonderful white wine for us, one of the best we've ever had.  Overall, this place is spectacular and I would recommend it to anyone who loves pasta.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Like other posters mention, the exterior doesn't match Ola's interior at all, it's much nicer inside than I thought. And wow, very high quality, fresh food. They know how to cook fish. Our entrees were the sea bass special in an orange sauce with hearts of palm and salmon with quinoa and mushrooms. Both fishes were juicy and delicious, all the flavor coming through. Big fan of the roll they serve with yummy Romesco. Also had steamed clams with chorizo, cooked perfectly as well. In addition, both the Margaritas and Mojitos did not disappoint.

"Decided to try out Almond tonight while in town for work because it was a nice walk from my hotel.   The interior is cute and rustic, however a tad loud as the dinner crowd gets settled in.   In fact, a server a few tables away was almost yelling at the diners so they could hear her. I ordered the ""Le Grand"" Mac and Cheese and was completely disappointed!  There was absolutely nothing creamy nor tasty about this meal.  I have had 'high end' mac and cheese before and this did not come anywhere close to others.  There was more cheese on top than there was mixed in with the pasta.  The cheese was incredibly greasy and slid right off the pasta...  in fact there was a small puddle of grease at the bottom of the dish (gross!).  I could only stomach 10 bites at most and gave up.  I am just thankful I ordered a field greens salad as that was my only meal.  The server checked in on me one time... before I even took a bite of the mac and cheese, so I never had a chance to say much about it.  Check please, I will go elsewhere for dessert. With the multitude of dining choices in NY, there will be no return visit from this gal.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Six stars! Love Cafe Chismosa, a great neighborhood spot that should be a draw in its own right. Came here when Honey's Sit n Eat and Cafe La Maude had hour plus waits. Was so pleasantly surprised and I should have come here in the first place. Things to note: 1. They have at least six house-made salsas that are original, creative, surprising, and amazing. The pepita salsa that I had on my last visit was orgasmic! These salsas are also available for purchase so that you can bring them home and incorporate them into your daily life. 2. Coconut lattes are a revelation. I can't believe I have lived this long without knowing the joy that is Coconut lattes from Cafe Chismosa. Cafe Chismosa has a lunch and dinner menu, but it seems to do a brisk breakfast business selling food and coffee drinks. 3. The menu is inspired and inspiring. The chefs here are amazing and have concocted an array of tacos, bowls, and other latin-influenced foods. There is a strong presence of avocados and beans, which are obviously my favorites. 4. The restaurant is BYO. With its reasonable prices and BYO status you can have an excellent meal and a great time for cheap! 5. They did not mind splitting checks for my group of five.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Perhaps I should preface this review with the confession that I DESPISE Indian food. I was pushed into Masala Grill against my will (I believe that's illegal in 48 states), but begrudgingly agreed to give it a shot (mainly due to the sworn promise of HaloPub for dessert). To be frank, the decor left much to be desired. The sad attempt at ""romantic lighting"" was an epic fail, and seating next to the windows was met with constant molestation from the shutters. When I ate here, the place was relatively empty (which is fine). However, I did get annoyed when we were seated on the table CLOSEST to the kitchen, whilst all the other 10 tables were free and clear. Maybe they wanted to see my beautiful face. I'll definitely agree with past reviewers on Masala Grill's service. Our waiter wasn't the jolliest guy I've seen. He didn't crack a smile once and seemed inconvenienced whenever we asked him something. Maybe he was having a bad night? We started off with the appetizer sampler; a conglomeration of all sorts of fried items (aloo tikka, samosas, chicken/veggie pakoras, onion/spinach bhaiji). PASS. Save yourself a coronary and pass on this. $15 couldn't justify a pound of fried batter and a measly helping of veggies. Buuuut, my boyfriend did enjoy the samosa (the consistency, the flavor and flaky crust). . . . To each his own. Then for the entrees! As the waiter brought us our food sans a smile, I noticed that the portions looked awfully small. The food was served in authentic Indian-style dishware. Small dishware. I ordered makhani chicken (butter chicken, medium spicy category) and was suprrrrriiiiiiissssssingggllyy impressed! The chicken was tender, juicy and cooked in a peculiar thick, buttery, garlicky sauce. I'd give my entree alone 5 stars (maybe it was because I truly expected the worst). My boyfriend ordered the lamb vindaloo (american-spicy on the Masala Grill spiciness Richter scale), and enjoyed it. He found the lamb a tad too spicy and overcooked, but he did commend its unique flavor and freshness. The naan was great; you could tell that they made it fresh. The rice wasn't anything special - plain white basmati rice with fennel seeds - meh. We ordered Ras Malai for dessert, and I was thoroughly disappointed when the waiter handed us what appeared to be two small previously-frozen imposters of Ras Malai. The texture was grainy and hard; two thumbs down. Overall, my experience at Masala Grill was suprisingly not pitiful, but certainly not the best. Granted it's in Princeton, but Masala Grill's prices are ....pricey. I'd have to compromise a lot just to go back for their butter chicken.

"The Clinton St. Baking Company is a nice little place to have breakfast.  It was really packed with no lines when I was there.  Luckily, I was alone so I was seated right away at the bar table.  In the background, nice 50's music was playing, I thought it gave a nice vibe and was brought back to another era.  I ordered the eggs benedict and the warm buttered apple cider.  The eggs benedict was a simple and tasty choice that will definitely fill you up when you are super hungry and want a big breakfast.  It wasn't the best eggs benedict I've ever had, but it's still pretty good if you're an eggs benedict fan.  I liked the warm buttered apple cider, it's good to drink on a cold and snowy  New York day.  The apple cider had a rich taste of butter mixed with a zing of apple cider and a touch of cinnamon, a delightful mesh of flavors in a big mug.   Everything sounded so good on the menu, I want to go back and try other dishes.  I could see myself eating here frequently.  BTW, remember to have cash with you because they don't accept debit/credit card payments.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ever since the change in management/staffing some time ago, this used-to-be-favorite of ours has gone downhill.  After a bad experience some weeks ago, we decided to give it another shot this morning.  We stopped in for coffee and a quick bite, but the service was anything but quick, and on top of that, it was rude.  When being served coffee, we asked if we could order and were told to wait a minute. No one ever returned to our table. Then we summoned our waitress, only to learn she had switched us off to the other waitress, who never came over and we had to summon her.  She finally arrived (there are only eight or so booths in the place and should be adequately handled by two waitresses).  We asked for toast and home fries, well done. She said the home fries could not be well done.  After years and years of going to Mo's, we had never been told this.  She indicated we could see the home fries on the grill for ourselves.  We asked if they could just cook them a bit longer and she said no.  Needless to say, we did not stay. Our last experience was also a very slow one.  I had ordered a swiss omelet done well.  It was anything but swiss and not done well.  I told the waitress that it was not swiss cheese in the omelet. Instead of offering to help, she told me ""yes it was.""  I found this to be rude by someone in the service industry. I think this was our last experience at Mo's, which is sadly the end of an era.  Too bad there was a change in management or staffing.

To top it all off, it is being marketed as a higher end Juniors, but while I sat there wondering why I was paying $15 for half of a normal Juniors portion, wrestling was on the tv in the background.

(If you can ignore the blowhard with the toupee sitting next to you trying to act sophisticated while also trying to peel the crispy skin off his fish -- dude a hint: the crispy skin is THE POINT of the dish). For Apps, I had the warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart with some sundried tomato pesto to cut the richness. It was perfect and they did not skimp on the cheese.My partner had the Onion soup with TONS and TONS of Gruyere on top. He raved about it. For main courses, he had a grilled trout over a warm spinach, walnut and lentil salad (with prefect crispy skin on the trout). I i had the perfectly-cooked bar steak.with the most perfect frites ever.  (They are famous for a reason.) For dessert we shared a tarte tatin, which was fell executed, but might be the least interesting part of the meal. The food was, indeed, excellently done classic French food. And generous portions of everything. But the service: Amazing. Our waitress was friendly, efficient and helpful. She answered any questions in a non-condescending way, and when i asked for a glass of wine, knowing i was getting the steak, she said ""that's a little bit lighter"" and explained the other reds by the glass and steered me to one that i liked quite a bit.  That was when i was really impressed. Water was refilled constantly, more bread offered... the waitress and her team worked as  well-oiled machine so that i never really noticed them, but i never had to ask for anything either. The friendly ""have a great night, thanks for joining us"" from the doorman was the finishing touch on a great experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Like Axel Rose once sang, 'all you need is a little patience' (i've been on an big hair/power rock ballads kick lately)...that's what you need at Taim, but in boatloads during the weekends.  This hot little closet of a place is jumping, has only 4 crappy stools and a bench outside (what happens in winter?) and what looks like a galley kitchen to cook the most lovely falafels ever.   I was weaned on Mamoun's when I lived in NYC, so they are my falafel standard.  I love that there are 3 kinds of falafel and the pita is fresh and flavorful.  There were three of us and I made like a den mother/waitress as I took the two boys' orders, made them wait outside and went to elbow my way to the counter. Because of yelp (thank you), i knew they didn't take credit cards (hence the subtraction of a star; we're in new york, not nebraska!) so I had a fistful of cash ready.  Because of wonderful, in-the-know friends, I knew to order the strawberry-thai basil smoothie and the fries with saffron aioli sauce.

"No one knows pizza like me. My friends from back in the old Brooklyn neighborhood call me ""The Pizza Gourmand."" Artichoke Basille is the best pizza by the slice around. I like the more traditional margharita pizza, but the Artichoke/Spinach is incredible (my wife's absolute favorite). Unfortunately, I haven't tried their crab pizza because I am Kosher. However, it looks and smells amazing. Well, perfection just got even better. You must try their new Sicilian (square) pizza called ""Sicillian a la Vodka."" Wow--what a fabulous creation. Their traditional Sicillian is great, but this gourmet masterpiece is even better. The East 14th location is just like a real, old fashioned pizza place. Small, no tables and always crowded. You have to wait for a spot by the side counter just to stand and eat your little piece of heaven--but it's worth it. For a pizza orgasm, try this unique pizza joint.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"This was our second visit to the Bainbridge Street Barrel House, the first visit we liked it very much, the service was good and the food was excellent. Our second visit however was not even close to the first and has convinced us not to return again even though it is in our neighborhood. This second visit was all around horrible.....we were seated very quickly but then had to wait 20 minutes for a waiter to even approach us, many walked by without the slightest nod our way. When we did have a waiter come over he asked if we had been approached by a server yet. After informing him we had not he reluctantly said ""Well I guess I'll take your order"", well thanks alot!!! Due to the fact we waited 20 minutes to see a server we were ready to order, we ordered drinks and food to get everything moving.....moving was very slow and it took another 20 minutes to get our drinks (iced tea and a hot tea...really). We sat and sat and sat and sat while many tables that had been seated after us decided to leave due to no service. 25 minutes later after receiving our appetizer we thought it was going to improve...no luck! 15 more minutes until the food arrived after our waiter apologized and said he would have the manager come over. Meals arrived were finished check paid and no manager to be seen or heard of.     Overall the lack of attention by a manager and the very slow service in the dining area will cause us not to return again. With all of the other great restaurants in the city you need to set yourself apart and this set itself apart with it lack of service and poor management.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's one of those trendy spots that banks on its rep as a cool watering hole, especially in a smaller town like New Haven.  The food at Barcelona is fine enough and decent.  But the service is horrible.  The night my friends and I were there, there was one server for 10 or so tables.   Poor server was overworked with no backup from management or whoever that dude was who came over chewing his food in my face when I asked what was up with the slow service.  Management, sadly, doesnt care about the concern of customers.  Aside from the guy chewing in my face- very unprofessional- even worse was the manager I spoke with.  Do not patronize Barcelona.

"Amazing.  My only regret is that we didn't order more food.  Came here with a party of six on a Friday night and took our server's suggestion to order family-style and share.  Highlights for me were the peking duck buns and the short rib served with asian pear.  If you are a fan of short rib, seriously just order that for yourself and don't share it.  It was so tender and melts in your mouth and I just wanted it all for myself.  But I digress. Also, save room for dessert!  The dip-sum doughnuts are creative and delicious, and are served with gingered cream cheese, blackberry jam and chocolate sauce.  Great for sharing.

"had the arista sandwich at night market in chinatown this past summer.  the roast pork and slivers of crispy skin taste just like the juicy and flavorful filipino suckling pig that i'm more accustomed to eating on special occasions.  my filipino and philly world seemingly collide in this sandwich.  no apple stuffed in this little piggies mouth, just broccoli rabe.  my mind was blown.  consider my interest piqued enough to seek out their namesake sandwich -- the paesano.   unfortunately, part of the intrigue of most philly sandwich shops is that they're only open for lunch hours.  sort of unattainable unless you have the day off or live in the area.  (ie. dinic's, john's roast pork)  paesano's was playing hard to get.     anyways, the place is a divey sandwich shop in the italian market and looks like you probably imagined it would.  i order my sandwich and waited at the communal table sipping on fountain root beer when a thick philly italian accent announces my order.  i was 62% sure he was referring to me and gather my silver wrapped footlong paesano.  hard toasted seeded roll, tender beef brisket, fried eggs, roasted tomatoes, sharp provey, horseradish mayo, and banana peppers.  greasy, messy, and a strange combination of flavors that i would have never put together myself.  don't get me wrong, it's delicious but something i'd prefer to have after a really late night out rather than for a midday food coma.  i still prefer the arista personally, but honestly feel like i've earned some kind of philly merit badge by having finally had the paesano.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Bison Burger just gets smaller and smaller! Once upon a time, it was to die for, rave-worthy, and huge; not any more. The bun outsizes the burger, and it seems to have lost some of its wonderful gamey flavor. And what's the deal with a sweet bun? what about us who don't want sugar in every single thing that comes our way? I would love to see a whole grain offering for buns, and not a pretend-whole grain that's mostly white flour. Additionally, I have no luck conveying to the staff what black and blue really means; or, they don't believe me. Last time in, it was medium rare. In fact last time in, they couldn't seem to get anything right. From the no-ice water, to the sides, everything was coming out mixed up. I had an out of town guest, who wanted the bison burger, and his was done correctly, but the bread was not toasted as we had asked, so of course it fell apart, and just about everything else about our experience was so far from ideal that we ended up with the manager at our table making deep apologies, but it was too late to save the meal.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The ONLY reason to go here is because it claims to be the Birthplace of the American Hamburger.  People pack into it and it is often so overcrowded there is hardly room to lift your hamburger to your face.  And the burgers?  Historically accurate I guess is the best thing you could say.  Served on toasted white bread and served up with a dose of ""eat it and get out"" hospitality.  Unseasoned and undercooked, my burger was warm and bloody. Now dig this: You take your trash up to the counter to be disposed of...The Same Counter Where You Pick Up Your Order.  I guess this violation of basic restaurant sanitation is simply overlooked or perhaps folks are too busy soaking up the experience.  I'm glad I went, checked it off my list, and was equally glad to leave.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"As of late, I've been trying to avoid writing reviews on places that I've only been to once but I really just fell in love with Kanella. After a day of training for a new job, my new co-workers and I ventured into the city with a free bottle of wine and free bottle of cider in hopes of finding a nice BYO to imbibe. We were told Kanella could be hit-or-miss, but we decided to give it a try. Right off the bat, everything was great. It had just opened so we had no problem getting a table sans-reservation, and the hostess gave us a table that was right by a window, albeit next to the kitchen, that gave us a nice place to people-watch. The decor itself is lovely. The banquets are lined with loose pillows, everything is done in light colors and the big windows really complete the whole comfy, relaxed vibe. Our server (I'm totally blanking on the name) was really nice, funny,  and efficient, despite him coming off as a bit spacey. Now, the best part is obviously the food. We shared 4 appetizers and 2 desserts for our meal which definitely left us super full. The dips of the day that we got to try were a garlic-potato, which was pleasantly chunky, a creamy yet somewhat savory lentil spread (my FAVORITE omg), and traditional baba ghanouj. The pita that it was served with was warm and obviously right off the grill. The dolmathes were also great and had an interesting spin in that it was served with raisins, giving it a sweet aspect. I wish it had come with 3 pieces, as opposed to two, but that's just a minor complain. We also had a pastry that had feta cheese and spinach, topped with honey (they even gave that honey thing that is used traditionally...the wooden one? You know? I have no idea what it's called), and it was divine. Our final appetizer was the grilled calamari, which I found delightful for being a bit overdone. Fortunately for us, the chef felt the same way and gave it to us on the house without us even making a comment on it. Finally, the deserts were AWESOME. We got a trio of ice cream which included mint, cardamom, and jasmine. The jasmine wasn't my deal, but the mint was AWESOME. It tasted like actual mint, as opposed to something you would buy out of a carton from Acme. The small pastry tasting I felt was slightly over-priced, but then again they managed to make semolina cake really good so I guess I can't really complain. While Kanella isn't the best Greek/Mediterranean food in the city, it's definitely up there. The chef obviously cares about the product that goes out and the staff seems to genuinely enjoy working there. It's great for all occasions, from business lunches to romantic dates. I'll be returning, for sure :]","[1.0, 0.0]"

I would drink it by the gallon). The only miss I've had was the Cebiche Mixto. It was fishy like I was licking a wharf.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The victor in our cheesesteak crawl was either Tony Luke's (because of the bread and yummy meat) or Dalessandro's (because of the best tasting meat we had, and the beer)  The meat at Dalessandro's is hands down, the best in Philly. We had Pat's, Geno's, Tony Luke's and Dalessandros back to back to back to back. While Pat's and Geno's are ok, you realistically could skip them and not miss much. The only thing I could fault Dalessandros on was how I like my roll (I like a crustier one, which is why I may give a slight nod to Tony Luke's) But make no mistake, no place has better cheesesteak meat than Dalessandros. Then you add their kick ass beer selection on top of that, and the super friendly staff? It's not even that much of a competition.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I really like Miriam. The food goes from solid to sublime, depending on what you order, and is very reasonably priced. The service is attentive, although under trained (often don't know about wines and that sort of thing), but given the good natured attitude and the good food all that is forgivable. A good place for a good meal. The only time that is a bit chaotic is brunch, which seems to be the most out of control for the wait staff and host. People don't know where to stand and on more than one occasion I have left to find somewhere else to eat since I couldn't find someone to take my name for the cue.

"Because I am on a diet, these days I tried to eat healthier. Mr. Lee, the friendly owner, suggested the vegetarian cheese steak. It sounded healthy so I decided to order it. I was never a fan of vegetables, but, I did eat it from time to time to feel healthier. While I was waiting for my vegetarian cheese steak, I was able to talk to the owner and the employees who were very down to earth people. When my steak came out, it was steaming and colorful from all the different vegetables that it consisted of. Then I went to the counter to look for a sauce that met my taste requirements.(they had about 10 different sauces). I decided to put the sweet chilli sauce mixed with the spicy dijon sauce on my steak. Every single bite made me take another look at the steak because i was in disbelief that what I was eating were actually vegetables. Best of all, after I ate the steak, I felt good about myself eating something that was as healthy, cheap, and tasteful as Lee's deli's vegetarian cheese steak was. Then as I finished my steak, I saw the famous carrot cakes on the counter. I decided to eat it even though my stomach was stuffed. The Carrot cakes were perfect for topping off a great meal. I pity those who have not tried Lee's Deli's vegetarian cheese steak or their carrot cakes.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Absolutely my favorite pizza, anywhere, ever. I have been going to Jimmie's since 1980 and the quality and taste have been consistent, even through changes of ownership. (I've seen Jimmie back in the place on a few occasions over the years--he obviously approves!) My favorite is pepperoni, onions and peppers--what a combination. Crisp crust, not too thin--classic Greek pizza--the peppers are the pickled kind. Different taste from ""fresh,"" but oh so delicious. Just the right amount of cheese, too. Not too heavy...not too light. Perfect. (Even the plain cheese pizza is just great--because of the crust, and the cheese he uses. Sauce just the right taste.) And the pepperoni grinder! Haven't had one in a while. It's time! I've only seen it on the menu a few other places, but here, instead of making it with pizza sauce, they use fresh lettuce and tomato. A wonderful sandwich. I don't live in Hartford anymore, but whenever I am even passing through, I go! Honest. It is that good. Long live Jimmie's! (and Jimmie, too...what a great, friendly guy.)","[0.0, 1.0]"

After letting one of the waitresses know of the situation, she took a napkin and removed the aforementioned roach with a napkin right above our heads. The other waitress gave us our bill and kindly removed the drinks off our tab, leaving us with a slightly lower bill for our barely touched nausea-inducing food. (It really should have been proper courtesy to nix the bill altogether, but I guess not all food institutions have that sort of common sense.) Sure, the initial bites of our meal was good, but needless to say this place now...bugs me. Recommended if you are down for live creatures crawling alongside your lamb po'boy.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love this place because their chicken is so juicy and delicious. I always buy a whole chicken because I don't like pork fried rice. I would make my own fried rice or just simple steamed rice. I think that the chicken is so well seasoned, it's almost to a point where it tastes a bit salty although I love salty food. I'd like to know what kind of seasoning sauce or herbs they use to marinade their chickens because it's hard to cook chickens this moist and succulent. I love Korean fried chicken such as Bonchon or Kyochon as I grew up with it in Seoul, Korea but because I try to avoid eating fried food, this is my go-to option whenever I feel like having fried chicken. Pio Pio is good but this place just perfect for take out for yourself or a party. I feel so happy whenever I get my chicken here since I support a small business and my proud neighbor!  I can't wait to go back to treat myself.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Ok so Riverpark is beautiful. Before you even walk into the Alexandria Center to the restaurant you see a little herb garden that was set up for Riverpark, and Riverpark only. You think to yourself ""WOW I'm about to have a foodgasim"", then you walk into the contemporary lobby towards the restaurant and again you get excited. You then enter the restaurant and see the panoramic windows looking over the river (and, you're a New Yorker, so you don't even notice the FDR is there too) and AGAIN you get excited. Once you are seated and get to really look around and see all the fun elements of the place. The ceiling looks like you're sitting out doors under the stars the décor is elegant and modern, the waiters are engaging and attentive. Then you get the menu and it all goes down hill, it took so long to order because nothing sounded great, and it wasn't. I started with the Baby Octopus w/ Manila Clams, lime, cilantro and Chili oil that was in a strange tasting broth that not only made the octopus waterlogged it was very bland too, my friend had Avocado and Hamachi salad w/ pickled Red Onions, radish, and chilies, SO bland. We both moved on to pasta, again bland, where are the fresh herbs and flavor???? Now, I have to tell you about the Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/ Blood orange, hazelnut and tarragon, sounds delicious right?

Oh and the fresh strawberry juice, which was VERY FRESH. The fingers were good....that asian ish I can't remember the name of I definitely tore down. The wasabi was cool, I like spicy...wasabi is just a different type of spicy that I can't explain. All it does for me is clean out my sinuses, but no real flavor.

"Perfectly executed! I went here for my birthday and all my expectations were met. There is a beautiful patio area that is actually NOT on the sidewalk, but in a little garden area. It annoys me to no end when a restaurant's ""outside seating area"" is on the sidewalk so that diners have the pleasure of eating with cars, fumes, and random pedestrians. No, thank you! Inside, the decor retains the garden element which reminds of me a combination of Secret Garden/Alice in Wonderland/Anthropologie. The bar area is a perfect size for guests waiting for tables. The food and service were both excellent. I ordered the lobster tail and slow cooked pork. My friends ordered the grass fed beef + ribs and the duck. I tasted all the dishes and they were all excellent. This was not a meal you could re-create at home. We also ordered the squash blossoms, kid ravioli/totrellini, mushroom pate, and smoked sturgeon for apps and a cheese plate and the cookie sampler for dessert. Everything exceeded expectations.

This must be a gift sent from above for all the travails I have yet to endure.   Sancho, I am still waiting.

"Unacceptable service My wife and I went to the Spicy Green Bean in Glastonbury last Sunday morning for breakfast.  When we walked in we weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait.  There were no employees in the dining area so we walked to the back in the kitchen area and a waitress told us to seat ourselves and she would be right over.  It looked busy, but there were still tables available.  The waitress came over took our orders and served us some coffee.  This is where it all starts to go downhill. About 15 minutes later, the place filled up.  A table of 4 men came in, and 2 other couples filled the other 2 tables.   It seems that only 1 waitress was handling this whole room.  I did see an employee walk out the front door and across the street.  Another 15 minutes go by and we still didn't get our order.  I walked back to the kitchen where I saw some plates being prepared.  I thought they must be ours.  I was wrong.  The waitress brought that food for the table of 4 men and then brought out breakfast for one of the other couples. I called the waitress over to mention we were in the restaurant and ordered 20 minutes before these other 8 people came in.  The waitress informed me the kitchen ran out of eggs earlier and decided not to tell us.  That employee who walked out the front door was going out to buy some eggs.  I asked ""but how did that table of 4 men get their breakfast?""   The waitress said they are ""Friends of the owner and claimed they were in a hurry and the owner left, so.......I don't know what to say"". ""WHAAAAAT?"" They run out of eggs and have us sit there for almost 45 minutes without an explanation or apology.  On top of that they gave their ""friends"" priority service.  HOW RUDE!  They never even suggested making up for this in any way. We stood up and walked out and said we would never eat here again.  We would make sure all of our friends would know of this experience along with restaurant ratings sites on the web. We drove down the street to Ken's Corner restaurant and they were fantastic and sympathetic to our bad morning.  I heard patrons of that restaurant sharing similar stories of Spicy Green Bean's bad service.  Good to know I wasn't the only one.  After reading other bad reviews of Spicy Green Bean, I am surprised they are still in business.  It's only a matter of time when all this word of mouth will catch up with them.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I'm from Jersey. My girlfriend (who is from Texas) came to visit me and we took advantage of the Groupon for this restaurant. Definitely a great way to save some money and get to know the place. From the staff to the service to the quality of the food....I must say this is among the best dining experiences I've ever had. I usually avoid fancy places, but this place was fancy yet not pretentious at all. When you pull up to the boat upon which this restaurant was built, you see how amazing and majestic it is. Once you enter, it has a very cozy feel. The hostess was incredibly polite and although we showed 30 minutes before they could seat us, the staff was incredibly polite and courteous to us. Once we sat down, my girlfriend and I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and Amish Farm Raised Chicken. While we waited, our incredibly kind and sweet waitress brought us complimentary Focaccia bread with butter that was made with sea salt and fresh honey. They then presented us with a complimentary pair of garlic toasted crackers with Chicken liver mousse. It was so delicious...it's hard to believe they were complimentary! Once we got our orders, my girlfriend and I were amazed at the aesthetic presentation of our food. Once we took our first bite, it was clear that this was going to be a great night. The food was fresh and delicious. Our waitress was very kind and willing to help us with anything we needed. The food was so good that I was upset that the meal was over!

"I NEVER ACTUALLY ATE HERE. I bought a Groupon back in October 2013, I believe, for Piazza Margherita. I am only reminded to do this because I got an email from Groupon today regarding my request to be reimbursed. We went to find the place to redeem the Groupon and couldn't find it, call the number and it was out of service, then googled the address and it led us here. I walked in and presented the Groupon just to get some information as to what happened to the former business and if it were still redeemable here. I didn't just automatically assume it was. Boy, did they let me know how stupid I was. Again... I did NOT just walk in and say ""here's this coupon, give me all my stuff and shut up"" I just tried to get information. The young lady I was speaking with was treating me as if I were illiterate and couldn't understand that the name of the restaurant was ""Bella Roma"" and NOT ""Piazza Margherita."" Our conversation was overheard by a Vinny Bagadoughnuts aye-ohh type that then told me ""yea, it was Margherita, now it's Roma, we aint takin dat groupon."" 0 for 2. At one point I actually had to inform them that I was not by any means debating the name of the restaurant had changed, it got that bad. I mean, I've heard the food is awful anyway, hopefully those two have since been relieved of their customer service duties. It's was as if they were angry that someone who was a little confused just wanted to ask a question or two, like I was interrupting their busy day with my blatant stupidity.

"I haven't been to the original but I stopped in on a  busy Saturday lunch-hour; the place was packed and people were hawking tables. They have a good selection of hot/cold sandwiches, a soup, salad, even lasagna. There was a lamb sausage sandwich w/sundried tomatoes that sounded good, as well as a roast pork classic made with suckling pig. I had a Tuscan Tony - hot dog wrapped in proscutti, with a long hot and bolognese sauce...this was the Italian answer to the chili dog and worth the $5.  Cartoon of this dog is posted in the photos section. On another occasion I split the Daddy Wad, their version of a classic Italian hogie; served on a Sarcone's roll, it was OK...not as much veg/lettuce as I would've liked but the cheese was sharp and the meat was good quality. At $8, it wasn't really that great. If you're looking for some interesting hot sandwiches and you're not in the mood for Bebe's BBQ, then this is a reliable stop in the Italian Market.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is place is awesome for a lot of reasons. 1.  They serve late - i think till 2 AM, even on weeknights.   This is pretty near to my apt and I can say that its hard to find any place decent that will deliver past 10:30PM on a weeknight, much less a place that will seat you.  This place will do both. 2.  The food is creative, delicious, and well executed.    Even the cocktails are good.  Lapsang infused tequila in a glass rimmed in bacon crumbs!     3.  Everything is served tapas style, but the portions are not dainty little bites.   4 dishes will make a nice meal for two. 4. Prices are very reasonable for this level of food.  7-10 bucks a dish for most items. 5.  Bacon donuts for desert.   Bacon + Donuts.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Just received a signed thank you letter from Chef Michael Anthony. I'm impressed that it was personalized - the first paragraph referenced the feedback I left on the comment card. It's that extra step that always leaves a lasting impression. Love this place - wish I could give it 6 stars!,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"I had a private party in the Whiskey Room at Woodrow's.  The service and food were exceptional.  We ordered a bunch of finger food that was passed around and everything was delicious.  Very upscale of what you'd expect from a pub.  There were very accomodating to any requests as well. Also, the beer and whiskey selection is quite extensive.  Definitely a great place to hang out with friends or have a get together.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I visited about a week and a half ago on a Friday night with 4 other friends. We just happened to be walking by and peeked at the menu. A server who was walking in the door to start her shift invited us in, so we said why not. We went in just for a drink, so we were offered what I will call the ""bar table."" Kind of like the chef's table in the kitchen, but this was a small counter with 5 seats that basically constituted the bar. We all ordered different drinks, mine was the Sienna Palermo. It was a mix of charcoal infused vodka, Fernet, and some other lovely liquors. I must say it is my new favorite drink, borderline obsessed. We decided to order a few appetizers to share, which were equally amazing. Stylish décor, relaxed modern atmosphere. I haven't been there for a full meal yet, but after my first visit, I will definitely return!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Great place! Went for lunch... Staff were very friendly and knowledgable about the menu... The food was soo delicious it speaks for itself!  With the early opening & extensive breakfast food and drink options, as a nurse, I am definitely going to make this a new after work 7a spot :))","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I don't eat drink wine or eat cheese, so I basically had no business going to eat dinner at Tria, but I have to say that I was impressed. I ended up getting some sort of tuna salad sandwich that came with a salad and it was pretty yummy although they put entirely too much fish in there and I ended up scooping most of it out. The ambiance in there is so warm and inviting, and the wait staff was attentive. I got the bread pudding for dessert and it was divine. The price also wasn't crazy expensive. This is a great place to eat outside and people watch, too.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Ordered duck for a main but it was all bones and no meat.  It was so bad they offered us a replacement meal for free.  We ordered the steak and that was overcooked and chewy.  I actually left without eating a proper meal.  Service was great but that doesn't make up for terrible food.,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"the pancakes are perfect. but so is the brioche french toast with bananas and pecans. annnnddd don't forget the side of sugar cured bacon which is unlike any other bacon out there. divine. best to go with ""like-minded"" friends and eat family style so you can indulge in and sample as much goodness as the baking company offers. oh and if you have a wait (you will) - cafe peddlar across the way serves a very lovely cup of stumptown coffee.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It was the evening of Mothers Day. Eight of us were at the Wadsworth Atheneum and needed a nearby restaurant that was not filled with the mothers day crowd. Vivo fit the bill perfectly.  Located in the Marriott, it is an informal place (no tablecloths) . It is spacious and relatively quiet, and has windows looking out on the street, which is nice contrast with the more cavernous settings found elsewhere in this city.  If you go there ask to be served by Giancarlo.  He was lively and took excellent are of us, but only after he established a conversation and could tell us about his brother back in Italy, and the son he wants to put through college.  To get the best bargains in wine, go to the end of the list.  The steak was good, and for that matter, so were the hamburgers. However dont order Expresso because they dont have an expresso machine.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Guacamole is great! and their other establishment in the back also serves their appetizers,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"I went there on a week day rather early to avoid the wait. Everything I had to eat was on point. I love that it's a place that specializes in vegan and meat items. Seems like a great place to take a group where one person has a food allergy and the other person is an avid meat eater. You will leave stuffed and very happy. Service was pretty good too. If you're in park slope and craving a little Latin flavor, go here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Every dish that I ordered was fantastic. I recommend the garlic shrimp, albondigas, salt cod and any one of the cured meats and cheeses. The Spanish bleu cheese was out of this world. I had the blanco sangria and it was light crisp and refreshing on a day that was close to 100 degrees.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"My favorite brick oven pizza in NYC.  My fiancee and I go there whenever we're in the mood for pizza.  We LOVE the portobello pizza with caramelized onions. Absolutely delicious.  I wish the tables were a drop bigger, but it still works for a local neighborhood place.  Really great spot during the summer when the outdoor picnic tables are out.  I like their salads too.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The bread is delicious. I've also enjoyed the ribs. That said, two of my friends have gotten food poisoning from there. And most food is mediocre at best. I'd go elsewhere.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I like the vibe of this place and the beer selection is incredible. The servers are very knowledgeable about the humongous beer list too. I am not rating it higher because I wasn't super impressed by the food. BUT I didn't try any of the meat (had a salad and a ricotta cheese app) which is obviously their specialty.   One pet peeve... for a serious beer place, I find it annoying that they have Pabst Blue Ribbon and beers of a similar ilk on the menu too. I know they are trying to appeal to a hipster clientele which doesn't know good beer. But this is a ""Good Beer Place"" and should stand up against bad beer. Loved the outdoor garden space. Can't wait to go back and try more of the brews.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This bar isn't what it used to be when it first opened up.  They have raised their prices, and stopped doing buy backs.  I feel it's a bar too caught up trying hard to be something.  Its always jam packed with hipsters and you can never get a seat at the bar.  The food used to be amazing when PJ was back there in the kitchen running the show, now it seems it has fallen off a bit. This bar to me now is MAYBE a brunch spot, but forget about going on weekend night, unless you want to wait a half hour for a beer, and be looked at as a dollar sign instead of a person.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was dragged to come here with my boyfriend and his friends recently, and I honestly enjoy light beers so I wasn't too bummed when I walked in. Stating the obvious when I say they have a crazy selection, but the bar itself isn't really a place I would ever bring my girlfriends. First of all, I had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to even tell me what to do when I pick out a beer from the fridge. Seems a little unorganized since I drank my first beer out of the bottle, and then once I opened my second beer someone came and grabbed it out of my hand. How the hell was I supposed to know you can't drink from the bottle? When a cocktail waitress pointed out the owner I would have never guessed it was the owner, but realized it made sense why the place was so unorganized (in my opinion). He was enjoying beer after beer, and it was actually comical to my boyfriend and his friends saying that we could probably get free beers out of him if we told him the bar was great. Once I went over to him, thinking he would be super friendly being the owner, I could barely understand the words that came out of his mouth. There wasn't many people in the bar so maybe he got drunk on a slow night, but we were all very weirded out by the whole situation and how the bar was ran, especially since we are in the business as well. I don't think I would recommend this place other than for take out.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"4 Stars for takeout. I love the value this place provides. I eat here once a week and can fill myself with plenty of protein and relatively healthy options on the cheap. For under five dollars, I can almost fill a Styrofoam takeout container and it's a satisfying meal. I often get nervous with Chinese food because of the msg and the after feelings, but I can honestly say that I never find myself gasping for gallons of water and I always feel well after. Quick and friendly too!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I really enjoyed the ramen here.  The portions are generous and the broth is great - flavorful and not too salty.  I also really the complimentary lemon flavored water.  I would get the large... I got the small and kind of wish I had gotten the large!  As much as I want to give it 5 stars, that's (unfairly) reserved to this ramen place I had in the Japanese International airport. Nonetheless, it is one of the best ones I have had in Philly!","[1.0, 0.0]"
