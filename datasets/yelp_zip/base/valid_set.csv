"The food was great.  We had a the vanilla buttermilk waffles (toppings change daily) and french toast with caramelized bananas.  The atmosphere is wonderful too, but busy.  People are coming in and out to buy drinks and pastries like a normal coffee shop, and then there are the big crowds waiting outside.  On a holiday morning, we had to wait an hour and a half. But it's worth it in the end to have the experience and decide for yourself if you want to go back for seconds.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Idk, am I the only one who feels like it's just eh. I mean it's delicious, sure. And a fun experience, honestly. But then there's just so many better places I've been to. Sometimes it feels like the food isn't even cooked thorough enough. I mean that.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Food @ Dish Bar & Grill was awful - TWICE. Went to the downtown spot many months ago and my friend got sick. The manager sent out a gift card, so last night we decided to use it at the Canton location. I was brought a turkey burger that looked like it was half-cooked and tasted like no turkey I had ever eaten before. I sent it back and then ordered New England clam chowder instead. Question: Who puts MASHED POTATOES in a bowl of N.E. clam chowder?!?! Never again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"One of the BEST falafel sandwiches I have ever had, and for only $4!! It was warm and moist, and the pita bread was so soft and perfect. They served it with tahini, hummus, and lettuce (I asked for it without onions and tomatoes). The tahini made it so perfect.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Lombardi's is always on top of the list whenever i'm in NYC.   Lombardi's has a great history and is not significantly different in flavor or appearance than what you'd get in a decent NY style pizza. Their pies come out a relatively even golden brown, as opposed to charred and crackling.   My usual is their usual with pancetta, sausage and pepperoni.  I finally tried the clam pizza during my recent trip and it was on the money!  Only tip i'll add is don't share and get your own pie!  It's light, airy and really freaking good.  I've been known to knock out a couple of pies on my own.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Would not recommend this place, although the food is not terrible their customer service needs some help! Our order was incorrect and when we gave the waitress our credit card to pay for dinner she lost it then came back and said we never gave her a credit card. After several minutes of her looking for the credit card she claimed we never gave her we paid with another and immediately canceled the credit card that was lost, with the thought that she might have returned ours to the wrong customer. Upon arriving home my Husband gets a call that they found the credit card the waitress claimed we never gave her.  Of course now too late because we already canceled our credit card. The following day my Husband went to pick up the card and was not even so much apologized for his inconveniece. He asked that for his inconvenience perhaps they could give him a gift card, the Owner in a rude manner said she wasn't going to give him anything. POOR MANAGEMENT ,POOR HOSPITALITY, and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  My  Husband had to be inconvenieced without a credit card for 10 days and they so much could not even apologize or give him a gift card for a return visit.  I guess they don't value their customers! WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!!!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"To be honest, more like 2 1/2. The margarita pizza was disappointing. The crust was ok, but there are other places in NYC I feel have better. I can't imagine that the sauce I had was what they've been serving for decades in Manhattan. It tasted more like a pasty, canned sauce. The mozz/basil was good.   The service was good. The atmosphere is fun. The prices are consistent with other brick oven pizza places. But i'm really puzzled. Is this really the famous pizza or have things changed? I mean, some touristy places really deliver (ex. Katz's deli is loaded with tourists but the pastrami is the best in the city).  This one didn't do it for me.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"From the moment we arrived on a busy Saturday night, we could tell this wasn't the same airport restaurant that occupied this building for the last few decades! The dark intimate bar room along with the energy from the live band that had just started screamed fun for everyone! We were seated after a normal Saturday night wait, (25 minutes) and a great cosmopolitan from the bar and we were greeted promptly by several staff members including the person who would be our server for the night. We reviewed the many choices on the menu and noticed just how busy this place was around 9:30PM so we ordered our appetizers and entrees along with another round of drinks, then decided to walk around and check the place out! A beautiful upstairs dining room with views of the runways and parked airplanes, (great private party spece), seperated from the rest of the restaurant, two great dining rooms downstairs along with a bar room and what looked to be an outdoor patio bar that was packed!  I guess they renovated! By the time we returned to our table, our server had delivered our martinis, The Girl Scout Cookie and some sort of fresh berry martini that was the equivilent of all that is good in the world!  Our appetizers came out piping hot and the presentation was solid.  Arguably the best calamari I have ever had with cherry peppers and a light balsamic reduction!  My goodness! We ended up grabbing our server's ear for the next several minutes, asking a million questions and Mike was not only entertaining and professional but had tremendous knowledge of the menu, the restaurant renovations and the comprehensive calendar of events that this place had going on!  Bands during the weekend, karaoke, happy hour specials, etc.  Our entrees showed up as he was talking to us. Two of us had burgers that were the biggest I've seen in a while.  I couldn't even finish half of it!  My girlfriend had one of the many specials on the blackboard, a stuffed halibut I believe it was. We were so stuffed that we passed on the many dessert options that Mike offered but we sat back and enjoyed the band for about an hour after dinner with drinks and great conversation! I live relatively far from the Lincoln Park Airport but I have been in the restaurant business as a Pastry Chef for many years and this place is just fun!  Great food, fantastic service and the surroundings just make you feel like hanging out with friends and family!  I can't wait until the summertime when we can sit outside! There is no place like it around!  Go check it out!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"From the looks of some of these reviews, I've been lucky.  My food has always been wonderful, and my experience with the service has been great too.  I tend to sit in the bar and order small plates over their large entrees.  A typical experience would be to order a great bottle of wine, the truffle fries, asparagus and gnocchi for the table.  I really like Grant's a lot and go there often.  Also, I don't understand why someone would review a restaurant without trying the food as one of the earlier reviewers did.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I LOVE this place, so much better than other sushi buffet places (read: Sushi Palace)! They are so generous with their servings, especially with salmon and eel. Their soft-shell crab rolls are to die for. I also love how they serve green tea icecream and red bean icecream for dessert. The interior is very neat and clean, and their servers are smiley and nice. It's a great place for a dinner outing with friends & family, when you're craving for American-style all-you-can-eat sushi!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is coming from a jaded new yorker who just move back to the east village a couple months ago and has actually lived in Spain in the past (Barcelona).  It began with the black and white pinstriped awning and the pretty gold sign which I spotted from east 10th street and drew me closer and closer.  I am really stunned with how gorgeous this place is nestled near the corner deli I've know for years and some cool brownstones (that I should have bought into years ago) such as the charlie parker place and all directly across tompkins square park.  The place is a stunning slice of spain with every design detail (mosaic floors, antique maps, cool arched shelving) accounted for...  they had me at pinstriped awning.  It was an off time like 4pm but they were still open and i got a seat at the bar to really take this place in.  It was killing me that I couldn't remember what this space use to be, and then I was in disbelief when the bartender told me it use to be the old pet store with the giant green awning...  you had to know the pet store to even further appreciate what this space is now. Honestly, I would have been content with just a trader joe's caliber glass of wine and some bread and olive oil that visit due to the visual love affair I was having with the space...  didn't mention that I even discovered a small dining room in the middle of the space that has a sky light! where did this place come from?!  But hen i saw these crazy tortillas on display at the end of the bar.  they looked like tall cakes  so i didn't pay them too much attention at fist but when the bartender explained that they were double layered tortillas stuffed in between they took on a whole different dimension.  I got a slice of the veggie one, they also had a meat option with jamon, which had leeks and spinach in between (plus a couple other things that i can't recall at this time like a mild cheese).  The tortilla was really ""clean"", not greasy, and super tasty.  I couldn't get over the actual classic tortilla layers and how spot on they were.  I have to remind you that I've lived in Spain and really ate my way through much of that country and couldn't recall a better tortilla than the one I was having now (at the former pet store no less!).  At that point I saw this place had more to it then just looks...  I got the menu and with the assistance of the bartender, really knowledgeable guy by the way, I navigated through the long list of ""pintxos"" (basque style tapas) and chose several: Bonito (special tuna from spain) pulpo (octopus) baccaloa (salt cured cod) Each of these were served on a crostini of bread and classified as a ""montadito"" on the menu.  These are the reason I'm taking the time to actually write a review now b/c they were the best part of an already intriguing first visit.  the little guys were like art pieces when they were presented to me...  really exceptional 3 to 4 bite treats.  The taste profiles were even better. The bonito was a show stopper...  the quality of the tuna itself was like nothing i've had since Spain and the toppings draped over it including a spanish white anchovie and a roasted sweet piqillo pepper were awesome.  Then the octopus which the bartender told me was galicean.  It was very well put together as well and finished with aioli and pimenton...  really delicious...  wanted to order another of it after the first bite.  last was the Baccaloa which comes in the ""whipped"" style made with potato as well.  It had carmelized onlions and special sundried tomatoes over it...  this was one tasted so much lighter than it looked that I felt like stuffing my face in a bowl of it.  Again on the baccalao, I have had this style of salt cod many times in spain and portugal and often enjoyed it but rarely did i enjoy it and feel that I could eat and long for a ton more of it. So after a couple bites I was already making plans on bringing my most foodie friends to this spot to show off my new discovery and take ownership of this recommendation in my hood.  Will report back after a full scale meal at this spot with friends...  definitely eyeing the private room with the skylight for it.   Oh...  forgot to mention that this place has some serious wines from the motherland...  can't report too much on this aspect at the moment b/c just sampled one on this visit...  a great Txakoli on tap!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Do you like lemons? Do you like olives that look like grapes? Do you like food that tastes like citrus detergent? If so, this is your place. Franco & Luigi's was a pizzeria that I grew up around the corner from, and they made great pizza and Italian food. Now, it's a rip-off restaurant with great entertainment that serves crappy wedding food with bad service. The only redeeming quality these days is that it's a BYOB. It should be a BYOD (bring your own dressing) for the house salad. The garlic rolls were delicious and most likely store-bought. Both entree choices (fish and chicken) sounded delicious when the waiter described them, but turned out to be drenched in lemon sauce that overpowered the taste of the food. Both entrees also included a lemon slice, just to make sure you got that lemon taste. The waiter thought our French wine was Italian. A decent ricotta cannoli for dessert, also probably store-bought. The subpar food was totally overpriced ($152 for four people) and included a 20% tip that was added to the bill. The food is not Italian. Gordon Ramsey would shut this place down.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Let's face it, service only goes so far when it comes to tiny little eateries, especially when all you have is a tiny arsenal of tables and chairs enough to seat all the fans of the NY Jets put together (I jest of course). So being greeted as you are exiting your vehicle from their tiny parking lot in the rear really gives you a hint of what to expect after entering the establishment. Although it may have been coincidental that an employee happen to be outside as I was getting out of my car, I assure you the service at Kim's Sushi is top notch. Usually when ordering from a little sushi dive, I tend to be adventurous and order the items that I am new, and underexposed to. However, these people here at Kim's Sushi really reinvent the usual sushi fair that you see in all the sushi menus in the world have. Just like the Philadelphia Roll I ordered was very unexpectedly made different; an innovative reinvention. Salmon was rolled on top of the roll and drizzled with delicious mayo which is then placed in a little foil cot where it is was then torched, searing the salmon just briefly and caramelizing the delicious mayonnaise, all before a healthy dose of savory, yet decadent Kim's Sauce. Simply put, it was the best philly roll I've ever had. Along with the free miso soup, a free salad, and three rolls later, I was happy, and full, and wished they'd offer a bed with a side compfy pillows for dessert. But yet again I was surprised by a free order of a seared salmon sushi (not exactly sure of the name). Once again. using the torch technique to ever so slightly sear the salmon on top, and drenched in their lovely sweet and savory glaze. It was at that exact moment I have realized that every single piece of sushi I have ever had before Kim's Sushi suddenly fell short of the bar that was just set before them. Pricing was moderate but not unreasonable, service kept me feeling like a million bucks, and food that knocked my socks off for the next few weeks until I visit the place again. Kim's Sushi, a place that's easily missed, easily pleasing, but absolutely not so easily beat.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Do get: Any roast meat but especailly the roast pork and duck. The baby pig, the one with the crunchy skin (Lechon for all you Pinoy's) is an instant foodboner for me. ""That soup with the roast duck"". Yes, that's how I order it and somehow, nothing gets lost in translation. Beef pan fried noodles. Crispy noodles! Strange chewy ""beef"". Veggies in some kind of sauce that has so much sheen on it you can see your reflection when you are putting your fat face in there. Salt and pepper squid or shrimp. Not greasy and seasoned perfectly. Soft shell crab (in season) is freak'n awesome Felicia! Yea its kinda expensive but come on, you're drunk and soft shell turtles would be good right abou now! Do it! and if you're a baller on a budget, any of the ""...with rice"" dishes is a solid choice. Solid! Dont: get put off by the wait staff. They barely speak English, so they are doing their best. Besides, with the amount of drunk white guys they deal with everyday, you gotta give 'em a pass for being a little salty at times. Besides, who the fuk ever comes to Chinatown (in any city, including the country of China) expecting good service? Oh, that's right, people from mainland America. Newflash: get over it. Tip'em cheap or don't tip them if they piss you off that bad. Even if they yell at you for not tipping them, they won't remember you, because they think all white and black people look alike! If you're Asian I wouldn't suggest this, however. Just remember doe: it's bad karma not to tip. look into the open kitchen or the guy cutting up the meat.

You pick one of three sizes of the paper cones that the fries come in.  If you cannot make up your mind, check out the sample cones, complete with sponge fries, hanging on the wall.  You then choose one or more of 20+ sauce options.  A few are free and the others come at a nominal additional charge.  Sample as many as you wish.  And as the sign reads, you could bring your own beer from the deli next door.

"Is there any way to give 0 star??? Outrageous is my first and only impression to the way how this seemingly popular restaurant treated its customers. From the right beginning when we walked into this restaurant, the atmosphere didn't feel right. We were seen as 'invisible' by the staff there even though several tables were already cleaned up and ready to serve. The waitress skipped us anyway, and started serving the person who arrived after us. Hey, come on, are you blind??? We had to ask for being seated. However, you know what, we were even not allowed to choose where to seat. Funny, right?! During the entire stay, we were treated as 'invisible'. No staff served us water, or, even made an apology for not being attentative. We were just treated like third-class citizens. Finally, we raised our voice to get the attention from everyone who was dining there. This time the staff there was no longer DEAF and BLIND. But again, they just don't care about customers. Their attitude just really made people sick and pissed off! We didn't dine there at all, and left with disappointment!!! So, we cannot speak for the food quality there.

"When I was a kid I loved funnel cake. Loved it. I grew up and now when I order côte de boeuf , I'm never thinking about funnel cake. I feel the same way about L&B Spumoni Gardens. As an adult, I like thin pizza that was made in a coal oven. The LAST thing I want to eat is a slice of Sicilian pizza. All thick and bread-y. One slice puts me into a carb coma. Back then, my grandfather drove a dairy truck. His route was all over Brooklyn. I'd jump on that truck during the summer and we always had a great lunch. At least to me, pizza, deli or burgers. One of our lunch stops was L&B Spumoni Gardens. I'd get a slice and of course a Spumoni. We'd sit outside and eat. I thought I was the richest kid in Brooklyn. My pesky little brother was home and I was on the truck having both pizza and spumoni. Ha! When I got married and started my family, I always had a soft spot for L&B. I wanted my kids to share my childhood experience. Looking at it now with adult eyes, its an old, ratty place. So, I walk in and order. $19 will get you a small, Sicilian pizza.   This pizza doesn't have cheese covering the pizza but sweet sauce. Not too much oregano, just sweet sauce topping. (Now? I'd add toasted bread crumbs) So I have my pizza to bring back to the burbs. Am I finished? Nah, I need to have a cup of Spumoni. Like my grandfather would have bought for me as a kid. I have Ralph's Italian Ice in Long Island, I like Ralphs. Guess what? They can not compare their Spumoni to L&B. Does Ralphs have more pistachios in their Spumoni? Probably. There is a taste, its almost intoxicating, of good Spumoni that not too many can duplicate. That's why I give this place 5 stars. The sensory rush of the Spumoni and the fresh Sicilian pizza corner slice. Nothing like it anywhere in the world. They could knock the building down and clean the joint up?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"i don't generally strike up conversations with strangers, but i may have to start making exceptions to that rule. simon pearce was recommended by someone i struck up a convo with riding the lifts at pico and it is definitely an experience. located in quaint quechee, simon pearce not only offers fine dining, but a fully functioning glass blowing shop, hydroelectric plant, and retail shop in addition to the restaurant, all in a converted mill. the restaurant itself overlooks the river and a covered bridge. atmosphere - check. the seasonal menu is not extensive, probably because it changes several times a year, but is well-executed. the georges bank scallops ($13) and carrot ginger soup ($7) provided some much needed warmth and protein after a long day of faceplants on the slopes. the roasted grapes served with the scallops added a great sweetness to the dish. for dinner, the braised bison short ribs ($29) were excellent, served with shallots, brussels sprouts, brown butter potato puree, and rosemary jus. normally, i am not a brussels sprouts fan, but these were delicious. the vegetarian dish was a sweet potato and apple agnolotti ($23). the handmade pasta nicely complemented the sweet potato & apple filling, topped with a simple, syrupy balsamic reduction. not only did i clear my plate, i polished off a couple of the agnolotti as well. the local apple crisp ($8) for dessert was piping hot and crisp. the house-made caramel in the dish was spectacular. food - check. simon pearce has an extensive wine list which i would say features bottles in the mid to high range. while there are some in the $30 - $40 range, many of which are featured on their website, the $50+ bottles dominate the list. we went with simon pearce's own special reserve pinot noir ($60) which was quite good - fruity and light enough not to overpower the pasta, but rich enough to accompany the bison. alcohol - check. the food, atmosphere, and service is definitely up to par with the potential $100/pp price tags. the location may make those prices a bit surprising for some, but there it is.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I got the green curry (I always get this in any Thai restaurant), and the chicken satay to go with it. They were both delicious, but the satay was more dry than I am used to. The service, given that it was so early was great too. Very attentive yet discreet - wohoo :). I'm trying this out on a date soon. It's very intimate and romantic. I will update you guys.

"I've been making a concious effort not to give too many restaurants high marks, but I had a fantastic meal here this past Friday night. I split an order of the pancetta wrapped rabbit to start, and it was delicious. Even more so because I would never eat rabbit normally, i've only had it once when my dad told me it was chicken, I reailized right away it wasn't. Regardless, decided to go for it afterall and between the perfectly crisp pancetta, moist rabbit, and tasty little spaetzle the dish worked perfectly. I think i'm a rabbit fan now. Without going into details, both entrees were great too; shell steak and mahi mahi. The cucumber vingairgrette on the mahi mahi was particularly interesting and delicious. Also got an order of the chive mashed potatoes, also good. I think the only thing that faltered for me was the dessert, i think a rocky road something with walnut icecream. the icecream was good, but the rocky road thing was just a bit dry for me. I guess the only other negative was that I dont think we came close to finishing the bottle of wine we ordered, but that was mostly my fault for having already gotten drunk earlier in the day. Oh yeah, good service and a nice atmosphere too, i'm a huge fan now.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Still don't understand the explanation I was given. After we were seated, the server came with water and she filled my glass without noticing the large chip--when I mentioned it, she rolled her eyes. It should have been a sign for me to leave but I was hungry. I ordered the eggs and salmon with the homemade biscuit. It was more like a scone-not fluffy like biscuits should be. And I would have preferred the salmon to be slices-not mixed in. When I asked for butter for the biscuit, I needed to ask twice. The salt on the table is rock salt and doesn't mix in to the tasteless eggs. Overall---I would not go back...I was with two culinary students and they got an eye full, also.","[0.0, 1.0]"

For Appetizer we order the shrimp cocktail and the mac and cheese. Delicious!!!! Set the bar up for me and excited for the entree. I chose the Roast chicken which I loved. This came with potatoes and spinach and the combination was just perfect with the chicken. I was very impressed with the resturant and the service.

"First, I must admit that the selection of Italian food here is excellent. The store is a big, beautiful and clean establishment. That said, I have to admit that the prices are on the high side, but you are paying for quality. It might be helpful though if they included more moderately priced products along with the high end stuff. Risoldi's Market and Porfirios in the same township offer more modestly priced  Italian food, but not in such high end surroundings. I shoudnt need to cash a cd to buy a couple of packages of pasta, But the worst thing about the place is the out and out rudeness of some of the staff members. Some of the men behind the deli counter are abrupt and definitely unfriendly.  But the  most disturbing aspect is one of the women who runs the check out. I have had a couple of negative, distinctly hostile encounters with her, and I know several people who have had similar experiences with her. A friend of mine complained about this lady to a man who appeared to be a manager or owner and his response was that the woman in question was a family member and they couldnt do anything about her attitude.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've always wondered what the fuss about going to a celebrity chef restaurant - until I walked (note I haven't said eat yet) into Scarpetta..the ambience speaks for itself. There was a little wait for the table (despite a reservation) but time flies in wonderment... We finally got a table and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had a vegetarian menu (yes, I'm one of those weirdos). My friend ordered the Polenta, while I decided to be a little more adventurous with the Chestnut Soup. The presentation was impeccable (just loved the fancy way they poured the soup and broth into the polenta) but that was just the beginning. . My first taste of the soup left me spellbound and speechless, I don't think my tastebuds have enjoyed themselves this muxh in a long time! The polenta was also very very good! We had the spaghetti for the main course (You can't eat anything else even if you wanted to, they cajole/coax/waterboard you into the spaghetti) and it was GOOD! Well worth the recommendation!  Dessert was the coconut panna cotta with the guava sauce and caramelized pineapple bits. If ever there is heaven,  I'm fairly confident I caught a glimpse!

I was very, very impressed. I know Japanese food and Sushi quite well. I have lots of experience with it and have eaten some of the best examples of it. This place, while not the best ever, was very serviceable. What it isn't is creative but that's ok with me. The dishes are quite traditional (Negimaki, Rock Shrimp Tempora, etc.) but very well made. I started with the Miso and it was served perfectly (piping hot like the tea was). Next up was the Negimaki which was served with a nice pickled side that added some nice flavor to the perfectly seared meat. I then tried the O-Toro (not the best, but quite good) and had some Nigiri and a few maki rolls. The rolls weren't very impressively prepared (knive/presentation wise) but tasted great. The Nigiri however was made of very high quality fish and I was pleasantly surprised since this wasn't a very traditional looking sushi place. Overall, I really liked this place.

I am not much of greasy burger joint gal so I wasn't too psyched about having dinner here but we needed some place quick to eat.

I went with the grilled chicken sandwich in an attempt to keep my grease intake to less than that of the BF. (Someone had to drive.) Any way the BF of course happily scoffed down two cheeseburgers followed by many fries and onion rings. I only marginally enjoyed my rubbery chicken breast sandwich. It did have lettuce and tomato and I was able to get honey mustard sauce to add some flavor.  I wasn't at all impressed by their catsup dispensers.

"We came here for mother's day last year and the food was okay at best. The prices are pretty reasonable. I ordered what I thought to be a super safe play: chicken marsala. The kitchen was getting crushed and was having a hard time pushing food out. After a wait of approximately 45 minutes for our entrees, my chicken marsala came out with overcooked chicken breast cutlets floating in a soup of brown water and mushrooms. The sauce hadn't even begun to form, let alone had a chance to thicken and for the flavors to intensify. Also, I stopped in the deli one night after a long night of work when I didn't feel like cooking to pick up a sub. I've heard good things about picking up a pizza or a sub from this spot, but I thought my sub (italian cold cut) was below average. At least the price was right at $5, if i recall.

"My favorite restaurant in NJ.  I eat here 2 - 3 times per month and have never had a bad meal.  A great staff who know what they are doing, can actually describe a menu item, and not just tell you that it is good.  Sitting at the bar is always a fun place, you are bound to talk to the people around you and leave in a better mood than you came in, thanks in part to the bartender Craig.   Always looking forward to my next visit.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We've been to this bakery several times for their deli. We used to rate the food quality as excellent but more recently it is just average. The service on the other hand has moved from above average to severally below average. Let me set the stage. There are a total of 7 workers behind the counters (it's a big and long bakery), not including those ""in the back"" who prep, bake, etc. 3-4 out of those 7 employees are near or at the deli area. However, only one person will actually make sandwiches, provide cold cuts, or salads. And this one individual is VERY MEAN. He doesn't acknowledge you or have any eye contact. There is a good chance this might be why other employee's won't get near or assist. He is also very slow so the line just backs up. Even though people were lined up before the 5pm cut off for the deli, he yelled at them to go away and just left. It's just unbelievable; we've seen this happen the last two times we went. We will never return or recommend this place again.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Absolutely fantastic place.  The happy hour special for 6 oysters + a beer is a great deal and includes a great selection off their larger oyster menu.  There's a terrific selection of oysters from briny to creamy and everything in between. The seafood entrees are great too.  My friend and I on our first visit, after ordering a whole mess (totally a technical term there) of oysters, proceeded to try out the soft shell crab, the scallops and the fettuccine with clams.  I believe the menu changes but I trust that you can't really go wrong with anything you select there. Their rotating beer selection is great as well and they're more than happy to help the indecisive among us (cough, me) select something, no matter how vague the instructions.  If you sit at the bar, you can also count on super friendly boy advice too, which is always a nice bonus. Complementary whiskey cake with your bill is a perfect end to each meal here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Easily the top of the casual fine dining Italian in Burlington. A little too metro for a simple dinner out but a great date night spot. As other reviewers have mentioned ALWAYS ORDER THE SQUASH BLOSSOMS!! Certainly not health food but at least i'll die happy. A perfect balance of crunch, salt, sweet, and delicate. If they are on the menu i order them. Every time. This is no one trick pony though. The entrees have always been stellar and the specials have really been special. The wine list seems geared towards enthusiasts but has some decently priced glass pours. Consistently friendly and efficient waitstaff rounds out this gem.","[0.0, 1.0]"

They brought out like three delicious desserts, all for the prix-fixe price that is completely reasonable (almost on the low side I would say) Totally recommend, thank you Delaware and Hudson!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The search for interesting flavors is their strength - try the mussels, the broth is soooo good! The schnitzel is superb, just like a proper one you can get in Vienna; the ravioli and the short ribs were also outstanding.  The staff is extremely attentive and helpful, even when the place really fills up on week-ends.

"Been going here for years for the best rolls around. My wife placed an order here last week and was trying to figure out what the name of the usual rolls we get  while on the phone with the bakery. Ended up with the wrong rolls and asked to change to the correct rolls. By the look on the woman's face you would have thought I farted in her face, and then asked her to run a marathon! She said she had to go in the back to get the rolls. Not positive, but I'm pretty sure they were not the freshest rolls. Never had anything but great products and service with Sorrento. Not sure who she was but she needs a customer service lesson. Next time I'll just walk in and place an order at the counter","[0.0, 1.0]"

Clearly she misunderstood my question and exploded (unprofessional). My advice, if there's no one in there, there's a reason.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Great scene.  Bar set-up is great - you can sit across from one another or take a 4-top.  Large tabels are for groups that call ahead and pre-order the Bo'ssam.  Wine list is oddly priced/geography/varietals and needs a look.

"We found this restaurant by accident and were pleasantly surprised. The food seems authentic Thai to us, and we've eaten at numerous Thai restaurants before. The service was excellent, although it was a good idea to get there before 6:00 PM on a Saturday night because the restaurant seemed to fill to capacity by 6:30. The food was very good. I enjoyed my Massaman curry and my husband liked his ahi tuna special. The famed poached banana dessert, although very sweet, was worth it. Save room and calories for it.

"I've been to Bartaco a few times over the past few years and have never been that impressed.   The restaurant is centrally located in West Hartford center.  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  My most recent trip was on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I had no problem getting a seat right away.  There is a huge wrap around bar area with plenty of seating.  During warm weather, there is a ton of patio seating and the front of the restaurant has giant doors that open, which creates a great open air feel.   Now for the negatives.  During my last visit, I ordered chips and salsa, the spicy cucumber salad and three tacos (sesame ribeye).  First of all, the portions are TINY.  The tacos where about 2 to 3 bites each with very little meat and a small amount of lettuce.  The chips and salsa are served with 3 (yes 3!) chips, each about the size of a sand dollar.  The cucumber salad was probably about 4 slices of cucumber.  Unless you order a ton of food, expect to leave somewhat hungry.   The taste of the food was okay.  Wasn't horrible, but certainly was top notch.  Just okay and unmemorable.   Lastly, the price.  I have no problem paying higher prices for quality food, but given the portion sizes and blah taste, the price is too high in my opinion.  Not to mention, they nickel and dime you for everything.  Chips and salsa, yup, another $3 (aren't chips and salsa usually complimentary at most Mexican places?).  An 8 oz Coke, yup, $3 with no free refills (yes, 8 oz is about 4 sips).   Bottom line, the atmosphere is casual and fun, but the food is okay and is overpriced.  There are better places to eat in West Hartford center.  Unless you're going for a drink, I would skip Bartaco.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I had a great experience last night at the Good Fork. The food, staff, and setting were all wonderful. We wanted to sit outside (cute, intimate backyard), and despite the wait, the host was very helpful and comped us a desert for our wait (which was less than he had quoted us and which we were perfectly fine with). The food was delicious -- I had the oyster po' boy, which, while not a replica of the southern sandwich was great and included a generous (for an app) amount of oysters and a great guac side. The seasonal ravioli were also great.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Banana Leaf is in Philly Chinatown and one of my people who was in charge wanted to eat here but when you think about it, u r in chinatown and you want to eat Malaysian food?? That was odd but I finally gave in and want to check out this place. We had a table of 75 people so they broke all of us into tables and i have to give them credit for serving that many people and they did a decent job. The food was malaysian but with alot of thai influences so i order a shrimp noodle soup. The soup was ok and it taste like shrimp head which i like but the noodle was way too soft for it.

The drinks are delicious (seriously, the strawberry beer I had tasted like strawberry jelly and I finished it in about 2 minutes), but a little pricey. The only thing I didn't really like about National Mechanics was that we felt a little out of place. It felt like all the ""cool kids"" hung out here--the hipster kids, if you will.

"Wow -- I gotta say, this place really earns its 5 stars from me. I'm new to the city and just recently discovered Stone Street. I went with some colleagues to Adrienne's after work on a Thursday and Stone Street was just MOBBED with people, mostly men. It was like an extremely well-dressed frat party. Anyway, despite the chaos, the Adrienne's servers were amazingly attentive. I don't know how they did it. We got a table because they DO take reservations, even in the crazy mess that is Stone Street after work. We stayed for a few hours and had a great time. When it got chilly, they easily moved our rather large party indoors. The food was tasty, the drinks were strong, the wait staff was hospitable...A+ all around.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is HOPPIN'. The vibrant atmosphere, and the greeting chefs and servers bring about a happy, almost exuberant attitude to this ramen shop. My friend and I were seated at the bar and right away ordered our pork ramen with egg, as well as pork buns. The pork buns were amazing! Wow, never in my life have I tried something this good..probably in a long time! I thought it was a very interesting fusion, you had a folded white bun and tucked inside are some meat and veggies. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. It kind of reminded me of those taco buns with duck that you get at traditional Chinese weddings. Next came the ramen....and it was just savory, delicious, and semi-fatty. I absolutely enjoyed every bite of it. The broth was cooked just right, the noodles were cooked to perfection. I could tell this restaurant was going to be my favorite spot to go to whenever I come to NYC. Absolutely enjoyed this place..and definitely coming back for more whenever I stop by NYC again! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As a recent transplant from Manhattan, I've been really disappointed with the quality of food in the area. Whether it's fancy or casual, there's a dearth of tasty food around me. Until now. We passed by the restaurant this afternoon, and though I didn't have high hopes, on a whim we decided to try it. OMG, the jerk shrimp are TO DIE FOR!!! I'm not exaggerating when I say that I just about had the best meal of my life there. The green salad that comes with the meal was incredibly fresh and colorful (NO iceberg lettuce), and the rice and beans were tasty as can be - I'm Puerto Rican, so if it's one thing my people know its definitely rice and beans. I'm a ""pescatarian,"" so I can't comment on the chicken or the ox tails, but this is perhaps the one time in over ten years that I wish I did eat meat because my boyfriend's dish smelled absolutely heavenly. While he had a side of creamy (and spicy!) mac and cheese, I had a spinach patty that was sooooo good - I love that they've thought about vegetarian and ""pescatarian"" options! Anywho, I definitely recommend this place. My only issue is that they came around just in time for bikini season...woe is me and my waistline!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"So glad Luke's Lobster finally came to Philly.  After enjoying Luke's in Washington DC and New York City, I knew that inevitably, Philly would catch on.   The lobster roll is where it's at (the crab and shrimp rolls are decent, but nothing life-changing and as you'll see, the price just doesn't justify what you get).  The lobster roll features a split roll brushed with butter (I pass on the mayo) with tons of lobster claw meat piled  on.  A little drawn butter and seasoning finishes the masterpiece.  Sadly, one could probably inhale this thing in 3-4 bites, but don't!  Savor the fresh, chilled lobster with perfect texture and not something that's been soaking in salt water all day.  Eat a little lobster off the top just to get the full flavor. And get the combo!  Cape cod chips are great and add a nice crunchy contrast to the lobster roll.  But the real treat is the Maine Root sodas.  The sarsaparilla is some of the best I have had and nicely washes down the sweet lobster. After all of this raving, why only 4 stars?!  As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, it's the price.  I can't justify spending $20 and still leaving a little hungry.  And seeing my filled out stampcard on the wall is great to remember my loyalty, but it also reminds me that I spent $100 on lobster rolls that usually never filled me up. Pro tip: you can get the lobster roll deconstructed if you are getting it to go.  They give you the lobster in a cup, and I'm pretty sure you end up with more lobster this way. Enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"As others have said, service here is terrible. I have been to other Macaroni Grills and have had a good enough experience for a chain, but both times I have been here it was horrible. The first time I went was a year or so ago, and thought the fact that we waited almost 1/2 an hour for service was a fluke because it was off-hours.  However, it was no different this recent time we went -  the waiter just kept disappearing. After waiting for a ridiculous amount of time for our dinner (we had finished an appetizer at least 20 minutes before it came out) only half of the food came out - two people still waited an additional forty minutes for their food! The rest of us were done eating. We kept getting up and complaining, but it clearly didn't do anything to speed them up. And the food wasn't even good - my pasta was way undercooked, the egg on it that was supposed to be poached and runny was more like a hard boiled egg, and my whole meal was cold upon arrival. All veggies at the table were overcooked, and everything was generally sloppy and mediocre. The coffee we ordered never came.  I was surprised when it was practically empty on a Friday night, but now we know why. Easily the worst service I have ever experienced. I don't know how they are still open. Oh, and the singer that goes around to the tables was painfully awful.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"The bread is terribly dense and there is way to much of it.  I peeled off half the roll to eat the sandwich.  The shrimp in one was delicious.  The pulled pork was good but the honey accent was way to strong and had an instantly funny taste on my tongue.   The problem is there are ""no modifications"" to any order, so you are stuck with a mini-baguette that has the following: 1) one butter soaked interior side; and 2) both bottom and top sides drenched in globs of a mayo concoction.  These just were gut-bomb additives that did nothing for the sandwich except require another hour at the gym to work it off.  One and done.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Where do I start???  Well, my wife entered the restaurant and waited at the hostess station for well over 5 minutes before any employee was seen.  That should have been our first cue to leave but we ignored our intuitions.  Finally a young man showed up wearing timberland work boots, jeans and a dress shirt and asked us if we had reservations.  I'm still not sure why that mattered as there was only one other couple in the entire restaurant.   The waiter came over (who was also the hostess) and took our order.  My wife and I like to share so we orders a few different things.  To start...spiced pumpkin soup, sesame shrimp and a caramelized onion and prosciutto pizza.  The waiter informed us that they only receive their fish order on Saturday so they were out.  We changed our order to muscles because he said they were delicious.  The waiter brings the soup and pizza, both tasty.  He then brings the muscles and you could smell the fish stench before the bowl hit the table.  Those were sent right back, NO Thanks!!! The busboy (also the waiter and hostess) cleared our table and took our entree order.  We ordered the burger, med rare. The burger came out and it was WELL done- not good.   As we waited for our waiter/hostess/busboy to return with our check, we heard and felt this VERY loud bass.  The restaurant is located (and shares a wall) with a popular nightclub.  The whole place shook- crazy how they don't see this as a problem.   Good luck with this place, truly unfortunate.  the Kitchen Table is a Kitchen Nightmare and could use help from Fox / Gordon Ramsey.

The scallop was realllly good! the scallop and the sauce were both delicious. BUT we didn't like the crispy pork. I didn't like it at all....i wouldn't recommend ordering this item. As for dessert, the caramel flan was good, and I got the cafe cubano espresso sweetened, and it was good. :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Wandered into this place after being sick of eating in Philly Chinatown. I was excited at first since I thought this placed served Roman food...note to self, it's Italian. The one working door leads you into a bar, which you will enter while looking really confused and wondering where the actual restaurant is (unless you've been there before or you've read this spoiler review). The bartender and waitresses will then look amusedly at you before asking you if you're here for the restaurant, at which point you'll be ushered into the back. They have plenty to choose from, in addition to your standard pasta. I did the nosy-lady thing and eyed up everything that everyone else was ordering; their meatballs were GIGANTIC (and that's not just what she said). But then again, for the prices they're charging, you'd better hope they were huge. I was really feenin' for some chicken, and my waitress recommended the Chicken Sicilian. My boyfriend got the Chicken Neapolitan, which to me just means ChocolateStrawberryVanilla but actually was just chicken in tomato sauce (I'm sure there were other things, like red wine and other spices, but it's 99% tomato sauce). My chicken Sicilian was pretty good, with the chicken cooked very well, and the cream and white wine sauce was delicious. However, since I didn't get it with pasta seeing as I was sick of carbs having gulped down a truckload of Chinese bakery buns, the dish was EXTREMELY salty. Good thing they gave us bread - just plain crusty bread, but excellent nonetheless. And also, this dish is laden with OLIVES. I happen to hate olives, and this dish contains two different types - the easily spotted huge black ones, and the cunning small green ones that like to masquerade as green peppers. One bite is enough to ruin any flavor in your mouth. However, since I didn't specify that my hair bristles every time I see olives while ordering, I won't hold this against Villa Di Roma. All in all, this is not really a place you want to go if you're in your teens/twenties and want a casual date spot. First, the food is quite pricey, the portion sizes are not meant for you to stuff and nourish your body, and on top of that, everyone else eating there is probably old enough to be your parents...or their parents. On top of that, they are CASH ONLY...so if you're treating a lot of people out, make sure you rob a bank or tell the other people they have to split a dish five ways. Total bill was around $37 for two people, and we had walked into the restaurant already half full and so hadn't ordered any appetizers or anything other than our main courses. That being said, their Chicken Sicilian sauce is excellent with dry crusty bread. I did feel a little self-conscious drawing pictures in the plate with my bread, it was delicious. When I'm 65 I'll come back here and become a regular.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Since I had the day off, I decided to meet up with my friend at Totto -- deciding to meet twenty minutes before opening. Unfortunately even that wasn't early enough. We ended up waiting for about half an hour. But the ramen did not disappoint. The spicy ramen was just spicy enough. And the char siu pork bun just melted in my mouth. It's possible the food tasted better because of the long wait, but we left full and satisfied. What more can you ask for? Next time, I'm getting there at least 30 min before opening....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I went there for three times, two for dinner and one for lunch. I think it's a good place to go if you are not so hungry and do not want to eat a lot. They have a deli bar which you can choose different kinds of Korean food from. And this is also one of the cheapest place in K-Town. I often go there and try five or more different foods( just a little for each kind). Generally it costs me 4~5 bucks for a dinner. And they also have some food to take out. I notice the Korean Sushi and Chicken is cheap and nice. I also tried Rice Cake there, but that was terrible!! The rice cakes there are too hard and tasted weird. I won't have them anymore. Anyway, if you only want to enjoy a light dinner, Woorijip is a good choice in K-town.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Veering from my plant-based diet to indulge in these meaty balls was one of the best decisions I've made this year.  If you can, bypass the veggie meatball...it doesn't compare to the meat versions.  The perfect evening involved eating 2 types of sliders and a custom-made ice cream sandwich.  Leave enough room in your tummy for the ice cream - so worth it!

"I HATE HATE HATE to admit it, but it's better than Lombardi's. - Pizza: I'm perplexed about the crust.  How does it get so crunchy and chewy?  Perfectly burnt as well.  Other places can't get it this soft and chewy.  The ingredients were great as well.  I recommend trying the spicy salami and sausage.  Nothing bad or special to say about cheese and tomato sauce. - Salad: I like to fill myself with some fresh veggies before stuffing myself with grease.  Salad selection here is not that special, but fresh and light.  A bit pricey I have to say for the quantity.

"The worst restaurants I ever had food. Could be the time I went into the restaurent. Chef was not available during peak hours of saturday around 8 PM. our family was a gunny pig. It took 60 minutes to get me a upma for my kid.  It was already made one and they just microwaved and gave. I was shocked to see upma coming after 45 minutes. THen I asked the attendant for my rest of the order. Then started rushing on the food only after I forced them. And food was horrible. The Veg biryani I ordered was nothing but boiled basmati rice garam masala added along with bunch of frozen mixed veggies, with horrible presentation!! Then I cancelled my rest of the order for Pesarattu. And later they came back and told one of the orders they can't make because of one of the chef's was away also there were lot of take away orders. They could have told me in the beginning itself that there going to be lot of delay I was totally pissed off. And the final bill amout was included the cancelled orders also. I has to adjust the bill to pay the final amount and walked away with lot of disappointment. And my first and last experience was not good. So I would not suggest this restaurant.

"After having some AWESOME bbq in Boston at Sweet Cheeks the week before, I was hoping Mighty Quinn's would demote Sweet Cheeks and become my new favorite bbq place.  I am sad to say that Mighty Quinn's wasn't as good as I hoped.   We got there relatively early and the seats are communal.  You basically stand on line and order your food and find a seat.  We were on line for maybe 15 min so it wasn't too bad.  We did go on a Monday night so maybe that's why it wasn't as crowded.   Brisket - I love brisket, but the brisket did not wow me.  I felt it was a little dry and it wasn't as tender or juicy as I hoped.  Fail. Smoked Sausage - I also love sausage and the sausage was delicious!  I would recommend this. Sweet Potato Casserole with Maple & Pecans - This was amazing!  I wasn't too sure what to expect and I am so glad I was convinced to try this.  This is a must order.  You will thank me.  The maple and pecans complimented the sweet potato very well. Pomme Frites - These fries weren't anything special and I was really disappointed.  Don't order these.  Go down the block to pomme frites if you are craving for some awesome fries. The bathroom in the back is also in an awkward location since you have to fight your way through the crowds to get there.  I wish they would have considered the issues the massive lines would cause since the space for the lines isn't big enough for the crowds of people.  I don't think I'll be back.  The food wasn't good enough for me to go wait on line and fight for a seat.  I also feel the menu options are quite limited.","[1.0, 0.0]"

She had other tables but we truly felt like we were her only table. The atmosphere felt upscale casual. The only thing I didn't like was the way we were seated. There were 7 of us and because the table couldn't accommodate our number, we had to throw a chair on the end of the table which made it cramped and I stuck out into the aisle. The food was great! I am not one to normally eat fish or seafood so some of the foods were a new experience for me. We got octopus for an appetizer and I would definitely recommend that! It was delicious and well-seasoned.

"If you can ""get"" served a drink, it might actually taste good, but the waitstaff is so disrespectful and pretentious, it just kills the enjoyment. I thought the first time here was bad. It gets worse. The waitstaff (one huge chick who thinks she's God's gift) ignores you. Not just you, everyone at the bar except the servers. They serve the servers first then the customers at the bar get served. You could wait 10 min to get anyone's attention. The problem: nasty waitstaff who won't give an ounce of attention to people who are supposedly going to give them a good tip. NOT! The food: average. They don't even have a fish fry on Friday.

"After an absolutely horrible experience at Burger Shoppe.  The posse, minus two, head to Adrienne's as its the only thing we can think of that nearby as we're all starving. When we arrive the restaurant is buzzing but they are able to seat us at a both immediately.  The restaurant narrow, with some family style dining tables at the front, a long banquette and seating at the bar.  The place has a nice vibe as it's casual and laid back.   Not wasting any or server was at the table and gave us an explanation on how things work and gave us a rundown of the specials.  He was polite, knowledgeable, most importantly FAST!  We order drinks, tea entrees.   The cocktails took the edge off, as a light weight drinker the Berry Caipirovska was refreshing.  We ordered a couple of Margherita pizza and Funghi with pepperoni pizza, stuffed shells and I ordered the lasagna.  One adventurous person orderd the pasta with pesto special.  For starters I order the Shrimp Oreganata. As we were recapping the previous experience no sooner did the shrimp arrive at the table.  Scrumptious!  Lightly breaded and moist with a nice sauce.   About ten minutes later all our entree's arrive hot and correct.  The pizza is very good as I like my pizza with thin crust but able to hold a lot of sauce and cheese.  The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was very flavorful.  The shells and lasagna had the same great sauce, and the portions were huge.   The lasagna was off amazing, meaty, evenly spread, perfect noodles and multi-layered with tons of cheese. I wanted to lick my plate.  The Shells were enormous and overflowing with ricotta cheese and spinach.  Over all, the kids were pleased. The price for the items was reasonable considering the neighborhood, portion size and quality of the food.

"I'm going to take my time writing this review. I've never been to China Town but this experience is everything I could've asked for and more. We walked in and although the place is short-person friendly (my boyfriend who is 6'5 pointed it out, I was comfortable) the interior was visually pleasing and stimulating. You could see the chefs cooking, the floors were immaculate, everything felt comfortable and cozy. For appetizers I talked my boyfriend into trying pork rolls. Wow... That's all I can say about them. They're tender, juicy, greasy in the perfect way, and the buns were soft and delicious. I honestly don't know how to describe the ramen other than the fact that I didn't know random things and noodles in liquid could taste so delicious. They could've turned around and told me that I was gulping down bucket water and I probably would've kept going. Absolutely delicious place. Unfortunately we didn't get to try out the tea because we stuffed ourselves on Ramen, but that just makes an all more reason to come back. I also want to add that when we did go, which was around 2 on a Tuesday, it was pretty quiet and empty - which for me is perfect since I like to avoid the city lunch crowd.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Typically I do not provide restaurant reviews. This case is different. We visited this establishment Easter Sunday evening. My overall rating is 6 out of 10. My first impression of AMIS was that the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing. The hostess and wait staff were professional. That's the good. With the reputation the Verti family has in the area I was expecting a culinary adventure, not so. The menu is broken down into different sections, small bites, entrees and sides, deserts and drinks. These are the items that were ordered by my party and my comments about them. Mortadella Mousse:   I'm sure there was Mortadella in there somewhere but the flavor was very faint. It was more like Mortadella cream cheese. I did like the grilled bread but I was cut a bit too thick. Fried duck egg with pecorino and crispy duck skin: There were out of the duck egg so they substituted with a chicken egg. The egg was served on grill polenta. This is not described on the menu and no price adjustment was made for a lesser product, being the egg switch. The dish was bland. I really didn't get the essence of what the chef was trying to convey here. Fried cauliflower with pecorino and salsa rossa: Nothing new or spectacular here. Tasted as if too much salt was used for finishing. Ribeye involtini with wilted spinach: The ribeye was cooked to the wrong temperature and was sliced into strips. This is something that NEVER should be done to a good cut of beef. Say goodbye to the natural juices inside of the steak. The salad contained small tomatoes this was not stated in the menu description. Braised lamb shank with root vegetables: The shank was under seasoned. Braised properly, fall off of the bone, yada yada.... Definitely not the best in Philly.  The root vegetables were either a puree or polenta. They tasted similar to grits. Once again the menu description did not reflect the dish presented. Fried brussels sprouts and lemon: When a brussel sprout enters this establishment it should arm itself because it is going to be tortured and killed. The worst BS idea, EVER. Fried to crisp and with addition of the lemon they tasted like a salt lick. As they cooled they became progressively more offensive to put in your mouth.   ""tartufo al bacio"" chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo with amarena cherries: The chocolate shell was hard and too thick. I found this tough to physically eat and much uninspired. It seemd to have been sitting in the freezer for quite some time. I didn't like it. The coffee: Yes the coffee, it tasted burnt. My assumption is that it had been sitting on the burner for some time and was not fresh. In the end I came away thinking the food was mediocre, the chef didn't understand how to properly season food or flavor profiles. The menu was vague, uninspired and incomplete. If the Verti family would like to keep their reputation in tact I would suggest either closing AMIS or revamping the concept and menu. The wait staff were wearing jeans and mechanic style work shirts. With Led Zeppelin playing in the background I got the sense that this place had no idea of what it was or what it wanted to be.

This is the worst place.  The service is NON-EXISTENT.  The young girl at the register had the worst attitude and acted like she was doing us a favor by ringing up our order.  We had a big party and had to even push our own tables together.  The food was horrible.

"Didn't pay the time I went here and that's a plus. But the prices... for the quality of food, I'm really not seeing it. The drinks are too expensive but that's what you get at a Starr establishment. My meal I wouldn't really call all that great, and then factor in the price, pretty disappointing. The options on the menu didn't look particularly enticing, but that's probably not the best way to judge a restaurant. I didn't like the design either, too big/bombastic/fake/clownish?, trying hard to evoke someplace else, it just didn't feel like philly, it didn't feel genuine.

"So worthy of my celebratory evening (birthday/grad school graduation)! Perfect low-key celebratory, and they take reservations for parties of 5+ which made this the perfect pick for a night out with the family & fiance. We started with the cheese plate, hush puppies & grilled flatbread. The hush puppies were the BEST I have ever tried. Hot and smooshy and so delicious. The flatbread was garlic-y and covered in cheese (can't go wrong) and the cheese plate was also very tasty. The real revelation on the cheese plate, however, came in the form of pickled grapes. A little strange at first (we thought they were olives) but very delectable. Fiance ordered the fried chicken, and scarfed down the entire plate. I managed to sneak a few bites, and it was pretty darn amazing. I polished off the plate of scallops with rhubarb and endive, while the rest of my family raved about their dishes. I manged to save just enough room for dessert, and thoroughly enjoyed the apple bread pudding--although I had to save half for later! But really, can't go wrong with a midnight snack of leftover bread pudding with caramel sauce.   Since the menu changes slightly, I won't write a novel..but GO! EAT! DRINK! and then..waddle home happy!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I just moved into the area so I wanted to try this out. It's basically a deli/shop and has so many fresh ingredients. I tried the smoked duck breast with brie, cornichons, and spicy mustard. The duck is so delicious and the mustard went well with the sandwich. Ask them to go light on it though. The ciabatta is real fresh and I could enjoy myself just eating the bread. I've also had the chorizo and machego. A great sandwich. The chorizo reminds me a ham/prosciutto, but less ""hammy"" if that makes sense for you. However, you really can't turn down their dark meat duck. Sooo good. The potato leek soup was a bit cold and thick, but still a great hearty filling soup. Another great soup is the spinach soup. You must get their soups with your sandwich.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Maison Mathis describes itself as an ""ambassador of food culture from the heart of Europe.""  I went in, having never been before, assuming that it was simply a fancy coffee shop.  It does, I suppose, have a European coffee shop-like appearance--it's brighter and more elegant than Starbucks or Blue State--but after a visit it becomes very apparent that this is not exactly an ordinary coffee shop--their emphasis is on their food, and that is where they find their (relative) success. Service was hectic and rather disorganized.  They give you almost obtrusively large paper cards with numbers that the servers use to locate their orders after you order at the counter, and mine was removed after the first part of my order was served, resulting in some confusion with the next server who brought my coffee--they'd run out of coffee, and I had to wait until they finished brewing a new batch.  We admittedly went at 11AM on a Sunday, which is presumably prime brunch hour, so the chaos was understandable, even if it did very much clash with the would-be elegant and calm ambiance of the place. The food itself was unexciting but well-made and generally well-presented.  I ordered a Belgian waffle with maple syrup, which came with high expectations due to Maison's Belgian roots.  I was not disappointed, but I wasn't particularly impressed either--the waffle was fluffy but could have been crisper.  It also had a large excess of whipped cream which covered and saturated the entire surface of the waffle, which was somewhat appealing in presentation but unappealing in the fact that I had to scrape it off the waffle in order to avoid it.  The maple syrup, however, was rich, tasted genuine, and was not overly sweet (as syrup sometimes tends to be), which is a major plus and probably the best thing about the dish, and it was definitely worth the extra dollar it costs. One friend I went with ordered the grits, which came with a sunny-side up egg and two strips of bacon and their breakfast roll with horseradish, avocado, egg, and bacon, both of which were good but uninteresting--the grits, though seasoned with sharp cheddar, were uninteresting after the crispy bacon and runny egg were finished, and the sandwich was unremarkable, if slightly overpowered by the horseradish.  The bread was despite the fact that Maison prides itself on house-baked bread, was a simple roll that was not particularly extraordinary. My other friend ordered a gruyere and jambon omelette, which came with breakfast potatoes and a salad--these, like the rest of the food, was well-executed and authentic but unremarkable, though the salad's vinagrette (possibly not house-made) was tasty and apparently the best part of the dish. Finally, the drinks, while not exorbitantly expensive, did not impress. Seeing as Maison (I thought) is in essence a fancy coffee-ship, I expected the drinks, their rhetorical ""bread-and-butter"" to be at the very least exemplary.  They were not.  Both the hot chocolate and the coffee were on the watery side--the coffee was fresh brewed (I had to wait, since they'd apparently run out of coffee right as I arrived) and was a quality dark roast but lacked body, tasting rather weak and thin. Maison Mathis is convenient for its decent food--it's definitely more than your average coffee shop, and the food is good but it's nothing particularly extraordinarily, and the service and ambiance are mediocre. It additionally is somewhat reasonably priced--a waffle and coffee was nearly 10 dollars, and the other dishes were well above that.  I was left relatively unsatisfied with the amount of food I ordered, but that was likely partly my fault for just ordering a waffle and coffee--for not much more, Sage and Michael seemed to leave quite satisfied.  Overall, Maison Mathis gets a deserved 3/5 stars.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Burger was alright. I am currently on a burger find but have still yet to find a burger that really blows me away. The one that has come close is PJ Clarke's. This burger was ordered ad a medium rare and it was cooked on the spot. The taste was juicy but lacked the basic savory flavor that normally comes with a good burger. Watching the guy cook burgers when you wait in line explains a lot. There is a lot of shifting but most of all I think he even ""smooshed"" a couple of the patty's which kind of turned me off a little. A little turned off but I tried it anyways. The fries were slightly overdone; however, crispy fries never hurt anyone. Coke was actually pretty flat, but it tasted like coke on tap which is pretty normal. I didn't want to write much because it really want much to write home about. It was a burger. And to be honest that is all that it was..","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I used  to come to Mezo Mezo which was in this location and I love the nearby Watawa and Kyklades so I  was excited to try the new place! We were seated upstairs in a very nice ""window seat"" with pleasant lighting. We started off with a nice moderately priced red wine, a montepulciano, very tasty and a good value for $28. We wanted one ot the ""specials"", a whole sea bass for two but at 7 pm on a Sunday evening they were out of that. so we opted instead to have a salad and 3 appetizers. The MP salad .., Greek salad with crumbled feta, green and black olives, lettuce, cucumber and red peppers was inoffensive but not great. The  grandma meatballs, served with a generous portion of pita and a tiny serving of tsatsiki sauce were delicious and filling. The octopus with chickpeas was tasty and very tender but a tad salty and lacked the tastiness of octupus at kyklades which sets the standard for octupus in my opinion. The Greek sausage , which is also served with pita and the tiny tsatsiki was very good in flavor but 2 of the 3 pieces were slightly undercooked. It also comes with grilled onions which were delicious. The waitress was nice and attentive but the sevice was a bit slow (it was crowded). I would come again but personally for the price and quality i much prefer Kyklades. what is nice is that that they take reservations and the ambiance upstairs is quite nice.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The food here isn't fantastic, so order strategically.  I always get the truffle mac and cheese--which has gotten a lot of press on Yelp and is definitely deserving of the praise. It's gooey, not too heavy, and packed with truffle flavor. My boyfriend always goes for the chicken and waffles. The portion-size is massive, the chicken is peppery and fried to a perfect crisp, and the waffle holds it own. Wash it down with one of Cafeteria's many interesting cocktails. My favorite is the liquid passion--prosecco and passion fruit juice is a winning pair! The restaurant has that quintessential NYC attitude--with very dim lights, slightly rude staff, and chic clientele. Definitely don't come here if you're looking for a laid back dining experience (the name ""cafeteria"" does not mean this place is casual!). The kitchen is open 24 hours, so Cafeteria is not a bad place to end (or begin!) a night on the town.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This is the best Sicilian Pizza I've ever had; I prefer traditional style by far, but this is Sicilian style that's impossible to pass up if you're as big of a pizza lover as I am.  The lines can get quite long, but the guys quickly turn these pizzas out as they restrict no toppings on single slices; I don't mind because I think this helps move things along quickly.   Typically, most people order a half-tray (12 slices) or a whole tray (24 slices).  I grabbed a half tray with my dinner date for the evening, and before I knew it I stuffed 4 slices down my gullet.  Like I said before, I'm not the biggest fan of Sicilian, but I am definitely fan of the greatest pizza sauce I've ever tasted.  While I have my go-to spots for slices of cheese, and my gourmet gems for my favorite style (Brick-oven that is), I've never had a pizza sauce better than Spumoni Gardens.  It had the right amount of sweetness to it and the perfect dashes of herbs and seasonings, accentuating the tomato flavors in all the right ways. Some other reviewers said there could be more cheese on these slices, and while I'm an avid cheese lover, that's not what this pizza is meant to be.  It's meant to be a tribute to what traditional Italian pizza sauce should taste like.  If it were loaded with cheese, it would definitely add greasiness and take away from the purity of the crispy Sicilian shell and the perfection of the best pizza sauce ever.   I wish I could tell you about more food options here (like the 4 different types of hero's the table next to me ordered looked amazing), but sadly the pizza was all I had room for.   I tried some of the Vanilla Chip water ice later on and was not a fan; it wasn't bad but it was also WATER ICE (icy, chipped) not ITALIAN ICE (creamy, smooth).  I'm usually not that picky, but being in Brooklyn and having such good pizza, I expected more from the water ice. Do yourself a favor, in fact do your whole family a favor, pick up a whole tray of sicilian and bring it home for everyone to enjoy!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great find!  Sadly we were only in town for a night, but finding the Tip Top Cafe made that night memorable.  Their garlic aioli (served with crusty bread) sets up high expectations for a meal that did not disappoint.  We had the apple and sweetpotato fritters, which came piping hot with a slightly spicy creamy dipping sauce.  Next was the butternut squash,  bacon, and cheddar risotto (I had mine w/o bacon).  Finally, we snagged a chocolate chip cookie for the road.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"We went a group of four last night. Have not been back in a few years. Remembered this spot and said let's try it again. Big fail of the night was not reservations. We arrived at 7 and were told it would be 45 minute wait. We decided to wait. This place was packed . They have a small bar area with about 12 seats right off the entry what,which was full. The wAiting area at the front is small and tight. About 8 people can stand and a few sit . We ended up waiting over an hour and finally sitting in near the bar. Not bad a bit tight in this area. We ordered drinks to start. Corona ,can't mess thAt up. One other was a mojito,which seemed to be off. Just wasn't right. Drank anyway but switched to tequila sunrise after. Strong but good. We ordered guacamole made at the table and yuca fries as appetizers. Guacamole was very good and fresh. Chips they served were ok, not warm as you may get in other places and not salt. The Yucatan fries were really good. Came with a dipping sauce almost like ketchup and mayo together. Not sure but complimented well. Out of the four of us we orders the cheese enchiladas, traditional burrito with chicken cheese sour cream and red sauce,steak fajitas and salmon with peppercorn brandy sauce and asparagus. We all enjoyed our meals. Food was good. Not best Mexican food I have had. Service was spotty. Bartender taking orders for food and drinks, then our waitress is talking to bartender while we are waiting for drinks,then our waitress is behind bar and bartender seems to be training her and she is yelling across room as to what to pour next and how much. So we were a bit confused. Parking is tough. Public parking at end of block. Don't pay meters after 6. There lot only allows for about 10 cars maybe. So all in all I would go back.

"Saw couple of good reviews here on yelp and decided to visit this restaurant for dinner one of these friday nights. I called in for a reservation and none picked up the call. So my husband, 2 other friends and I decided to just drop in for dinner. Unfortunately these guys were full and told us we cannot have dinner today. So, we guys had to push our dinner plans to sunday. So please please call these guys before you drop in!!!!!!!!!!!!! As scheduled this time we dropped in on sunday for dinner. The staff is a little slow at things however this restaurant is simply amazing. The food is so much close to typical Indian food (South Indian). We guys loved it. We tried the vegetable samosa pastry for the appetizers and ordered Beye Ayinetu(A veggie combo) for the main course. Ordered Baklava for the dessert. The food is simply superb! We got 3 samosas in 1 portion, taste was good. Then the veggie combo was seriously delicious. These are huge traditional pancakes served with a variety of lentils and veggies. I would recommend to go for the combo's, you get to taste every bit of it. Oh yeah one portion is definitely to be shared by two people. And the dessert was beyond the world. This was a warm pastry kinda, stuffed with nuts and this too to be shared :) I call this Cuisine another version of Indian food ;) Definitely with its own flavors. Guys if you like Indian food then you will love this place. Give a try and enjoy! Cheers!!!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Although I do still feel the same way as I last posted - you do still have that icky tofu scramble in your repertoire (please please, no jerk seasoning... just some good ol' fashioned nutritional yeast and some salt/pepper! a sprinkle of onion maybe?) - I can't possibly leave our relationship hanging in the balance like this.  I feel a lot like the lover who went back after realizing she was wrong - I am the Shoshana to your Ray.  I know this.  Yet still I must push forward... Still still, I do love you and all that you stand for - your sweetness, your history, your steadfastness, your jazziness.  And holy HELL I love you for those cinnamon bun pancakes!

This has always been the best breakfast joint in town, and I am not kidding, I have been coming here since 1996 - eek! almost 20 years (am I really that old!?).  I think I may need a t-shirt - only I promise not to wear it when I eat there...

"My party of four arrived promptly for our 7:45 reservation. By 8:45, we were tired of standing in the cramped front of the restaurant, waiting for our table. We left and went around the corner to Stella where we were seated promptly. After waiting for over ten minutes for someone to acknowledge us (the bartender and three different servers saw us standing there but ignored us), we had to flag down someone to tell them we'd arrived. A few minutes later, someone came over and told us that our table wouldn't be ready till 8:15. By that point, we'd already been there almost fifteen minutes, so what was another fifteen? Well, the fifteen came and went. A table of four that had gotten there AFTER us were seated. We heard them say that their reservation was at 8:00 (remember, ours was for 7:45). Meanwhile, an empty four-top with a ""reserved"" sign sat in front of us. They told us they couldn't seat us there because a party of 11 was coming in soon. The 11 didn't arrive the entire hour we sat there waiting, yet they wouldn't seat us there. Then, they looked at us again and said ""Oh, there are only four of you? We thought there were eight of you. We could've sat you at that other table"" (where the 8:00 reservation sat down). For the next half hour, they checked up on us every five minutes. ""Just a few more minutes,"" they'd say. But still we sat there. We finally asked to see the manager. The hostess disappeared in the back  and never came back out, at least not for more than five minutes. By this time, we'd been there for a full hour, so we left. Good riddance. I've never seen such a level of inattention, miscommunication, and ineptitude. I will never, EVER return to this place. It's a joke.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Long review...MAKE SURE TO ORDER THE FRIED CHICKEN! Root & Bone is from two Top Chef alum (Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth) and has been blowing up my Instagram feed from fellow foodies posting drool-worthy pics of chicken and waffles! This spot doesn't take reservations, so we arrived right when it opened (11:30am-ish). When our server told us about the special Bourbon Bloody Mary I was ALL over it. When it arrived and I saw all the yummy garnishes (BACON! PICKLES! OLIVES!), I was even more stoked! The executive chef is known for fried chicken, so I knew I had to order it. There was simply nothing to think about. I got a half order of the Crispy Free-Range Chicken. It is sweet tea brined and served with pickled lemon dust and spiked Tabasco honey. I'm really not sure where to start. The chicken was delicious. Each bite was awesome. The skin was perfectly crisp, the meat was moist and the sweet tea brine was a wonderful complement to the salty skin. I love the taste combination of salty & sweet, so I was in HEAVEN! There is an option to add a cheddar cheese waffle and whiskey maple syrup. CLEARLY I did that. I was surprised when 4 mini waffles appeared instead of one large waffle. They were super cute! The cheese ended up hardening up and cooling down. I'm undecided on this presentation style - it was just congealed, not that sexy. I'd suggest that the cheese be shredded and integrated into the batter or turned more into a cheese sauce. I also read that the mac & cheese was super delicious, so we ordered a side. Naturally, it was huge. The mac is made with big elbow pasta, crunchy cheese toast and a fresh thyme crust. We loved it but hardly made a dent in it - eek! Lauren ordered the Southern Peach Caprese made with fried pimento cheese, grilled peaches, pickled green tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, sticky molasses vinegar and basil. She loved it! I wanted no part of any sort of salad as I was elbow deep in CHICKEN N WAFFLES YO! When we got the check, it was rolled up in a bone. I thought this was a nice (somewhat spooky) touch and attention to detail. Come here and order the chicken!! Since you can't make reservations, I'd recommend coming right at opening or at non-peak meal times.","[1.0, 0.0]"

I went in on January 1st and it was a little busy but the dining area wasn't that bad. We ordered a burger some fries and soup and I wanted 4 tables around us get flipped and get food while we waiting over 45 minutes and no food. Finally we flag down a waitress who cops an attitude for me asking and then our waitress comes over and tell us the food order got lost. Also note we had to flag down a waitress no one ever checked in on us. Finally I asked for the manger after almost an hour and no food and he apologizes and comps the food but when it comes out the burger is overcooked and the tater tots are cold. I went back again last night for a 2nd chance, this time I brought my parents. My mom is allergic to shellfish and the waitress says man that sucks everyhing is cooked together here and my mom orders a reuben as does my step father I order the special, a buffalo chicken wrap, 50 minutes later I have to go up to the bar and ask for them to check on it, and also turn the Flyers game back on it was 4-4 with like 3  minutes to go and they flip it without seeing if it was still on. When the food comes out the Reubens are both hot,  but my sandwich is room temp at best and the tater tots are cold.

"We must have gone on an ""off"" night, because it was not a good experience. I ordered the beet salad, and my husband ordered the mussels in a curry sauce. The beets arrived as if they had dumped a whole can on a plate. The presentation was very unappealing. The mussels had the wrong sauce, (mustard), which my spouse hates! I took two beets, and the small amount of salad that was underneath, and then couldn't fathom eating  anymore. The waitress took the mussels to be replaced by the correct order. Fifteen minutes later, with little attention from the waitress, I decided to cut my losses and leave. We told the hostess that ""it was not working"", and that we were taking our unfinished bottle of wine and leaving. The truth was revealed, that the waitress had mixed-up the mussel orders, and the other table had gotten the  curry sauce.

"I think the term ""gastropub"" is a bit of a stretch here.  I like the brickyard, I would call it more ""upscale comfort food"".   I live not too far away and came here for happy hour with some friends.  The staff was very friendly, from the door staff to the servers.  We were never left hanging.  The happy hour is pretty good: $5 house wines and well drinks.  I think the prices went up.  The food here ranges from ""meh"" to good.  Nothing is outstanding, but nothing is bad either.  We got a bunch of apps with our drinks and both the wings and the onion rings were very middle of the road.   Bottom line: you will not have the experience of you life here, but you will have a good meal and get good service too.  That works 90% of time for most people.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Great little coffee house, friendly staff, and lots of vegan treats.  I got a vegan chocolate chip muffin that was soo good- perhaps better than any non-vegan muffin I've had.  I also really liked the huge milk selection for coffee- they had soy, skim, whole, and almond milk.  Cozy back room with lots of seating and tables.  They also let you bring your dog in.  I will definitely be back with my pooch!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food is solid, the atmosphere is LOUD. It is a beautiful building inside, I felt like I was in a really cool/large wine bar. I couldn't hear the waitress though, which was a bummer. Thank heavens whatever I ordered was tasty! Started w/ the grilled octopus. Stellar. Light and delicious. We split the lombardo pizza and robiola francobolli. If the Robiola were stuffed more and bigger (instead of being the ""postage stamp"" size they even advertise it as), I would be in heaven. Buttery goodness. But -it's just a sampling :( The pizza was eh, it wasn't bad but I've just had much better so I feel like I must say it did not live up to the reputation of being the best pizza in Philly. But still good. I'd order a different pizza next time. Ended the night with chocolate flan that came with pistachio gelato. O-M-G. I wanted to lick the plate. My BF and I were fighting for every last bite, which was not romantic. The flan was actually more like chocolate molten cake, which was fine with me! In summary, if the pizza was up to the caliber of the other foods, I would've given Osteria a 5. The service was impeccable and attentive, but not in the bad way where you feel like you are being watched at all times (ahem ahem Le-Bec-Fin). On a side note: the restaurant is kinda in the middle of nowhere. We felt brave so we took the broad st line back from dinner to CC. I thought I was going to die (but didn't!), but we all secretly think we are going to die on the Broad St line at one point or another, don't we? Anyway, the night was a success.

"I am completely shocked and perplexed as to how this place has a 4 star yelp status. I thought this place must be good as the first time I tried to get in there was a crowd of people outside (both Chinese and not). I say this because being Asian, we can nip out the good from the bad. There was also a 20 minute minimum waiting time. Homie don't play that... So I got here another time where there was no wait. Weeeeee I was execited. Well, Joe's is the epitome of a tourist trap. I think 5 people must've said this place was really good, and the sheep of society followed because nothing about this place was extraordinary. Once inside, if you're not with a large party, expect to sit at a table with a bunch of strangers. Ok, that's fine but now I guess my party and I will order less to accommodate room for other people's food at our table. Service was rushed and they never came back to check if we were good, wanted water, or were still alive at the minimum.  Total dumpling sweatshop factory. While I agree the soup dumplings are exceptional, as they are super juicy and flavorful, anything outside of that was mediocre to not so good (fried quail, pan fried noodles with shrimp, scallion pancakes, etc.) I have zero desire to come back here and sit with strangers in a cramped space to eat dumplings.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've had several good dinners here. It's cramped and crowded, but the food is consistently delicious. However, just had my first brunch experience at Tartine, and it left me with a bit of a sour taste. Word of warning: The prix fixe menu might say ""includes orange juice and coffee"", but refills of oj are definitely not free. We didn't find this out until the bill came and it included a $3.50 charge for each additional glass of juice ($10.50 total). Mind you, these were tiny glasses, our server never told us that refills cost extra, and they never brought us water. These are pretty sneaky tactics, and I'm guessing we weren't the first group to fall victim to them. Hopefully you can now avoid the same trap.","[0.0, 1.0]"
My wife and I had breakfast there this past Saturday and OMG this was Easily the ABSOLUTE WORST breakfast I have EVER had!  Almost scarred for life bad!  This place DOES NOT make fresh corned beef hash - that segment on Diner's Drive In's and Dives was for sure staged as I know corned beef out of a can and what they served was ABSOLUTELY of the canned variety.  The only places where you can be sure to have the real thing in New Jersey is The Mad Batter in Cape May or Colonial Diner in East Brunswick.  As for Hightstown Diner it was beyond disappointment we will NEVER go back there again.  This place is only for locals - if you have to go even 5 minutes out of your way NOT WORTH IT!  For anyone hoping for a great experience due to what they saw on Triple D I assure you that you will feel the same as I do.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"I am so disappointed! I was really looking forward to this because have spoken to a lot of people who said the food and atmosphere here was good...I wouldn't know I never actually got any food.  The decor is cool, but don't care where I am if you are going to treat your customers like crap. When my friend and I arrived Friday around 6:30 p.m. after standing for an hour in traffic to get here we were told we could be seated outside or wait to be seated inside.  We agreed outside was fine, until it started to rain.  The hostess was very sweet and tried to help us (thus the one star for her), by telling us we could take a table that was half inside half outside, but when we had gone to sit there people had taken it upon themselves to relocate themselves to that table.  She asked us to follow her and agreed she would help us.  When we went inside I'm assuming the manager or owner asked her what she was doing and got snippy with her in spanish...yeah buddy I understood. Then he turned to us and told us we had to go wait our turn in line...the wait was at that point over an hour.  When I explained the situation he brushed it off and said he didn't care.  Really nice of him considering I drove an hour from another state to eat at your restaurant, to celebrate a special occasion...Needless to say I will not be eating here again...Although the food smelled good I refuse to put money in anyone's pocket that doesn't treat their customers like they give a crap about them because there are others!

"For some reason, this is currently the highest rated Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, at least according to Yelp. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to try the food. I write a blog called Pho Across America, where I go and eat pho in every state. I was really surprised that Bo Ky's menu only had two types of pho, and they were hidden in the middle of the disorganized menu. What a lack of variety! I just wanted to order a basic Pho Tai, but the aggressive server was hounding me about what type of noodles I wanted. I just wanted regular pho noodles, but somehow we could not communicate. It got to the point where I was just so turned off and uncomfortable that I wanted to leave. My first impression of Bo Ky was that it was surprisingly busy for such a dingy looking restaurant. The food here must be very good, because the service and atmosphere certainly won't bring in customers.. I can usually put up with a lot to give the food a try, but I just felt so unwanted here.

Being a restaurant in our town we thought we should give it a chance at an off hour, so it was on Saturday that we stopped there for a very late lunch, 4 pm. Since it is summer we were not the only people having a late lunch, it was half full all be it with a much more mature clientele. They were still offering their brunch which ends at 4, I opted for the eggs benedict, nice touch to have perfectly poached eggs on a very nice potato pancake, the bacon was very good, the only thing that spoiled an other wise perfect presentation was that the home fries made into an oval patty were greasy. My husbands Irish beef stew with Guinness also passed the taste test. The service was very good our server, very nice, well mannered young lady.","[1.0, 0.0]"

If you are out of something, take it off the menu, especially if its been out ""for awhile"". I decided to have the Cream of Clam soup which was ok but nothing special. I would pass.

"I came here last night and my experience was great! I got here around 6:30 PM and was seated immediately. The decor is very nice--spacey and comfortable. Seating is good for either parties of 2, 4, 6, and probably more. They had a lot of tables. Dim lighting also helped set a relaxing mood; it was romantic, but not too romantic. There was also a nice bar area if you were interested. Service was pretty good in my opinion. Right as we were seated, we got our menus and a bread basket. They asked if we needed any drink menus and was friendly when we said we needed a few more minutes. We ended up ordering the Classico appetizer, which had clams, shrimp, and mushrooms. This was delicious. I usually don't enjoy shrimp that much, but this was cooked just right. I ordered the Gnocchi alla Baba entrée and my boyfriend had the Farfalle Primavera. The gnocchi was cooked just right, soft and chewy, and the farfalle had a nice healthy taste to it with a lot of vegetables. The waiters were attentive and stopped by to ask if we needed anything or whether our food was good. They came around each time we got our food to ask if we wanted some pepper or cheese on it. At my stay there, I believe at least 5 waiters came to serve us, whether it was with cheese, pepper, utensils, menus, or dishes. At some other restaurants I have visited, waiters don't serve you if they're not assigned to. Not at this restaurant! I was actually surprised when a different waiter took our bill. I think tip was included in our bill also. Oh and one last thing, as we were leaving, the host (I think) eagerly followed us a few steps and asked if we enjoyed our meals. Thumbs up here. I noticed that the listed attire for this place is ""casual."" Maybe it was because it was a Monday at 6:30, but most of the people that dined were dressed up--no jeans and mostly collared shirts. My boyfriend and I were in jeans, hoodies, and sneakers, so we felt a little out of place. As a matter of fact, we were painting ceramics in the day and happened to get paint splashes on our clothes. (It was entirely my fault.) I just couldn't help but laugh the whole time. So I hope they didn't mind that we were dressed like bums. Overall, I had a good experience here. I think I saw two floors here, so seating should not be a problem most of the time. Stopping here before a show is probably a good idea. I would come back for a nice quiet dinner.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"A few days ago, I would have given this wonderful restaurant five stars.  However, after being treated extremely rudely by the manager on Friday night, as well as two other instances of utterly inhospitable service, I can only give 3 stars. In the past 2 years that I've lived 2 blocks away from Bocca Lupo, I have brought countless friends for brunch, appetizers, dinner, wine, whiskey, and all manners of rustic but refined Italian fare.  The bruschetta are perfect little bites.  The wine list is extensive, but also gives wonderful notes to help you choose exactly the right one for you.  The goat cheese and mushroom frittata is one of my absolute favorite brunch dishes in the neighborhood.  The wait staff is often helpful in describing and selecting menu items.  The ambiance during the day is bright and cheerful, with large windows for people watching; at night, it becomes warm and romantic. Friday late afternoon, 3 teacher friends and I came here for after-work drinks and appetizers.  When we arrived at about 4:30, we were the only patrons in the restaurant.  Our server admitted that she was still new to the menu, but she was extremely polite, attentive, and welcoming. At about 6 PM, this lovely server's shift had ended.  The restaurant was slowly becoming more crowded for the dinner hour.  We had just ordered our second round of drinks, and had another friend join us who also ordered drinks. The manager arrived at about that time, as well as another server.  Twice, we felt as if we were reprimanded: once, when we moved our table about 4 inches in one direction because the setting sun was directly in our eyes, and told (not asked) to move it back; second, the manager took my friend's leather pocketbook off her chair and put it on the floor -- again, without asking to touch her belongings -- simply TELLING her that it was blocking the ""aisle."" For the next hour, it was extremely obvious that this manager was giving us dirty looks and talking about us in a derogatory way just a few feet from us to the other staff (at some point she said ""They're teachers"" -- I guess to mean that we won't pay enough to her liking).  It was later clear that she was refusing to refill our water glasses.  She dropped off our check without our request, saying something about a ""wait list,"" despite the 1 or 2 open tables next to us, and the lack of anyone waiting at the door. We all recognized that we should probably order another round of drinks -- we knew that they wanted us to pay if we were going to continue to hang out.  However, when we tried to do so, we were refused service.   When we tried to explain how we were shocked to be treated so rudely, the manager only said that she was ""sorry if we felt that way."" Before I became a teacher, I was a waitress myself.  I understand that a lot goes in to service running smoothly, and that you want tables to turn over to get as much revenue in one night as possible.  However, I learned that the first rule of food service is HOSPITALITY.  Customers are more likely to return to a restaurant for good service than for good food.  This manager could have easily asked us politely to finish up, or move to the bar, if we weren't going to be ordering dinner.  Instead, she chose to passive aggressively kick us out. It's not worth it to go into the other two strange incidents of poor service -- I think this is enough.  I am saddened and shocked that I may no longer be able to frequent my favorite local hangout for fear of being treated disrespectfully.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I celebrated my birthday last night at Fat Buddha. I was looking for a loungy bar with a DJ, good food and where I could reserve a table for my friends and I. This place fit the criteria after extensive research (by extensive research I mean Google). Any who, I didn't want to deal with the crowded club scene this year, just wanted a laid-back spot. I called two weeks beforehand and made reservations with a girl named Gin. It was quick and easy and surprisingly they didn't take credit card info which some places tend to do. I reserved their biggest table for about 20 people at 8pm on a Friday. When we got there the table was perfectly set up and they even let me bring balloons (yes, I wanted balloons) :) Those of us who got there before 9pm were able to take advantage of the happy hour (although we were seated at the table). I quickly ordered pork buns and wings for everyone and it came out fairly quickly. One of the bartenders sent over free shots for everyone which was really nice of him. Around 1030pm they begin to remove all the tables and create a dance floor by DJ. They played a mix of everything but mostly Hip-Hop. It was definitely a lot if fun and we ended dancing for the rest of the night. My only negatives are that the lychee martinis were pretty weak. My friends kept buying me drinks and I was still perfectly fine after about 7. I should've been done after 3! Also, they removed all our bags and coats from the couches without asking! They take them to coat check but still...freaking let us know! Other than that great time and staff was excellent.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This a review for brunch: First, I love bourbon, and I've been here numerous times to drink some scotch/bourbon in the beautiful bar, but I've only eaten the brunch menu. Second, the bar truly is beautiful.  There is a nice big window looking out/in to the street, and the bar looks extremely inviting from the outside and is nice and cozy from the inside. The brunch is a knock you on your butt sort of meal.  I love the eggs benedict on the southern biscuit with the bacon gravy.  Add a side of bacon, some bacon grits, and a bourbon bloody mary or two and your will likely sleep the rest of the afternoon.

"Ri Ra is one of the best places to go on a Friday night because they have relatively cheap drinks and no cover with a DJ that plays Top 40. On other nights, it is the bustling neighborhood Irish pub offering traditional Irish pub faire. Half-price burgers highlight Wednesday. It was packed around dinner, especially on a nice hot day like today. The patio seating filled up quickly and we ended up waiting about an hour to get seated and get our food. I was disappointed by the lack of any BBQ flavor from the Guinness BBQ burger. The burger patty itself was huge, and while it was moist, I was left wanting more tangy BBQ flavor. The hand cut chips were also a shame. The normal pub fries were actually fried crisp (most likely due to a nice layer of starch), but the hand cut chips were mostly soft and soggy. The malt vinegar mayo was nothing special. Service was slow, but you can hardly blame the waitresses since they were probably getting slammed by all the orders. I can't complain too much about a $5 burger, but next time, I think I will pass on the hand cut chips.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The radio told me I should try Paesano's hoagies. No, that's not quite right. The internet told me that the radio told me I should try Paesano's hoagies. However I got the information, I was glad that this little shop was brought to my attention. In an unassuming shop on an unassuming street in Northern Northern Liberties (or Southern Fishtown?)  Paesano's is humbly assembling gourmet sandwiches that rival anything I've had in Philly or elsewhere. I ate the namesake sandwich, the Paesano: a great seeded roll packed with delicious roast beef. This isn't your average deli roast beef, this is big chunks of juicy meat cooked perfectly. Also, this sandwich was topped with cole slaw. Great combination. They ran out of rolls shortly after we began to devour our food ... I think around 6:45. I could only stare at the poor souls walking in after that with pity; they would not be experiencing culinary bliss. I'd also recommend calling ahead or allowing yourself plenty of time, our food took about 15 minutes to come out. The inside portion of the shop has a counter with about 8 stools and was pretty hot inside. The two people working there were knowledgeable and friendly despite their busy-ness. There's two tables you can eat at outside. Given it's current popularity, I'd consider Paesano's a food destination rather than a quick lunch stop. Plan to spend some time there and savor the meal and the experience.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"My partner and I have been coming to this restaurant for years.  The food is excellent, the service is superb, and the decor is lovely. There is a great selection of food, from vegetarian fare to lamb and kibbee dishes. The baklava is simply to die for. Everything is very reasonably priced and the wait staff is the best that there is. You will feel like a member of the family.  My partner is of Lebanese descent and this is the only place we dare bring her family. You will be very happy to share a meal at Sahara.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I've been a patron of Steve's Place since before it was Steve's Place and the Hartford Drive In was open because that's where we used to take them. I believe it was the Newington Giant Grinder Shop. It's a standing joke with Doug that I buy ""long distance grinders"" because I have had to come from Meriden (instead of Main St, Newington) to get the best turkey grinder on the planet since I got married. Rocky Hill is closer but for some reason, the home town ones are better; especially when Doug makes them himself. Think I might head that way today! :)","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Pros: I wouldn't travel out of my way to go here, but it's a great place if you're in the area and hungry.  Food isn't the most authentic, but is almost always good.  Also much cheaper than similar surrounding restaurants.  Great place to sit out back for drinks in the summer.

"The greater Trenton area has a rich variety of Italian restaurants.  This is a living legacy of the area's 19th and 20th-century immigrant population. Debates are almost endless as to the ""best"" meatballs, best sauce (or ""gravy"" in some quarts), best chicken, and of course, best pizza. The trick in this debate is that there is no single ""best."" you can watch Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining TED talk about jarred spaghetti sauce, to get the real story.  Different people have different preferences.  So the challenge for would-be diners, is to know which places offer what kinds of atmosphere, service, great food, and good value. In the race to be viewed as ""best,"" restaurants do different things.  The Olive Garden may be ""best"" if you want unlimited bread sticks and soup or salad.  In Hamilton and Robbinsville, New Jersey, ""best"" may mean a tiny pizza joint with a spiffy new dining room, or a new local branch of a long-time area pie purveyor. Massimo's has been a fixture in Robbinsville for years now, and it still shines as bright as ever for its delicious pasta dishes, varied chicken and veal preparations, and yes, superior pizza. Tucked in a strip mall building off Route 33, Massimo's offers a Tuscan-style dining room with contemporary flair.  Warm ochre walls set the backdrop for modern banquets of blonde wood and piano-black accents.  Servers are friendly and welcoming.  Blackboards and hand-written sheets list the specials of the day.  Framed photos and memorabilia celebrate Italy's long soccer heritage. The menu further reflects the soccer theme, with pasta dishes named for favorite famous players.  Try the Lalas, a rich blend of meaty bolognese-style sauce, with creamy ricotta, and fresh mozzarella, over penne rigatta.  This has been a Broke Gourmet favorite for years.  So too their pasta e fagioli, another Italian dish with devoted local following.  Massimo's version boasts a broth thickened with creamy beans, flavored with just enough smoky pork, and the brightness of tender celery.  Delicious, and hearty on a winter's night. Massimo delivers on its chicken and other meat dishes as well.  Chicken Parmagiana brings large pounded cutlets, breaded and perfectly sauteed, under the requisite blanket of melted mozzarella cheese. The menu offers varied preparations, including classic sautees, and newer recipes such as the pan-roasted ""chicken under a brick."" Of course, Trenton area Italian restaurants wouldn't be complete without pizza.  Massimo's offers two types.  Their traditional pies are, to my tastes, and those of my frequent companions, top notch.  The right combination of chew and crisp, with a perfect balance of delicious sauce, fresh melted cheese, and multiple toppings. Recently, Massimo's sought to distinguish itself from the other local pie shops, by becoming certified in an authentic Italian pizza process.  This is a D.O.C., or Controlled Denomination of Origin process.  You can't say you offer the ""real authentic"" thing, without the certification that says you have learned it and mastered it.  Massimo's has the credential.  Their higher-end pies do have the more rustic char and chew of the fired oven, and you may love them.   But in truth, I recommend Massimo's regular pizzas.  Frankly, they are superior to that ""tomato pie"" joint nearby (locals all know who I mean- the guys with attitude, whose odd ideas about pizza seemingly brainwashed a generation of Trentonians).  If you have an open mind on your pie, a craving for delicious food at fair prices, in a stylish friendly setting, you'll find it all at Massimo's.  Like the Italian soccer teams, it's a winner.

"I agree with the other negative reviewers on here and would not recommend Skappo to anyone. My husband and I were completely misled by the high/positive reviews, as I'm sure many others have been. I never like to judge a book by its cover, but in this case I wish we had. Initially we were happy to be given our own table and not be seated on the awkwardly large 'picnic' tables that take up most of the restaurant, however, our table was extremely sticky. My husband literally had to peel his cell phone off the table! It's not really what you expect in a restaurant and it gives a horrible first impression. The shabby menus were falling apart with pages missing and the menu choice is very limited. We also had a long wait for our food - we waited 30 minutes for just one serving of crostini, then we had another long wait for the rest of our food (chicken with broccoli and mushroom, & black risotto) both of them were terrible, the chicken was extremely dry and both meals lacked any real flavor or seasoning. Our waitress was also extremely moody and didn't bother checking up on us or clearing the table. Overall, it was a terrible experience and one that my husband and I would never like to repeat.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to Eccola several times since 2001. Generally service and food is good. Tonight was a disappointing exception. I ordered the Salmon with quinoa off the daily specials menu and received a cod dish. The manager, who sat us and provided the menu, said i ordered the fish special. Apparently, he gave me an outdated menu. I don't eat cod, so while my companion enjoyed a steak dish, I sat awaiting the replacement dish ($16.95 basic spaghetti dish). The manager, who made the mistake, and made me feel like a complete idiot, did not even offer a free drink or dessert. After we paid the check and I mentioned something to the server. she must have relayed the message. Then he offered an after dinner drink. By that time, it was too little too late. So disappointing. There are so many other really good dining options available that service, above all, should never be inadequate.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Update: The general manager made a great effort to set everything right with me after her employee's enormous screw-up.  Call this 3.5 stars in reflection of my now drastically improved feelings about their customer service. First time for dinner, fourth trip total.  Super-cool decor, very rustic and definitely check out the menswear and barber shop at the top of the alley.  Breakfast is halfway decent, and if you get there on the early side you can get a table without a wait (alternative: check out Bubby's - damn good food, grassfed beef from Fleisher's in Kingston, super cool, great coffee, awesome wait staff, and they're open all-hours on weekends...gold stars for them). Dinner tonight was a whole different story.  My girlfriend and I knew it would be quite a wait, so we braced for the two-hour wait and look forward to imbibing in some wine in the upstairs cocktail lounge.  We had the entirely disappointing cheese platter while we waited (seriously, you WILL be disappointed by this pathetic showing - save yourself the $13). We did!  It was lovely.  The wait was more than two hours, but we were having fun and the drinks kept coming so no problem.  We were finally summoned to our table, and I enjoyed the brook trout (decent, but not worth the subsequent hassle! - check out Almond NYC or Standard Grill instead) and my girlfriend's pork dish (meh - I could have done it better).  I went to use the restroom after finishing, and found my wine glass was gone. This was in the past few hours - please note the coherence and the lack of typos in this review - but the manager, a 20something young fellow ""Craig"" decided - without meeting me, without ever talking to me, without seeing me, based purely on his supernatural talents - that I was ""overserved"" and he swiped my wine glass off the table.  I asked him about it.  We stepped outside to discuss.  The bouncer in Freemans Alley, a gentleman named Mike, agreed I was perfectly reasonable about the whole affair, but nonetheless, my girlfriend left in tears and I had to take a separate cab uptown to calm her down.  She agreed my behavior was perfectly acceptable and that she was super-sensitive for other reasons.  It turns out that Craig is simply a Napoleonic third-rate latenight manager/floor-sweeper without a clue as to how either (a) the restaurant business or (b) reality more broadly operate, and somehow I got 86'd.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Finally we get to front of line and we make order for a whole pizza. Waiting a while, we finally get pizza. Our mouth's watering with delight, we each take a slice. Was like eating Totino's Pizza Roll. I was unimpressed by this Pizza. Cheese was like goat's cheese that turn sour and red meat on tops was spicy and greasey.

"These guys are incredible. I've had over a dozen different sandwiches in the last couple years and every one is solid.

I have to gnaw it off the paper like a squirrel. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for a seeded roll. Most times one half is good enough for a meal. Save the rest for later. In addition to sandwiches, they have everything you'd expect from a corner deli. Chips, candy, ice cream, soft pretzels, tons of drinks/sodas. Cigarettes. Milk. Everything. And they deliver!

Hachapuri adjaruli, the oversized bread bowl with molten cheese and raw egg (mix it quickly together at the table) was what we came for.

Like everyone said it's bigger than you would expect. The outside of it is small but once you go downstairs it opens up. The first floor is a bar and intimate for two people. It's very dark and the music makes it hard to hear everyone at the table. I went with 5 other people and we tried the chicken that was recommended. They were very big pieces and was very juicy. we tried the appetizer sampler and they are very tiny and not worth it in my opinion. The biggest hit was the risotto with a sunny side egg and filet Mignon strips. It was perfectly cooked. This place is definitely for large parties and for sharing family style. The dessert was lovely; also party sampler. We looked more like animals going after everything. Come hungry and it came out to about thirty per person which wasn't bad at all.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

Sadly it was extremely far from the mark, and to top it off discovering their ""C"" sanitary rating as we left (it was conveniently hidden behind an umbrella at the bar entrance) punctuated an all round poor experience. Went for a Sunday lunch, I initially ordered the soup and grilled cheese on sourdough, what I got was a cold tomato bisque and cheese melted onto an old hamburger bun. They were kind enough to replace the dish for me as after checking with the kitchen the waiter discovered they had run out of any bread besides the stale buns. Second time around, I ordered the vegetable flatbread. This was equally disappointing. The dough itself was good, but the soggy vegetables and the old, wilted arugula mountain on top of it was neither appealing or tasty and all but a few bites were left on the plate. The two waitstaff that were working, were scurrying around the various seating areas of the historic building and could have definitely done with some more help. The understaffing meant that we were left waiting some time to get our check to leave ... both hungry and disappointed. Hopefully they can get their kitchen, vermin issues, and staffing levels sorted as it has the building itself is worth a visit, but sadly in its current state I would venture to nearby Stone Street to fill the belly.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"You can't really go wrong with BCD!! Have tried most of the soondubu. Personal favorites are Pork and Prok & Seafood (yes its not on the menu, you can request them to change from Beef & Seafood to Pork). Who can turn down on the free complimentary sides, fish and the squid are the best!! You can ask for more if you can't get enough. We've order Seafood pancake and the Ribs before, both are great. But we won't be able to finish everything with soondubu, so i suggest you to get them if the third wheel were present! Try to get here either early or late to avoid the crowd. My girl and I always go there either 6pm or 9pm. We are able to get a table once we stepped in. Service is fast and great.

"Had a terrible experience with the male owner. I tried to bring in a group of 16 in on a Saturday afternoon. After meeting with the owner earlier in the week to make sure there we be space, I showed up with my group. My husband and I had been here before and had a positive experience. We live right around the corner and were excited to show some of our friends/family this place (most who also live in the neighborhood). All we wanted was 30 minutes to have a few pizzas, polenta bread and beers. Upon arrival, we were told that the owner forgot to mention they have a STRICT $10 minimum per person, so we couldn't sit unless we agreed to that. There was ONE table occupied and besides that the place was empty. My husband got on the phone with the owner who was completely rude and said ""sorry I have a business to run"". In my opinion, he not only lost out on at least $130 worth of business but also the chance to showcase his food to people in the neighborhood. The opportunity cost was worth more than the $30 difference. But hey, if he'd rather have an empty restaurant, so be it. I will never go to this place again just on principal alone.

"This place has fallen off my recommendations list - permanently. I have eaten here five times, and the last two times it was simply unacceptable. Cold entrées - seriously? Late apps (40 minutes) , an eye roll when we ordered something less than the most expensive wine on the menu? The dining room filled with burning oil from a malfunctioning boiler, and the response I got from the manager was ""It's not our fault"". Are you kidding me? So it's my fault for paying $500 for dinner for four? Apart from the expectations I had built up from the first three times I was there, I have been embarrassed for the last time. When the dinner tab is $40, I can accept less than stellar service. If you want to roll with the big boys, you have to have consistency. If 2 out of 5 times I have experienced major errors at this price range, and managers were unable to correct it,  all I can say is that this is a failure.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The reviews on this restaurant were so conflicting, lots of 1 STAR and 5 STAR reviews, so I gave it a shot. When I went in I was pleasantly surprised, the two complaints I had read were a short menu and poor decor. The place looks nice enough and the menu was extensive enough for my tastes. The food was good but nothing special, typical tavern fare. I went for football Sunday as they had advertised 14 televisions. When the games started up there were only 3-4 games on the 14 televisions. I asked the waitress if they could put one of the TVs on the game I wanted to watch and she said that all the 1 o'clock games were on and that she had DirecTV and thats all there was. There were at minimum THREE other games on not being played, and just repeats of the same games over and over again. Finally after asking again she had the ""DJ"" turn on the game we had come to watch. Not long after that the ""DJ"" started playing ""music"" so loud it shocked my system. I am in my mid 20's and not unfamiliar with loud football sundays at bars or loud music. The reason DJ and music are in quotes is because the ""DJ"" wasn't playing music, instead he intermittently BLARED static and what sounded like a horn in between the audio from one of the games. When I say it was loud I mean it was like having your head under the hood of a car when the horn goes off. More frustrating than a baby crying in a movie, I asked the waitress to hold part of our order because we wanted to leave. She argued with me and said because it was already placed I couldn't cancel it and get my check and leave. So we stayed for our second order (we arrived before the games some time and ordered appetizers etc). During this time the game we requested was turned OFF the TV. The waitress apologized but made no attempt to fix it and said its ""always this loud on football sunday"" I told her its not the crowd who is loud, your DJ is playing abrasive static and honking noises for no reason. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT and am telling everyone I know to avoid it. The waitress pretended to help because she wanted a tip but was snotty and rude. She also lied several times and kept telling us to ""suck it up and deal"" in other words and wouldn't let us leave and cancel our orders and get the check. After all is said and done the meal was OVER $100 and despite knowing we were upset, after complaining SEVERAL (literally, six times between trying to get the game on, trying to leave, and arguing with her about being able to leave an establishment at any time - food in hand or not) she did not take anything off the bill, didn't apologize, and didn't deserve a tip at all. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCES I HAVE EVER - EVER HAD , and I eat out a few times a week. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE DJ, HORRIBLE WAIT STAFF, RUDE, and for mediocre food it isn't worth the trouble. I am disgusted with the service I received and wouldn't go back even if the manager gave me a credit to use, it was that terrible","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I'm always on the lookout for healthy fast food restaurants in the area.  Some friends had recommended Natureworks for their fast and healthy meals.  It was a Saturday early afternoon, and I had spent most of the morning on the couch dealing with the repercussions of a night with one too many drinks.  I usually opt for an order of pad Thai and egg rolls on a day like this,but I was feeling like eating something hearty and healthy.  I ordered the Lemon Chicken Salad with two dressings on the side (oil & vinegar and fat-free Caesar).  After just 15-20 minutes, the apartment buzzer rang with good news of a food delivery.  After impatiently waiting, I knew something had to have gone wrong when more than 10 minutes had passed by.  I called Natureworks to notify them of the situation and after connecting with the delivery guy, they realized he had delivered my salad to another apartment in the building.  This bothered me quite a bit, but I understand every restaurant makes mistakes.  They brought me a new order within the next 20 minutes.  The salad was simple but it was very fresh and tasty.  The chicken was of great quantity and quality and I really enjoyed the fat-free Caesar dressing.   By early evening, my friends and I decided to order from Natureworks for a second round (don't judge, it's healthy!)  It never crossed my mind that another mistake would happen.... but IT DID.  They delivered our meals without any dressing and forgot my beverage as well. I called Natureworks again to have them deliver what they forgot and decided to speak my mind about how disappointed I was with their service.  The man on the phone didn't really seem to care at all- he basically just sighed the entire time.  It's such a shame because they really do have good, healthy and simple food and deliver in no time.  Unfortunately, they really need to step up their game with their employees- completely unprofessional and disorganized!  After all the mistakes they made in just one day, you'd think they'd provide us with a free meal.....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The tacos are amazing. I love that they use a corn tortilla shell, instead of flour (although you can request flour). It really changes the flavor of the taco for the better, and I much prefer the texture. I'm partial to the chicken, but friends have ordered the beef and the sweet potato and said it was delicious. The salsa/pico de gallo is absurdly good, and the tortilla chips are perfect (crispy, not flimsy, non-greasy, and not too salty). My only wish is that they had queso on the menu, and offered some more seating inside (I think they could manage, if they rearranged things and had a more space conscious set up).","[1.0, 0.0]"

We also shared the Asparagus wrapped with thinly sliced pork and rice cracker (special on the menu that day) -very good .. and again... a teaser! He had: Shiromaru Hakata Classic with soft boiled egg, bambu shoots, and pork belly. Expensive bowl of ramen with all the add ons.. So glad my ramen was better! I enjoyed (thoroughly) the Karaka Men with a poached egg. VERY SILKY. VERY DELICIOUS! Fantastically mouth watering. Not greasy, not overly salty like most ramen I've had. Definately the best Ramen I've had thus far. Drinks: Sapporo on tap (Yumski) and the Green Tea High (gross) For an extra $2 you can order more noodles -what a fantastic idea.. dont mind if I do. We were lucky we didnt have to wait, but I would definately wait to eat here and can understand why people do. Total including graduity came out to a shocking $86.

"my wife and I were heading toward the subway on a Sunday morning, looking to get something to eat before the long trip back home. heading up Nostrand, we saw the sign for David's Brisket and decided to give it a shot- and I'm glad we did. we had the ""house special,"" which called for a choice of meat, home fires, and eggs; we had the brisket.  we also ordered the corned beef sandwich on a roll.  as it was a bit early, the pastrami wasn't available at that time.  I can honestly say that the home fires, alone, would have been enough for a great review- they were terrific! the brisket was tasty, super tender, with just the right amount of fat included.  and the corned beef sandwich was probably even better- probably some of the best I've ever had.  it was nice getting great food in New York and not getting price gouged, too.  the place is definitely worth a trip, and we'll be sure to swing by again when we're back in the area.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The reviews of this place tend to be extreme on either end, so we had both high expectations and feared for the worst before our first visit.   No one disputes that this place scores high on originality and eco-hipness.  The two deal-killers are flavor (simply untasty, across the board) and service (inattentive, hipper-than-thou, 1 wrong item and 1 never-showed-up item out of 4 items ordered.)   Lots of adoration in other reviews about the menu, but despite its flowery wordiness, it fails to provide basic descriptions of what the food actually is.  Tokyo fro comes drenched with 2 mayonnaise-like sauces that obliterate whatever flavor was in the potato.  No mention of this in the menu, although we do learn that the dish, like, totally embodies ""the beauty that can be created when people of differing backgrounds find ways to appreciate one another.""   Oooookay.   Another head-scratcher is their approach to the ""Sushi for the masses"" menu, which our super-hip waiter informed us that the kitchen will serve, but is not included on the printed menu that you get at the restaurant.  As a result of this, we got to enjoy, for the first time ever, the ironic experience of having to download a restaurant menu on a smartphone, while sitting in the restaurant.   Originality + incompetence + high prices = arrogance.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I had dinner at BLU after reading about the restaurant in the Top 30 Meals in NJ article. We then read mixed reviews on here so we weren't sure what to expect. However, we were pleasantly surprised to say the least. This was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. From outside, the restaurant isn't anything special, but inside it is simple and classic  with a dining area that allows for plenty of space for you and your party. My boyfriend ordered the polenta app and I ordered the seafood dumplings. Both were delicious and served minutes after we placed our order. The entrees, however, blew the appetizers out of the water - something that rarely happens. I ordered the duck and it was probably one of the greatest meals I have ever had (perfectly cooked with red cabbage and a tasty fig sauce). My boyfriend ordered the salmon (with brussels sprouts and yam puree) which was fresh and perfectly cooked. We weren't necessarily in the mood for dessert, but given the quality of food, we felt we couldn't say no. At the recommendation of our waitress (who was helpful, pleasant and polite), we ordered the black olive cake with basil ice cream. AMAZING! The taste of the basil ice cream explodes in your mouth and the black olive cake is dense and delicious without being overly sweet. The icing on the cake was the delicious coffee (individual french press at the table) and the restaurant being a BYO. Our bill for 2 people was just under $100 - definitely a deal for such a delicious meal. We will definitely be back as the waitress told us that the menu changes often, reflecting seasonal ingredients and the creativity of the chef. Looking forward to our next trip!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I have many fond memories of sitting with one of my best friends at Julius Meinl in Chicago, gobbling down Viennese topfenstrudel and sipping espressos with bitter chocolate. Of course I was going to bring him to Cafe Katja upon discovering its existence. Of course.   I think schnapps are more usually a digestif, but throwing protocol to the wind, we started with it. It came room-temperature in tiny cordial glasses. Sip slowly! I enjoyed my Williams pear schnapps but my friend hated his apricot schnapps, calling it ""the strongest alcohol I've ever tasted."" And then to get rid of it, he shot it. Is that against his straight-liquor-guzzling nature or in accordance with it?! The apricot did smell nice but admittedly was kind of rough. The table next to us got HUGE steins of beer. I would skip the beer, just because of the resulting reduced stomach space for actual food! Portions are pretty big. Emmentaler sausage ($14) - In the best possible way, everything on my plate tasted like it was made with butter. Thanks, Austria!  Never have I enjoyed the solid balls of dough that Western cuisines call dumplings, but the quark (i.e. topfen) dumplings on the plate were fantastic and such a surprise, especially texturally - tender and smooth without being mushy. I also really appreciated the addition of caraway seeds to the delicious savoy cabbage (everything needs a little caraway). The sausage itself got overwhelming after awhile (I know, I know, shut up), even with their pot of spicy mustard. It's quite salty, as expected, with a consistency like kielbasa. The plate could've done with half as much sausage (come to think of it, there was only emmentaler in half the sausage...), or double the amount of starch... but that's probably my fault for eating the quark dumplings first. Trout mullerin ($17) - This came with little boiled potatoes and some buttery spinach. What little I had of the trout was fantastic. This traditional German dish is supposed to be battered with flour and pan-fried, but the filet served here had a light, barely perceptible coating.  I would not hesitate to order this next time. Spaeztle (side dish, $5) - Oh buttery, twisty, funny spaetzle. Noodles + cheese is not exactly the most interesting combination, but they even managed to make this delicious. They should've served it NOT in a shallow dish because spaetzle was bouncing around everywhere. Tip: Eat it before it gets cold. For dessert, we passed on the apfelstrudel* for the more unfamiliar topfen palatschinken ($7), served with cherry compote. It was lovely, and I usually hate crepes. Pretty much an iteration of the entire evening's meal - soft and rich with little bright hints. Notes on crowdedness: The pretty, dimly lit dining room is way bigger than Yelp reviews would suggest. There's a round bar toward the back with plenty of counter space. We came on a weekday around 6pm and only two tables were occupied. Service was tight - our waitress was friendly, attentive, and happy to explain dishes, and even showed us another table's arriving food as we perused the menu. Our food came fast, within 15 minutes of ordering. By 7:30pm the place had filled up and I believe she was covering the entire room and understandably very harried. You won't have any issues if you come early. Overall, fantastic food and a fantastic time. I very rarely find myself loving everything about a restaurant and going back for a second visit.... but I am definitely coming back here. *My browser dictionary suggests that ""apfelstrudel"" be spelled ""premenstrual."" You're welcome.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I've been a faithful customer who refers others to Artichoke since their opening. But the artichoke cheese pizza is kinda gross. And they've been steadily downsizing the size of the Sicilian pizza and I've noticed that a burnt pizza is almost the new standard. Plus their service is getting ruder. A few weeks ago, I put in an order online (new feature), and everywhere I had the option, I specified that it was for pickup. I even put it in the Notes section. 15-20 minutes later I called to see when I should pickup the order (something that I routinely ask when I order over the phone,) and the woman was so confused. She fumbled around, and then finally said that the order had just come in, so I should go in 40 minutes. Later, we walk towards the pie shop and we're almost there when we get a call from our doorman saying that there's a pizza delivery for us. One of us sprints back and gets the pie from a deliveryman who is sitting there looking at the delivery order that has a ""NOTE: pickup"" on it, wondering why they gave it to him to deliver. I'm walking home calling Artichoke asking for an explanation of why the pie was delivered even though I confirmed at several points that it was supposed to be picked up. The owner dives in on the conversation and blames me for ordering online, he blames me for checking in via phone. He is extremely unapologetic, even accusatory towards me. At one point he admits that it's a website glitch (ie, if you order online they will deliver even though there is a checkbox for delivery and I put in a special note that it was for pickup) that needs to be fixed. After a few rounds of back and forth, he asks me what I want. I say I want an apology. He says, I can't give you an apology, I have to check the delivery order first. I feel like he's calling me a liar and tell him that I generally love their pizza but their customer service stinks. He says he'll check the delivery order and call me back, that they call all customers back to check on their satisfaction. Of course, I walk home and find the delivery order with my note on it. The owner never calls me back. And guess what? I've never gotten pizza from them since, and probably never will.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Normally I don't write reviews about the restaurants I go to but I felt compelled to say something about Upstairs since it is getting such rave reviews. If you are just going out for drinks I can understand why people love this place. The bar has cool decor and a nice vibe. I watched the bartender go out to pick fresh mint from their garden to make a mojito so I have to give them credit for that. Unfortunately, dinner was a different story. I found the menu to be very limited. It is separated into two sections: small plates and large plates. Some items on the ""small plates"" list looked like meals and some looked like appetizers. When I asked the waiter, he said some were large enough to be meals. Why not differentiate between them? Personally I think they should have called them ""small plates"" and ""smaller plates."" The portions were not very generous, especially for the price. I ordered the scallops, which were very fresh and had a wonderful texture. The snap peas were also firm and fresh. The problem was that everything tasted like it was soaked in butter. The presentation was beautiful surrounded by the carrot puree but I would have liked to have more than half a handful of snap peas. I have to say that the wait staff was very friendly but there seemed to be a lot of people working for such a small dining room. I think the thing that irritated me the most about my experience was the 20% gratuity that the waiter added to the bill. I don't mean to be petty. We were a large group so I was expecting gratuity to be added but in every restaurant I've been to it has always been an 18%% tip added. The funny thing is that I normally tip 20% as a rule of thumb unless the person was horrible but this isn't Manhattan and for them to tip themselves 20% seemed a bit presumptuous. I guess they had to cover the 8 servers that were covering 6 tables. There are so many amazing restaurants in Montclair. For these prices I expect more.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Incredibly rude staff--I would never go here again. This place is NOT kid-friendly. My mother likes this restaurant so my husband and I and 15 month old son joined her along with my brother and his wife with their 6 yr old and 2.5 yr old. First the hostess scowled when we asked for a high chair. Then the hostess and waiter proceeded to ""shhhhush"" the 2 toddlers throughout the meal! With the exception of getting settled down initially, they really were not even misbehaving or raising their voice too loudly. I have NEVER been to restaurant that was not nice to children. I have brought my son to a ton of restaurants from casual to fancy and the staff is always fawning over how cute and well mannered he is. The staff here was incredibly rude and made it clear that we were not welcome. The food come out in record time--clearly they were trying to get rid of us quickly.

"TERRIBLE just about sums up both the service and the food here. First of all, expect to wait to be seated even if you have a reservation. Secondly, the waiter didn't seem like he cared at all about us. But most importantly, the steaks were awful; we ordered the NY Strip and even the premium bone in Porterhouse & Rib-Eye. I've never had steak that tasted so awful and  you can just tell that they were of low-quality and improper preparation. My advice is to AVOID THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. Waste of money.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"It's a food truck on the side of the road so no real seating. Halal Guys is a ""restaurant""/food truck that my friends recommended to me as a ""must go"" for our trip to New York. After visiting it 2 times (at 2 different locations), I believe I have a fairly good idea of what this place is like. First off, Halal Guys is one of the countless halal food places you can find in New York. Since I have not tried the other halal places (although I saw my friend try once), I can't give a perfect comparison between the few. However, I do believe it is significantly better than many other places! The items to get here are the chicken and lamb combo meal. If you are at a food truck, your order will be given to you within 2 minutes. Along with your box lunch, you will receive a couple little cups of sauce that you can add to your meal, which I highly suggest applying. After that, I believe the meal was actually not too bad. The meal I got from the food truck had a crap load of rice at the bottom, and topped off with lamb, chicken, and gyro bits. The rice is so-so cooked, but I mean considering the price (around 6 bucks), for how much food you are getting it is a great deal. One warning is DO NOT GET THE FALAFEL MEALS HERE. My friend, a vegetarian, got the meal from the food truck and was heavily disappointed by the quality of the meal. It might be better in a store, but if you are getting your meal from a food truck, def don't get the falafel cuz all you will paying 6 dollars for will be a box of rice with some badly cooked falafel balls (they taste dry as heck). In all, this place should be visited if you are in new york. Since it provides really fast service and gives you a pretty decent and pretty decently sized meal, I would recommended it to most people :) (just not vegetarians).","[1.0, 0.0]"
"To sum... generally good, but erratic.  My review may be more applicable to dieters than to anyone else. I've eaten here three times. My benchmark for judging any new Chinese restaurant is their hot and sour soup. Generally, Bao's is very good, although I've had to adjust it once or twice with a bit of vinegar. Otherwise, nice flavor and very thick with pork, tofu, and other yummies. Their chicken vegetable soup is also quite good, with tons of veggies. Otherwise, I always get one of the diet platters - steamed chicken and vegetables. You wonder, how could anyone screw this up, right? Heh, well, it's possible. They have been a bit erratic in the quality of the sauce that is provided on the side. I think it has been different all three times I've gotten this dish, and most recently, on a Tuesday, they provided no sauce at all, only a little tub of soy sauce, so I had to make my own! Also on this Tuesday, it was heavy on the broccoli and very light on the chicken. (On this same day, they also screwed up my order, giving me a small rather than large soup. Of course I was at home and not feeling well when I realized it, so didn't fight it.) No one was in there on a Tuesday, not even kitchen staff! I think i would advise avoiding it on this day, and maybe stick to the high volume days (Thurs-Sun) when full staff is on duty. Generally, though, perfectly acceptable Chinese food in West Haven.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This is probably the best high end restaurant in downtown Hartford. A little pricey, but very good food and the new manager wanted to make every guest feel right at home. I ordered a steak and added a lobster tail to it. I asked for some drawn butter, our waiter took the plate back and returned with their ""lobster hollandaise"" sauce poured directly over it. I didn't complain since it was very good, but when the manager asked about the service I did mention this incident and she literally forced us to accept a new lobster tail even though we had already eaten the other one. Seriously in this day and age how many restaurants do that? None that I have been to before, but if anyone knows of such a place PM me please because those are the kinds of places I like to frequent. Anyway will definitely be back because you can't beat the food, you can't beat the service and that is a one-two punch.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Pork chop is really easy to overcook, but at Osteria morini is was perfectly, with this marinated crispy glaze on top.  It's the one restuarant I will crave, especially on a cool crisp day in the fall, or a snowy winter when I need some hearty pasta(which is SO reasonably priced!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Princeton has many eateries and the latest addition to the list is 30burgers... Now we are vegetarians and my husband and I usually steer clear of burger joints, because there aren't many choices in the menu to pick from.  So imagine our surprise when we just stepped in for a lark to ""check"" the menu out and saw so many different veggie options!!!  My husband ordered the Athens burger and I ordered the Black bean one.  And both we're amazing! The black bean was outta this world.... Spicy and full of flavor...  Best part is both burgers had distinct flavors and weren't your run-of-the-mill usual veggie-soy burger.  Apart from what we ordered, there are other paninis and salads to choose from... So this is definitely a burger joint that even vegetarians can enjoy.  Do make sure to order their seasoned spicy fries!!! Yummmmmyyyyy!  The staff is very pleasant and offers their suggestions on what to pick...(they do have an extensive menu).  The restaurants also has tables outside. ....

At the suggestion of Diane, I had the flounder stuffed with crabmeat on a bed of gingered spinach which was also delicious!

"So, we've ordered from this place like a bajillion times since I last reviewed-- their al pastor tacos were so addictive! However, as another reviewer mentioned, they recently made some changes that we aren't too happy with. First off, they raised their prices. In terms of the tacos, they seem to justify this by ""including"" cheese and sour cream in the price. Only problem is, one of the things I liked best about the tacos was that they DIDN'T have sour cream and cheese-- they were like the ones I actually had in Mexico. Now, they put a slab of cheese on it and raise the price by several dollars--not cool! Their menu is bigger, with more tex-mex stuff on it, lunch specials, etc. but I liked the smaller menu! We're really bummed about these changes and we hope they'll go back to the way they were! Or at least offer 2 styles of food, mexican and tex-mex, so customers can choose what they want to pay for.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The Place: Took my girlfriend to Skara Estiatorio for Dinner Saturday night at 6:15. The place was about ¼ full when we arrived. We were greeted with a smile and asked if we would like to check our coats. We were seated at a table near the front. The place isn't large, but we certainly didn't feel like we were on top of the next table. In a shocking development, they actually had Salt and Pepper shakers on the table!! Lately it seems that every restaurant we go to we have to ask for them. Oh, and the salt was ""Himalayan Sea Salt""... in case you're into that. The place was well lit (we could read the menus without the help of a flashlight app), clean and while I wouldn't consider it an overly romantic spot, it wasn't very noisy either.   The Staff: Our server was Andrea. She was extremely helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and apparently tried every item on the menu. It's important that we don't feel rushed, as reviewing the menu items can take us about an hour..... at any rate, we never felt rushed and by the time we got around to ordering our main course (it's a BYOB, by the way), the place had pretty much filled up. The owner came over to our table on more than one occasion during dinner and seemed genuinely interested in our experience. Great guy, super nice. The Food: We ordered two appetizers - the Skara Eggplant and the Wrapped Feta. The eggplant was a bit bland, but still tasted good. The Wrapped Feta was outstanding. For our main course, we both ordered one of the specials. We ordered the Moshari Stifado - (braised beef) and the Lamb Shank Lemonato which is severed over potatoes. Both were delicious and tender. The portion size was more than adequate. The Moshari Stifado was large enough to allow half to be taken home. For dessert our server recommended the Eck-Mek... it's like a firm custard with whipped cream (homemade of course), over a unique crust that I really can't explain. It was covered with Caramel. Fantastic!! Highly recommend it. In summary, I highly recommend Skara Estiatorio and will definitely go again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The food at Rubamba is world's better than their food carts. The food at the cart is delicious, don't get me wrong..but the actual restaurant blows them out of the water. The price at Ay! Arepa is significantly cheaper, but the quality is now significantly less. Worth noting, the cart no longer has pico de gallo (at least they haven't the last few times I went, and it's crossed off of their menu, so one can assume..) and in it's place they used sauteed onions. Mehhhhhh. It does the job, but it no longer satisfies my Rubamba craving, which is unfortunate. I feel like the reasoning behind these small changes were due to people complaining that the food at the cart vs. the brick & mortar were exactly the same for 1/3 of the price. Well, now they're no longer exactly the same. Wah. Good going, guys. In a nutshell, I'll still come here once in a while. It's good. It's cheap. But nowhere near as good as Rubamba.

"If there's one place I wouldn't mind eating every week, it's Bibou. The food is outstanding, the servers are very nice, and it's a BYOB so you can bring your own alcohol. It even has free parking! Plus, how many restaurants give you the opportunity to talk to and thank the chef after your meal? Chef Pierre Calmels and his wife and hostess Charlotte are the nicest people and they're always genuinely happy to see you. Be forewarned, though. Because Bibou is so good, you will likely not get a table without a reservation and, even if you do, you'll have to be happy with whatever table you get because the place is small, cramped with too many tables in its space, and is as popular as Le Bec-Fin used to be. Why? The obvious answer is Chef Calmels. He is possibly our area's finest French chef having been executive chef at Le Bec-Fin for five of his eight years there. His sous chef at Bibou was also a chef at Le Bec-Fin. Bibou serves extraordinary French food at reasonable prices and without any of the pretentiousness that turns off a lot of people from French restaurants. My boo and I each ordered the Foie Gras Duo for our appetizers. Can you believe it? Two preparations of foie gras! Foie gras port wine crème brulée and seared foie gras with sautéed fig in a red wine, campari gastrique sauce. The taste of the crème brulée might be a turnoff for those expecting their crème brulée to be the usual boring sweet vanilla variety, but this was a marvelous version made with my favorite organ meat. The seared foie gras sat atop a small piece of sweet toast that was very much like French toast. The accompanying sauce tasted very much like maple syrup. Both preparations reminded me of a decadent breakfast. For our entrées, I had the braised veal cheeks, rutabaga purée, turmeric spaetzle, fava beans, and sundried tomato, and he had the poached red snapper roulade with pasta au gratin, baby arugula, and almonds. I sampled the red snapper and it was delicious, prepared in a porchetta style. Add Bibou to the list of places that serve items in an elegant porchetta style! My veal cheeks were simply the best entrée I've ever had the pleasure of eating at Bibou... and I've had quite a few meals here. I have to say that their Pied de Porc, which is braised pig foot stuffed with foie gras, has gotten plenty rave reviews, but is not my thing. There was just too much gelatinous fat for me and too many lentils in the dish. I've had the distinct pleasure of enjoying Bibou's soft shell crabs, a summer dish, on three occasions with marks of good to excellent each time. I've also had their bone marrow, a divine entrée that only a foodie like me will understand. Craig Laban of the Philadelphia Inquirer calls it ""caveman cuisine at its most decadent, and so primally good, like eating Satan's stuffing."" As good as all of these entrées were, none compared to the gorgeous dish in front of me last night. Oh, it is an ugly-looking dish by most standards, this braised veal, but it is gorgeous in its flavors, textures, and aromas that simply define good comfort food for the soul. Chef Calmels told me he wanted to make it more stew-like for the season. I like his thinking. If only I could eat this while sitting in front of my television watching the Eagles on Sundays!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Have to say, believe the hype about the Vetri restaurants--at least Vetri and Osteria, the two I've been to...

I have been to Osteria about 5 times and have never been disappointed or had a less-than-excellent anything there. Typically, I don't care much about service, just food. However, the last visit (9/24/12) requires some mention of the wonderful people we had waiting on us.  Steven was our server and his knowledge of every dish, the way it's made, and his fun/elegant manner made the evening so enjoyable.  The young man bringing our bread ( from whom one doesn't usually expect much product knowledge), Adam, was able to answer a specific question about the ingredients in a dish we had.  Even Christina, the girl filling our water, was attentive, wonderful to talk to, and could tell us details about and advise us on wine!

The food is ALWAYS consistently phenomenal. Also, the lobster friend rice is out of this world.   I wish I lived in Philly again. Miss this place desperately! Make it a MUST on your business trip to Philly!","[1.0, 0.0]"
Fantastic take out. Been coming here for years. The pizza is fantastic as is anything I have ever ordered. Especially the boneless wings calzones and chick parm subs. They're subs are just as good as the pizza. Which means great.  Pizza rolls aren't like the mystery meat toaster strudel that you normally think of when you hear the term pizza roll. The pizza is delicious crispy thin crust and the tomato sauce is tangy. A meatball pizza from here is like crack.,"[1.0, 0.0]"

"We happened to be at CHOP today, taking my son for a doctor's appointment, and decided to so something fun after and checked out how close this place was to the hospital - we were in luck - right around the corner. We all had different burgers - they all were up there with some of the best we have ever had.  The fries were just awesome - crispy, not greesy, just perfectly salted.  My mouth is watering and I want more already.  I loved the fries!  The onion rings were good.  Milkshake was good. A few different sauces at the table to try on the fries and burgers - I expected them to be spicy (they were not) but they were tasty and I liked trying them all.  The burger sauce was the best, to us. It was spotless, the service was super friendly and nice.  Trendy decorations.   It was about $45 bucks for 3 burgers, 2 fries, 1 onion ring, 2 sodas and 1 milkshake.   We would certainly go back.  It was worth it - it was much better than average.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I would rate it a 3 1/2 actually=)  But since I can't I'm going to round up to 4. Bread that came was good.  The part that was unique is a eggplant tapenade that was quite tasty. Appetizer was calamari fries.  My wife and I thought we would try something different.  It's basically calamari in the shape of a mozzarella stick.  Same breading, calamari is thicker than the rings.  It was slightly over fried.  I prefer the rings which are more lightly breaded. Entrees were a pork chop (bone-in) with long peppers and potatoes.  Pork chop was tender and flavorful.   The long peppers make it spicy with a kick so if you don't like spicy don't get this.  Black linguine had crab and flavorful shrimp with some spinach. The flavoring was good.  I personally like pasta that is adente because the pasta is made with squid ink it does have a softer texture.  So if you're not into that then don't get it.  My wife loved it. Dessert - tiramisu was light and tasty.  Gelato included some flavors I haven't commonly seen  - rice pudding and raspberry chocolate.   Service was good although when the dining room got busy - it started to lag. I would definitely come again - but it is quite pricey.  $100 (w/o tip) includes one app, two entrees, one kids meal, soda/juice and two desserts.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"So, after driving through NY/NJ, we definately had to stop by philly to get a real cheesesteak.  I had recommendations to go to Pats / Ginos / Jims... but my buddy said his local PA friends recommended this place.   We ended up here and got served fairly quickly and the lady at the counter was very nice.  I was actually quite surprised to see the steak all chopped up into bits and pieces... I'm not sure if this is something that a lot of cheesesteak places do it but it was kind of weird.   Of course we ordered our steaks with wiz and while it was decent, i wasn't amazed.  I definately walked out of there full and happy but couldn't help but think, maybe we should've tried one of the more ""famous"" spots. So, I wanted to give 2.5 stars but i had to lean towards the 2 stars. Maybe my expectations were too high?  maybe there wasn't enough cheese wiz in the sandwich?  maybe we should've gone elsewhere to experience a true philly cheese steak..?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Pros: Great broth, great ramen! Love the spicy sesame oil! Cons: Cramped up space Ippudo UNDERwhelmed me and Totto OVERwhelmed me! Be mindful that this place is really small. Fits about 20 people max at a time? I waited almost an hr to get in @ 3:30pm on Sat afternoon. Was the wait all worth it? YES! I ordered their Niku Ramen(Meat lover's ramen, $15) with the spicy sesame oil and the pork bun($3) and my bf got the Extremely spicy ramen ($10? $12?). The bun came out fast so it's a good starter to order to fill u up before the ramen comes out. If you are some serious meat lover, try the NIKU! It's got some serious loads of thick pork slabs and although the slabs may look tough, they are super juicy and tender! To the disgrace of all the meat lovers out there, I had to give up some of the meats to my bf... The portion is HUGE too. I mixed in their so-called extremely spicy sesame oil stuff but to my taste, it was NOT that extreme. Just enough heat to kick ur taste buds but that was about it. Don't be scared and just go for it if you like things spicy. :) The broth is definitelly impressive. Very rich, deep in flavor. It was worth all of the $15 and more. Would I come back here? Oh yes! and I will get the Niku Ramen AGAIN! :)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place surprised me greatly. It was already quite packed at 5:30pm on Thurs, not what I expected in this part of Midtown, my old work stomping ground. Could've be the networking event hosted that night, though. The drink specials are $5 for select beers/wine and $6 for select specialty cocktails, respectively. I had the Bohemian Rhapsody specialty with Bombay Sapphire, St. Germaine, cucumber and some other ingredients. Though I suspect it came in a smaller glass than usual, it was a refreshing and just the light but kind of powerful cocktail I was hoping for. My friend and I also ordered food: the Grilled Pizza with Pancetta. I thought the dough was a bit much and the pancetta extra crispy like burnt bacon, but who doesn't love ANY form of bacon?! (Oh vegetarians huh...) It was still a tasty combination and did its job to line the stomach. Though my rating is conservative (if only there were a 3.5 button!), I really did quite like the place. The bartenders and other staff knew how to not take themselves too seriously, and some were actually quite engaging (shout out to Sean). It has a Murray Hill vibe with all the suits I saw, which would suck in actual Murray Hill, but for some reason works here. From experience I know going for drinks in the 55th to 63rd ish area from B'way on west can be such a pain. There's nothing cheap but still clean, classy, and responsible young professional friendly in this area. I suspect this could be changing some, and Ivy's a sign of that change, so I hope they keep the good downtown vibes going. I'll be back for sure if I'm around again!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Because I love this place, I took my mom there this afternoon. What started out as a disaster led to a wonderful lunch. I ordered the vegan hot dogs as I usually do. My mom got the salmon sandwich. I bit into my hot dog and spit it out immediately upon realizing that it was beef. I'm a vegetarian. Uh oh. I notified the waitress, she apologized and my food was brought out. It was delicious as usual, but I was pretty upset by the experience because it was my first bad experience of any kind at Westville and I was definitely let down. She offers my mom and I a complimentary dessert. I thought this was the extent of the apology but was still gracious. We ordered an apple pie and I got a coffee. Then, she brought us the check. We were only charged for my mom's sandwich. The total was twelve dollars. I was shell shocked. What would have been a meal costing over thirty dollars, was twelve dollars. I thanked the waitress so much because I was genuinely happy to know that the business really cared about its reputation and its relationship with its customers. I commended her on her professionalism and her graciousness. I wish I caught her name but I can attribute the gestures of apology only to the business as a whole. I was honestly doubting whether I would back into the restaurant after being served a beef dog after clearly ordering a vegan one, but now I know that I don't have to fear mistakes because they will take care of business.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend pitched this to me today and I said do they have turkey burgers (primarily because I feel bad for the cows - shhh I don't want to hear it) So despite feeling bad for the cows I do have a soft spot for cows and a good burger - nice contradicting myself but whatever. I like the fact that you wait in line for your burger and whatever that ale was my friend ordered for $2.50 a piece was delightful. Lets focus on the $2.50 for a minute -where in this day and age, let alone in a major metropolitan city such as New York of all places can you get a Burger for $6.00 and a beer for $2.50 - WHAT that is unheard of. Oh and the beer is not Pabst or Rainier it's actually good ale...McSoley I'm sorry bad with names but it's one that sounds like that. So yeah despite the fact I feel bad for the cows that was lovely. However I maybe should have protested to the ale and ordered a Manhattan because lets face it until you've had a Knob Creek Manhattan and  a burger you don't know what living the good life is. Okay you know how to live the good life but we're talking about burger combos so run with it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

Yet another over hype place.  We dropped a $100+ bucks and were left wanting more.  Portions were small and nothing was spectacular.  We always get the salmon at every sushi place we go so I feel we have a good palate for it.  It was ok; certainly not the best and certainly not worth the money.  Service was good and the place has a cool feel to it.  I just felt we would have gotten more bang for the buck elsewhere.,"[0.0, 1.0]"

We had dinner last night at Matthew's and I can't say enough GREAT things.  Matt was incredibly welcoming and made us feel very comfortable.  We had perfectly made large martinis at the bar which we finished at our table. Our server, Martine, is a very friendly, efficient and happily familiar face for us from his days at Bella Napoli.  It's great to connect with him again. Matt sent over an appetizer special that was incredible.  It was a stack of roasted (?) vegetables topped with mozzarella and surrounded by toasted pignoli nuts and a delicious balsamic reduction. Next we shared a delicious fresh seafood salad in a lemon vinaigrette dressing.  BTW, the bread is also fantastic. I had the highly recommended Filet Mignon with roasted potatoes, string beans and a red wine sauce.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was delicious and perfectly cooked (medium rare). My partner had a Surf and Turf special which was a NY Strip topped with 3 Jumbo Shrimp, Scampi Style over a bed of fluffy perfectly prepared mashed potatoes.  This was also delicious and perfectly cooked (rare in this case). Martine recommended a special Cabernet that was not on the very nice wine list which was the perfect accompaniment. We shared a dessert which was a special last night.  It was a delicious homemade Lemon Cake served with fresh whipped cream.  It was really good. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, Matt and his staff.  Get there as soon as you can.  We'll definitely be back soon. Thanks again for a great night. Michael","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Yes, i am giving only one star. I was googling ""best Pancake in NYC"" on an early Sunday morning because i haven't had pancakes in a very long time and i felt like looking for a place that has a real homemade pancake like i would do them at home. So ""Clinton Bakery"" popped up and my partner and i made us on our way to Clinton St. A very long line of annoyed/waiting people in front of their cafe welcomed us. The hostess inside informed us that the waiting time will be 2,5 h if we want a table. The hostess yelled into the crowd for everyone to keep them posted.  I had to say "" i'll pass"" and we've decided to have breakfast somewhere else. All other people remained strong and wanted to keep waiting. The long waiting time made me feel the pancakes there must be really good. Two months later we called Clinton Bakery spontaneously in order to ask how long the waiting time would be and they said 1,5 h. ( both times on the weekend) Last week by coincidence i had an appointment at Clinton St so i just walked across the street on a late Sunday afternoon to Clinton Bakery and the waiting time was then ""only"" 45 min. My partner and i wanted to try it out this time. Finally after waiting the 45 min we got seated and I've ordered:  (""Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter, Wild maine blueberry, banana walnut, or chocolate chunk  $14"" ) as written on the menu. I got asked what i want and i mistakenly thought there is at least blueberries or a banana included  I  said want the  ""chocolate chunk"". 15 min later. I got served a high pile of layered pancakes with chocolate chips inside and i must say the pancakes were the worst and cheapest diner quality i ever ate in my life. The pancakes are made of some kind of instant powder maybe such as ""Aunt Jemima"", and tasted terribly dry and the flavor wasn't good either of course. Actually the pancakes had were abolutely flavorless. it was hard to swallow it down.  The chocolate chips were soft end melted inside but that did not help. It came with a creamy caramel sauce on the side  too less to overcome this dryness and the pancakes were hard to eat. I noticed after 5min that i had to add much more syrup, in order to be able to eat it. ( i actually dont like too much sugar) My boyfriend said in the same moment:"" Is your pancake also this bad as mine? and we both agreed on, that the "" best Pancakes "" as written in new York Times are not made at Clinton Bakery. Then you can also take the time and go to one of the Irish Diners in Sunnyside, Queens. There you would really get a 3 times better prepared "" instant powder"" pancake and they make it taste softer with a rich flavor and serve you a richer or nicer decoration with more exciting ingredients. ( a bit ice cream ,or fruits, whip cream, or anything else.) The pancakes at Clinton Bakery were utmost simple. The other pancakes at Clinton Bakery come only with some blueberry sauce and blueberries, maybe the artificial caramel sauce on the side. Or just banana and walnut etc. Hope this helps to give you an authentic impression. I haven't tried a burger there and we won't come back. The waiting times are so or so uneccaptable, especially if it gets colder outside.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Bistango was one of the first gluten free pasta places in NYC with good food and that did not get me sick.  Its so nice to go into places that actually know what gluten is. The ambience feels kind of casual even though they put out candles in the evening and dim the lights.  The food is so good that I journeyed from the upper east side after 10pm one night on a bicycle just to get there gluten free spinach & feta stuffed ravioli pasta in a creamy white sauce to go. The dilemma to all of this is that I did not have a chain for my bike and by the time I got there at 10:30pm, the restaurant was starting to close.  One of the servers told the manager that I was outside desperate to order.  The manager was so nice that he had the servers leave one of the outdoor tables and chairs for me to stay with my bike while they made my food.  They gave me warm gluten free bread with water while I waited near the side entrance and they checked on me from time to time. I always have good service when I eat inside but this was them going above and beyond.  I love the food and the flour-less cake is to die for.  This is the perfect spot for food, cocktails, and dessert completely gluten free.","[1.0, 0.0]"

The Sashimi selection was so fresh and delicious and the rolls were bursting with flavors and textures that really made everything about the dinner enjoyable.

We used to order the mascarpone cheesecake on every visit but the last 3 times, it came out sans the walnut shortbread at the bottom.  If I write my congressman, do you think I could get it added back on to the dessert?  Oh well, it just gives me a reason to walk up to Capo Giro for gelato after dinner -- the extra blocks qualify as exercise, right?","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The Dream It was a stunning Saturday morning in Philly, the sun bright, the air brisk....... and all I could think of was a warming bowl of soup.   Having dined at Morimoto for the first time a few days ago my trip to Philly for work and dine was off to an amazing gustatory high.  Then,  re-visiting one of my favorite steakhouses added to the elation. I'm beautifully sated and now, I wanted to warm my engines to the tune of something liquid,  hot, and in a bowl.   Nothing else.  All I could think of was the Yelpeviews of Nan Zhou.   And honestly, I was prepared for a letdown before walking into NZ.  The rave reviews made my mind go south (it's the Rule Breaker in me).   But my Yelp conscience did a double-take,  smacked me into thinking so many Yelpers can't be wrong.  So off I went.   I walked in and found le restaurant packed and as soon as I queued in, 500 people followed behind me.  Score! The Reality Because I was dining solo, I was offered a spot on a communal table.  There were two things I wanted to try here:  the beef brisket soup and the peanut sauce noodles (reviewed by Yelper Jordan).  MMmmmmmm.  Hand-drawn pasta, there's nothin' sexier.  My mind and palate were tingly from being prepped by the Yelpeviews.  I ordered the beef brisket soup.  When it came I saw peeking through the soup was lots of Chinese celery and immediately,  my palate went to fifth gear  Restaurants rarely use this herb which to me changes the flavor profile of any soup, dry or not.  And  dear Yelp almighty, my palate soon was treated to silky, soft, firm noodles, so perfectly soft you'd think they'd break or fall apart.  They didnt, unless you cut them with your teeth.  I can't say I have experienced this before, even with the dearth of amazing Chinese options in the SGV and SoCal.  I've never had Chinese noodles so oozy soft and tender but held together no matter how high you picked them up with your chopsticks.   The brisket was so well made, it didn't fall apart as I expected but it was tender.  Four around $6, the beef brisket portion was really generous.   The texture of the tender firm brisket contrasted to the soft pillowy noodles gave my mind a solid ahhhhhhhhh moment.   Finally the broth was layered with generous Chinese celery which to me, sealed and completed the dish.   The Letdown The soup was quite delicious but  I expected more.  It didn't have the hours if not days worth of development.  I dont think they used enough bone marrow or soup bones to add the layer of umami  I craved.  The dish would have been perfect but still, very very good.  Some might argue, you're not dining at Morimoto cut them some slack.  I beg to differ.   If the soup were made with hours of care and development, it would have been perfect whether it's $6, $60 or $600 a bowl.   Reality Check. My experience with the famed beef brisket noodles soup dish was solid:   my senses and palate were so sensually excited I almost Yelped right there.... But Nah, ""I got class!""   My neighbor, sporting a Japanese passport,  ordered the same dish.  He slurped his noodles in true Japanese style and literally finished in 2 1/2 flat.  Not  a drop of broth was left on the bowl.  He walked off into the brisk morning with  a half smile, wiping the sweat from his neck.  My neighbor couple on the other side  perplexed me.  They too ordered the same soup.  They were slurping their noodles in complete slowmo as though they were slurping each bite frame by frame.  In hindsight, I read someplace this is another, if not correct way of eating  hand drawn noodles in soup:  the broth and noodles are savored slowly.  They walked off into the morning as though this meal was a part of their ritual. I finished my soup,  my soul warmed and umamied, I walked off into the sunny morning lovin' simplicity in a bowl of soup. There's nothing like a gorgeous sunny brisk day in Philly to get your Nan Zhou ON! Visits: 1  (more to follow)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This place is around the corner from me, so I had to check it out. first time, get a falafel, not bad, but not great. Second time, get a gyro. Take one bite- pickles and cabbage. I don't know where the owners are from, or what type of sick concoction this is- but under no circumstances should there ever be pickles or cabbage anywhere near a gyro. I eat it because I'm a poor college kid, but felt thoroughly betrayed by my food. Some months go by, I say to myself ""lets give this place another chance."" This time I wisely order my gyro without pickles or cabbage, because the rest wasn't that bad last time. The place was packed and it took me a good 15 minutes to get my gyro. I finally escape the sweatbox of an interior that place has, and start heading home. I decide to unwrap my sandwich from the foil and take one bite. Pickles. Cabbage. what the hell. I didn't want to go back in because the guy at the register was already surly enough. Will not be returning there, three trips is three too many. How can a Mediterranean food place mess up a gyro?","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Happy Birthday to me! I don't know about you, but my friends and I always end up celebrating my birthday in what I call birthday week/month...aka massive amounts of celebration! On my actual birthday, my boyfriend took me to Gramercy Tavern! We've wanted to try it for awhile but never found the time/occasion. It was delicious! The ""Tavern"" part of it is definitely more casual and behind the curtains in the main dining room, you'll usually find more of a business casual atmosphere. We were started with a cheese puff that had a rich and creamy center with a slight crunch with the shell. I opted for the Beef Fazzoletti (I had to google image this!) which was big sheets of pasta with a ragu-y beef and carrot sauce. It packed a bunch in terms of flavor. My bf ordered the Ruby Red Shrimp with beans and kale. His dish was much lighter than mine, but the shrimp were fresh and tender. For our entrees, I ordered the Arctic Char and he the Pork Loin & Belly. My Arctic Char was amaaaaazzzinnggg. I am generally not a huge fan of non white colored fish like Salmon because they tend to be too fishy for me. However, the Arctic Char was prepared perfectly! Definitely get it medium rare because the fish will melt in your mouth like a piece of chocolate. My bf's Pork Loin & Belly was equally good, but definitely more hearty. I didn't love the pickled vegetables that came with it. I thought it had a strange after taste, but the pork was delectable. For dessert I ordered the mint ice cream. This is not your store bought mint (chocolate chip) ice cream. This tastes like you ripped of a sprig of mint and then started chewing it with a dollop of frozen cream. The little brownies and stuffed raspberries that came with it were super cute! My bf got the warm chocolate bread pudding, which kinda resembled a chocolate lava cake - just as rich but not as dense with a whole lot of dark chocolate flavor. All in all dinner was perfect! Service was attentive and the food was above par. I would definitely recommend coming here for any special occasions!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hadnt really heard much about this little spot til restaurant week but.. wow. What a great place to have so close. Small, yet very professional and relaxed feel. The food was phenomenal. I started with the calamari appetizer and my husband with the buffalo springroll- both so full of flavor! The broccoli rabe ravioli was delicious as well as the fried oreo dessert. And we also got to enjoy our favorite wine we brought. Kevin, the owner/chef also came to chat and ensure we enjoyed our experience which I thought was a nice personal touch. He also described how the menu changes every so often, so we'll definately be back to try some new plates. Bravo Entree!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Something I have learned about Philadelphia is that it's a good idea to have one or two go-to places in every neighborhood for the categories of: booze, brunch, coffee, and a quick, cheap meal. The one I struggle with the most is brunch, because if there's one thing Philadelphia loves, it is brunch. This makes it hard to find a spot where you can go on short notice, not have to wait for hours to be seated, and still get consistently good food. EGG is a godsend of a brunch spot for me - in my neighborhood and therefore easily walkable, accessible (see: not waiting for a seat for days), good food, and good prices. EGG was my Room of Requirement: I needed it one day, and it was there. Definitely going to have to go back for this dollar oyster night I have heard so much about!","[1.0, 0.0]"
"It is 3.5 but I tend to leave it as 3 stars. Frankly, I was a bit disappointed. Prob because I had a high expectation based on the chef's background -EMP vet and Mike C's review. And probably because I picked the wrong seat - at the bar as I usually did when dinning alone: since the restaurant is small the kitchen entrance was right in front of me so the whole night I was watching people running around. Not what I expected while I want a peaceful dinner. I stop whining here, onto the food. Overall is good with space to improve. I got the watermelon salad with ricotta and crispy farros to start, which was one of the most creative dish of that night. The watermelon was, well, as watermelon should be - juicy, sweet and fresh, and perfectly balanced with the creamy ricotta and crunchy farro. Only small complaint, the chunk was too big that I had to cut it into 4 smaller squares. Not a deal breaker. I could not finish as I was saving space for the two small dish - softshell crab and octopus. The softshell crab looked lovely until I start cutting it - the batter was too thick and too crisp that I could not taste the crab at all. The burrata, as a side of the dish, however, was the highlight.  I had better softshell crab else where.   Charred octopus with pork xo, brown butter foam. This dish was well executed. The pork xo (I think is some sort fried beacon crumb) was slightly crunchy and very savory. The brown butter, rich and buttery. Good, but not good enough to draw me back on its own. Dessert, yeah they just added to the menu, was sundae with yuzu peel, berries. Honestly, passable. I do like the decor, especially the Edison light bulbs hanging in the dinning room. The vibe is typical alphabet city type, lively, eclectic. Service was attentive though felt lukewarm at times. One thing I want to call out, they did not recommend me to switch wine after the salad, though a good manager should know the food coming the table did not go well with the first wine I ordered. It was myself told them that I needed to switch wine. I am not trying to pick on anyone but a good restaurant should know that. Being new is not an excuse. All in all, was a fine. Since I have not tried any entree, I think I will give it a second try in the next month or two. PS it is small so make a reservation.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went here last year for my mom's birthday and if it was closer to where I live, I'd definitely go here more often. The decor was really nice and the lighting was just perfect. We had a pretty huge meal and every one of the dishes we ordered was very flavorful, well-balanced, and perfectly spiced: -Moo Ping - sliced marinated pork. Typically, I avoid pork at Thai restaurants because I don't like how it's prepared but this was delightful. The pork was tender and the marinade was really good. -Goong Tod - again, the shrimp were very well-cooked and the sauce accompanied the shrimp really well -Kao Pad Mie Thai - Special/House Fried Rice. One of the better fried rice dishes I've had and frankly I would eat these on its own -Pad Kee Mao - now if you see my other reviews, you'll know that I'm totally biased towards this dish and it was definitely very good in terms of flavor, serving size and balance -Pad King Sod - ginger sauce and I believe we had this with chicken. Again, a pleasant surprise because the chicken was very well cooked -Moo Tod Ka Tiem - crispy fried pork - again really tasty -Ped Siam - duck!! I wasn't a fan of duck for a long time but this duck was very well-cooked. I don't really remember if we got dessert or anything vegetarian but they did have several options for vegetarians (and very yummy looking ones, not just salads). Our server was really sweet and friendly but a bit inattentive (in terms of refilling glasses). Frankly the service and the fact that I find some of their items overpriced is the only reason I'm taking away one start but... Bottomline: for a special occasion, this place is really nice and has an extensive (and tasty!) selection of dishes.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I'm a huge pizza snob and have frequented many spots in nyc and am constantly on the hunt for top-quality pies. Yes there are endless amounts of neopolitan pie places to choose from. Sottocasa is my number one go-to right now...for neopolitan style. (Don't get me wrong, i still prefer Di Fara's new york style pizza above all). My favorite pie is the boscaiola since i prefer meat as a topping. The pies are substantially sized compared to other neopolitan joints and the taste is impressive. It's authentic italian from the owners to the customers which is always a plus. Nice cozy environment too as it is situated in the basement of a brownstone very fitting to what sottocasa means in italian.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If it's 1:30 am, you're extremely drunk, and you happen to be in the marginally safe neighborhood of Sisson Avenue Pizza House, then stop in for a slice.  Otherwise, it's really not worth the trip.  It's the kind of pizza you can enjoy while drunk, but when you try it in the sober light of day, well, it's a comparable sensation to waking up next to the person you brought home as a result of your beer goggles. The wraps aren't very good either.  They are small, they cost about $7.00 without fries, and the ingredients don't taste very fresh. If given the choice between stopping at a gas station and buying assorted snacks OR visiting Sisson Avenue Pizza House, I'd choose the gas station with a smile.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Amid our two-and-a-half-hour wait for pizza at the universally acclaimed DiFara's. I was so unimpressed by the customer service experience, which left would-be diners lined up three deep at the counter for at least 25 minutes without a single order taken. But it was completely worth it. We watched Dominic DeMarco painstakingly craft each pizza by hand, using three cheeses, freshly snipped basil and olive oil. We cursed those ordering multiple pies. We listened to the ringing phone go unanswered. We scoffed at those who popped into the pizzeria to ask, 'How long?' After a while, it was like magic to watch DeMarco custom-create each pizza from scratch, as he has been doing for more than 50 years. It no longer mattered that we had spent half the afternoon tucked away in a dingy, greasy little restaurant in Midwood, Brooklyn. Skeptical as every good native New Yorker (and pizza aficionado) should be, I bit into that first slice ready to find fault after waiting TWO-AND-A-HALF HOURS. But there was none. It was perfection.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"If you are looking for a nice Italian restaurant to take a friend (you have a slight interest in, but not enough interest to date) to dinner, Picclo Angolo is the place to go.  I called in a day before to RSVP which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  My friend and I went on a Saturday night at 8pm and the place was jammed packed, every seat taken.  It seemed like most customers RSVP'd because there was no waiting line (except for us) and NO WAITING AREA. We were standing in front of the door for 10 minutes patiently waiting and staring at the customers hinting them to quickly eat and leave (I bet you do that too).  After all, we did have reservations.  The AMBIANCE of the restaurant was dim lighted with candles and VERY WARM in presence.  Note the seats are very close together so be expected to listen in on stranger's conversations throughout the night perhaps dine with them. Once we sat down the server politely introduced himself and provided us the menu.  He also brought FRESH GARLIC BREAD straight-out-of-the-over.  We devoured it and asked for more which he gladly provided.  We ordered LINGUINE WITH CLAMS and FETTUCCINE AL PESTO.  Both dishes were FANTASTICO- the linguine with claims more so because of the generous portion of clams and the divine clam essence in the sauce.  The noodles were soft and slightly chewy, cooked to perfection.  I was not a big fan of the fettuccine because of the thickness of the sauce, however my friend enjoyed it. I rarely order pasta at restaurants because it is overpriced (noodles at the super market costs $2 for 4 servings of pasta and $4 for a can of sauce), but Piccolo Angolo was well worth the money.  The pasta cannot be recreated at home and I strongly recommend those who love linguine with clams to try it!","[1.0, 0.0]"

The second time I called for pickup and they said the same thing, so I ordered something else. This place is weird, that dish is a staple, and what's the big deal about stocking a traditional ingredient? It's cheap and a shortcut, but I'm not spending my money there anymore. Not because of the noodles but because the food doesn't taste anything more than sweet. Maybe I just don't like thai...","[1.0, 0.0]"

I'll just have to go back again!  The grab and go dinners look great and are a great option for a home cooked meal when you don't have time.  You can tell Jessie and Adam have passion for great flavors and quality ingredients....

"After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, my friend and I waited in line for almost an hour before we were seated at Grimaldi's on a Sunday afternoon. While waiting in line, I did notice that the take-out line and the dining line are now one and the same. This was clearly stated at the entrance of the restaurant. I have to say the thin-crust pizza remains one of my favorites in NYC. However, I was put off by the service charge that was inserted into our bill. A review on another website said that the ""service charge"" was inserted because the diners looked like ""foreigners"". The simple one-page menu did not state that a service charge would be levied for 2 people dining at the restaurant. Has anyone else have had service charge levied on their final bill? Because of the wait and the service charge inserted, I am giving this a 3-star.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Let me start off by saying- I have been coming to Jacobs pickles for months now (since I moved to the Upper West Side)- it has a warm atmosphere with ok food, and a nice beer selection.But after a few bad experiences, today has pushed me over the edge- to never return and tell my friends to do the same. Today we went to have brunch (Sunday) around 2:30pm, and was told there was a wait--- normal... But nearly 2 hours later we were staring at empty tables while a manager of some sort wined and dined his friends. (I assume he was a manager because he kept checking in with the host and severs).Once we  sat, we were ready to order: 2 breakfast sandwiches and proceeded to wait another half an hour until the food came.  It made for a long, unpleasant afternoon. I would like to say the servers & bartenders do a great job: all very helpful, polite people but at Jacobs Pickles there is a constant cycle of employees, unclean drinking glasses, raw meat served, and empty tables with a 2 hr wait!? As someone with serving experience- it seems to me that there are some serious management problems. Oh! And one time this fall- a manager proceeded to clean an overhead area fan WHILE I ate... Yum, I'll have the mac n' cheese with dust please! I wish them well with their business- they will no longer have mine.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Heard great things about Pepe's; ordered a specialty pizza for take out. The pizza was good nothing that spectacular. Im rating it a two because my initial impression was they were stuck up and rude. There is a sign on the door that says ""wait to be seated"" but there is no hostess there. Your expected to know to wait outside on the benches. They are very strict about take out orders as well. I ordered and then I could wait outside for 15 mins, but I just sat in my car. When I got home the pizza crust was burned all the way around, I mean blackened!!! I love crust, but not totally burned crust. They cook it in a wood burning stove so I expected the edges to be crispy. When I called the man who answered the phone was very polite and said he could make another pizza or me ""lightly cooked"" or put me on the list for another time. Then the manager got on and told me that was their signature and didn't want to give me another pizza because I didn't like their pizza. He was pretty rude and I will not be going back there especially with the 100 million other pizza joints in New Haven. There were five on the same street.","[0.0, 1.0]"

The rest of the food was just over sauces/sweet/salty take out Chinese food.   I would not try the Sushi... as the fish does not look good at all.   My favor was the soft ice cream.  hahaha  I had couple of them.  My b-f loved it too. The sweets choices just ok.  They were package sweets.  I did not try any so I can't tell if they are any good.   As for $13/person for lunch (we were told after we got the check that it was holiday so it's brunch instead of lunch), I would not go back.   If you have a large group and love cheap take out food (chinese and pizza), this is a place for you.  However, if you are looking for some good food, there are better choices. If you do love Chinese food, please try Qin Dynasty on 857 Hwy 46 E Parsippany.  It's the best Chinese food around this area.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I came here to try their chicken and waffles, which sounded amazing, considering I was a little hungover and starving! There were 2 of us and it was a 20min wait because they were obviously understaffed and left plenty of tables empty...but I still thought it'd be worth the wait. Our waiter, Luis, talked very fast and didn't listen very well, so the service was already somewhat disappointing. I finally got my food, and after a few bites, noticed something dark in my waffle...IT WAS A BIG BLACK SCREW!! I told Luis immediately, was extremely nice about the situation, and he brought his manager out who apologized and brought me a fresh new plate of food after my friend had already finished eating...and my appetite was already ruined... What really surprised us, was that they ended up charging us full price for our meals! I kind of regret not putting on a scene, maybe they would have been more accommodating...

"They have a good bread service and high quality olive oil. I remember 4 months ago I ordered a clam appetizer.  The dish came out in a nice hot Staub type of dish.  The flavor was good but looking closer at the dish with the candle light, i saw a lot of oil or grease or something.  It might have been the rendering of the chorizo or maybe the butter broke or maybe the wine didn't cook fully but it was the type of oil I didn't want to dip any bread in to finish.  I give that dish 2 stars I also remember eating a pasta.  I forgot what it was but I remember giving it 4.5. stars.  only one and a half heavenly bite size pieces of short rib were on the bowl so I took away 1 whole star. so it became 3.5.   Service was still a 5 considering it was the end of the night  he offered black pepper and parm.  He also continued to check up on me if I need anything.  but at the same level let me be to eat alone.  (930pm) I then went back a month ago.(end of feb. at 10pm)  I sat at the bar because I just worked a long shift, so i wanted no BS. give me food and drink and let me be.  I order the Amaro Cup.  He went maddddddddd cheap on the Fernet, even cheaper on the Compari or maybe i couldn't taste it because he just squeezed half a squeeze bottle of simple syrup into the bar shaker. i give that drink 3 stars.  The pasta I ordered came out delicious 4.5.  This time I hear the servers talking to each other about ""gotta take care of my dogs, leaving early, who is opening what tomorrow"".  whatevers I got off my barstool, went over and black peppered my own pasta dish.  Forget the parm, I'm already feeling salty with the service.  The bartender is doing the opposite of what he was supposed to be doing and instead of listening to my problems, he's telling me his problems and i guess that is supposed to excuse the crappy service.  he is telling me he worked 12 hours cause of brunch service.  I work 12 hours 5 days a week  standing, making sure food is consistent and up to the highest quality.  I don't need to hear you're BS.  (FOH gets tips and i still left a decent tip after what you showed me.)  I finish eating and then he asks ""you want another drink?"".  That night service was a 1 star.  It was as unpassionate as the counter girl I order my 6 dollar lomein from.  but cost 4 times as much.  At least she'll flick in two or three packets of hot sauce without me having to ask. Just because you know you are better than NY style eats doesn't mean you can slack off.  I'm begining to not like you VENTURO but why do I dream about your pasta dishes every month or so.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"The Italian sausage with provolone is easily the best sandwich in the city. Was a frequent customer when we lived there. My biggest complaint about moving to Pittsburgh was leaving DiNic's behind. I frequently travel to NYC for business, and my preferred travel route to fly to Philly, stop at DiNic's, then catch a train to NYC. A sandwich that can alter travel plans like that must be good. All of their sandwiches are terrific without, but the sausage is the top. The pulled pork Italian is second in my book.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"3.5 stars I think of this place as the neighborhood IHOP, but with cleaner interior and friendlier staff, as well as more affordable prices. My bf and I ordered two orders of #1 which is two eggs any style, 2 slices of toast, home fries and choice of meat (BACON of course) + I ordered a cup of coffee all for $15.17 before tip. The food was very standard. Easy, breakfast food. My eggs were cooked as they should be, I ordered them over easy and they were perfectly done so. The bacon was crispy, good. Coffee was good. But the hash browns, I have a suggestion of seasoning them a bit better. I didn't say anything, but my boyfriend brought up the same point. But it's alright, since there's salt and pepper at the table for us to season to our liking. Overall, a good neighborhood breakfast stop with extremely affordable prices and good portions. You can't compare this to Sabrinas, Green Eggs or anything like that. That's not what this is, or what they try to claim to be. They're just a simple diner, but they do it alright :)","[1.0, 0.0]"

They have the giant beer glasses and serve German food late into the night. Hard not to have fun while you're there because the atmosphere is just lively.

I apologize I can't go into too much detail as others, being robbed of my senses of smell and hearing to an awesome cold.  From what I could taste culminated with my friends' responses, some courses were an immediate hit, some challenged us to try something not in our color wheel, but all in all were pretty successful. In keeping with the casual/formal vibe, the staff were great, managing to be both personable and efficient so effortlessly.  Our server was so sympathetic to my congestion, he added the Maitake, Hazelnut, Preserved Lemon, Lemongrass Chicken Broth just for me!  Also, for a Saturday, the fact that Chef Nicholas delivered and introduced at least one course to every table and chatted and had photos snapped, yet still seem pretty unassuming and down to earth, is an admirable feat. You may want to put in a reservation now if you want to get a table in the spring.. I may just to try the rest of the menu... when I'm feeling better:)","[1.0, 0.0]"
"My friend and I were in the mood for bbq and mac & cheese. We've never been here before and wanted to try it. After experiencing it here, I am confident that we will never be returning. Here goes the rundown . . . we sit at the table and immediately our arms and hands are sticking to the table. We expressed our concern to the server but apparently it was due to the finish of the tables. If that is the case I would recommend a table cloth, just b/c the stickiness is kind of turn off for cleanliness standards. Then we started to order and unfortunately this BBQ place was out of brisket and short ribs, which was a huge let down! However, we got the bbq sliders that were actually really good. The meat here is cooked really well, however everything else was pretty terrible. The mac & cheese was like having a bowl of cereal with milk. The cornbread muffins were either stale or just really dry. If they did the corn bread as tray and cut squares as it was ordered it would stay fresh longer. The baked beans were pretty terrible as well. Also, after we received our food, we were waiting for plates. After two attempts at giving us dirty plates, we finally got clean ones. Since we were so disappointed with a lot of the food and the service here we tried to talk with our waitress and the manager about it, and gave them several opportunities to practice some good customer service. We were continuously looked at with a blank stare of what do you want us to do?!?! They at least took off 1 beer, thanks for saving us the $5, but they should of offered something more than that. The service was really horrible, and the upper management seemed just as clueless. I would recommend Percy Street or Kyber Pass Pub for some reliable BBQ.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"i hate lines, i hate waiting in lines and waiting in lines outside when my feet are cold...however i would gladly wait another hour in line in much colder weather for this pizza. day started with a walk over the brooklyn bridge which Ive never done even though ive lived in New York my whole life (yes, i know im sorry). it was a beautiful sunny day and the views from the bridge are breathtaking. we knew we were in the right place the minute we saw the line. Everyone was excitedly waiting  for their turn to try some of  arguably the best pizza in the city of great pizza. so we finally make it in  and the person who seats us says it will be 30 minutes for pizza so they can reheat the oven. But it didnt matter now, we were in . We decided to stay classic getting ust a regular plain fresh mozz pie and then we got another one half sausage and peperoni and half sundried tomato and roasted red pepper.  The roasted red pepper and sundried tomato slice was life changing..ive never had a pizza that tasted to fresh and had such a perfect balance of flavors. At pies starting at $14 its completely more than worth it financially and it definitely has a fun atmosphere full of people all excited to being part of the experience","[1.0, 0.0]"

If you can't find something to eat here, you are going to have to turn in your digestive system. You don't deserve it. The smells, the colors, it's completely overwhelming. I saw amazing prices on everything from fish to fruit to beautiful NY strips ($10.99/lb). If I wasn't hopping on a train for an hour back to NYC, I would've stocked up for sure.

"As my friends and I arrived at a hole-in-the-wall in a sketchy-looking area at night, I thought to myself, the food better be good if I'm gonna risk getting mugged and it was worth it. Food: I was told that they had great soup dumplings called Xiao Long Bao (shanghai style steamed pork buns).  When they mentioned soup dumplings, I thought it was a bunch of dumplings in a soup. When the food was dropped off, I realized that the soup was inside each dumpling! It was my first time having these and I was blown away. The meat was delicious and the soup provided even more flavor. Top each bite with ginger and soy sauce and it'll be an excellent meal Service: Mediocre. They just take orders and drop them off. They don't really check on you to see how you're doing and it takes forever to get a refill of water.","[1.0, 0.0]"

This was a third of one potato, if that.  Vegetables: Should have been twice the portion. I had my own soup as a starter.  Plus a beer. I had to fill up on their bread.  One shouldn't have to pay $22. for a dinner and fill up on bread.  Other than this it is a wonderful restaurant.  I hope the owner of the restaurant reads this and stops being so parsimonious with portion size.  Or, lower the price of the meal!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've never had chinese food that I had to throw out before I was satisfied. The food was so horrible. I ordered the Wontons in Szechuan sauce, Cold noodles in sesame sauce, spring rolls, and an egg roll. After the first bite of the Cold Noodles I knew this wasn't going to be good because you can judge the quality of chinese food by the quality of their noodles. It tastes like they were soaked in a pan that was recently cleaned but didn't get all the soap off the sides. Soapy noodles, not so delicious (on a side note they smelled like a locker room). Then I tried the szechuan wontons. They appeared to be fried, but when I picked it up it had the consistency of a steamed wonton. I assume they were once fried and then they had to be soaked in the sauce so long that they became soggy and pruned. Either way, I don't know what happened to these wontons, but I couldn't eat more than two before I put an end to that. My mom had the spring rolls, she took a bite of one and made a face. I took a bite, and it was so stale. They had to have not sold a spring roll in months, so that is what we got. We threw those out right away to avoid food poisoning. The only thing passable as chinese food was the egg roll, it wasn't good but it wasn't completely horrible when drenched in duck sauce. I've never had such bad chinese food, usually chinese food is fantastic or at LEAST edible. Please save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. If you want good chinese food in clifton go to the New China Wok on Market Street, it's not that far away from this dump.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"I've been to Memphis Taproom 3 times, so far. I think the food is great, the service is great (knowledgable staff), and the atmosphere rocks! I love visiting bars and restaurants where everyone seems to be in a great mood. Though it's loud, we'll say boisterous, it's welcoming and lively! The food is consistently great. I try something new each time. I remember the first time, I had the pork sandwich, expecting pork bbq, and it wasn't with bbq, but it was still delicious, and hot! I had the chicken fingers dinner with mac and cheese the second time - equally scrumptious. Then, yesterday, I was there for the no-repeat week (beers on tap). I had the Mams's Little Yellow Pill, I think. Very smooth, yet tasty, light-hearted beer. Started with the cheddar soup with a cider touch, and I haven't had soup that great this entire winter season! I fell in love with the battered dill pickles dipped in Horseradish sauce. Loved. Them. My brisket burger was not too big, as some gastropubs seem to do to me (I am small!!), but not too small, either. Just right. I almost cleaned my plate. Go here.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Tonkatsu is one of those dishes that carries over well to the American Palate.  Rarely have I met a non-Japanese who couldn't get behind this deep-fried pork dish, assuming they eat pork, of course. Lots of Japanese and mixed-Asian restaurants have tonkatsu.  But it's rare to have a tonkatsu so good, I can't complain about some aspect of it.  Great tonkatsu comes from both the ingredients and the preparation and all too often, in many restaurants, one or both are inferior.   Katsuahama's regular Tonkatsu is absolutely amazing, nice and thick, and juicy on the inside while have a nice, light crunchy outside, and the tonkatsu sauce is just perfect.  If you like the pork a little fatty, they can arrange that too. They also have another version of Tonkatsu, using kuro-buta, which literally translates to black pork, referring to Berkshire pork.  It's to pork what wagyu/kobe is to beef.  And...damn....it's good. Over the passed 10 years, I've gone to New York about a half dozen times and this restaurant is another on my list of must-do's.  This restaurant has satisfied in quality every time.   What is there to complain about?  Oh yes, one thing...whenever I leave, I know it'll be two years before I can go back....","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Good, but not great, and I hate having to say that because I was realllllllllly stoked about trying this place.  I'll definitely give it another shot, but no time soon.  Part of my beef with this kitschy little Louisiana loving gem were their prices.  Just a little (not a lot) too high for the size and quality of the portions.   We tried the trio side sampler and the Jambalaya.  They were all foods I've had many times before and am fairly experienced with, so I am confident of my opinion when I say that it's ""good food"" but not ""great"". For all of you gluten free eaters out there, there are very limited options for you here.  I initially called to inquire about this a week before eating there, and received a response that implied that about half their menu is gluten free. When the day came to actually try this place out, we were disappointed to hear from our server that we were misinformed by the employee on the phone.  There are some gluten free options, just not a lot. They had a nicely stocked bar, and the service was friendly and efficient.  No complaints there, what so ever.  They weren't very busy when we went, which was nice, too.   The one thing I have to make a note of is their bathroom with the pull chain toilet.  Apparently it's got some notoriety about it.  Also, the decor in general was brought in from LA (a lot of it at least.)  If you ask about it all, I'm sure they'd be happy to tell you the stories about the different items!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I love the VPB. I always order the pulled pork pie and sweet potato fries. I'm finding less and less items I can eat now that I've been relegated to the gluten free penalty box. I'm assuming the fries are off limits for me (but I've never asked actually. The issue would be the fryer and being fried with non-gluten-free items in case people are wondering.) I have had the pulled pork since my diagnosis, and haven't had any ill effects (though I have since found out I can't have vinegar either. Sometimes you just don't realize what you can and can't have when the diet is a new thing to you.) However, regardless of my restrictions, I love the food.I love the onion rings and the calamari. The only dish I've ever had there that I didn't like was the meatloaf, and that was because it had onions and some other veggie chunks. I personally like a smooth meatloaf.

"Went to Audrey Claire for restaurant week.  This restaurant is extremely small and the tables are VERY close together.  You are practically sitting WITH the table next to you. We each ordered a different first and second course so we could all try a variety of items.  In order from favorite to least; first course: seared haloumi, grilled tiger shrimp and bosc pear and gorgonzola flatbread. The haloumi fig compote could have been a dessert it was so sweet.  The arugula and sweet potato with the shrimp was delectable.  Everything about the flat bread was spot on.  For second courses we had the shallot crusted lemon sole, pappardelle w/portobello mushrooms, potato crusted ahi tuna. Both of the fish dishes were cooked extremely well.  the pasta with mushrooms had a wonderful earthy flavor and was a rather large portion for restaurant week.  the dessert was a sampler of three different items.  the bread pudding was ok, the chocolate was delicious as always, and the third (I have no idea what it was) but it was amazing! Our server was pretty on top of things, except they brought our second course out before our first course had been entirely cleared from the table.  That was annoying, since everything we had was pretty large portions, it would have been nice to have a 10-15 minute break in-between.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"This place has over 2400 reviews so I'm going to give you advice rather than rant about food: Educate yourself before coming here! Look at the menu ahead of time so you know what to order immediately as you sit down! If you want to come after 11:30am when they start serving lunch things, plan for the over-2-hour wait! It's cash only, so make sure you bring some! That is the biggest advice you won't find in the other reviews. Don't be a F**king idiot and show up after 8:40/8:45am and get pissed you have to wait 1-2.5 hours for a table. If you took the time to decide ""Hey, I'm gonna go to Clinton St. for brunch during the weekend, when it's the most busiest time, and I know everyone else is going to do the same thing! Good idea!"" WITHOUT READING ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE, then you deserve your long-ass wait. This place is SUPER SMALL, so seating is very limited.

My GF and I got in line right before 8:45 and were the last cut-off for the first seating (maybe 20 people in front of us). I can't tell you how many people would come like at 9:45 or later, be told the wait was around or over 2 hours, then get pissed and say ignorant shit like ""wow you serious? fuck that. what kind of place is this? fuck this!"" in full earshot of everyone dining and the staff. Way to start your morning while ruining other people's breakfast, jackhole. --- Food review: The pancakes were truly delicious. Maybe not worth all the crazy hype, but they were pretty damn good. The french toast was also amazing. I really wanted to get the chicken and waffles, but we were there too early. Do yourself a favor and get the cheese grits, very good and can easily be saved and taken with you if you're too full.

"Jane has been on my bookmark for a while. I'm just not keen on trekking to the area for food but boy was it worth it on a holiday evening. The prix fixe menu had some appetizing options for a very decent price. I enjoyed their fried oysters and toasted gnocchi for starters, the braised short rib as an entree and an espresso with my chocolate cake. The appetizers were decadent, rich and raised the bar for the entree. The oysters were light and crispy, and my only gripe with it was that the grilled sour dough ficelle could of been a little crisper to support the remoulade and toppings. Not much can be said about the ricotta gnocchi except that it's practically a signature item and shouldn't be passed off unless you're allergic to dairy. The short rib was perfectly seasoned and tender but the farro beneath it was more than a touch too salty. The chocolate mousse cake was beautifully presented and equally delicious. It was perhaps the best executed part of the meal. Espresso was sooty and left much to be desired. I also will not comment on the mishaps in service, but at the very least, our waters were filled.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"The front staff are little too fake friendly.  Sorry if you don' t mean to be.  But it comes off very fake :-( the bar tender was very nice and i think pretty talented.  I LOVED my lime basil daiquiri. i had 2! i never have more than 1 cocktail...ever! i'd go here just to drink this over and over. we had the crab with aioli sauce.  delicious! then cod which also was excellent.  i loved the eggs with crispy oysters...my sister didn't eat any of it because for her the eggs were too 'liquidy' and she doesn't like oysters.  too bad for her.  but i ate too much trying to finish the whole thing myself.  eventhough we weren't hungry, we needed to try the dessert.  the lemond bundt cake was a perfect small portion to share.  and really lovely as an end to the meal.  YUM! overall, it was an excellent meal. i will have to come back for dinner one day.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"After a night of drinking, and waking up feelin' it, my friend suggested this place. I'd been interested in trying Cafe Lift for quite some time, and was ready to eat just about anything, so I happily agreed. We arrived only 15 minutes after they opened and were seated promptly. The place did fill up quick after that. I had the plum tomato, asparagus, and mozzarella frittata-delicious! Their side of potatoes are also pretty tasty. The waitress was great; after the night we had all we wanted was good breakfast food and fast, and she accommodated. I would absolutely come back! Cash only!","[1.0, 0.0]"

Tried this little greek restaurant this weekend. I should have saved my money. They were so expensive i couldnt believe it. This male owner was really cool. But the woman really needs to find a mop. There were kids running around throwing up on the floor. I love children so i had to clean it! The service was extremely slow. All silverware was plastic. All cups were solo cups. And paper plates!

"Showing up early at this no-reservations establishment proved just the ticket to an atmospheric and relaxing Valentine's Day dinner. When we walked into Five Leaves, we felt like we'd stepped into a local joint in an earlier era, and when a couple of guys sauntered in wearing fedoras with dates on their arms, that only reinforced the decade-out-of-joint feeling.  The decor is lovely, from the Edison bulbs and the zinc-covered bar to Louis Armstrong playing on the record player most of the time we were there. Service was prompt and the truffle fries were as delicious as others have described them here (they're like crack; we were instant addicts), as was my tenderly cooked hangar steak and the creamy mashed potatoes, which accompanied it. Satchmo handed the torch to Billie Holiday just as we headed out the door and into a chilly Brooklyn night.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Unfortunately, growing up with ""good"" Chinese food, I have been spoiled for choice. The lure of the shop front sign stating 2 x lobsters for $20 was exciting, so we thought we'd try the place out (despite some uncomplimentary online reviews). It sadly went down hill from here: Rude staff, cold duck in the duck and wonton soup, mixed seafood doused in any oily sauce - and no lobsters available (yet, they left the signs up and didn't advise us when we asked about them walking in). If you're not too fussy and like a quick/cheap meal, then this place ""may"" be worth a visit, but if you like your Chinese cuisine I'd recommend against the effort.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Finally, a Stephen Starr restaraunt where the decor doesn't overshadow the food! It's actually pretty quaint and simple, really. It's reminiscent of an authentic Parisian brasserie (allegedly, as I've never actually been to Paris). The food was outstanding. I had the branzino with fingerling potatoes and fennel salad. The branzino was crisp, tender and tasty, and the fennel salad was a great complement to that. And most surprisingly: it's affordable. You would expect a place like this to be outrageous, but it's really not. I would say this is probably one of the top 5 restaraunt meals I had in year 2008.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"This was the very first Greek eatery we found out about thanks to our uncle nino.This place is the king of Greek food in Astoria, just by the crowds every day.The pain in the butt nunu has been here many times with his uncle nino .When we make the trip waiting is part of life. Always a line outside.We order the Greek salad to start very good . My group orders seafood like whiting,barbounia,grilled octopus which they love.For me I always order a chicken dish with a side of rice and fries,yummy.The lemon potatoes are good.You get free dessert at the end which is OK but there is no dessert menu.My only real problem here is that the place is small and you are very close to everyone noI elbow room but otherwise its fine.When porcelli comes back to town I will bring him here.Also VIncente  loves this place he eats like he is in a marathon what a clown. .So folks if you like good Greek food make the trip, you won't regret it. I decided since trying other places, this place is good but not the best. On 23 rd ave you can find some  just as good if not better places to eat at.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Whoa this place is awesome!  That BBQ brisket is so good and if you haven't been able to check this spot out, book mark it now and go there asap.  This has been on my yelp bookmark for a solid 6 months but am happy I finally was in the neighborhood when I was hungry.  I came here with some friends and we all tried something different and everything was delicious.  The baked beans were really good as a side and is a perfect compliment to your meal and the other sides it comes with. This is a wait in line, pay at the counter kind of a place which is great for a casual dining experience.  A individual meal and a beer costs 17 dollars but obviously my 5 stars says it's worth it.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Hideki is absolutely right.  Compared to Metro Cafe who charges $7.49, Commerce Food Court definitely outshines them in terms of quality AND price. Once in a while they have pepper Beef Ribs.  Beef Ribs!!!  I swore I busted a gut that afternoon, but definitely food coma for sure.  Their cold side is also pretty good - lots of salad/ fruit/ seafood selections. One thing though is to keep in mind this is a buffet and like all buffets, it's best to go early, like 12 for the primo/ freshly cooked stuff.  I wouldn't come here after 1:30pm.  Also stay away from the Cheesesteak guy between the cashiers- waaay too greasy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"I recently had one of the best birthday dinners I can remember at Butcher Bar. Having recently enjoyed several delicious meals there in the past couple months, I thought it would be fun to bring along some friends for my 25th birthday. (Everyone I know lives in Brooklyn, and they refuse to believe that there are decent places to eat in Queens.) I was concerned about bringing a large group to a relatively small space, but the folks at Butcher Bar were incredibly accommodating; they set aside a nice large table for us, brought over lots of free appetizers, and even gave me a slice of apple pie with a birthday candle for dessert. Everyone in my group had a wonderful (and delicious!) evening. Part of the reason I like this place so much is the high quality of the meat. My girlfriend and I are massive carnivores, but we always had trouble finding sustainably raised, locally sourced, grass-fed meat in western Queens. Not only is Butcher Bar's meat responsibly raised, but they're extremely knowledgeable on the subject, able to answer all the annoying questions we had about the food's provenance. Everything is also very affordable, and deliciously prepared--I don't know what they put in that rib sauce, but it's definitely got me hooked. The whole place has a really nice atmosphere, comfortable and trendy without being too self-consicously hip. The wait staff are really friendly and very prompt, even on crowded evenings. And the management is interested in making sure you have a great time, generally accommodating whatever special requests you might have. In my humble opinion, Butcher Bar is a unique and wonderful new addition to the Astoria foodie scene. I hope they stick around!","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Although I'm not big on celebrating Valentine's Day, my girlfriend insisted on taking me out for dinner that night. After a brief stroll on Bloomfield Avenue in Montclair, we chose Tuptim Thai since it wasn't crowded. The place is clean, but some of the décor leaned on the tacky side. Some of the bulbs of their track lighting aimed too low, so depending on where you sat, you might have that interrogation light right in your face! I was one of those lucky people, but they were cool about us switching seats. Their prices leaned on the higher side of Thai, but that's expected for this block. My GF ordered the Pad Kee Mao, while I ordered one of their specials: Just Noodle. I am a huge Noodle Whore! This ""Just Noodle"" dish included three of their featured noodle dishes: Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Pad Kee Mao, and this other rice noodle cooked in garlic sauce topped with chicken. I was super excited about this carb-ful order, but it wasn't all that great. The presentation was fine and I love having three noodle dishes on one plate, but if I were to review each item individually, I have to say they were all mediocre and somewhat bland. The service was good and their staff was awesome. The food just doesn't suit my taste.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"I think all the negative reviews of this place are misleading. This is an honest nyc dive-ish bar in an area of town that is dominated by overpriced tourist traps and pretentious establishments catering to the after work wall street crowd. Anyone expecting a fine dining establishment is a fool. It is obvious from the second you walk in that this is a cheap bar, with cheap bar food... That being said, our experience was great. The place was empty, and the bartender was more than attentive, picking up a couple rounds throughout the night. We had n enjoyable and relaxing evening and would encourage anyone looking to escape the high prices and congestion of the seaport to check this place out. Not a great place to go for dinner, but great spot for drinks with friends.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I wanted to like this place, I really did. I read all the reviews and it sounded great, so maybe expectations were high, but I don't think I'll go back. our first issue was not being served immediately, even though there were people who came after we did who gave their orders before we even got menus.  We had to flag a waitress to finally get a menu. But that isn't the reason for the low rating, as you never know what staffing is like on a particular day, and our waitress was lovely once we got her attention.  It was the lackluster food.   I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was almost inedible. It consisted of watery, unseasoned and crumbly scambled eggs with some token veggies in a fairly dry tortilla., and a smattering of cheese somewhere, but very bland. The only seasoning consisted of side sauces, and I have to say there was a chipotle sauce that was delicious and nicely spicy, but they should have integrated spices  or even a little salt or pepper or herbs into the base product.  If you douse the crumbly mess with the sauce, it's a little tasty, but just not integrated.   Call me old fashioned, but food should be seasoned properly and not require heavy dousing with condiments to make it edible. I only ate about a third of it that was it. My friend ordered the one thing that might be a specialty, the lemon ricotta pancakes. I shared bites of that, and it was indeed nice, if not as awesome as reviews would lead you to believe. If I were to go again, I'd order that and skip any kind of egg dish. The other issue is the comfort factor. Yes, the industrial thing looks nice but the small, hard metal chairs that squeek on the floor were simply uncomfortable.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Tried the Tip Top for the first time and will definitely go back again.  The menu is small and unique, but has something for everyone, including a variety of vegetarian entrees.  The meats, produce and dairy are all from local farms and the seafood comes straight from the Mass. coast.  The waitstaff is friendly, helpful and attentive.  The fries with garlic aioli and seared tuna appetizers were both excellent as were the salmon, seared scallop special and flat iron steak entrees. The cinnamon bread pudding was excellent, but the chocolate truffle cake and almond pear tart were disappointing. Would recommend reservations for a Friday or Saturday evening.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"Even though this place is not brickoven (womp womp but healthier I guess), it is really good pizza. Please note, that if you go during dinner time (6:00-8:00), there will be a wait.  They do not take reservations and it is first come, first serve.  The wait usually isn't too bad as the place is huge inside.  If you are coming with 2-4 people, you should be seated 20-40 minutes after you get there.  You can always to go one of the neighboring bars and get a drink. You have to order pizzas by the pie.  I usually get mushrooms and sausage on mine and opt for the smallest pie there is (because I usually go with one other person and it's a lot of food).  The pizza comes out relatively quick and it is key to eat the pizza hot (or wait until the next day for cold pizza; never eat lukewarm pizza - what's the matter with you).   I'm looking at the pictures and I don't know why anything would get anything else at Lombardi's besides the pizza but some of the things do look appetizing.  Maybe I will give it a go next time I go back.   Happy eating, suckers.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"One Word: CHOPPED! Just got back from our first meal at Amanda Freitag's new digs and were extremely disappointed. While the space looks great, the cocktails were unmemorable as were our starters: The Loaded Baked Potatoes were odd and tasted no better than a diner breakfast side dish. The Charred Octopus Greek Salad was actually quite delicious and I'd recommend it, however, our entrees were for the most part tasteless: The Lemon Chicken (a very small portion considering the price) was served with a soupy ricotta something or other aside two overcooked carrots.  The crispy chicken skin was very good, but to be honest, I've had better chicken at Boston Market. We sent back the Oyster Pan Roast, a sandy, flavorless pool of liquid resembling something our dog expelled last week, which was quickly replaced by the Patty Melt (greasy & flavorless), served alongside with what appeared to be oily Terra Chips, all of which had less flavor than a Denny's order. The service was very friendly (especially the hostess & waiter) and we loved the atmosphere and vibe. As we left the restaurant, my husband, who has a flair for the dramatic, exclaimed how he never wants to eat again and is now in the bathroom relieving himself of the meal. As longtime neighbors of The Empire Diner and fans of Miss Frietag, we so wanted this to be a good place and hope that it improves, but don't see ourselves returning anytime soon :-(","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I came to this restaurant for a rehearsal dinner, looking forward to it. I know of the owners & they've been running a successful pizza parlor for years. First off, I love the paintings in this place. After that, I'm turned off - it's dark, drab, and depressing. Also, I know it's the old Standish house & it's supposed to be old-fashioned, but the room we were in (on the 2nd floor) was so uneven that we all tripped several times over the evening. Not good when women are in heels & people are tipsy. We noticed the groom-to-be missing for the first 20 minutes of the dinner. He had booked the room for the whole evening but, upon arrival, was told ""By the way, not to rush you or anything, but we booked another party for 10:00 and the band is coming to set up at 9:30."" Which gave us 90 minutes. The antipasto was already set up at a stationary table - hummus & pita wedges, grilled vegetables. The wait staff was slow in getting drinks, the bride's aunt waited over 15 minutes for a glass of wine. There were three pasta stations set up: pasta with chicken, pasta with shrimp, pasta with vegetable. There was also a large chopped Greek salad. The salad was incredible! I should've eaten my weight in salad, it was that good. The pasta with shrimp was overly fishy and left an unpleasant tangy aftertaste in my mouth. Other members of the bridal party raved about the pasta with chicken; there was very little of that dish leftover, but an awful lot of the other two. Dessert was Tiramisu in little espresso cups. Delicious! It was the perfect size & was very rich. Now, I understand that I had a limited menu to work with, so maybe my review seems unfair, but honestly this place didn't win me over with what we were working with. Maybe if I get a craving for Tiramisu I'll come on back, but otherwise I'm staying out of Old Wethersfield.","[1.0, 0.0]"

You don't have to even ask me twice if I want Dinosaur BBQ because the answer will be yes! Ive always loved Dino BBQ. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. Only this time I noticed that the food was not as on point as it used to be. Some things were a hit and some things were a miss. The chicken wings are amazing!!! The deviled eggs and the ribs were good as well but I was not too crazy about my main course. I ordered 2 pork sliders with a side of mac n' cheese and the Harlem potato salad. I really hate to say that I was disappointed because I really do like this place but its the truth. The pork was pretty bland the mac n' cheese was not very cheesy and the potato salad was not good either. Im not quiet sure where things went wrong here but the food has decreased in flavor.

"My friends and I decided to go here last week.  They had been, I had not. I want to start off by saying the burger itself was delicious.  I had the bacon cheeseburger and I enjoyed the beef  The bacon was nothing special. The meat is where the good begins and ends.   The good; listed above the quality of the fresh ground beef. The bad: every thing else. Specifically; The waitress ""Aura"" I think. talked and talked and TALKED about herself actually telling us how beautiful she was(not in a cute or ironic way) and how wonderful her accent was, I could barely understand her.  She talked about her bills, her life, her travel her need to buy things she really couldn't stop herself......I really don't want to hear vapid self interest when I'm looking to EAT.   Also I feel uncomfortable telling a server to please move along and let me order / give me a moment to read the menu as they are handling my food out of my sight. When I'm hungry I don't want to hear my server talk for 15 minutes.  It was a constant pushing and prodding up sell of beers, apps, desserts throughout the ordeal.  I don't recall ever feeling so badgered and at their prices, you need to have some kind of customer service or decency.  I know this is the poor woman's job, but I really felt under attack and nervous.  I just wanted a hamburger. Our appetizer was subpar and partially burnt, for 9 bucks that's not acceptable. I had to ask 3 times for a glass of water (beer pads the bill)  Should I have to ask for water? Is this a per diem it now? She did manage to come by and ask me twice if I wanted another beer when ours wasn't half empty yet. I noted how the food took a while to get to us to, it wasn't hot, ill assume another attempt to get us to order another alcoholic beverage as they weren't busy. This place is not worth the misery they put you through for fresh meat. Bottom line, quality ground beef, but you have to jump through hurdles to get to it.   If I ever go to this conveyor belt of a place again it will only be for take-out. It might have been an enjoyable meal if not for the utter lack of customer service. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Beware.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"Now, I might regret writing this review because one of the great things about Grand Apizza is that you can usually walk right in and get a table or if you order over the phone, it is never that long a wait, so maybe it is foolish to let people in my neck of the woods--Fair Haven--know how good it is.  But really, folks, this pizza is terrific; it has great crust and sauce, for one thing, and a wide variety of toppings from the traditional to the more modern variations, like Pesto Shrimp.   As a native of New Haven, I really know my pizza, and what many don't realize is that some of the very best of it is found  not in the big three--Sally's, Pepe's, and Modern--but in the neighborhood joints; in fact, anyone who remembers  places like the old Venice on Dixwell  or Dino's on Whalley knows what I am talking about. Since I first tried Grand Apizza about twelve years ago, I have not set foot  on Wooster street; I mean, seriously, why wait in line for an hour plus when you can get delicious neighborhood pizza without a long wait?

"Decided to stop by this quaint, little French restaurant after shopping in SoHo. The wine list boasted a fair selection of French wines, and as other commenters have noted, there is a French person who works there. However, this isn't exactly what I am looking for when craving French cuisine. This isn't to say that the food wasn't good. They describe themselves as American fare with a French influence, and I would say this is accurate. I was only looking for a little snack and to pass a little time, so this fit the bill. I had the avocado crevettes, which is a whole avocado, halved, filled with diced shrimp tossed in a cognac tarragon sauce. I was left wanting a little more from the sauce. Texture could be improved or served with hard bread or crackers, as the shrimp/avo combo is a little mushy. I also had the asparagus salad. I like egg on salads, but it was overloaded with cheese and was practically what was served as a side with the avocado. I wish I had been better informed ab this. If I come back, I'll def be doing brunch. Oh yea, the little baguettes that are served with the meal are awkward and hard to eat. Too bad bc the dough seems good.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Food is great, drinks are made well and the service is always good...but only check this place out for Happy Hour or an early dinner.  They close earlier than any other bar I've ever been to and you may end up being the only one there if you stay past 9:30.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I called a few weeks ago to reserve space in the back room for my bfs bday on Sat 11/22. The owner was GREAT and booked space for me and 15-20 people - only needed my name, no ridiculous guaranteed # of people or cost which is so rare and appreciated in NYC. We had one whole side reserved with enough seats for everyone - the space has great character and a great selection of beers. My only complaint is when we arrived, it was clear the back room was extremely warm and stifling. Over the course of the night I talked to two waitresses and a bartender all of whom said they'd put on the air. We continued to sweat until after 12. I'm disappointed in the (lack of) response, while Id love to have another party here I don't think I'll come back.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Went for the Happy Hour $4 wines. I arrived at 6 and the place was empty. As in there were 4 people there aside from myself. Which is great in that I was able to easily snag a table for my group. But bad if you're into people watching or trying to meet new people. I ordered a white wine I'd never tried before-and it was really good. I actually stuck with it the entire night. More people arrived after Happy Hour ended at 7. My group ordered the artichoke dip ($6) which was tasty, though I didn't taste the artichoke so much as I tasted garlic, and then we all ordered sandwiches. I got the chicken one ($12) which came with a small salad. It was good. Nothing spectacular. I didn't give it 5 stars bc it was kind of dead (as previously mentioned) and I enjoy people watching. Additionally, it would be nice if they had Happy Hour deals on the food/apps. And while the wine was good (and prob worthy of a 5 star rating) the food was just average. Also, they have a $15 minimum for credit cards with a maximum of 2 credit cards per table. So if you go with a group, be prepared for that.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"Amazing pizza, probably as good as any of the big names in the New Haven area. I had a white pizza, forgot the name, but it had gorgonzola, garlic, mushrooms, and bacon. Absolutely perfect from the crust to the cheese to the toppings. So good. The delivery was slow, and the guy didn't have a GPS, which led to some confusion - but it was worth the wait (and thankfully, the pizza was still hot). Try it, you won't be disappointed.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"For a Connecticut deli, it is the best around. I have had sandwiches at Carnegie Deli, Katz Deli (NYC), as well as the other ""Deli's"" in Connecticut, e.g.. Reins and Reuben's. Overall this is the Rolls Royce of New York style deli restaurants anywhere in Connecticut. I have been going there since they opened in 1998 and the quality of the food is consistently great. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. They know my order as simply my ""usual."" The usual order for me is a matzoh ball soup where the ball is slightly firm yet not tough. The broth is well balanced with carrot and celery as the aromatics. The Corned Beef and Pastrami ""Sky High"" is aptly named. This sandwich can practically feed a third world country! Well not quite, however some may find this sandwich difficult to finish in one sitting since it is so overstuffed. Overall if you cannot make it to NYC, this is the place to go for lunch or a light dinner if you would like to nosh on NY style deli food.","[0.0, 1.0]"

Best fries I've had since the paranoid health Nazi's and weight bigots dictated that everyone should have fries in tasteless low-fat oils (the B**tards). I've not been in quite some time, wish they had a Syracuse branch, LOL. As for complaints about mayo, I guess some of you aren't aware that this is more or less a Belgan restaurant, and Belgians (and the Dutch and others in Europe) mainly have their fries with mayo (Or if British, with vinegar & salt). Ketchup is purely an American thing when it comes to fries.","[0.0, 1.0]"
"A very nice restaurant with a good menu, solid service and beautiful atmosphere.  There are a lot of ""fill in the blank -ville"" inns in Bucks county but this one is very different from some of the others I've been in.  For starters, the dress code is a bit more formal.  Most women were in skirts or nice slacks, many of the men were in collared shirts or jackets.   The menu, too, stands out for more inventive flair than your average inn.  There were some creative appetizer choices that we narrowed down to two: pierogies and piave cheese frico (a fried cheese).  They were both delicious.  Between the four of us, we had the tilapia, salmon, pork paprikash, and flatiron steak.  All of us felt our meals were perfectly cooked and well seasoned, though the chef was a BIT heavy on the garlic on ALL of our dishes.  This is coming from someone who loves garlic, so I'm not being overly sensitive.   Minor negatives: Dessert, sadly, did not live up to the inventiveness of the main menu.  It was basically your standard ""chocolate cake, fruit pie, ice cream/sorbet"" choices. Also, since the inn is rather small with low ceilings it was INCREDIBLY loud. Other major positives: The wine and beer lists were good.  The coffee was nice and strong.   The service was top notch.  Our waiter could not have been more friendly and attentive. Overall, a very nice evening and I look forward to dining here again.","[1.0, 0.0]"

"we were impressed by the valet parking and the ambiance. But soon we realized that it was going to be a disaster when there were only two vegetarian dishes in the menu.

The appetizers were cold and soggy. They served the vegetarian dishes first and forgot to bring the naan. When the manager asked us how was everything, we told him it was bad and he did not even apologize, let alone offer to make up for the lousy service. He said, next experience will be better.

"So I came here on a tuesday night around 7:20pm and expected to wait about 1/2 hour wait or so. So there was quite a few people there waiting on the steps, sidewalks, etc. About 50 mins later, my gf went inside to go to the bathroom. When she came out, she noticed my name was crossed out and several people listed under me were crossed out also. My name was not even called out. Either they just crossed out my name or someone standing near the doors just used my name since I was standing outside by the stairs. My gf enjoyed her Totto miso ramen.

"I cannot imagine any better BBQ in NY than Hometown.  In fact, I live in the south (Carolina, to be exact) and I can't claim with a straight face that I've ever had any better anywhere down here!  The baby-back ribs were award winning and the brisket tasted like filet mignon... and I used to think my mom made the best cornbread!  Collard greens?  R U kidding me?  In Brooklyn!  No, I kid you not and they were outstanding.  Though the beans were not exactly like anything I'd previously tasted in the south, they were tasty in a 'yankee' kind of way.  And the mac'n cheese wasn't as good as mom's (nobody's could ever be) and I can see how some would be mildly disappointed, but everything else more than made of for that slight imperfection.  As you can see, still five stars from this ol, redneck.  I felt right at home with the atmosphere and the staff.  I can't wait for a return trip, sooner than later.","[0.0, 1.0]"

"It's a chain steakhouse. So if you're from the west or Texas or something you're going to hate it. That's just how it is, it's the same reason I hate Olive Garden. So, if you're not from a state made of steak, then you'll like this place just fine. It's got all kinds of food that are designed to fill you up and make you feel, I was going to say something like sin, but it's just gluttony really, so they've got that one covered. Sloth, as well, if you count having people waiting on you. Getting away from the sinning, Texas Roadhouse will start you off with free, unlimited rolls and cinnamon butter. You'll want to eat them all, ask for more, and then eat those as well. This is a trick, you shouldn't do this, unless you want to feel sick later. Not the gross kind of sick, but the kind of sick you feel after you've done something shameful. Wait, we're back to sin, aren't we? Hmmm. We usually get the thing that's not called a blooming onion, because that's totally copy-written by someone else. It's a battered, fried onion, with what I can only assume is fried dipping sauce (gotta get that extra grease in there somewhere!) You will also eat this until you're sick, because it's salt and fat, and your human brain still hasn't evolved away from primitive hominids far enough to not be constantly functioning under the assumption that food is scarce. Now your meal will arrive. Hopefully, you've gotten steak. If you haven't, then you've made a poor life choice, because you're at a goddamned steak house. You'll eat your steak, nearly rupture something internally then trudge back to your car ready to sit and digest for a while. Wait, don't forget dessert! They've also got pie!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"After visiting Ani Ramen, I've updated my NYC/North NJ ramen list as follows: 1) Menya Sandaime 2) Ippudo 3) Ani 4) late night at Takashi 5) Santouka 6) Totto* to be fair I only ordered a veggie one here- should probably go back. Ani Ramen is very good. They have a more expanded menu of apps and add-ins than some of the other places. We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and pork buns which were amply sized and tasty. To give a fair comparison to other ramen joints in the area, I ordered the Ani Ramen- pork broth, char siu, spinach, scallions, and the always fabulous Sun Noodles. The broth was flavorful and I appreciate the big hunk of spinach. Egg is well, eggs-tra but perfectly soft boiled. I guess I'm picky about my pork because it was kinda just boiled, but plentiful. I ate about 1/3 and our lovely friends who treated us also had the best hack- bringing Tupperware from home to take the rest. I respect that Ani doesn't condone taking home leftovers because they change over time, but also like that they look the other way when you bust a container out of your bag and dump your leftovers in it.","[1.0, 0.0]"

There's nothing wrong for customers wanting to know approximate how long they have to wait for the table and decide whether they want to wait or go somewhere else.   on top of that, I was still standing right there, even if a customer asked a stupid question, you don't say mean things or make fun of them to their face.  on top of that, the table who just gave you the bill, how long do you think they will stay there for? another hour?! come on... if the restaurant keeps that kind of waiter, they will loose lots of business.

Still no slaw. I asked if I could have chips instead. With eyes rolling back into her head in disgust at my expectations of some modicum of customer service, she sauntered away only to return 5 minutes later and tossed a bag of chips at me.

Its pretty spicy, but not too strong in terms of alcohol.  The raspberry mojito is another great option, also not too strong but very flavorful.

"I have tried many japanese restaurant before and this is the worst. I have made my reservation after reading good reviews about this restaurant. To my surprise it was quite a horrific experience and very expensive lesson learnt too. 1. Something is not quite right if the customers are all caucasian and not a single japanese patronizing. Always a tell tale sign when the locals are not even coming. 2. We ordered omakase. And omakase in japanese means the best and freshest for the day. Well, this was not the case. The first plate of sashimi we had tasted like something we buy from the supermarket that was left on display for many hours. To add to the insult, the fish was not even sliced properly by Japanese standard. I am horrified that this was even served. A remark to the waiter that the sashimi wasn't fresh was met by a puzzled look and walked away without an apology. This is quite unheard of in a Japanese culture. 3. Next was several plates of sushi. Sushi was served in 1 plate meaning its like communal dining. For USD $120 per person I would have expected a bit more personalized or individual serving. 4. The sushi with oysters, clams was fishy and uneatable. I almost felt sick and wasn't sure if I was going to throw up. I couldn't even swallow my sushi and had to spit it out. We left the rest untouch and try to ask the waiter if he would like to try it for himself. He just shag his shoulder and took our plates away. 5. There was a tiny piece of shell in my oyster sushi and I dismissed it. Then there was another in my uni sushi. This time I told the waiter and he said that it is salt. I am quite horrified with how a piece of salt is so hard, sharp and not melt in your mouth. 6. The rice that was used in the sushi was dry and felt like cheap Japanese rice. It does not even stick properly together. 7. End of 1 sashimi and 4 sushi later the waiter came and ask if we are still hungry and if we would like to add any other chargeable items. We were left perplexed. We are certainly far from full and still unsatisfied. There were no variation of food for the omakase, no basic miso soup served, no hot items, no desserts. So after having paid for so much we need to pay extra to fill our stomach? We decided to just leave and walked to grand central station for a more satisfying shake shack burger. I am warning all potential customers. Unless you got too much money to spent and don't know anything about Japanese food, you can attempt to try this restaurant. It's shocking how a Japanese run restaurant can turn out to be so bad. Japanese take pride in their food and almost every aspect of things that they do. For them to even dish out something like what I had tonight, they must have been blind, not japanese or totally cannot be bothered at all. Its the most horrific experience in new York or even my lifetime of eating Japanese food.","[0.0, 1.0]"
Great place for seafood lovers! You might have to wait for seating but that means good food! It worth. You can't miss their grilled octopus. That is a MUST!,"[0.0, 1.0]"
"on my most recent excursion, my dining companions and i were debating whether Bonnie's is the best or worst place to go on a date: worst because man that food is messy, but best because if the person is still interested in you after you've eaten such a messy meal then you know they're worth your time.  and, as i told my male friend, he doesn't want to date a girl who doesn't have a hearty appetite.  then i proceeded to eat half a dozen wings and polish off my burger with canadian bacon and cheddar cheese. beyond that, what can i say that hasn't been said already?  the burgers are great -- i wouldn't say it's the best burger i've ever had in my entire life, but it's really, really good and they're generous with the toppings -- and i do love their buffalo wings.  yes the seating is sparse but i'm usually seated immediately if i go after 7:30, and true to the park slope style, they actually have a good number of vegetarian options for those friends of yours who don't eat meat.  i suppose the service is a little... brisk... but somehow i still find the guys there to be friendly and pleasant.  they're just brooklyn, that's all.  and that's not a bad thing if you ask me.","[1.0, 0.0]"
Pretty excited to find a new favorite Thai restaurant now that I've moved to the west side. Service is great and menu is pretty yumz too. Duck soup is really well done. Thin sliced juicy morsels of duck over a wonderfully flavored soup with your choice of noodles. My only complaint is that the place is packed tight. You are literally sitting on top of another couple when eating.,"[1.0, 0.0]"
"Stopped here for lunch today! Our server was very friendly, patient, and offered me a sample of whatever I was curious about. I must say I was a little reluctant going in due to the strong smell that African cuisine usually gives off but it was amazing! I got a peanut soup with foo-foo (sp), rice and beans, fish stew, and noodles that had a boiled egg on the side. The flavors are pungent, they use a lot of fish and if you're not into anything too exotic you might want to start with the soups and ease your way in. The food is also very spicy which works for me!","[0.0, 1.0]"
"I was with a friend from work, and we thought that after work (1pm on a Friday... love me my Summer Fridays) we would grab lunch and watch a World Cup match.  We could have gone anywhere, but we decided to go to BXL East because they do flights of beer, and we thought that was awesome.   So, we quickly grab a spot at the bar and we look over their fairly extensive list of Belgian beers.  Impressive, but we have no idea what to get.  Luckily, the bartender was very helpful and suggested that if we do the beer flights, he'll choose the beer for us and in which order to drink them.  Frankly, I don't remember what he chose but we went from light to dark and each beer had it's own distinct taste and feature and it was a great way to sample a variety of beers in one afternoon.   And of course, we got lunch... everything looked good but i settled for the Croque Monsieur-- basically, a ham and cheese sandwich topped with a cheesy, creamy sauce and served with fries.  It was a good sandwich, but the fries were amazing.  I'd like to come back and try their mussels. Overall, it was a good place to grab lunch. And it's a good place for (wanna-be) beer connoisseurs.  This place knows its s**t when it comes to beer.  Not only do they clean each cup (again) immediately before pouring, but each beer on tap, at least, is served in its own distinct glass made for that specific beer.  Fancy shmancy.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"The guy behind the counter is clearly exercising his psychic powers because when I walked up he just stared at me, obviously, to see if I was a telepath as well.  I'm sure in his mind he had given me a warm welcome and asked me what I'd like to order.  Unfortunately, I'm not a telepath so this came off as rude which is probably so far from the truth.  After I placed my order for 5 cheese steaks, I watched a guy take meat WITH HIS UNGLOVED HANDS and drop it onto the griddle. At that point, certain of rhinovirus or some other pathogen, he scooped it up with a spatula as he held the roll with the other hand.  In his defense, the roll-hand wasn't the one he used for meat--just the one he used to rub his face.  The food didn't get me sick so I guess, that's where the one star really shines.  By the way, the place across the street--worse.","[1.0, 0.0]"
"WUT the WUT!? Is this place for real? Does it truly exist? Was it a figment of my imagination? Could it be the best sake bar in NYC? I'm thinking that answer is a ""hells yea"".. can I get an Amen!? I always wanted to go to Sakagura, I had heard it was the most authentic Japanese dining experience in the city... and for the first time in a while, the rumors were true. This spot is legit. From the makeshift Japanese village decor, to the 100s of bottles of sake lining the bar wall, and even to the basement location, this place reminds me of all those incredible random restaurants in Asia I've left behind. After dining on sushi across the street at Sushi Yasuda, my colleague and I figured the best way to end the night would be over a couple of bottles of sake at Sakagura. After placing our butts on the seats at the bar, we dove right in and went with some dry sake prepared in traditional Masu boxes. The sake was superb! Smooth, layered with flavors and with a hint of ginger on the nose. After a few more sips, we realized that side dishes were needed. We jumped into the deep end and ordered a traditional octopus in squid liver dish and the pork belly soup. The squid liver was an acquired taste, it was a very foie gras heavy flavor that lingered long after you finished eating it. Surprising, but delicious nonetheless. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and the accompanying broth was light and flavorful. The whole ensemble packed a punch and was visually appealing. Overall, this spot offers the best of the best in terms of traditional Japanese sake bars with a twist. The ambiance, the patrons, and the food are great. Good luck finding this spot, as it is hidden from the casual eye...but so worth it when you do!","[1.0, 0.0]"

"Came here a month ago for Chinese New Year with my sister's friends who were raving about the little pork dumplings aka shao long boa so I tagged along to see if they really were the best. It was relatively empty considering it was still early (5-6 pm) and the dinner rush didn't start yet. The waiter gave us about 5 mins to look over the extensive menu and kept rushing us to order by pacing back and fourth. It took a while for the food to come and when it did, they got one of my orders WRONG and instead of taking it back, they said ""this is what you ordered"". OK FINE I didn't make a big deal out of it....until they slapped the check on our table BEFORE we finished eating. Then the waiter came back 5 mins later and asked us if we were ready to pay. I didn't appreciate being rushed out of there before I finished my meal...it wasn't even busy and no one was waiting on a table so I don't know why the waiter rushed us out of there. I noticed that they let the caucasian tourists extend their stay and were just rude to asian customers. That being said, they're lucky I even left a tip...$4 t be exact (an unlucky number and gesture according to the Chinese) especially on Chinese New Year. NEVER going back","[0.0, 1.0]"
"This place is pretty decent: Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Though a bit pricey, the food is really tasty. I'd go back with a few people, but if you're in a big group, get prepared for a huge bill and a long wait for drinks. My return is conditional on one crucial fact, however---they need to have a functional bathroom. I'm pretty sure that's a violation of some nanny state health code, anyway.","[1.0, 0.0]"
When I don't feel like cooking and have a taste for pizza late night. Alpha delta is my go to pizza shop in new haven. I lovvvvvvvvvve there special pizza. It was a time or two when I almost gave up on them cause it seemed like there's two different cooks or something. Awhile ago when Id order my special pizza it didn't look nor taste right. But now I'm not sure if they have a new cook or what but I've been loving my pizza. Hopefully it stays that way!,"[0.0, 1.0]"
